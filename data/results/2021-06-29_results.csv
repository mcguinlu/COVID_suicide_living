"Meta-analytical evidence on mental disorder symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America","Objective. There is a lack of evidence related to the prevalence of mental disorder symptoms as well as their heterogeneities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America, a continent across the equators. The current study aims to provide meta-analytical evidence on mental disorder symptoms during COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers, general healthcare workers, the general population, and university students in Latin America. Methods. Bibliographical databases, such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Sciences, PsycINFO, and medRxiv, were systematically searched to identify pertinent studies up to Februry 6, 2021. Two coders performed the screening using predefined eligibility criteria. Studies were assigned quality scores using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The double data extraction method was used to minimize data entry errors. Results. A total of 33 studies with 101,772 participants in Latin America were identified. The pooled prevalence of anxiety, depression, distress, and insomnia was 32%, 27%, 32%, and 35%, respectively. There was a higher prevalence of mental health symptoms in South America compared to Central America (33% vs. 27%, p <0.001). The pooled prevalence of mental health symptoms in the general population, general healthcare workers, frontline healthcare workers, and students in Latin America was 33%, 31%, 37%, and 36%, respectively. Conclusion. The high yet heterogenous level of prevalence of mental disorder symptoms emphasizes the need for appropriate identification of psychological interventions in Latin America.","Stephen X.

"Long Term Health Consequences of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Patients from North India: A follow up study of upto 12 months","Purpose: Long COVID syndrome is now a real and pressing public health concern. We cannot reliably predict who will recover quickly or suffer with mild debilitating long COVID 19 symptoms or battle life threatening complications. In order to address some of these questions, we studied the presence of symptoms and various correlates in COVID 19 patients who were discharged from hospital, 3 months and up to 12 months after acute COVID 19 illness. Methods: This is an observational follow up study of RT PCR confirmed COVID 19 patients admitted at 3 hospitals in north India between April August 2020. Patients were interviewed telephonically using a questionnaire regarding the post COVID symptoms. The first tele calling was done in the month of September 2020, which corresponded to 4 to 16 weeks after disease onset. All those who reported presence of long COVID symptoms, were followed up with a second call, in the month of March 2021, corresponding to around 9 to 12 months after the onset of disease. Results: Of 990 patients who responded to the first call, 615 (62.2%) had mild illness, 227 (22.9%) had moderate and 148 (15.0%) had severe COVID 19 illness at the time of admission. Nearly 40% (399) of these 990 patients reported at least one symptom at that time. Of these 399 long COVID patients, 311 (almost 78%) responded to the second follow up. Nearly 8% reported ongoing symptomatic COVID, lasting 1 to 3 months and 32% patients having post COVID phase with symptoms lasting 3 to 12 months. Nearly 11% patients continued to have at least one symptom even at the time of the second interview (9 to 12 months after the disease onset). Overall, we observed Long COVID in almost 40% of our study group. Incidence of the symptoms in both the follow ups remained almost same across age groups, gender, severity of illness at admission and presence of comorbidity, with no significant association with any of them. Most common symptoms experienced in long COVID phase in our cohort were fatigue, myalgia, neuro psychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety, brain fog and sleep disorder, and breathlessness. Fatigue was found to be significantly more often reported in the elderly population and in those patients who had a severe COVID 19 illness at the time of admission. Persistence of breathlessness was also reported significantly more often in those who had severe disease at the onset. The overall median duration of long COVID symptoms was 16.9 weeks with inter quartile range of 12.4 to 35.6 weeks. The duration of symptom resolution was not associated with age, gender or comorbidity but was significantly associated with severity of illness at the time of admission (P=0.006). Conclusions: Long COVID is now being recognized as a new disease entity, which includes a constellation of symptoms. Long COVID was in almost 40% of our study group with no correlation to age, gender, comorbidities or to the disease severity. The duration of symptom resolution was significantly associated with severity of illness at the time of admission (P = 0.006). In our study, all patients reported minor symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, neuro psychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety, brain fog and sleep disorder and persistence of breathlessness. Severe organ damage was not reported by our subjects. This might be the longest post COVID follow up study on a sample of nearly 1000 cases from India.","Sandeep Budhiraja; mona Aggarwal; Rebecca Wig; Akansha Tyagi; R S Mishra; Monica Mahajan; Jay Kirtani; Rommel Roshan Tickoo; Arun Dewan; Ritesh Aggarwal; Prashant Saxena; Namrita Singh; Ashok Kumar; I M Chugh; Pankaj Aneja; Sanjay Dhall; Vandana Boobna; Vineet Arora; Sujeet Jha; Abhaya Indrayan; supriya bali","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.21.21258543","20210628","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15373,""
"Healthcare Worker Resilience During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Integrative Review","The purpose of this review was to examine resilience among healthcare workers during the coronavirus-disease-2019 pandemic. The coronavirus-disease-2019 pandemic has caused an unprecedented strain on healthcare workers internationally. Rising infection rates, inadequate personal protective equipment, and the lack of availability of hospital beds has resulted in further deterioration of the already-fragile mental health of healthcare workers (Firew et al., 2020). Resilient workers have lower rates of burnout, and improved patient outcomes (AACN, 2020). PubMed and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases were searched using the terms resilience, nurse, and COVID-19 to identify studies on resilience during the coronavirus-disease-2019 pandemic. Resilience scores among frontline healthcare workers worldwide during the coronavirus-disease-2019 pandemic in the studies reviewed were overall found to be in the moderate range. Data from the United States showed a decrease in nurse resilience, while participants from China had increased resilience compared to pre-pandemic levels. Building resilience in nurses and other healthcare workers can serve as a protective factor against negative outcomes related to the job, including burnout, anxiety, and depression, and can improve patient outcomes. Strategies for building resilience in healthcare workers are discussed.","Baskin, Bartlett","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13395","20210628","Burnout, Psychological; COVID-19; Health Personnel; Resilience, Psychological; Review [Publication Type]","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15374,""
"Management of Older Outpatients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The GeroCovid Ambulatory Study","The GeroCovid Study is a multi-setting, multinational, and multi-scope registry that includes the GeroCovid home and outpatients' care cohort. The present study aims to evaluate whether outpatient and home care services with remote monitoring and consultation could mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental and affective status, perceived well-being, and personal capabilities of outpatients and home care patients with cognitive disorders. Prospectively recorded patients in an electronic web registry provided by BlueCompanion Ltd. Up to October 31, 2020, the sample included 90 patients receiving regular care from the Center for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia in Catanzaro Lido, Italy. It was made of 52 ambulatory outpatients and 38 home care patients, mean age 83.3 Ã‚Â± 7.54 years. Participants underwent a multidimensional assessment at baseline (T0) and after 90 days (T1). For each patient, we administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive functions, the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental ADL (IADL) scales for functional capabilities, the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) for comorbidities and their impact on patients' health, the 5-items Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) for mood, and the Euro Quality of Life (EuroQoL) for perceived quality of life. Contacts with both ambulatory and home care patients were managed in person or via telephone, preferably through video calls (WhatsApp or FaceTime). Contacts with patients were kept at T0 through telephone. At T1, visits were made in person for over 95% out of the cases. The ADL, IADL, CIRS, GDS, MMSE, and EuroQoL changed slightly between T0 and T1. Most of the patients were clinically stable over time on the majority of the scales explored, but behavioral changes were found in 24.4% of patients and anxiety and insomnia in 17.7% of patients. Our study suggests that contacts through telephone and video consultations are likely associated with a health status preservation of the patients.","Gareri, Fumagalli, Malara, Mossello, Trevisan, Volpato, Coin, Calsolaro, Bellelli, Del Signore, Zia, Ranhoff, Incalzi","https://doi.org/10.1159/000516969","20210628","COVID-19; GeroCovid study; Home care patients; Older patients; Outpatients","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15375,""

"Help-seeking intentions in the US population during the COVID-19 pandemic: Examining the role of COVID-19 financial hardship, suicide risk, and stigma","The primary goal of this study was to increase understanding of help-seeking intentions in the U.S. population during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine influencing factors such as COVID-19 financial hardship, suicide risk, and stigma in order to contribute to effective theory-based help-seeking and suicide prevention campaigns. In a representative sample of U.S. adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5,010), this research tested whether COVID-19 financial hardship was associated with higher levels of depression and suicidal ideation (supported), and whether the reasoned action framework could usefully predict help-seeking intentions in this context (supported). The reasoned action framework explained 36% of the variance in help-seeking intentions in the U.S. population and identified injunctive norm (social support) as primary determinant of intention. Neither suicidal ideation, COVID-19 financial hardship, or self-stigma of seeking help influenced determinants of help-seeking. Future research should test injunctive norm as causal predictor of help-seeking in the U.S. population to usefully inform effective help-seeking campaigns, particularly among those who have experienced COVID-19 financial hardship. Additionally, effective dissemination strategies for help-seeking campaigns should be tested and identified, such as broader targeted approaches as well as intentional mis-targeting techniques.","Lueck","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114069","20210628","Depression; Health promotion; Reasoned Action Theory; Suicide prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15377,""
"Coping strategies adapted by Ghanaians during the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown: A population-based study","The COVID-19 pandemic and control measures adopted by countries globally can lead to stress and anxiety. Investigating the coping strategies to this unprecedented crisis is essential to guide mental health intervention and public health policy. This study examined how people are coping with the COVID-19 crisis in Ghana and identify factors influencing it. This study was part of a multinational online cross-sectional survey on Personal and Family Coping with COVID-19 in the Global South. The study population included adults, Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years and residents in Ghana. Respondents were recruited through different platforms, including social media and phone calls. The questionnaire was composed of different psychometrically validated instruments with coping as the outcome variable measured on the ordinal scale with 3 levels, namely, Not well or worse, Neutral, and Well or better. An ordinal logistic regression model using proportional odds assumption was then applied. A total of 811 responses were included in the analysis with 45.2% describing their coping level as well/better, 42.4% as neither worse nor better and 12.4% as worse/not well. Many respondents (46.9%) were between 25-34 years, 50.1% were males while 79.2% lived in urban Ghana. Having pre-existing conditions increased the chances of not coping well (aOR = 1.86, 95%CI: 1.15-3.01). Not being concerned about supporting the family financially (aOR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.06-2.68) or having the feeling that life is better during the pandemic (aOR = 2.37, 95%CI: 1.26-4.62) increased chances of coping well. Praying (aOR: 0.62, 95%CI: 0.43-0.90) or sleeping (aOR: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.34-0.89) more during the pandemic than before reduces coping. In Ghana, during the COVID-19 pandemic, financial security and optimism about the disease increase one's chances of coping well while having pre-existing medical conditions, praying and sleeping more during the pandemic than before reduces one's chances of coping well. These findings should be considered in planning mental health and public health intervention/policy.","Iddi, Obiri-Yeboah, Aboh, Quansah, Owusu, Enyan, Kodom, Nsabimana, Jansen, Ekumah, Boamah, Boateng, Doku, Armah","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253800","20210628","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15378,""
"College from home during COVID-19: A mixed-methods study of heterogeneous experiences","This mixed-method study examined the experiences of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic through surveys, experience sampling data collected over two academic quarters (Spring 2019 n1 = 253; Spring 2020 n2 = 147), and semi-structured interviews with 27 undergraduate students. There were no marked changes in mean levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, or loneliness between 2019 and 2020, or over the course of the Spring 2020 term. Students in both the 2019 and 2020 cohort who indicated psychosocial vulnerability at the initial assessment showed worse psychosocial functioning throughout the entire Spring term relative to other students. However, rates of distress increased faster in 2020 than in 2019 for these individuals. Across individuals, homogeneity of variance tests and multi-level models revealed significant heterogeneity, suggesting the need to examine not just means but the variations in individuals' experiences. Thematic analysis of interviews characterizes these varied experiences, describing the contexts for students' challenges and strategies. This analysis highlights the interweaving of psychosocial and academic distress: Challenges such as isolation from peers, lack of interactivity with instructors, and difficulty adjusting to family needs had both an emotional and academic toll. Strategies for adjusting to this new context included initiating remote study and hangout sessions with peers, as well as self-learning. In these and other strategies, students used technologies in different ways and for different purposes than they had previously. Supporting qualitative insight about adaptive responses were quantitative findings that students who used more problem-focused forms of coping reported fewer mental health symptoms over the course of the pandemic, even though they perceived their stress as more severe. These findings underline the need for interventions oriented towards problem-focused coping and suggest opportunities for peer role modeling.","Morris, Kuehn, Brown, Nurius, Zhang, Sefidgar, Xu, Riskin, Dey, Consolvo, Mankoff","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251580","20210628","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15379,""

"The Relationship between Neighborhood Deprivation and Perceived Changes for Pain-Related Experiences among US Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could disproportionately affect the health of vulnerable populations, including patients experiencing persistent health conditions (i.e., chronic pain), along with populations living within deprived, lower socioeconomic areas. The current cross-sectional study characterized relationships between neighborhood deprivation and perceived changes in pain-related experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (early-September to mid-October 2020) for adult patients (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°97) with nonspecific chronic low back pain. We collected self-report perceived experiences from participants enrolled in an ongoing pragmatic randomized trial across medical centers within the Salt Lake City, Utah and Baltimore, Maryland metropolitans. The Area Deprivation Index (composite of 17Ã¢â‚¬â€°U.S. Census deprivation metrics) reflected neighborhood deprivation based on participants' zip codes. Although those living in the neighborhoods with greater deprivation endorsed significantly poorer physical (pain severity, pain interference, physical functioning), mental (depression, anxiety), and social health during the pandemic, there were no significant differences for perceived changes in pain-related experiences (pain severity, pain interference, sleep quality) between levels of neighborhood deprivation since the onset of the pandemic. However, those in neighborhoods with greater deprivation endorsed disproportionately worse perceived changes in pain coping, social support, and mood since the pandemic. The current findings offer evidence that changes in pain coping during the pandemic may be disproportionately worse for those living in deprived areas. Considering poorer pain coping may contribute to long-term consequences, the current findings suggest the need for further attention and intervention to reduce the negative affect of the pandemic for such vulnerable populations.","Rassu, McFadden, Aaron, Wegener, Ephraim, Lane, Brennan, Minick, Fritz, Skolasky","https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnab179","20210628","COVID-19 pandemic; Chronic low back pain; Disparities; Neighborhood deprivation; Pain management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15382,""
"Distancing Measures in COVID-19 Pandemic: Loneliness, More than Physical Isolation, Affects Health Status and Psycho-Cognitive Wellbeing in Elderly Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","Since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020, many governments have been imposing confinement and physical distancing measures. No data exist on the effects of lockdowns on the health status of patients affected by chronic pathologies, specifically those with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Our study aims to establish variations across the psychological and cognitive profile of patients during the isolation period in Italy, in a cohort of patients affected by COPD, between February and May 2020. Forty patients with established COPD were comprehensively evaluated by geriatric multidimensional assessment before the spread of the epidemic in Italy, and submitted to a second evaluation during the subsequent lockdown. We assessed functional ability, basic and instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL and IADL), cognition and mood status. We compared the scores obtained at baseline against those obtained during the pandemic, and used mean differences for correlation with major clinical and functional indexes. The score differences from MMSE, ADL and IADL were statistically significant. Such differences were correlated to the presence of a caregiver and to the total number of family members living together. Remarkably, the loneliness dimension, more than the restrictions themselves, seemed to represent the major determinant of altered health status and depressed psycho-cognitive profile in our population. Also remarkably, we detected no correlation between the score variation and the respiratory function indexes of disease severity. The isolation measures adopted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have triggered the classic clinical string associated to geriatric isolation, which leads to a deterioration of cognitive functions, independence and frailty levels in a population affected by a chronic degenerative disease, such as COPD. If considered from a multidimensional geriatric point of view, the individual benefit of isolation measures could be small or non-existent.","Scarlata, Cardaci, Santangelo, Matarese, Cesari, Antonelli Incalzi","https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1941834","20210628","COPD; COVID-19; Physical distancing; SARS-CoV-2; elderly; frailty; psycho-cognitive wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15383,""
"Gender implications of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in the Spanish population: A validation study","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> The aim of this study was to determine the psychometric properties of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) for the general Spanish population. <b><i>Method:</i></b> A cross-sectional investigation was carried out in several stages. Participants (N = 699) between the ages of 18 and 73 (M = 27.79; SD = 12.68) completed both the FCV-19S and the Hospital, Anxiety, and Depression Scale (HADS). We performed descriptive, exploratory factorial (n = 349), confirmatory (n = 350), and scale reliability analyses. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The results confirmed the factor structure of the original scale as well as the scale's goodness-of-fit indices and good internal consistency (ÃŽÂ± = .91, Ãâ€° = .98). The correlations between the Spanish FCV-19S and the HADS support the scale's validity, especially for the subdimension of anxiety. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The Spanish version of the FCV-19S appears to be a valid measure for the assessment of fear in an adult population. The present study moves research forward by providing a confirmatory analysis of the gender variable's influence on the factor analysis. The FCV-19S-Spanish provides a valid brief measure to evaluate fear of being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results also revealed that fear was higher among women than among men, which is important as it suggests that more attention needs to be paid to assessing and treating women's fear. Assessing and treating fear represents an important step for the prevention of future mental health problems.

"Does the attribution of responsibilities modify the relationship between coping styles and mental health? A survey of Chinese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) and self-reported Posttraumatic Growth (PTG) in the general population. This study used linear regressions for analyses, based on an online survey conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown among 2441 Chinese adults in February 2020. The results showed negative coping and attributing responsibilities to individuals were associated with more PTSS, while both positive and negative coping, as well as attributing responsibilities to individuals were related to more PTG. Moreover, attribution of responsibilities modified the association between coping and PTSS, but not PTG. These findings shed light on mental health interventions in a pandemic context.","Fu, Huang, Hall, Shi, Shahid, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591053211025596","20210628","COVID-19; PTG; PTSS; attribution of responsibilities; coping styles","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15386,""
"The impact of social unrest and pandemic on mental health of young people in Hong Kong: The transdiagnostic role of event-based rumination","Co-occurring population-level events, such as social unrest and coronavirus disease 2019, are observed in many societies today. Few studies have explored their combined mental health effects on young people. While self-focused rumination has been suggested to be a key mechanism underlying depression, the role of event-based rumination in mediating the impact of population stressors has yet to be elucidated. Data were collected from 6988 young people in a large-scale community online survey in Hong Kong. The survey assessed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, direct exposure to social unrest-related traumatic events, coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-related events, personal stressful life events, event-based rumination and other individual risk factors. High levels of comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms were observed. Logistic regression analysis revealed that probable post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with traumatic events (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.73, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.64, 1.82]), pandemic-related events (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.08, confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.01, 1.16]), stressful life events (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.20, confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.21, 1.37]), high event-based rumination (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.00, confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[2.58, 3.48]), lower resilience (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.18, confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.15, 1.21]), higher smartphone reliance (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.09, confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.05, 1.13]) and financial concerns (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.25, confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.18, 1.33]). The odds for probable post-traumatic stress disorder was also significantly higher when two or more traumatic events were experienced (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.03, confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[3.52, 4.62]). Factors associated with moderate-to-severe level depressive symptoms were similar. Event-based rumination significantly mediated between different types of external events (traumatic events, pandemic-related events, stressful life events) and both post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that diverse types of stressful events during population-level crises could add to personal stressors to affect mental health outcomes in young people. Among other protective and risk factors, event-based rumination presented as a prominent transdiagnostic mediator for different symptom dimensions which may be a potentially important target for early risk detection and intervention.","Wong, Hui, Suen, Wong, Chan, Lee, Chang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211025710","20210628","Post-traumatic stress disorder; depression; rumination; social unrest; youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15387,""
"First Episode Psychosis during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Series","Neuropsychiatric events are often associated with viral pandemics. The unexpected turn of events the world over since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic may serve as stressors which can trigger or worsen mental disorders particularly psychosis. There is little or no reports about acute psychosis on the background of this current global pandemic particularly in the African context. The aim of this article describes a case series of acute schizophrenia-like disorder with COVID-19 related psychotic themes in the context of the current pandemic. We present a case series of 2 patients with first episode psychotic illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both patients presented at the mental health outpatient clinic of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Two patients with no previous history of mental illness presented with COVID-19 delusional themes and odd behaviours. Mental state examination revealed abnormalities in behaviour, thought system, perception and cognition. ICD10 diagnosis of Acute and Transient Psychotic disorder was made in both patients. There were no abnormal physical health findings and symptoms resolved with the use of antipsychotics. Information on the COVID-19 pandemic may influence the content of psychotic experiences among the general population. A high index of suspicion and acute services are important to ensure prompt intervention and promotion of community mental health. Clinicians need to be well informed to be able to identify what deviates from the norm, and to be able to provide prompt intervention.

"Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: Addictive social media use, depression, anxiety and stress in quarantine - an exploratory study in Germany and Lithuania","To slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments of many countries introduced various behavioral measures starting March 2020. The measures included domestic quarantine (not leaving home) for infected or potentially infected people. Due to the need for social distancing, online activity increased in spring 2020. This could foster the risk for addictive social media use (SMU). The present study investigated tendencies of addictive SMU and their relationship with depression, anxiety and stress symptoms specifically among individuals who stayed in domestic quarantine due to COVID-19 in Germany and Lithuania. In Germany (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 529; quarantine group: <i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 157, non-quarantine group: <i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 372) and in Lithuania (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 325; quarantine group: <i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 54, non-quarantine group: <i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 271), data were assessed via online surveys in spring 2020. In both countries, persons in quarantine had higher levels of addictive SMU, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms than individuals who were not in quarantine. The difference was significant only for addictive SMU in the German sample. The significant positive correlations between addictive SMU and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were stronger in both quarantine groups than in the non-quarantine groups. The mostly female, young and well-educated composition of both investigated samples limits generalizability of the current findings. Results reveal first evidence that the use of social media during domestic COVID-19 quarantine might contribute to the increase of addictive tendencies and negatively impact well-being. Alternative ways of daily routine during the quarantine are discussed.","Brailovskaia, Truskauskaite-Kuneviciene, Margraf, Kazlauskas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100182","20210628","Addictive social media use; COVID-19; Depression, Anxiety, Stress; Germany; Lithuania; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15391,""

"SARS-CoV-2 Host Receptor ACE2 Protein Expression Atlas in Human Gastrointestinal Tract","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects host cells through interactions with its receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), causing severe acute respiratory syndrome and death in a considerable proportion of people. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience digestive symptoms. However, the precise protein expression atlas of ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the ACE2 protein expression pattern and the underlying function of ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract, including the colon, stomach, liver, and pancreas. We measured the protein expression of ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with an ACE2-specific antibody of paraffin-embedded colon, stomach, liver, and pancreatic tissues. The correlation between the protein expression of ACE2 and the prognosis of patients with gastrointestinal cancers was analyzed by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. The influence of ACE2 on colon, stomach, liver, and pancreatic tumor cell line proliferation was tested using a Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) assay. ACE2 presented heterogeneous expression patterns in the gastrointestinal tract, and it showed a punctate distribution in hepatic cells. Compared to that in parallel adjacent non-tumor tissues, the protein expression of ACE2 was significantly increased in colon cancer, stomach cancer, and pancreatic cancer tissues but dramatically decreased in liver cancer tissues. However, the expression level of the ACE2 protein was not correlated with the survival of patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Consistently, ACE2 did not affect the proliferation of gastrointestinal cancer cells <i>in vitro</i>. The ACE2 protein is widely expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, and its expression is significantly altered in gastrointestinal tumor tissues. ACE2 is not an independent prognostic marker of gastrointestinal cancers.","An, Lin, Liu, Zhong, Zhang, Zhu, Wang, Li, Sheng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.659809","20210628","ACE2; gastrointestinal; gastrointestinal cancers; immunohistochemistry; prognosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15394,""
"Perceptions of Study Conditions and Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among University Students in Germany: Results of the International COVID-19 Student Well-Being Study","<b>Background:</b> Results of previous studies examining the impact of the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic in 2003 on university students' mental well-being indicated severe mental health consequences. It is unclear how the current COVID-19 pandemic and the changes in study conditions due to federal regulations affected mental well-being in the German student population. We examined university students' perceptions of study conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated associations between study conditions and depressive symptoms. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Germany in May 2020 at four universities (<i>N</i> = 5,021, 69% female, mean age: 24 years, <i>SD</i>: 5.1). Perceived study conditions, as well as sociodemographic information, were assessed with self-generated items and the CES-D 8 scale was used to determine depressive symptoms. Associations between perceived study conditions (academic stress and academic satisfaction), in general, and confidence to complete the semester, in particular, and depressive symptoms were analyzed using generalized linear regressions. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-four percent of survey participants felt that the university workload had significantly increased since the COVID-19 pandemic; 48% were worried that they would not be able to successfully complete the academic year; 47% agreed that the change in teaching methods caused significant stress. Regarding depressive symptoms, the mean score of the CES-D 8 scale was 9.25. Further, a positive association between perceived study conditions and depressive symptoms was found (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), indicating that better study conditions were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Results of the generalized linear regression suggest that better student mental well-being was related to higher confidence in completing the semester. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides first insights into perceived study conditions and associations with depressive symptoms among students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.

Two online anonymous surveys were developed: population-based and clinical-based (children with neuropsychiatric disorders). Outcomes included emotional and behavioral symptoms, as assessed by psychometric scales (BPSC, PPSC, PSC, CES-DC and SCARED, respectively), and lifestyle changes during home confinement (i.e., physical activity, screen time, home schooling, reading). <b>Results:</b> The sample included 9,688 pediatric subjects, and 289 children and adolescents with a neuropsychiatric disorder. The presence of siblings was a protective factor in all ages. In pre- and school children: male sex, a diagnosis of autism, residency in highly affected areas, high parental educational level or job loss, and screen time (&gt;2 h/day) were risk factors. Physical activity, home-schooling, reading, talking with other people were protective factors. Residency in highly affected areas, a diagnosis of mood disorder, parental job loss, and screen time, were associated with a worsening of the depressive symptoms, whereas physical activity, talking with other people, playing with parents were protective activities. Screen time was also a risk factor for anxiety symptoms, while physical activity, reading and talking with other people were protective factors. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study identified risk and protective factors for mental health symptoms associated with lifestyle changes caused by COVID-19 home confinement to promote mental well-being in pediatrics during pandemic times.","Oliva, Russo, Gili, Russo, Di Mauro, Spagnoli, Alunni Fegatelli, Romani, Costa, Veraldi, Manti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.664702","20210628","COVID-19; home confinement; mental health; neuropsychiatric disorders; pediatrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15397,""

"Fear of COVID-19 and Stress-Relieving Practices Among Social Media Users, Makkah Region, Saudi Arabia","Background The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its associated consequences can trigger feelings of fear, concern, and anxiety among the population, leading to unfavorable consequences on mental health. This study aimed to assess fear of COVID-19 and stress-relieving practices among social media users in the Makkah region, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional analytic study was conducted among 532 adults inhabiting the Makkah region of Saudi Arabia over a period of one month, from June 15 to July 15, 2020. A predesigned, self-administered questionnaire, including assessments of fear of COVID-19 and stress-relieving practices, was used for data collection. Results The mean Fear of COVID-19 Scale score was 17.3Ã‚Â±5.21 out of 35. Individuals aged 30-49 years and married individuals had higher mean scores (18.4Ã‚Â±5.20 and 18.4Ã‚Â±5.29, respectively) compared to other groups (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, individuals with histories of anxiety and depression, individuals suffering from chronic diseases, and those who did not exercise regularly had higher levels of fear compared to other groups (p&lt;0.05). Practicing religious and spiritual rituals was the most commonly adopted stress-relieving practice among study participants (68.6%). Conclusion Adults in Saudi Arabia have considerable levels of fear of COVID-19. Special attention is recommended for highly susceptible groups. Additionally, mental health education programs are recommended for the promotion of the community's psychological resilience in such a global crisis. Spiritual aspects should be included in such mental health education programs.","Abo-Ali, Mousa, Omar, Al-Rubaki, Ghareeb, Zaytoun","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15817","20210628","adults; covid-19 outbreak; fear of covid-19; saudi arabia; stress-relieving","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15399,""
"Anxiety Sensitivity Mediates Relations Between Mental Distress Symptoms and Medical Care Utilization During COVID-19 Pandemic","Anxiety and uncertainty are common during pandemics. The present study extended previous pandemic research by investigating the role of two transdiagnostic risk factors - anxiety sensitivity (AS: fear of physiological anxiety or ""fear of fear""; Reiss &amp; McNally, 1985) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU; Buhr &amp; Dugas, 2009) - in explaining relations between mental distress symptoms and behavioural responding during the COVID-19 pandemic. Student and community-based participants (N=457; 87.6% female) were recruited between May and July 2020 to complete measures of anxiety (health, panic, general), depression, and stress. Anxiety and related symptoms were found to be higher than in previous studies. Parallel mediation analyses showed that clinically meaningful levels of mental distress symptoms <i>directly</i> influenced safety behaviours and medical care utilization but also <i>indirectly</i> influenced the latter (vs. former) through AS-physical concerns (vs. IU).

"Identity Leadership, Social Identity Continuity, and Well-Being at Work During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread remote working that has posed significant challenges for people's sense of connection to their workplace and their mental health and well-being. In the present work, we examined how leaders' identity leadership is associated with the well-being of employees in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we examined how both leaders' and team members' identity leadership is associated with employees' social identity continuity, and through this with their job satisfaction, burnout and loneliness at work. Employees (<i>N</i> = 363) participated in a field study during the COVID-19 pandemic, completing measures of their leader's and team members' identity leadership (i.e., entrepreneurship and impresarioship), social identity continuity, job satisfaction, burnout, loneliness at work. Results revealed that to the extent that employees perceived greater social identity continuity, they were more satisfied with their work and felt less lonely. Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed indirect effects of team members' identity entrepreneurship on job satisfaction and loneliness via an increase in social identity continuity. Results suggest that to foster employees' health and well-being in times of disruption, organizations might put in place practices that allow employees to maintain a sense of 'we-ness' at work by involving not only formal leaders but also other members of the organization.","Krug, Haslam, Otto, Steffens","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.684475","20210628","COVID-19; health; identity continuity; identity leadership; social identity; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15401,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Emotional and Cognitive Vulnerability in Iranian Women With Breast Cancer","The psychological cost on emotional well-being due to the collateral damage brought about by COVID-19 in accessing oncological services for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment has been documented by recent studies in the United Kingdom. The current study set out to examine the effect of delays to scheduled oncology services on emotional and cognitive vulnerability in women with a breast cancer diagnosis in Iran, one of the very first countries to be heavily impacted by COVID-19. One hundred thirty-nine women with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer answered a series of online questionnaires to assess the current state of rumination, worry, and cognitive vulnerability as well as the emotional impact of COVID-19 on their mental health. Results indicated that delays in accessing oncology services significantly increased COVID related emotional vulnerability. Regression analyses revealed that after controlling for the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables, women's COVID related emotional vulnerability explained higher levels of ruminative response and chronic worry as well as poorer cognitive function. This study is the first in Iran to demonstrate that the effects of COVID-19 on emotional health amongst women affected by breast cancer can exaggerate anxiety and depressive related symptoms increasing risks for clinical levels of these disorders. Our findings call for an urgent need to address these risks using targeted interventions exercising resilience.","Choobin, Mirabolfathi, Chapman, Moradi, Grunfeld, Derakshan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.663310","20210628","COVID-19; breast cancer; cognitive function; emotional vulnerability; psychological health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15402,""
"Identifying Resilience Factors of Distress and Paranoia During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Five Countries","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has affected all countries with more than 100 million confirmed cases and over 2.1 million casualties by the end of January 2021 worldwide. A prolonged pandemic can harm global levels of optimism, regularity, and sense of meaning and belonging, yielding adverse effects on individuals' mental health as represented by worry, paranoia, and distress. Here we studied resilience, a successful adaptation despite risk and adversity, in five countries: Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Israel, and Norway. In April 2020, over 2,500 participants were recruited for an observational study measuring protective and obstructive factors for distress and paranoia. More than 800 of these participants also completed a follow-up study in July. We found that thriving, keeping a regular schedule, engaging in physical exercise and less procrastination served as factors protecting against distress and paranoia. Risk factors were financial worries and a negative mindset, e.g., feeling a lack of control. Longitudinally, we found no increase in distress or paranoia despite an increase in expectation of how long the outbreak and the restrictions will last, suggesting respondents engaged in healthy coping and adapting their lives to the new circumstances. Altogether, our data suggest that humans adapt even to prolonged stressful events. Our data further highlight several protective factors that policymakers should leverage when considering stress-reducing policies.","MÃƒÂ¦kelÃƒÂ¦, Reggev, Defelipe, Dutra, Tamayo, Klevjer, Pfuhl","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.661149","20210628","coping behavior; mental health; pandemic (COVID-19); protective factor; thriving","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15403,""
"Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Fear of COVID-19","<b>Background:</b> Due to lack of preparedness of health systems, fast spread of the new virus, high mortality rates, and lack of a definite treatment, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led to high levels of fear and anxiety in different populations. In addition, isolation, mental disorders, and limitations in social interactions as a result of lockdown and travel ban increased the fear of the new coronavirus. <b>Methods:</b> International databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google scholar, were searched without any time limitation, and all observational studies published in English reporting the mean of fear of COVID-19 based on the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) were included in the analysis. Methodological quality was assessed using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. Random effects model, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression analysis were used to analyze the data. Heterogeneity across studies was examined using Cochran's <i>Q</i> test and <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic. All the statistical analyses were conducted using R software v4.0.3. <b>Results:</b> A total of 44 articles with a sample size of 52,462 were reviewed. A pooled mean of 18.57 was found for fear of COVID-19. The mean of fear of COVID-19 was higher in women than in men (20.67 vs. 18.21). The highest and lowest means of fear of COVID-19 had been found in Asia (18.36) and Australia (17.43) based on continent, and in hospital staff (19.51) and college students (17.95) based on target population, respectively. In addition, the highest and lowest means of fear of COVID-19 were related to items #1 and #3 of the scale, respectively. According to the results of meta-regression analysis, there was no significant association between the mean of fear of COVID-19 and sample size and participants' age. In addition, publication error was not significant (<i>P</i> = 0.721). <b>Conclusion:</b> The mean of fear of COVID-19 was high around the world; therefore, it seems necessary to pay more attention to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.","Luo, Ghanei Gheshlagh, Dalvand, Saedmoucheshi, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.661078","20210628","COVID-19; fear; fear of COVID-19; meta-analysis; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15404,""
"Intolerance of Uncertainty and Fear of COVID-19 Moderating Role in Relationship Between Job Insecurity and Work-Related Distress in the Republic of Serbia","The COVID-19 outbreak in Serbia was followed by strict restrictions that negatively affected the economy, particularly small size companies. The complete lockdown and the prohibition of certain services have led to an unstable employment situation. Only several studies investigated the job insecurity and its consequences during COVID-19 pandemic, and some of them highlight the fear of COVID-19 as a significant moderator of mental health. Other studies emphasize the huge effect that intolerance of uncertainty could have in explaining distress, especially during pandemic. In addition, intolerance of uncertainty was considered as a possible moderator of the relationship between the objective and subjective job threat, as well their consequences for mental health. This study aimed to examine the presence of job insecurity and work related distress in Serbia during the first wave of COVID-19. We wanted to measure the effect of the job insecurity on experienced work distress, as well the moderation potential of the intolerance of uncertainty as an individual-level and the fear of coronavirus as a situation-dependent variable. Five hundred and twenty five employed participants took part in an online study during the first wave of coronavirus infection in Serbia. To measure job insecurity, we used Perception of job insecurity scale (PJIS), while distress was assessed with Distress scale from 4DSQ. Fear of COVID-19 was measured on three items. The intolerance of uncertainty was measured by the IUS-11 scale. The results showed that 30.4% of the participants consider their employment as moderately or highly insecure, and 15.1% thought they can lose their jobs. 63.4% of participants expressed increased levels of distress. The moderation analysis revealed that the effect of job insecurity on distress can be moderated by interaction of intolerance of uncertainty and COVID-related fear. In general, distress scores were increasing with increasing job insecurity, intolerance of uncertainty and fear of COVID-19. This pattern is not observed only when fear and intolerance of uncertainty were both low, when job instability could not influence distress. This study also showed that emotional appraisal of the job threat had higher impact on distress than the perceived threat, that shed the light on the importance of considering general resilience capabilities as a protective factor in the work environment in the time of crisis.","BlanuÃ…Â¡a, Barzut, KneÃ…Â¾eviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647972","20210628","Job threats; distress; fear of COVID-19; intolerance of uncertainty; job insecurity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15405,""
"Mental Health Status, Life Satisfaction, and Mood State of Elite Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Follow-Up Study in the Phases of Home Confinement, Reopening, and Semi-Lockdown Condition","Scientific reports notified that the pandemic caused by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised an unprecedented mental health emergency worldwide. Abrupt changes in daily routine, environmental constraints, adopted home confinement measures, and uncertainty about a date for returning to usual activities can potentially affect mental health and sports activities in athletes. Hence, we designed a cross-sectional study with a within-subjects design to investigate the impact of the pandemic on mental health, mood states, and life satisfaction of elite athletes. During the three phases of home confinement (April 14-24, <i>n</i> = 525), reopening (May 9-19, <i>n</i> = 464), and current semi-lockdown (July 20-31, <i>n</i> = 428), elite athletes voluntarily responded to an online survey. The self-report questionnaire was prepared to collect demographic and epidemiological variables of interest and the COVID-19-related information. All participants also completed the Profile of Mood State (POMS), General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). The main result is that the training rate, mental health, life satisfaction, and positive mood have decreased during the home confinement period as compared with the reopening and semi-lockdown phases. However, the need for psychosocial services has increased during the pandemic period. The present study provides the first preliminary evidence that home confinement conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic might have negatively influenced elite athlete's mood state, mental health, and life satisfaction, as well as training rates. Monitoring the psychological parameters of elite athletes and developing strategies to improve their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic should be on the agenda. Next studies, therefore, seem reasonable to focus on active interventions for athletes during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Mehrsafar, Moghadam Zadeh, Gazerani, Jaenes Sanchez, Nejat, Rajabian Tabesh, Abolhasani","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.630414","20210628","COVID-19; elite athletes; life satisfaction; mental health; mood states; sport","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15406,""

"A Cross-Sectional Study on Mental Health Problems of Medical and Nonmedical Students in Shandong During the COVID-19 Epidemic Recovery Period","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a plethora of psychological problems worldwide since its onset in December 2019. In the upheaval period, compared with medical college students, nonmedical students' psychological state deserves additional concern due to their lack of medical knowledge. Although the epidemic in China has been largely controlled for several months, the mental health problems resulting from the COVID-19 epidemic persist to this day. In this study, we assessed the mental health problems and associated risk factors experienced by nonmedical vs. medical college students in universities of Shandong Province during the COVID-19 epidemic recovery period. <b>Methods:</b> An online survey was conducted over the period from 17 to 19 December 2020. A total of 954 Chinese college students (486 nonmedical and 468 medical students) from three universities of Shandong Province participated in the survey. Mental health variables were assessed with use of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). <b>Results:</b> Compared with medical students, nonmedical college students had higher prevalence rates of depression (53.9 vs. 46.4%; <i>p</i> = 0.020) and insomnia (28.0 vs. 22.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.049), as well as higher total scores on the PHQ-9 (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and ISI (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Among nonmedical college students, being female and native of non-Shandong were risk factors for anxiety and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), while only native of non-Shandong for insomnia (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Among medical students, age (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and living in rural areas (<i>p</i> = 0.04) were risk factors for depression, while only age (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) was a risk factor for anxiety and insomnia. <b>Conclusion:</b> Nonmedical college students in the universities of Shandong Province had more mental health problems and more risk factors for developing them during the COVID-19 epidemic recovery period than medical students.

"Mid-term Psychiatric Outcomes of Patients Recovered From COVID-19 From an Italian Cohort of Hospitalized Patients","<b>Background:</b> Although the usual primary clinical manifestation of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is respiratory, several non-respiratory symptoms have been described, including neuropsychiatric ones. The aim of this study was to investigate the mid-term mental health outcomes in patients recovered from COVID-19, 3-4 months after discharge from the University Hospital Maggiore della CaritÃƒÂ , Novara, Italy. Furthermore, we investigated the possible association of the mid-term mental health consequences of the COVID-19 infection with patients' clinical current status, persistent physical impairment and severity of acute phase of the disease. <b>Methods:</b> Prospective study involving 238 individuals recovered from COVID-19. In the context of a multi-disciplinary approach, patients' assessment included both a clinical interview performed by an experienced psychiatrist, trained in the use of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview to assess the presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and self-administered questionnaires: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), Impact of Event Scale (IES). <b>Results:</b> At the psychiatric assessment 32.9 and 29.5% of participants showed anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Changes in appetite and sleep patterns emerged for 15.6 and 31.2% of patients. According to the self-administered questionnaires, 7.1% of participants had moderate-severe anxiety levels (BAI), while 10.5% had mild to severe depression (BDI-II). Twenty-six (11%) participants were referred to further psychiatric consultation. Psychiatric symptoms showed no correlation with acute COVID-19 severity; in our sample patients with depressive symptoms at the clinical interview, as well as those with mild to severe levels of depression according to BDI-II scores, had lower forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1) values than those without and greater odds for persistent, poor tolerance for physical efforts. <b>Conclusions:</b> As could be expected, an approach including both a psychiatric interview and the use of self-administered questionnaires is likely to capture the psychiatric outcome of patients recovered from COVID-19 better than questionnaires alone. Anxiety and depressive symptoms at follow-up had no correlation with the severity of COVID acute manifestations, but rather with ongoing and persistent physical symptoms.

"Chinese College Students' Stress and Anxiety Levels Under COVID-19","The outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019 has had a significant impact on people. While attention is paid to the immense physical harm it has caused, the psychological impact should not be underestimated. The main purpose of this study was to explore the stress, anxiety, and depression levels of different groups of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an online questionnaire survey of college students by using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9), and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). A total of 1,586 questionnaires were collected and analyzed in R language. The results showed that students with moderate to severe stress (PSS-10 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 14) accounted for 67.50%; the detection rate of depression (PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5) reached 43.77%; and 20.60% of students had anxiety (SAS standard score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50). There were significant differences in PSS-10/SAS among different genders, majors, whether returning to school or not, and those with different psychological experiences (negative or positive, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). It is notable that the median of female, medical student, non-resumption of schooling, and negative experience was higher than that of positive experience (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The results of principal component analysis showed that there were significant differences in PHQ-9, PSS-10, and SAS between the resumption of schooling group and the non-resumption group. Therefore, it is inferred that the stress and anxiety level of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic is generally high, especially for those who have not yet resumed school. Long-term negative emotions can easily lead to serious mental diseases such as cognitive impairment. Education departments should attach great importance to the mental health of college students, and it is necessary to provide precise psychological interventions for groups experiencing greater pressure levels and marked anxiety and depression.","Zhan, Zheng, Zhang, Yang, Zhang, Jia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.615390","20210628","COVID-19; anxiety; college student; returning to school; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15414,""

"The Relationship Between Age and Mental Health Among Adults in Iran During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The evidence on the predictors of mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed contradictory findings, which prevent effective screening for mental health assistance. This study aims to identify the predictors of mental health issues, specifically examining age as a nonlinear predictor. Based on a survey of 474 adults using snowball sampling under the COVID-19 pandemic during April 1th-10th, 2020, in Iran, we found that age had a curvilinear relationship with nonsomatic pain, depression, and anxiety. Specifically, it predicted pain, depression, and anxiety disorders, negatively among adults younger than 45Ã‚Â years, yet positively among seniors older than 70Ã‚Â years. Adults who were female, were unsure about their chronic diseases, or exercised less were more likely to have mental health issues. This study, being the first paper to examine age curvilinearly, suggests future research to pay more attention to nonlinear predictors of mental health disorders in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Zhang, Wang, Afshar Jahanshahi, Mokhtari Dinani, Nazarian Madavani, Nawaser","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00571-6","20210628","Age; Anxiety; Curvilinear relationship; Depression; Distress; Nonsomatic pain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15416,""
"Psychometric Properties of the Arabic Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) Among Jordanian Adults","There is an urgent need to assess the impacts of the Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) outbreak on mental health among the general population such as the Fear of COVID-19. The current study aimed to provide further validation of the Arabic version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) for use among Jordanian adults. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous online survey between 1 and 12 May 2020. The forward-backward translation method was adopted to translate the FCV-19S into Arabic. The study sample included 725 Jordanian adults. The internal consistency (Cronbach's ÃŽÂ±) was 0.91 indicating excellent internal consistency. As for convergent validity, a significant positive correlation was found between the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and the three subscales of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), with the highest correlation being between the FCV-19S and the anxiety subscale (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.54, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), followed by the stress subscale (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.51, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), and lastly, the depression subscale (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.46, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). Construct validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item response theory (IRT). The unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S was confirmed on the study sample. The Arabic version of the FCV-19S is a reliable and valid instrument with good psychometric properties. The use of this scale for assessing the severity of fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic among Arabic-speaking populations is recommended. The findings may guide future COVID-19-related research and further validation testing.","Al-Shannaq, Mohammad, Khader","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00574-3","20210628","Arabic FCV-19S; COVID-19 pandemic; Fear of COVID-19; Jordan; Psychometrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15417,""
"How Communication Technology Fosters Individual and Social Wellbeing During the Covid-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Support For a Digital Interaction Model","The aim of the present study was to test an explanatory model for individual and social wellbeing which incorporates the advantages of using digital technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was carried out in Italy, one of the countries that has been most severely affected by the pandemic worldwide. The study was designed to include variables that might be specifically pertinent to the uniqueness of the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Adults living in Italy (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1412) completed an online survey during the lockdown period in March 2020. Results showed two distinct digital interaction processes highlighted by the facilitating use of online emotions (""e-motions"") and online social support (""e-support""). In short, e-motions were positively related to posttraumatic growth, which in turn was positively associated with positive mental health and higher engagement in prosocial behaviors. Moreover, individuals who perceived themselves as having greater e-support were characterized by higher levels of positive mental health, which it turn was positively associated with prosocial behaviors. Collectively, these two digital interaction processes suggest that digital technologies appear to be critical resources in helping individuals cope with difficulties raised by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Canale, Marino, Lenzi, Vieno, Griffiths, Gaboardi, Giraldo, Cervone, Massimo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10902-021-00421-1","20210628","COVID-19; Coronavirus-19; Online social support; Positive mental health; Posttraumatic growth; Prosocial behaviors; Social sharing of emotions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15418,""
"How Has the COVID-19 Pandemic Changed BMI Status and Physical Activity - Its Associations with Mental Health Conditions, Suicidality: An Exploratory Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has psycho-socially impacted people of all age groups. The consequences related to this crisis may increase the suicide mortality rate as reported in prior pandemics. Although many studies have been conducted identifying suicidal behavior attributing factors, there is a lack of knowledge on the associations of body mass index (BMI) and physical activities, their changes, and suicidal behavior, which were explored herein for the first time. An online-based, cross-sectional study was carried out with a total of 324 Bangladeshi people (mean age = 26.99 Ã‚Â± 8.17 years). The measures included questions on socio-demographics, health-related variables, physical activities-related variables, and mental health problems (eg, depression, anxiety and suicidal behavior). About 41.0% and 29.3% of the participants reported being depressed and anxious, respectively, whereas suicidal behavior after the pandemic's inception was found to be 6.5%. Although the role of BMI status either prior to or during the pandemic in mental health conditions was not statistically significant, the changes of BMI status were (that is, those with decreasing BMI status compared to no change in BMI status were at greater risk of depression and anxiety, which was followed by increasing BMI status). Besides having no outside space for exercise and performing more physical activities prior to the pandemic were reported to increase anxiety levels, but no significant associations between changes in physical exercise frequency and other mental health problems were observed. In summary, the present findings showed that people with either decreased or increased BMI status after the inception of the pandemic were at greater risk of mental instabilities, which is a concern which should be considered when adopting any preventive approaches.","Auny, Akter, Guo, A Mamun","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S308691","20210628","COVID-19; anxiety; body mass index; depression; pandemic and mental health; physical activities; psychological impact; suicidal behavior; suicide in Bangladesh","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15419,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Emotional Well-being of Healthcare Workers: A Multinational Cross-sectional Survey","Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in the last few months has disrupted the healthcare system globally. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological and emotional well-being of healthcare workers (HCWs).

"A longitudinal study on psychological burden of medical students during COVID-19 outbreak and remission period in China","Due to their professional characteristics and future career orientation, medical students have a deeper understanding of COVID-19 and enact disease prevention and control measures, which may cause psychological burden. We aimed to assess the psychological impact during the COVID-19 outbreak period(OP) and remission period(RP) among medical students. We surveyed the medical students in Shantou University Medical College twice-during the OP and the RP, surveying psychological burden of COVID-19 lockdowns and its associated factors. 1069 respondents were recruited in OP and 1511 participants were recruited in RP. We constructed nomograms to predict the risk of psychological burden using risk factors that were screened through univariate analysis of the surveyed data set. There was a statistically significant longitudinalÃ‚Â increment in psychological burden from OP to RP, and stress as well as cognition in psychological distress were the most dominant ones. Common impact factors of the depression, anxiety and stress included frequency of outdoor activities, mask-wearing adherence, self-perceived unhealthy status and exposure to COVID-19. In addition, the high frequency of handwashing was a protective factor for depression and anxiety. The C-index was 0.67, 0.74 and 0.72 for depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was worse during the RP than during the OP. Thus, it's necessary to continue to emphasize the importance of mental health in medical students during the pandemic and our proposed nomograms can be useful tools for screening high-riskÃ‚Â groups for psychological burden risk in medical students.","Zhang, Lin, Peng, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2021.06.003","20210628","COVID-19; Medical students; Nomogram; Psychological health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15422,""
"Neuroticism and respiratory sinus arrhythmia predict increased internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted young adults across a number of different domains. It is critical to establish the degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health and identify predictors of poor outcomes. Neuroticism and (low) respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) are risk factors of internalizing disorders that might predict increased psychopathology symptoms. The present study included 222 undergraduate students from [name removed] in Long Island, NY. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, participants completed self-report measures of neuroticism and internalizing symptoms and an electrocardiogram. Between April 15th to May 30th, 2020, participants again completed the measure of internalizing symptoms and a questionnaire about COVID-19 experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased distress, fear/obsessions, and (low) positive mood symptoms. There was a Neuroticism x RSA interaction in relation to distress symptoms, such that greater pre-COVID-19 neuroticism was associated with increased distress symptoms, but only in the context of low RSA. These findings suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increased internalizing symptoms in young adults, and individuals with specific personality and autonomic risk factors may be at heightened risk for developing psychopathology.","Szenczy, Nelson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111053","20210628","COVID-19; Internalizing symptoms; Neuroticism; Respiratory sinus arrhythmia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15423,""
"Psychological Distress and Physical Health Symptoms in the Latinx Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Role of Anxiety Sensitivity","The outbreak of the novel 2019 SARS2-Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to substantial physical and mental health consequences. Rates of mortality and hospitalization are highest among those of racial and ethnic minority persons, including Latinx persons. Further, Latinx persons have been experiencing elevated mental health problems in response to the pandemic compared to non-Latinx Whites. The current study examined whether individual differences in anxiety sensitivity (AS) related to more severe emotional distress associated with social distancing, financial strain, fear of COVID-19, and physical health symptoms stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic among Latinx adults. Participants included 188 Latinx persons (31.4% female, <i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°34.1Ã‚Â years, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.16) recruited via an online survey panel program.

"Emergency dispatches for suicide attempts during the COVID-19 outbreak in Okayama, Japan: A descriptive epidemiological study","Hardships associated with the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can affect mental health, potentially leading to increased risk of suicide. We examined the relationship between the COVID-19 outbreak and suicide attempts in Okayama, Japan using information from emergency dispatches. This was a descriptive epidemiological study. We collected information on emergency dispatches in Okayama City and Kibichuo from March to August in 2018, 2019 and 2020 (n = 47,770 cases). We compared emergency dispatches and their demographic characteristics, especially focusing on suicide attempts, during these 3 years. The number of emergency dispatches in 2020 decreased compared with the previous 2 years, while the number and proportion of emergency dispatches related to suicide attempts increased. This increase was more pronounced among women and those aged 25-49 years. Among women aged 25-49 years, there was a cumulative total of 43 suicide attempts in 2018 and 2019 and 73 suicide attempts in 2020. The number and proportion of emergency dispatches related to suicide attempts increased in 2020 compared with the previous 2 years, especially among women and those aged 25-49 years.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related restrictions on people with pre-existent mental health conditions: A scoping review","Globally, governments have introduced a variety of public health measures including restrictions and reducing face-to-face contact, to control the spread of COVID-19. This has implications for mental health services in terms of support and treatment for vulnerable groups such as people with pre-existent mental health conditions. However, there is limited evidence of the impact of COVID-19 and its related restrictions on people with pre-existent mental health conditions. To identify the impact of COVID-19 and its related restrictions on people with pre-existent mental health conditions. A scoping review of the literature was employed. Eight electronic databases (PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Academic Search Complete) were searched and 2566 papers identified. 30 papers met the criteria for this review and findings were summarised under three key review questions. COVID-19 and its related restrictions have had a notable effect on people with pre-existent mental health conditions. Public health restrictions have contributed to increased levels of social isolation, loneliness, and reduced opportunities for people to connect with others. Reduced access to health services and treatments has compounded matters for those seeking support. Exacerbation and deterioration of symptoms are commonly reported and can lead to greater susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. The importance of proactive planning, alternative accessible healthcare services and supports for vulnerable and at-risk groups is illuminated. Increased monitoring, early intervention and individually tailored care strategies are advocated. Recommendations revolve around the need for enhanced provision of remote support strategies facilitated using technology enhanced resources.

"Changes in clinical practice perceptions and mental health of sports medicine physicians due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","<u>Objective</u>: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had an immense impact on healthcare, but little has been published on its impact on sports medicine physicians. This study aimed to assess the perceived impacts of the pandemic on practice changes, financial implications, and mental health of the physician members of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM).<u>Methods</u>: Online surveys were sent to physician members of AMSSM, with questions asking about demographic information and personal associations to COVID. Main outcome measures included self-reported clinical practice volumes, visit types (telemedicine, face-to-face), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) scores, personal finances, clarity of practice guidelines, and personal protective equipment (PPE) availability.<u>Results</u>: A total of 825 respondents completed the initial survey, with a subset completing follow-ups. In-person clinical and procedural volumes were reported to be reduced to just 17.9% and 13.7% of pre-pandemic baseline volumes at the first survey (March, 2020), but increased to 81.1% and 77.3% (August, 2020), respectively. PHQ-4 anxiety subscores significantly decreased over time (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); younger physicians and female physicians were more likely to have higher scores (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Reported physician income significantly increased over time (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and financial concerns steadily decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The perception of having adequate PPE significantly increased over the study (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), but not for having clear practice guidelines (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Physicians became increasingly aware of others testing positive for the virus, but not themselves or someone they live with.<u>Conclusions</u>: Sports medicine physicians have been heavily impacted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with some recovery since it started. Sports medicine physicians should be aware of pandemic-related practice changes and resulting mental health and financial implications.","Cushman, York, Asay, Ross, Teramoto, McCormick","https://doi.org/10.1080/00913847.2021.1949252","20210628","COVID; Coronavirus; anxiety; depression; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15428,""
"A qualitative examination of the mental health impact of Covid-19 in marginalized communities in Guatemala: The Covid Care Calls survey","The mental health impact of Covid-19 from the perspective of individuals experiencing psychological distress during lockdown period in marginalized, high-risk communities remains underinvestigated. This study aims to identify key factors related to psychological distress resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic across highly vulnerable districts in Guatemala. The Covid Care Calls (CCC) survey was administered to households in 11 districts in Guatemala to gather information about medical, mental health, and psychosocial status during the lockdown period; provide referral for care; and disseminate information on evidence-based protective measures to stem the spread of the virus. The 330 individuals participated the survey. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze survey data. Most commonly reported mental health issues since the start of the pandemic were anxiety (46%), stress (36%), and exacerbation of pre-Covid-19 mental health conditions (19%). Depression and burnout were equally reported by 12% of participants. Only 2% reported issues with safety in the home. Concerns about catching the virus and economic worries were the most commonly reported sources of psychological distress. Results of this study indicate a high prevalence of anxiety, stress, and increased prior mental health symptoms resulting from the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in low-income, high-risk communities across Guatemala. Efforts focused on enhancing coping strategies as well as psychoeducation to address stigma and increase help-seeking for depression are particularly important.","Alonzo, Popescu","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211028612","20210628","Covid-19; Guatemala; marginalized communities; mental health; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15429,""
"""Communitas in Crisis"": An Autoethnography of Psychosis Under Lockdown","In this article, I use autoethnography to examine time spent on an acute psychiatric ward during the COVID-19 lockdown. I employ the device of ""communitas in crisis"" to emphasize the precarious nature of this experience and the extent to which, for myself at least, informal social interactions with fellow patients and ""communitas"" were significant features of my hospital experience and subsequent discharge. I suggest that a lack of emphasis on inpatient to inpatient relationships in the recovery literature is an omission and a reflection of psychiatry's authority struggles with both service users and professionals, along with a general perception of psychosis as individual rather than as a socially constructed phenomenon. I also suggest that, especially in the wake of greater social distancing, mental health and social services should safeguard against psychological and social isolation by creating more spaces for struggling people to interact without fear or prejudice.","Fixsen","https://doi.org/10.1177/10497323211025247","20210628","UK; autoethnography; lockdown; peer relationships; psychiatric unit; psychosis; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15430,""

"Food insecurity and its associations with bulimic-spectrum eating disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders in a nationally representative sample of US adults","To examine cross-sectional associations between food insecurity and 12-month eating disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders among U.S. adults. This study used data collected between 2001 and 2003 from 2914 participants in the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication, a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44.9Ã‚Â years; 53.4% female). Twelve-month food insecurity was assessed with a modified version of the Short Form U.S. Household Food Security Scale. Twelve-month DSM-IV diagnoses of mental disorders were based on the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Modified Poisson regression models were conducted, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and income-to-poverty ratio. Food insecurity was experienced by 11.1% of participants. Food insecurity was associated with greater prevalence of bulimic-spectrum eating disorders (prevalence ratio [PR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.26-6.42), mood disorders (PRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.53; 95% CI 1.96-3.29), and anxiety disorders (PRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.69; 95% CI 1.39-2.07). Results indicate that food insecurity is associated with a range of internalizing mental disorders, though these findings should be confirmed with contemporary data to reflect DSM-5 diagnostic updates and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study emphasize the need to expand food insecurity interventions and improve access to mental health services for food-insecure populations.","Hazzard, Barry, Leung, Sonneville, Wonderlich, Crosby","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02126-5","20210627","Anxiety disorders; Depressive disorders; Eating disorders; Food insecurity; Mood disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15432,""
"The trajectory of loneliness in UK young adults during the summer to winter months of COVID-19","Current research has shown that young adults are at the greatest risk of loneliness during the pandemic. Drawing upon the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey, this study investigated the trajectory of loneliness in young adults (aged 18-25) from June to November 2020 and its association with emotional support as well as demographic and health factors. The analytic sample included 419 young adults (296 females; 123 males). Growth curve modelling revealed a U-shape longitudinal trend in self-reported loneliness, with a sharp rise during the winter months under the national lockdown. Young adults with long-standing physical or mental health conditions were more likely to report feeling lonely. Those with a lower household income and who were unemployed or not in school reported higher levels of loneliness. Gender was found to moderate the association between self-reported emotional support and loneliness. While greater emotional support was associated with less loneliness in males, no association was shown for females. The current findings add to our understanding of how the pandemic has affected the mental health of young adults and the differential effect of emotional support as a potential coping strategy for males and females.","Hu, Gutman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114064","20210627","COVID-19; Emotional support; Gender; Loneliness; Mental health; Trajectory; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15433,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and maternal mental health in a fragile and conflict-affected setting in Tumaco, Colombia: a cohort study","The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health have been understudied among vulnerable populations, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings. We aimed to analyse how the pandemic is related to early changes in mental health and parenting stress among caregivers, many of whom are internally displaced persons (IDP), in a conflict-affected setting in Colombia. For this cohort study, we used longitudinal data from a psychosocial support programme in which 1376 caregivers were randomly assigned across four sequential cohorts. Recruitment of participants took place in March, 2018, for cohort 1; July, 2018, for cohort 2; March, 2019, for cohort 3; and July, 2019, for cohort 4. Participants completed assessments at baseline, 1-month, and 8-month follow-ups. The 8-month assessment occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic for participants in cohorts 1 and 2 (n=573), whereas those in cohorts 3 and 4 (n=803) were assessed during the early stages of the pandemic, 2-5 weeks after the national lockdown began on March 25, 2020. Primary caregiver anxiety and depression were measured with a scale adapted from the Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised and parenting stress was measured with the short form of the Parenting Stress Index. We estimated how mental health changed by comparing prepandemic and postpandemic 8-month outcomes using lagged-dependent variable models. Results showed that the likelihood of reporting symptoms above the risk threshold increased by 14 percentage points for anxiety (95% CI 10-17), 5 percentage points for depression (0Ã‚Â·5-9), and 10 percentage points for parental stress (5-15). The deterioration in mental health was stronger for IDP, participants with lower education or pre-existing mental health conditions, and for those reporting a higher number of stressors, including food insecurity and job loss. Maternal mental health significantly worsened during the early stages of the pandemic. Considering the vulnerability and pre-existing mental health conditions of this population, the estimated effects are substantial. Policies in fragile and conflict-affected settings targeting IDP and other vulnerable people will be important to mitigate further mental health and socioeconomic problems.

"COVID-19 vaccine trust among clients in a sample of California residential substance use treatment programs","Individuals with a substance use disorder (SUD) are at a significantly higher risk for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and have higher rates of COVID-19 related hospitalization and death than those without SUD. This study assessed COVID-19 vaccine trust, transmission awareness, risk and protective behaviors, and effects of COVID-19 on mental health and smoking among a sample of clients in California residential SUD treatment programs and identified factors associated with vaccine trust. A multi-site sample of SUD treatment clients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°265) completed a cross-sectional survey. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine trust. Participants were predominantly male (82.3 %) and racially/ethnically diverse (33.3 % Non-Hispanic White). Most participants were aware of COVID-19 modes of transmission, however, only 39.5 % trusted a COVID-19 vaccine would be safe and effective. Factors independently associated with trust in a COVID-19 vaccine included age (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.03, 95 % CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.02, 1.05, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) and wearing a mask all the time (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.48, 95 % CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.86, 3.31, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001).

"Female Sexual Function During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","International studies have demonstrated increasing rates of sexual dysfunction amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, the impact of the pandemic on female sexual function in the United States is unknown. To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on female sexual function and frequency in the United States. A pre-pandemic survey containing the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and demographic questions was completed by adult women in the United States from October 20, 2019 and March 1, 2020. The same women were sent a follow-up survey also containing the FSFI, as well as the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety with 4 items (PHQ-4), and questions pertaining to mask wearing habits, job loss, and relationship changes. Risk for female sexual dysfunction (RFSD) was defined as FSFI &lt; 26.55. Differences in pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic female sexual function, measured by the FSFI, and sexual frequency. Ninety-one women were included in this study. Overall FSFI significantly decreased during the pandemic (27.2 vs 28.8, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .002), with domain-specific decreases in arousal (4.41 vs 4.86, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .0002), lubrication (4.90 vs 5.22, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .004), and satisfaction (4.40 vs 4.70, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .04). There was no change in sexual frequency. Contingency table analysis of RFSD prior to and during the pandemic revealed significantly increased RFSD during the pandemic (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .002). Women who developed RFSD during the pandemic had higher PHQ-4 anxiety subscale scores (3.74 vs 2.53, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .01) and depression subscale scores (2.74 vs 1.43, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .001) than those who did not. Development of FSD was not associated with age, home region, relationship status, mask wearing habits, knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19, relationship change, or job loss and/or reduction during the pandemic. In this population of female cannabis users, risk for sexual dysfunction increased amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and is associated with depression and anxiety symptoms.

The clinical features associated with COVID-19 are yet to be conclusively documented. Caution is needed when interpreting the severity of the symptoms as most of the diagnosed patients are those attending clinical assessments. Features of COVID-19 are far from understood. There is a suggested increased risk of COVID-19 infection among people with mental health disorders, which is primarily attributable to the challenges associated with limited resources. There are a variety of reasons why individuals with mental health disorders are more susceptible to infectious diseases. There is currently no specific recommended antiviral treatment. The interventions now used are supportive treatments to alleviate the symptoms and invasive mechanical ventilation. In this review, we discuss the adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccinations. We further highlight the need to develop guidelines and recommendations for managing patients with mental health.

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and two Chinese academic databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang) for studies published from December 2019 to September 2020 that reported the prevalence of above mental health problems among children and adolescents. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the pooled prevalence. Twenty-three studies (21 cross-sectional studies and 2 longitudinal studies) from two countries (i.e., China and Turkey) with 57,927 children and adolescents were identified. Depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed in 12, 13, 2, and 2 studies, respectively. Meta-analysis of results from these studies showed that the pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were 29% (95%CI: 17%, 40%), 26% (95%CI: 16%, 35%), 44% (95%CI: 21%, 68%), and 48% (95%CI: -0.25, 1.21), respectively. The subgroup meta-analysis revealed that adolescents and females exhibited higher prevalence of depression and anxiety compared to children and males, respectively. All studies in meta-analysis were from China limited the generalizability of our findings.

When compared with 2019, the 2020 patient age was lower, with less trauma relating to alcohol (7.3% vs. 13.2%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.009), but more from DSH (3.6% vs. 2.1%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.10). In 2020 less patients were assessed by a consultant and trauma team, with a shorter stay in hospital and critical care. This is the first study to document trauma trends through a lockdown and thereafter. After lockdown easing, trauma footfall rapidly rebounded to 2019 levels. This should be acknowledged in resource allocation decisions if future lockdowns are necessitated.","Waseem, Romann, Lenihan, Rawal, Carrothers, Hull, Chou","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-021-01725-w","20210626","COVID-19; Lockdown; Major trauma; Pandemic; Polytrauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15444,""
"The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic: Approaches for the elderly and those with Alzheimer's disease","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that since its outbreak in December 2019 has become a global pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by the previously unknown coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The elderly are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, and have the highest mortality of the afflicted. Similar patterns have been observed in epidemics and pandemics throughout the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries. In this article, we review some unique challenges the elderly and people with Alzheimer's disease face during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest approaches that could be taken from healthcare and social approaches to better handle this pandemic.","Zhang, Song","https://doi.org/10.1002/mco2.4","20210627"," healthcare; Alzheimer's disease; COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; SARSÃ¢â‚¬ÂCoVÃ¢â‚¬Â2; coronavirus; economic; information access; mental health; the elderly","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15445,""
"During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Opioid Overdose Deaths Revert to Previous Record Levels in Ohio","During the COVID-19 pandemic, states have had to confront a drug overdose problem associated with the pandemic. The objective of this study was to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the opioid epidemic in the state of Ohio by describing the changes in the quarterly opioid overdose deaths (OOD) over the last 10 years. This longitudinal study included OOD data from death records obtained through the Ohio Department of Health. Temporal trend analysis and visualizations were performed on the OOD death rate per 100,000 quarterly from 2010 to 2020. Age, sex, and ethnicity were also analyzed. The OOD rate of 11.15 in Q2 of 2020 was statistically equivalent to the previous peak level of 10.87 in Q1 of 2017. There was a significant increase in the OOD rate from Q1 to Q2 of 2020 and a significant difference between the actual Q2 of 2020 OOD rate and the predicted OOD rate. The poisoning indicator fentanyl was present in 94% of OOD during Q2 of 2020. The total number of OOD remains highest in the White population. There was no significant difference between the actual and predicted OOD rates in the Black population of Q2 of 2020 based on the trend line. However, the OOD rate of 14.29 in Q2 of 2020 was significantly higher than the previous peak level of 8.34 in Q2 of 2017. The Q2 of 2020 OOD rates for 18 to 39 and 40+ age groups were significantly higher from what would be expected from the trend predictions. Based on these findings, Ohio has entered a COVID19 pandemic mediated fourth wave in the opioid epidemic. These findings further suggest that as efforts are made to address the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, states need to maintain their vigilance toward combating the local opioid epidemic.","Vieson, Yeh, Lan, Sprague","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000874","20210626","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15446,""
"Discrimination as a predictor of poor mental health among LGBTQ+ people during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional analysis of the online Queerantine study","To assess the mental health and experiences of discrimination among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) people at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data come from a cross-sectional online survey targeted at LGBTQ+ people, which collected data on mental health, experiences of discrimination and a number of other pandemic-related experiences. To examine the association between sexual orientation and gender and mental health and experiences of discrimination, we conducted regression analyses that adjusted for a range of sociodemographic variables. A web-based survey was used to collect data between the end of April and mid July 2020. An analytical sample of 310 LGBTQ+ respondents aged 18 and above. We assessed mental health with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale and with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). We asked respondents about discriminatory experiences because of their LGBTQ+ identity during the coronavirus pandemic. Perceived stress scores among our LGBTQ+ sample were high (mean: 7.67; SD: 3.22). Based on a score of 10 or more on the CES-D-10, the majority of participants had high levels of depressive symptoms (72%). Around one-in-six respondents reported some form of discrimination since the start of the pandemic because they were LGBTQ+ (16.7%). The average score for perceived stress increased by 1.44 points (95% CI 0.517 to 2.354) for respondents who had experienced discrimination versus those who had not. Similarly, the odds of exhibiting significant depressive symptomology increased threefold among those who had experienced discrimination compared with those who had not (OR: 3.251; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.168 to 9.052). The LGBTQ+ community exhibited high levels of depression, stress and experienced discrimination during the coronavirus pandemic. High levels of poor mental health were partially explained by experiences of discrimination, which had a large, consistent and pernicious impact on mental health.","Kneale, BÃƒÂ©cares","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049405","20210628","COVID-19; mental health; social medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15447,""
"Impact of Covid-19 on the mental health of singaporean GPs: a cross-sectional study","Covid-19 has stressed healthcare systems and workers worldwide. General practitioners (GPs), as first points-of-contact between suspected cases and the healthcare system, assume frontline roles in this crisis. While the prevalence of mental health problems and illnesses arising in healthcare workers (HCWs) from tertiary care settings during Covid-19 is well-examined,(1) the impact on GPs remains understudied. To describe the prevalence and predictors of anxiety, burnout, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) amongst GPs during the Covid-19 pandemic DESIGN &amp; SETTING: Survey of GPs operating in Singapore primary care clinics METHOD: GPs completed a survey which comprised of four validated psychometric instruments. Open-ended questions asked of respondents' challenges and their envisaged support. Data were analysed with multiple logistic regression with demographic data as covariates; concepts of grounded theory were used to analyse the qualitative responses. 257 GPs participated. 55 (21.4%) met the scales' criteria for anxiety, 211 (82.1%) for burnout, 68 for (26.6%) for depression, and 23 (9.1%) for PTSD. Multivariate regression analysis showed working in a public primary care setting was associated with anxiety and depression. Qualitative analyses uncovered possible stressors: changes to clinical and operational practices, increased workloads, and financial difficulties. Mental health issues were found present in Singaporean GPs during the pandemic. Prevalence of anxiety, burnout and depression were found to be higher than those reported pre-Covid-19. Our findings also provide determinants of the issues which serve as possible foci for targeted interventions.","Lum, Goh, Wong, Seah, Teo, Ng, Abdin, Hendricks, Tham, Nan, Fung","https://doi.org/10.3399/BJGPO.2021.0072","20210626","Covid-19; PTSD; anxiety; burnout; cross-sectional study; depression; general practitioners; mental health; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15448,""
"Combating the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic through yoga: Recommendation from an overview","Globally, the psychological health of the people is being affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the fact that numerous systematic reviews already exist on yoga and mental health, it becomes vital to undertake an overview on the same. The objective of the overview was to summarise the evidence from different systematic reviews of distinct yoga interventions used to improve mental health and recommend yoga practices for the same. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020185221). MEDLINE via Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Google Scholar were searched for relevant literature. Search terms used were ""Yoga practice, mental health and systematic review"". Reviews from earliest possible date till May 2020, including those examining the effects of any single or combination of yoga interventions on mental health reported on children, youth and adults were selected. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool was used to evaluate the evidence of the included reviews. Out of the 90 reviews found, eight unique reviews were selected for the overview. Overall, 243 studies were analyzed, with an overlap of only 6 studies across the reviews. Out of 8 reviews, only 2 were of high quality and the rest were of moderate quality. Owing to heterogeneity of the included studies, only descriptive analysis was possible. The results of the review indicate moderate to positive effects of yoga on the mental health parameters. Practicing yoga (physical postures, Bhramary Pranayam, mindfulness meditation, sahaj yoga and laughter therapy) can be beneficial to improve psychological health of the people during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kulkarni, Kakodkar, Nesari, Dubewar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.04.003","20210626","Anxiety; COVID-19; Mental health; Overview; Yoga","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15449,""
"Investigation of the Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Aerosol After Dental Treatment","The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol and COVID-19 contamination distance asssociated with ultrasonic scaling and tooth preparation. Twenty-four patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Removal of supragingival plaque with ultrasonic instruments for 10 minutes and high-speed air-turbine using for the simulation of cutting the maxillary right canine tooth with a round diamond bur for 5 minutes were performed. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: In group A, medium-volume suction was used during treatment. In group B, high-volume suction with an aerosol cannula was added to medium-volume suction. Prior to treatment, 5 glass petri dishes containing viral transport medium were placed in the operating room. After treatment, petri dishes were immediately delivered to a microbiology laboratory for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. RT-PCR test results were negative for all specimens in group B. However, 5 positive test results for COVID-19 were detected in group A specimens. Suction with an aerosol cannula is very important to prevent COVID-19 viral contamination via aerosol. In addition, a high-volume suction capacity (air volume) of 150 mm Hg or 325 L/min is sufficient for elimination of viral contamination. Thus, high-volume suction should be used during dental treatments in COVID-19 patients.","Akin, Karabay, Toptan, Furuncuoglu, Kaya, Akin, Koroglu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.identj.2021.05.002","20210626","Aerosol; Covid-19; PCR test; Scaling; Suction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15450,""
"COVID-19 and Adolescent Mental Health in the United Kingdom","This study examines the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents in the United Kingdom as well as social, demographic, and economic variations in the impact. Nationally representative longitudinal panel data from the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey were analyzed. The analytical sample comprises 886 adolescents aged 10-16 years surveyed both before and during the pandemic. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to measure adolescents' mental health. The results from person fixed-effects regression models show that adolescents with better-than-median mental health before the pandemic have experienced an increase in their emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer relationship problems, but a decrease in their prosocial tendency during the pandemic. In contrast, adolescents with worse-than-median mental health before the pandemic have experienced opposite changes in each Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire domain. Further results from lagged dependent variable regression models show that compared with girls, boys have experienced a smaller increase in emotional problems but a greater decrease in prosocial tendency. The negative mental health impact is particularly prominent among adolescents in one-parent, one-child, and low-income households. Adult household members' COVID-19 symptoms and illness have undermined adolescents' peer relationships. The results reveal the pandemic's diverse impacts on adolescent mental health, which vary with adolescents' prepandemic mental health and sociodemographic backgrounds. The findings underline the need for tailored mental health support for adolescents and targeted measures to mitigate inequalities in the mental health impact of the pandemic.","Hu, Qian","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.04.005","20210628","Adolescents; COVID-19; Inequality; Mental health; The United Kingdom","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15451,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and obsessive-compulsive disorder in young people: Systematic review","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world since the first cases were reported in China in January 2020. The secondary mental health impacts of the pandemic are thought to be significant. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a condition defined by recurrent obsessions and compulsions. It has been hypothesised that the focus on hygiene and contamination during the pandemic could exacerbate obsessive-compulsive symptoms in young people. A systematic literature review was conducted. Papers were sought looking at the effect of the pandemic on obsessive-compulsive disorder in young people. Six published cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were identified, of which four studies investigated clinic samples with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder and two looked at community adolescent populations. Five out of the six studies found that obsessive-compulsive symptoms were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be associated with a worsening of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in young people. Being in treatment seems to have a protective effect. Maintaining mental health services during a pandemic is vital. It is important to be aware of the implications of pandemic on obsessive-compulsive symptoms in young people in order to allow them to access appropriate treatments. More research is needed in this area.","Cunning, Hodes","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045211028169","20210626","COVID-19; ObsessiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œcompulsive disorder; adolescent health; child health; obsessiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œcompulsive symptoms; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15452,""
"Anxiety, depression, and glycemic control during Covid-19 pandemic in youths with type 1 diabetes","Our study aims to assess the impact of lockdown during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on glycemic control and psychological well-being in youths with type 1 diabetes. We compared glycemic metrics during lockdown with the same period of 2019. The psychological impact was evaluated with the Test of Anxiety and Depression. We analyzed metrics of 117 adolescents (87% on Multiple Daily Injections and 100% were flash glucose monitoring/continuous glucose monitoring users). During the lockdown, we observed an increase of the percentage of time in range (TIR) (p&lt;0.001), with a significant reduction of time in moderate (p=0.002), and severe hypoglycemia (p=0.001), as well as the percentage of time in hyperglycemia (p&lt;0.001). Glucose variability did not differ (p=0.863). The glucose management indicator was lower (p=0.001). 7% of youths reached the threshold-score (Ã¢â€°Â¥115) for anxiety and 16% for depression. A higher score was associated with lower TIR [p=0.028, p=0.012]. Glycemic control improved during the first lockdown period with respect to the previous year. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with worse glycemic control; future researches are necessary to establish if this improvement is transient and if psychological difficulties will increase during the prolonged pandemic situation.","Cusinato, Martino, Sartori, Gabrielli, Tassara, Debertolis, Righetto, Moretti","https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2021-0153","20210625","Covid-19; adolescents; anxiety; depression; type 1 diabetes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15453,""
"Persistence of Symptoms after Improvement of Acute COVID19 infection, A longitudinal Study","With increasing the number of COVID-19 infected patients all over the world, a large number of survivors reported changes in their quality of life or experienced re-infection. So, we aimed to detect the percentage, type, and risk factors of persistent symptoms after improvement from acute COVID-19 infection and to detect the percentage of COVID-19 re-infection and degree of severity of the second infection. One hundred seventy-two (59 male, 113 female) patients who were tested positive for SARS-CoV2 were followed up via mobile phone every 2 months for 8 to 10 months. After recovery, 105 patients (61%) (30 male, 75 female) reported persistent one or more COVID-19 symptoms. Fatigue, dyspnea, and depression were the most common persistent symptoms representing 37.3%, 22 %, 22% respectively. We found that age was independently related to the persistence of symptoms. During the follow-up, six females (3.5%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 re-infection. Their mean age was 35.7 Ã‚Â± 11 years. The mean interval from the complete recovery of the first infection to the onset of the second one was 53 Ã‚Â± 22.2 days and ranged from 30-90 days. The second infection was mild in severity than the first infection in 83.33% of cases. There was a high percentage of patients who complained of persistent symptoms after recovery from COVID-19.

"SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with serious mental illness and possible benefits of prophylaxis with Memantine and Amantadine","Patients with serious mental illness are a high-risk category of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Patients with schizophrenia are not participatory and have increased mortality and morbidity, patients with dementia cannot be cared for while depression, anxiety, bipolar tubing are associated with low immune status. Social stress is amplified by social isolation, amplifying depression and the mechanisms of decreased immunity. Hygiene measures and prophylactic behavior are impossible to put into practice in conditions of chronic mental illness. In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the risk for severe development is associated with the presence of comorbidities and immune system deficiency. Prothrombotic status, cytokine storm and alveolar destruction are mechanisms that aggravate the evolution of patients, especially in the context in which they have dysfunction of the autonomic system. The activity of proinflammatory cytokines is accentuated by hyperglutamatergia, which potentiates oxidative stress and triggers the mechanisms of neural apoptosis by stimulating microglial activation. Activation of M1-type microglia has an important role in pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and may associate hippocampal atrophy and disconnection of cognitive structures. Memantine and Amantadine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor inhibitors, have demonstrated, through their pharmacological profile, psychotropic effects but also antiviral properties. In the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on these arguments, we suggest that they can be associated with the therapy with the basic psychotropics, Memantine or Amantadine, for the control of neuropsychiatric symptoms but also as adjuvants with antiviral action.","Marinescu, Marinescu, MogoantÃ„Æ’, Efrem, Stovicek","https://doi.org/10.47162/RJME.61.4.03","20210628","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15455,""
"Black Americans demonstrate comparatively low levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic","During public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, populations can experience worsening mental health. Prior reports have suggested that Black Americans experienced lower rates of anxiety and depression than White Americans before the pandemic; however, during the pandemic, outcomes may be different as Black Americans have been disproportionately affected in terms of mortality, hospitalization, COVID-19 infection, and job loss. We documented the differential mental health impact of COVID-19 on Black and Non-Black Americans. We analyzed nationally representative longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study COVID-19 Tracking Survey spanning March through November of 2020 to assess differences over time in prevalence of anxiety and depression between Black and non-Black Americans. We found that Black Americans were significantly less likely to report symptoms for anxiety, depression, or both during the pandemic. In a given month between March through November of 2020, the odds of Black Americans reporting such symptoms was on average about half that of Non-Black Americans. We also found that in September 2020, the gap in reporting symptoms for depression began to widen gradually. Specifically, since that time, prevalence of depression remained stable among non-Black Americans while it declined gradually among Black Americans. Our main results were robust to adjusting for demographics, risk perceptions, and baseline pre-pandemic mental health status. Black Americans maintained significantly better mental health than Non-Black Americans despite their struggle against economic, health, and racial inequalities during the pandemic. We discuss the significance and implications of our results and identify opportunities for future research.","Owens, Saw","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253654","20210628","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15456,""
"Measuring the Impact of COVID-19 on a Sample of Mental Health Patients: Results from the Siyan Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory","Recent research has shown that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation on people's mental health are quite extensive, but there are limited studies on the effects of the pandemic on patients with mental health disorders. The objective of the present study was to assess the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals who have previously sought treatment for a mental health disorder. The current study uses the newly developed Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII) survey. This tool was designed to assess tangible impacts of epidemics and pandemics across personal and social life domains. From November 9th, 2020 to February 18th, 2021, a total of 245 adults (recruited from a mental health clinic) completed the consent form and responded to the survey link from the Siyan Clinical Corporation and Siyan Clinical Research practices located in Santa Rosa, California, USA. We found that the least affected age group was 75 years or older individuals. This was followed closely by the 65- to 75-year-old age group. People with children under the age of 18 also reported both more negative indicators associated with the pandemic and more positive indicators compared to those without children at home. Gender queer, non-conforming, and transgender individuals may also be at risk for more negative impacts associated with the pandemic. When respondents were assessed with regard to their mental health diagnosis no differences were notes. Substance use also increased during the pandemic. In conclusion, the data collected here may serve as foundational research in the prevention, care and treatment of mental health disorders during pandemics such as COVID-19. Populations such as those with previously diagnosed mental health disorders are particularly at risk for negative effects of pandemic-related stressors such as social isolation, especially if they have children in the household, are of a younger age group, or have substance use disorder. Gender may also be a factor. Further, the EPII survey may prove to be a useful tool in understanding these effects. Overall, these data may be a critical step towards understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations with a mental health diagnosis, which may aid mental health practitioners in understanding the consequences of pandemics on their patients' overall well-being.

The delicate balance between duty, altruism and fear for oneself and others often causes conflict and feelings of helplessness and dissonance in many health care personnel with a fear to resume back the duty, especially after being a COVID victim. There have been hardly any studies yet, related to understanding the emotional and general well being of COVID-19 positive health care workers who have recovered and resumed their duties. To study in post COVID-19 recovered resident doctors and interns the presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, sleep changes, general well-being, perceptions of their COVID experience and association of general wellbeing with anxiety, depression and sleep changes. The study was conducted after institutional ethics committee permission and online informed consent from the participants which included medical interns and resident doctors of our institute. A Google form with questions and scales pertaining to the aims of the study (Patient Health Questionnaire, Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scale, Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale and Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire) was sent on the Google link to the 150 interns and resident doctors via whatsapp who had recovered from COVID 19 infection. Their details were taken from hospital database with Dean permission. 79 responded to the link with the mean duration of COVID infection being 16.1 Ã‚Â± 8.59 days. 64 participants were hospitalized and 18 participants had lung parenchymal involvement. 28 participants had depressive symptoms on the patient health questionnaire. Only 4 participants experienced anxiety as per Zung self rating anxiety scale. 69 participants had greater well being with scores higher than 40 on the Warwick Edinburgh mental well being scale. 8 participants had sleep related issues affecting their work. A negative correlation of general well being was seen with depression, anxiety and insomnia which was highly significant. The most distressing of COVID experiences were being isolated in a room, transmitting disease to near and dear ones and possibility of a serious complication. Re infection, workload followed by use of PPE was the major concern.Many described their COVID experience as boring, depressing with feelings of loneliness. Our study is the first of its kind to evaluate the psychiatric sequelae and COVID experiences of post COVID-19 recovered resident doctors and interns. Psychosocial and institutional support will definitely help in improving the post COVID sequelae in the resident doctors and interns.","Sawant, Ingawale, Lokhande, Patil, Ayub, Rathi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychiatric+Sequelae+and+COVID+Experiences+of+Post+COVID+-19+Recovered+Resident+Doctors+and+Interns+of+a+Tertiary+General+Hospital+in+Mumbai.","20210628","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15460,""
"Maternal mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing, China","The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on breastfeeding women and to identify predictors of maternal mental health and coping. Mothers agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years with a breast-fed infantÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â months of age during the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing, China, completed a questionnaire. Descriptive analysis of lockdown consequences was performed and predictors of these outcomes were examined using stepwise linear regression. Of 2233 participants, 29.9%, 20.0% and 34.7% felt down, lonely, and worried, respectively, during the lockdown; however, 85.3% felt able to cope. Poorer maternal mental health was predicted by maternal (younger age, higher education) and infant (older age, lower gestation) characteristics, and social circumstances (husband unemployed or working from home, receiving advice from family, having enough space for the baby, living close to a park or green space). Conversely, better maternal mental health was predicted by higher income, employment requiring higher qualifications, more personal space at home, shopping or walkingÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°once/week and lack of impact of COVID-19 on job or income. Mothers with higher education, more bedrooms, fair division of household chores and attending an online mother and baby groupÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°once/week reported better coping. The findings highlight maternal characteristics and circumstances that predict poorer mental health and reduced coping which could be used to target interventions in any future public health emergencies requiring social restrictions.","Wei, Gao, Fewtrell, Wells, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-021-00439-8","20210625","Coping; Coronavirus disease 2019; Maternal health; Mental health; Postpartum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15461,""
"Academic stress in Danish medical and health science students during the COVID-19 lock-down","COVID-19 has disrupted normal life and resulted in an online transformation of teaching. Little is known about how these changes affected academic stress in students. This study examined the role of changes of teaching methods on academic stress among university students during the first lockdown in Denmark. The cross-sectional survey was part of the international ""COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study"" and included responses on socio-economic characteristics, infection worries, academic stress, work capacity and satisfaction with teaching from 1,541 Danish health and medical science university students in May-June 2020. Changes in academic stress were analysed using descriptive statistics and multi-variable analyses using stepwise logistic regression. A considerable part (39%) of students reported academic stress due to COVID-19. One third reported that their study workload had increased significantly due to the COVID-19 outbreak and that they were concerned about their ability to complete the academic year. Factors associated with academic stress were female sex, young age, bachelor level, knowing a COVID-19 patient and being worried about becoming infected, whereas immigration background, sufficient financial resources and living arrangements were not. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak has influenced university students' academic stress.

"COVID Pandemic Impact on Healthcare Provision and Patient Psychosocial Distress: A Multi-National Cross-Sectional Survey among Asia-Pacific Countries","COVID pandemic significantly affected the delivery and maintenance of healthcare system, resulting in greater utilization of digital health interventions. This multi-national cross-sectional survey was administered to clinicians working in major Asia-Pacific cities during the mandatory social lockdown period in June 2020. Clinical demographics and professional data, delivery of Andrology-related healthcare services, and patient distress based on validated questionnaires such as Depression and Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and Decisional Engagement Scale (DES) were collected. Telehealth medicine was instituted in all the centres with the majority of centres (92.9%) reported a 50% or more reduction in out-patient related services. The numbers of phone calls, emails correspondence and educational webinars have significantly increased. Despite the provision of reasons for changes in healthcare service and delay in surgery, more than half of the patients (57.1%) rated 2 on the DASS score for the item on patients over-react to situations, while a third of the patients (35.7%) scored a 2 for DASS item on patients being more demanding or unreasonable. The DES scores were more positive with most patients reported a score above 7 out of 10 in terms of items on accepting current arrangement (85.7%), confident in clinician decision-making about treatment (92.9%) and comfortable that the decision is consistent with their preferences (71.4%). Most patients (85.7%) indicated their preferences for more detailed information on healthcare provision.

"The COVID-19 anxiety syndrome and selective attentional bias towards COVID-19-related stimuli in UK residents during the 2020-2021 pandemic","The psychological and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are pervasive and there is potential for a long-lasting impact on mental health. In the current study we sought to provide, in a representative sample of UK residents during the third COVID-19 lockdown in February 2021, further evidence for the validation of the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome construct. We did this by evaluating the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome against measures of personality, health anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety in predicting levels of generalised anxiety and depression, and by examining whether increased health anxiety and COVID-19 psychological distress (COVID-19 anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety syndrome) scores were associated with increased attentional bias to COVID-19-related stimuli. A series of correlation analyses revealed that neuroticism, health anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety syndrome scores were positively and significantly correlated with generalised anxiety and depression scores, and that the perseveration component of the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome predicted generalised anxiety and depression scores independently of age, gender, conscientiousness, openness, health anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety. Furthermore, results indicated that only the total COVID-19 anxiety syndrome score, and the scores on the avoidance and perseveration components, were positively and significantly correlated with attentional bias indices. More specifically, the general attentional bias index was only shown to be positively and significantly correlated with the total COVID-19 anxiety syndrome score and its perseveration component, while slowed disengagement was only shown to be negatively and significantly correlated with the total COVID-19 anxiety syndrome score and its avoidance component. The implications of these findings are discussed.","Albery, Spada, NikÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2639","20210625","COVID-19 anxiety; COVID-19 anxiety syndrome; attentional bias; depression; generalised anxiety; health anxiety; personality traits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15464,""
"Increased Risk of Death Triggered by Domestic Violence, Hunger, Suicide, Exhausted Health System during COVID-19 Pandemic: Why, How and Solutions","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, just like many other public health emergencies, is a well-established global health burden that has resulted in several changes in routines and lifestyles of people globally. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has directly or indirectly involved in the loss of lives of more than 3.24 million as of 6th May, 2021. The increasing threats posed by this pandemic were subsided by the swift and drastic measures put in place by different countries. As other causes of death before the emergence of COVID-19 still exist, the pandemic has further worsened their impact. The increased risks of COVID-19 deaths are not only due to the health burden it possesses, but also due to some other factors. These factors include domestic violence that becomes rampant, especially during lockdowns; hunger due to low economic development, unemployment, and loss of jobs; suicide due to depression; exhausted health system due to high level of COVID-19 cases and inability to contain it. As we move from the response phase into recovery, the pandemic's direct and broader impacts on individuals, households, and communities will influence the capacity to recover. An understanding of these impacts is therefore required to develop priorities to support recovery. This paper identifies other causes of death amidst the pandemic, such as domestic violence, hunger, suicide, and exhausted health system, and how to minimize their effects.","David, Aborode, Olaoye, Enang, Oriyomi, Yunusa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.648395","20210626","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; death; domestic-violence; hunger; pandemic; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15465,""

"Current global research landscape on COVID-19 and depressive disorders: Bibliometric and visualization analysis","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected daily life globally dramatically over the last year. The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on mental health is expected to be immense and likely to be long-lasting, raising a range of global problems that need to be addressed accordingly. To analyze the Scopus-based depression research and COVID-19, explain the advancement of research nowadays, and comment on the possible hotspots of depression research and COVID-19 to obtain a more global perspective. In this report, bibliometric analysis and visualization are used to explain COVID-19's global research status on depression and provide researchers with a guide to identify future research directions. Relevant studies on depression and COVID-19 were retrieved from the Scopus database. Visualization maps were produced using the VOSviewer software, including research collaboration. At the time of data collection (November 18, 2020), 77217 documents were released by Scopus to COVID-19 in all areas of research. By limiting the search to depression and COVID-19 (January 2020 up until November 18, 2020), there are 1274 published articles on depression and COVID-19 in the Scopus. The great majority of which are original articles (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1049, 82.34%), followed by 118 review articles (9.26%), 66 letters (5.18%).

"COVID-19 impact on high school student's education and mental health: A cohort survey in China","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the universal implementation of control measures are fundamentally affecting every aspect of our society and daily lives. To evaluate the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and their associated factors as well as the effects and attitudes towards online education in Chinese high school students. A total of 883 students were included. The first, second and third-year students of a high school in Lanzhou, Gansu province of China were invited to participate in this study. They were requested to involve their parents to complete the survey together. A detailed questionnaire of 65 questions was designed and divided into five sections. The survey was anonymously conducted <i>via</i> WeChat, a Chinese multipurpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app. Overall, 32.94% of students experienced post-traumatic stress disorder due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The majority of students (60.82%) felt that online education was not (10.76%) or less effective (50.06%) in terms of gaining knowledge and improving practical and communications skills. Correlation analysis revealed that the class level, residential background and whether living with parents were significantly linked with the effectiveness and satisfaction of the online education system. Of the final year students, 74.2% said that the COVID-19 outbreak has negatively affected their preparation for the college entrance exam, and 68% of students felt that this outbreak increased psychological pressure for their college entrance examination preparation. In case of having COVID-19 symptoms during the exam, 50.7%, 13.3%, and 10.2% would notify the proctor, teacher and parents, respectively. We found a high prevalence rate of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in high school students.

"COVID-19 Lockdown: Key Factors in Citizens' Stress","<b>Background:</b> Confinement due to COVID-19 can have a short- and long-term impact on mental health (increased levels of stress and anxiety and emotional upheaval) and on people's quality of life. Knowing what factors are behind the stress can benefit the development of strategies and resources for future situations of a similar nature. The purpose of this study is to examine the incidence of a series of sociodemographic factors, confinement conditions, and work situation on the stress reported by confined citizens. <b>Method:</b> The sample is made up of 2008 citizens (19.9% men), the Perceived Stress Scale of 14 items (PSS-14) was used to assess the stress level of the population, as well as a sociodemographic questionnaire and different questions aimed at obtain information about the characteristics of the confinement and the employment situation. Data were collected using exponential snowball-type non-probability sampling. <b>Results:</b> The results suggest that sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and income level could be good predictors of confinement stress. Post-confinement work expectancy along with pre-confinement working conditions can be key to protecting the well-being of confined populations. <b>Limitations:</b> This is a transversal study that forces us to be cautious with causal interpretations. The questionnaire was administered online, which means it excluded a good proportion of the population. <b>Conclusion:</b> The perception of stress being higher in women than men, with the lowest stress in older people and those with higher reported incomes. Stress levels increase as populations spend more weeks in confinement and the pre-confinement work situation seems key to protecting the well-being of the population. A lower stress is observed among stable couples without children confined in residential or suburban areas. Low income or economic instability is associated with a higher rate of stress and anxiety.

"Could the Associations of Changes in Living Arrangement with Mental Disorders Be Moderated or Mediated During COVID-19 Pandemic?","Changes in living arrangement was one of the most well-established risk factors for mental disorders, but little evidence came from moderating or mediating effect during COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to determine whether associations of changes in living arrangement with mental disorders could be moderated or mediated during COVID-19 pandemic. Data were a cross-sectional and international population-based survey data collected as part of theCOVID-19 pandemic. Participants included nationally representative general population probability samples of adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) during COVID-19 pandemic (N=16,784). Main mental measures were reflected by loneliness assessed by UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3, anxiety assessed by Generalised Anxiety Disorder 2-item, and depressed mood assessed by The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 in the survey. With control variables, all the mediation models were conducted by Stata mode. Potential influencing effects of social contact and social support as moderators were analyzed using Hayes's PROCESS macro. Among the participants, prevalence of mental disorders was high. Logistic regression indicated that changes in living arrangement had significant associations with anxiety (AOR=1.127, 95% CI: 1.018-1.249) and depression (AOR =1.142, 95% CI: 1.027-1.269). Mediation models indicated that indirect, direct, and total effects of changes in living arrangement on mental disorders through COVID-symptoms; change in alcohol use; and social contact were significant. Indirect, direct, and total effects of changes in living arrangement on loneliness and depression through social support were significant. Moderation analysis indicated that moderation model 1 in AF Hayes Process procedure was accepted. This study indicated that associations of changes in living arrangement with mental disorders could be mediated by COVID-symptoms, changes in alcohol use, social contact, and social support and moderated by social support during COVID-19 pandemic.

Consecutive patients &gt;18 years old affected by SLE and regularly followed in a single rheumatologic centre were involved. Primary outcome was to compare the scores of the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12) and the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D) between patients and general population. A total of 64 patients completed the survey. After a propensity score matching, they were compared to 128 people from PRESTO project. The median age among patients was 43 years (I-III interquartile range 35-54.5), 88% were female and 100% Caucasian.

"Depression and anxiety symptoms to COVID-19 outbreak among the public, medical staff and patients during the initial phase of the pandemic: an online questionnaire survey by a WeChat Mini Program","To survey anxiety and depression symptoms to COVID-19 outbreak in the public, medical staff and patients during the initial phase of the pandemic. Cross-sectional online survey administered through WeChat Mini Program using Chinese versions of Zung Self-rating Depression Scale and Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale. Guangzhou, China. 47Ã¢â‚¬â€°378 public, 1512 medical staff and 125 patients with COVID-19. Higher rates of depression (47.8%) and anxiety symptoms (48.7%) were shown by patients who were screened positive compared with those of the public (35.6%, 25.7%) or medical staff (15.4%, 13.3%). The professional identity of a nurse, conditions of 'with an infected family member' and 'working at the frontline' were risk factors to depression or anxiety symptoms for the medical staff. Younger age, lower educational level, female and not having adequate masks were the risk factors for the public. The COVID-19 outbreak increased people's depression or anxiety emotion responses, which varied extensively among the patients, public and medical staff.","Wang, Tao, Zhu, Wu, Li, Zhao, Yang, Wang, Zhang, Guan","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046350","20210628","epidemiology; mental health; psychiatry; Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Medical Staff; Pandemics; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15475,""
"Should older adult pneumococcal vaccination recommendations change due to decreased vaccination in children during the pandemic? A cost-effectiveness analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic is causing declines in childhood immunization rates. We examined potential COVID-19-related changes in pediatric 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) use, subsequent impact on childhood and adult pneumococcal disease rates, and how those changes might affect the favorability of PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65Ã‚Â years. A Markov model estimated pediatric disease resulting from decreased PCV13 use in children aged &lt;5Ã‚Â years; absolute decreases from 10 to 50% for 1-2Ã‚Â years duration were examined, assuming no catch-up vaccination and that decreased vaccination led to proportionate increases in PCV13 serotype pneumococcal disease in children and seniors. Integrating pediatric model output into a second Markov model examining 65-year-olds, we estimated the cost effectiveness of older adult pneumococcal vaccination strategies while accounting for potential epidemiologic changes from decreased pediatric vaccination. One year of 10-50% absolute decreases in PCV13 use in &lt;5-year-olds increased pneumococcal disease by an estimated 4-19% in seniors; 2Ã‚Â years of decreased use increased senior rates by 8-38%. In seniors, a &gt;53% increase in pneumococcal disease was required to favor PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised seniors at a $200,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained threshold, which corresponded to absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 vaccination of &gt;50% over a 2-year period. In sensitivity analyses, senior PCV13 vaccination was unfavorable if absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 receipt were within plausible ranges, despite model assumptions favoring PCV13 use in seniors. COVID-19-related decreases in pediatric PCV13 use would need to be both substantial and prolonged to make heightened PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised seniors economically favorable.","Smith, Wateska, Nowalk, Lin, Harrison, Schaffner, Zimmerman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.037","20210625","COVID-19; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Elderly; Pneumococcal vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15476,""

"Disordered eating &amp; body image of current and former athletes in a pandemic; a convergent mixed methods study - What can we learn from COVID-19 to support athletes through transitions?","The COVID-19 pandemic has seen worsened mental health as a result of lockdowns, isolation and changes to sociocultural functioning. The postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is representative of global cancellations of sporting events, reduced facility access and support restrictions that have affected both current and former athlete's psychological wellbeing. This study aimed to determine whether current (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°93) and former (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°111) athletes experienced worsened body image, relationship with food or eating disorder symptomatology during acute COVID-19 transitions. The study was a Convergent Mixed Methods design whereby qualitative content analysis was collected and analysed simultaneously with quantitative cross-sectional data using the EAT-26 and self-report COVID-19 questions. Data were collected from April until May 2020 to capture data pertaining to transitions related to the pandemic and included individuals across 41 different individual and team sports from club to international competition levels. There was a surge in disordered eating in current and former athletes as a result of the early COVID-19 response. Eating disorders were suggested to occur in 21.1% of participants (18% current athletes nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17, 25% former athletes (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26). There was a significant difference between males and females (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.018, rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.17), but interestingly no differences between groups from individual vs team sports, type of sporting category (endurance, antigravitational, ball sport, power, technical and aesthetic) or level of competition (club, state, national or international). 34.8% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°69) self-reported worsened body image and 32.8% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°65) self-reported a worsened food relationship directly from COVID-19. Qualitative analysis indicated that disordered eating occurred predominantly in the form of body preoccupation, inhibitory food control, fear of body composition changes and binge eating. This study indicates that transitions in COVID-19 have worsened food-body relationships in current and former athletes and must be treated as an at-risk time for eating disorder development. We suggest that resources are allocated appropriately to assist athletes to foster psychologically positive food and body relationships through COVID-19 transitions. This study makes practice suggestions in supporting athletes to manage control, seek support, adapt and accept change and promote connection and variety through athletic transitions. The current study looked to explore how current and former athletesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ disordered eating had been affected in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that disordered eating had worsened in both population groups and was described through increases to food preoccupation, control, binge eating, dietary restriction and fear of body composition change. This study offers suggestions on how to best support current and former athletes through COVID-19 transitions, further relating these findings to athletic transitions such as retirement, injury, pregnancy and illness.","Buckley, Hall, Lassemillante, Belski","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00427-3","20210625","Athlete; Body image; COVID-19; Eating disorder; Retired athlete; Sport","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","",15478,""
