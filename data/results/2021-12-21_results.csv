"The Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak On Quality of Life, Seizure Frequency, Depression, and Anxiety in Patients with Epilepsy: A Cross-Sectional Study During the Early Period","Objectives: Epilepsy, according to our current knowledge, does not increase the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection or the rate of complications related to this infection. However, the COVID-19 pandemic can have adverse effects on patients with epilepsy (PWE) and affect the mental health of the community in general. This study aimed to evaluate the depression and anxiety of epilepsy patients, the effect of the epidemic on the frequency of seizures, and the quality of life of the patients in the past 3 months during the pandemic. Methods: The patients who were referred to an epilepsy outpatient clinic of a tertiary neuropsychiatry center within the past 2 years were retrospectively evaluated. The data regarding the seizures, quality of life, anxiety, and depression were recorded during follow-up or through an online platform. Seizure frequency, frequency change during the pandemic (April 2020 to June 2020), medications, admissions were obtained, and Beck Depression and Anxiety Scale were applied to the patients. The patients' quality of life was evaluated using the ""Quality of Life Scale Short Form-36 (SF-36)"" form. Results: One hundred sixty-four patients (77 men, 87 women) included in the study were analyzed. The median overall seizure frequency and seizure frequency during pandemic were 0.2 seizures/month (0-1) and 0 seizures/month (0-0.9), respectively. 125(76.2%) of the patients reported that they had no seizures during that period. No significant difference was found between the frequency of seizures reported by the patients before and during the pandemic period (p=0.12). Only one patient had a PCR confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and the other six patients were diagnosed clinically and radiologically. No significant relationship was found between COVID-19 diagnosis and seizure frequency (p=0.671). 105(64.02%) patients were considered to have depressive symptoms with ten or more points according to the Beck Depression Scale. 116 patients (70.7%) were considered to have anxiety symptoms with nine or more points from the Beck Anxiety Scale. Conclusion:This study was conducted to evaluate the seizure frequency, psychiatric status, and quality of life of PWE in April, May, and June 2020 during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in our country while the social restrictions were applied at the highest level. We found that there was no significant increase in the seizure frequency of patients during the pandemic period and depressive symptoms were common in this patient group and affected their quality of life.","Eren, F.; Gul, G.","https://doi.org/10.14744/epilepsi.2021.26122","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Epilepsi; 27(4):212-220, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24038,""

"Prevalence of depression and anxiety among male patients with COVID-19 in Lebsayyer Field Hospital, Qatar","Background: Depression and anxiety are major health problems found to be associated with various conditions. COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has a substantial effect on the worldwide population. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety among male patients with COVID-19 and explore their relationship with participants' characteristics. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among expatriate male patients with COVID-19 admitted to Lebsayyer Field Hospital in Qatar with mild COVID-19 (according to World Health Organization classification) from July till August 2020. The sample size was calculated using Cochran's formula based on disease prevalence. All eligible patients were invited to participate until reaching 400 participants, who then completed an anonymous survey of sociodemographic questions, Patient Health Questionnaire- 9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire, which are validated screening tools for depression and anxiety, respectively. Results: Of the 400 participants, 148 (37.0%) and 77 (19.3%) reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Depression was more prevalent among those 40-49 years old ( p = 0.029), while anxiety was more prevalent among people aged $50 ( p = 0.456). Both depression ( p = 0.009) and anxiety ( p = 0.042) were more prevalent among Bangladeshi, followed by Filipino participants. Depression was more prevalent among those with the highest income (&lt; 15,000 QR;p = 0.004), in contrast to anxiety, whichwasmore prevalent among thosewith the lowest monthly income (, 2,000 QR;p = 0.039). Conclusion: The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms is high among the study participants. Associated factors identified by the study were unsteady income, poor self-rated health, living with family, Southeast Asian ethnicity, and age group of 40- 49 years.","Deen, N.

"What COVID-19 has taught the world","Background: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has captured global recognition in a short period of time by dramatically impacting people's everyday lives and emerged as a public health emergency. Undoubtedly, it shows that lessons learned from past coronavirus epidemics such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) were not adequate and thus left us ill-prepared to deal with the challenges presently raised by the COVID-19 pandemic1,2. Methods: COVID-19 adds to the list of previous outbreaks of infectious disease epidemics that try to remind us that we live in an ecosystem where the relationship between human and animal life, and the environment must be respected in order to survive and prosper. Rapid urbanization and our forestland invasion have created a new interface between humans and wildlife, and have exposed humans to unfamiliar species, frequently involving unfamiliar organisms and exotic wildlife2,3. Findings: Every pandemic is nature's way of reminding us that the interrelationship between all forms of existence needs to be recognized. To limit new infectious outbreaks, the transdisciplinary 'One Health' solution incorporating 'Health in All Policy' involving all stakeholders especially environmental health and social sciences is being advocated (Figure 1). Conclusion: Savings and investments should be made by everyone to meet the unexpected. Stigmatization and prejudice among individuals in the world should be discouraged. Special attention should be paid to the elderly, as their immune system is weak. Health and safety precautions such as physical distancing and health hygiene etiquettes should be considered as part of life. Global experience teaches that containment steps and active tracing of contacts are effective to minimize the economic burden of disease and enhance knowledge of disease processes, health issues, disease emergence, and re-emergence. These lessons will help us to battle future pandemics.","Barman, R.; Ambra, N.; Barman, M.","https://doi.org/10.5339/jemtac.2021.qhc.21","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Emergency Medicine, Trauma and Acute Care; 2021(2), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24042,""
"Effective approach to manage COVID-19 challenges in Hamad General Hospital dialysis facilities","Background: Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) is providing dialysis treatment to approximately 1050 patients. COVID-19 started from China in December 20191,2, and the first case in Qatar was confirmed on 27th February 2020. There were challenges to provide dialysis treatment for COVID-19 positive and negative patients during the pandemic due to severe staff shortage3, staff fear and psychological distress, workload, lack of dialysis slots, prolonged working hours and staff fatigue. Some staff were even deployed to COVID-19 facilities (modular dialysis services, hotel and quarantine facilities) to provide treatment. Methods: 1) A COVID-19 management committee was established 2) An on-call team was assigned to manage new cases and review dialysis slots availability. 3) Staff performance and adherence to safety measures was monitored. 4) A hierarchy model was implemented for COVID-19. A) Elimination: - Confirmed COVID-19 patients were not to receive dialysis at Ambulatory Dialysis centres. - Unit meetings were only held online. B) Substitution: - Dialysis services were to be provided in HMC dialysis facilities, COVID-19 hospitals, and isolation/quarantine facilities (home/hotels). - Administrators with chronic disease worked from home. C) Engineering: - Reduce number of chairs in tearoom and waiting area - Rearrange offices, working spaces, and conference room to keep everyone 2 meters apart. D) Administrative: - Staff, patient and family education - Screening by using visual triaging scale - Deployment of staff - Managing staff mental health and psychosocial well-being Results: 76 dialysis patients and 30 dialysis staff were infected. 900 hemodialysis sessions were provided inside quarantine and isolation facilities (home, hotel, Bu-Sidra, and other locations) and HazmMebaireek General Hospital (HMGH) Modular Dialysis Unit from March to October 2020 (Figure 1). The number of COVID-19 positive patients reduced from 39 in May 2020 to 12 in July 2020 (p=0002) (Figure 2). Conclusion: Thanks to our approach, we were able to provide a high quality and safe dialysis service for in-centre dialysis and in COVID-19 facilities and quarantine centres (home/hotels).","Fouda, T.; Ibrahim, A.; Elgaalib, M.

"Exercising under COVID-2x: Conceptualizing Future Green Spaces in Australia&rsquo;s Neighborhoods","The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a social and economic disruptor on a global scale, severely curtailing people&rsquo;s ability to travel and engage in many recreation activities. Periodic lockdown and stay-at-home orders have exacerbated the situation. In this social climate, urban green spaces have attained a high significance for the maintenance of the physical and mental health of the population. Given the presence of similar coronaviruses in animal populations, it can be predicted that future epidemics and even pandemics will occur. Urban planning needs to incorporate the lessons learnt during COVID-19 in order to future-proof our communities. This paper reviews the role that urban green spaces played during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these observations, the paper discusses a range of options for the provision of pandemic-sensitive spaces for physical exercise and mental recreation. Design concepts for long-term planning adjustments as well as for future ad-hoc solutions are provided. These include the provision of social distancing 'pods&rsquo;embedded in design and landscaping of permanent parks, the design of ad-hoc, socially distanced 'parklets&rsquo;on a quietened street and a rethink of the design of curb-to-boundary setbacks (nature strip) in residential streets.","Spennemann, Dirk H.

Analysis of the retrieved articles revealed five main topics related to psychosocial wellbeing in the workplace: (1) Support from colleagues and organizations;(2) Home&ndash;work interface and balance;(3) Changes in workload and work demand;(4) Job competence and appropriate training;(5) Job insecurity and financial stress. All five themes were associated with occupational stress and poor mental outcomes, like anxiety, depression, and burnout symptoms. Peer and organizational support seem to have a major impact on workers&rsquo;mental wellbeing. Recognizing these factors and projecting interventions that mitigate their effects or boost their efficacy is a fundamental step towards dealing with COVID-19 in the workplace, or any such future emergencies.","Lulli, Lucrezia Ginevra, Giorgi, Gabriele, Pandolfi, Caterina, Foti, Giulia, Finstad, Georgia Libera, Arcangeli, Giulio, Mucci, Nicola","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132413869","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(24):13869, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24047,""
"COVID-19 Changed Human-Nature Interactions across Green Space Types: Evidence of Change in Multiple Types of Activities from the West Bank, Palestine","COVID-19 stay-at-home orders impacted the way humans interacted with built and natural environments. Previous research on the human use of green spaces during the pandemic, largely conducted in a Western context, has found increased use of home gardens and urban green spaces, and decreased visitation to conservation areas. We explored changes in residents&rsquo;outdoor nature-associated activities during the pandemic in the West Bank, Palestine. We used a web-based survey to ask residents about their passive, interactive, and extractive outdoor activities that take place in home gardens, urban parks, and natural areas. Overall, our 1278 respondents spent less time with family and friends and more time alone. We found differences in respondent&rsquo;s participation in activities both between green space types and between activity types. Participation in passive appreciation of nature activities increased for home gardens but decreased in urban parks and natural areas. Interactive activities, including cultivation, increased for all areas, while extractive activities stayed the same or decreased. Only in natural areas did respondents&rsquo;demographics explain changes in activity participation rates after the pandemic. Residents&rsquo;increased time alone raises concerns about mental health. The differences we observed in activity participation across green space types highlights the importance of looking across different types of natural spaces and different activities in the same setting, as well as examining non-Western settings.","Dawwas, Emad B.; Dyson, Karen","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132413831","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(24):13831, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24048,""
"Evaluating the Impact of COVID-19 on Society, Environment, Economy, and Education","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused drastic changes across the globe, affecting all areas of life. This paper provides a comprehensive study on the influence of COVID-19 in various fields such as the economy, education, society, the environment, and globalization. In this study, both the positive and negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on education are studied. Modern technologies are combined with conventional teaching to improve the communication between instructors and learners. COVID-19 also greatly affected people with disabilities and those who are older, with these persons experiencing more complications in their normal routine activities. Additionally, COVID-19 provided negative impacts on world economies, greatly affecting the business, agriculture, entertainment, tourism, and service sectors. The impact of COVID-19 on these sectors is also investigated in this study, and this study provides some meaningful insights and suggestions for revitalizing the tourism sector. The association between globalization and travel restrictions is studied. In addition to economic and human health concerns, the influence of a lockdown on environmental health is also investigated. During periods of lockdown, the amount of pollutants in the air, soil, and water was significantly reduced. This study motivates researchers to investigate the positive and negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in various unexplored areas.","Kumar, Vijay, Alshazly, Hammam, Idris, Sahar Ahmed, Bourouis, Sami","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132413642","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(24):13642, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24049,""
"Connection between Teacher Support and Student&rsquo;s Achievement: Could Growth Mindset Be the Moderator?","The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound effect on the system of education&mdash;gaps in students&rsquo;learning, their socioemotional and mental health problems and growing inequality have been recorded. These problems confront students from low socioeconomic status (SES) in particular, therefore supportive relationships with teachers are of great importance. The growth mindset, as a student&rsquo;s belief that he or she can develop his or her capabilities, can help him or her cope with arising difficulties. Based on the first hypothesis, this study sought to establish whether teacher support is positively related to student&rsquo;s achievement. Our second hypothesis is as follows: a student&rsquo;s growth mindset moderates the positive effect of teacher support on students&rsquo;achievement;this relationship is stronger when the student&rsquo;s growth mindset is higher. The research sample consisted of 163 students from municipalities of Lithuania that are regarded as socioeconomically disadvantaged. The research results show positive correlations between teacher&rsquo;support, student&rsquo;s growth mindset and achievement. Additionally, the role of student&rsquo;s growth mindset as a moderator between teacher support and the student&rsquo;s achievement was established. Statistically significant differences between high-SES and low-SES students when comparing their growth mindsets and achievement prove that it is important to enhance confidence of low-SES students in their capabilities and the potential to develop them.","Brandisauskiene, Agne, Buksnyte-Marmiene, Loreta, Cesnaviciene, Jurate, Daugirdiene, Ausra, Kemeryte-Ivanauskiene, Egle, Nedzinskaite-Maciuniene, Rasa","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132413632","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(24):13632, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24050,""
"Exploring the Linkages between Substance Use, Natural Disasters, Pandemics, and Intimate Partner Violence against Women: A Rapid Review in the Context of COVID-19","Rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) and substance use have risen during the COVID-19 pandemic, with potentially enduring effects on women&rsquo;s health. A rapid review was conducted on IPV and women&rsquo;s substance use in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid review explored two separate research questions with a view to integrate the literature related to: (1) containment, social isolation, pandemics, disasters, lockdowns, and IPV;and (2) the relationships between substance use and IPV. Two different searches for each question were conducted between May and October 2020 and n = 47 articles were included. Women experience multiple physical and mental health consequences related to IPV that can be exacerbated by public health crises such as pandemics and disasters. Perpetrators may use these events as a tactic to threaten, isolate, or use coercive control. Similar tactics are reported in the complex relationship between IPV and substance use, where substance use can accompany IPV and/or be used as a coping mechanism for survivors. The findings highlight long standing women&rsquo;s health concerns made further visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional research is needed to identify actions required to reduce gender inequities and harms associated with IPV and substance use, and to adequately tailor and prepare effective responses in the context of future public health crises.","Brabete, Andreea C.; Wolfson, Lindsay, Stinson, Julie, Poole, Nancy, Allen, Sarah, Greaves, Lorraine","https://doi.org/10.3390/sexes2040040","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sexes; 2(4):509-522, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24051,""
"A Case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Triggered by the Pandemic","Background: The pandemic caused by the sars-cov2 coronavirus can be considered the biggest international public health crisis. Outbreaks of emerging diseases can trigger fear reactions. Strict adherence to the strategies can cause harmful consequences, particularly for people with pathology on the spectrum of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Case presentation: We describe the clinical case of a woman, with a history of anxiety disorder, who develops obsessive-compulsive symptoms, she started cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacological therapy, with appropriate follow-up. Conclusions: The intense focus on the risk of contamination and the adoption of new hygienic behaviors can be internalized as normative and become an enhancing trigger for obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviors. It is an important focus on prevention, early intervention and adequate follow-up, through measures to promote mental health.","Costa, Ana, Jesus, Sabrina, SimÃµes, LuÃ­s, Almeida, MÃ³nica, Alcafache, JoÃ£o","https://doi.org/10.3390/psych3040055","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Psych; 3(4):890-896, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24052,""
"COVID-19 Related Fears of Patients Admitted to a Psychiatric Emergency Department during and Post-Lockdown in Switzerland: Preliminary Findings to Look Ahead for Tailored Preventive Mental Health Strategies","Background and Objectives: While the impact on mental health of 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) has been extensively documented, little is known about its influence on subjective fears. Here, we investigate the COVID-19 impact and its related restrictions on fears of patients admitted to a psychiatric Emergency Department (ED) during and post-lockdown. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study on 1477 consultations at the psychiatric ED of the University Hospital of Geneva (HUG) was performed using a mixed-methods analysis. The first analysis section was qualitative, aiming to explore the type of fears, while the second section statistically compared fears (i) during lockdown (16 March 2020&ndash;10 May 2020) and (ii) post-lockdown (11 May 2020&ndash;5 July 2020). Fears were also explored among different patient-age sub-groups. Results: 334 patients expressed one/more fears. Both in lockdown and post-lockdown, fears mostly pertained to &ldquo;containment measures&rdquo;(isolation, loneliness). When compared lockdown vs. post-lockdown, fears about &ldquo;work status&rdquo;(deteriorating, losing work) prevailed in lockdown (p = 0.029) while &ldquo;hopelessness&rdquo;(powerless feeling, inability to find solutions) in post-lockdown (p = 0.001). &ldquo;Self around COVID-19&rdquo;(dying, getting sick) fear was relatively more frequent in youth (p = 0.039), while &ldquo;hopelessness&rdquo;in the elderly (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Collectively, these findings highlight that lockdown/post-lockdown periods generated temporally and demographically distinct COVID-19 related fears patterns, with special regard to youth and elderly, two particularly vulnerable populations when faced with sudden and unexpected dramatic events. For this reason, the particular ED &ldquo;front-line service&rdquo;status makes it a privileged observatory that can provide novel insights. From a mental health perspective, these latter can be translated into pragmatic, more personalized prevention strategies to reinforce specific resilience resources and mitigate the current and long-term pandemic&rsquo;s impact.","Costanza, Alessandra, Macheret, Laura, Folliet, Aline, Amerio, Andrea, Aguglia, Andrea, Serafini, Gianluca, Prada, Paco, Bondolfi, Guido, Sarasin, FranÃ§ois, Ambrosetti, Julia","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57121360","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Medicina; 57(12):1360, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24053,""
"Differences in the Association between Physical Activity and People&rsquo;s Resilience and Emotions during Two Consecutive Covid-19 Lockdowns in Israel","Governments worldwide have imposed harsh restrictions for decreasing the Covid-19 pandemic and maintaining public health. Yet such limitations have impacted people&rsquo;s physical activity. This study examined relationships between changes in physical activity and resilience, emotions, and depression during two lockdowns in Israel. An online survey was completed twice by 135 participants during two consecutive lockdowns. The results indicate that resilience and positive emotions were higher, and negative emotions and depression were lower during the second lockdown compared to the first one&mdash;even though people spent less time performing physical activity in the later lockdown. Moreover, negative emotions significantly decreased among people who reported increased physical activity during the second lockdown [M = 2.2 (SD = 0.9) compared to M = 1.9 (SD = 0.8) on a scale of 1&ndash;5] and increased among those who reported a reduction in activity [M = 1.8 (SD = 0.7) compared to M = 2.2 (SD = 0.7)]. It could therefore be concluded that while the Israeli population&rsquo;s resilience is higher compared to other populations (who do not regularly deal with crisis situations), their increased physical activity was associated with better resilience and emotions and lower depression scores. Since lockdowns are an extreme yet often repeated phenomenon, it is important to understand the psychological implications of engaging in physical activity.","Zach, Sima, Eilat-Adar, Sigal, Ophir, Miki, Dotan, Avital","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413217","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(24):13217, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24054,""
"The Relationships among Anxiety, Subjective Well-Being, Media Consumption, and Safety-Seeking Behaviors during the COVID-19 Epidemic","The COVID-19 epidemic has been confirmed as the largest scale outbreak of atypical pneumonia since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and it has become a public health emergency of international concern. It exacerbated public confusion and anxiety, and the impact of COVID-19 on people needs to be better understood. Indeed, prior studies that conducted meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort research compared mental health before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic and proved that public health polices (e.g., city lockdowns, quarantines, avoiding gatherings, etc.) and COVID-19-related information that circulates on new media platforms directly affected citizen&rsquo;s mental health and well-being. Hence, this research aims to explore Taiwanese people&rsquo;s health status, anxiety, media sources for obtaining COVID-19 information, subjective well-being, and safety-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 epidemic and how they are associated. Online surveys were conducted through new media platforms, and 342 responses were included in the analysis. The research results indicate that the participants experienced different aspects of COVID-19 anxiety, including COVID-19 worry and perceived COVID-19 risk. Among the given media sources, the more participants searched for COVID-19 information on new media, the greater they worried about COVID-19. Furthermore, COVID-19 worry was positively related to safety-seeking behavior, while perceived COVID-19 risk was negatively related to subjective well-being. This paper concludes by offering some suggestions for future studies and pointing out limitations of the present study.","Luo, Yi-Fang, Shen, Heng-Yu, Yang, Shu-Ching, Chen, Liang-Ching","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413189","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(24):13189, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24055,""
"Exploring the Protective Function of Positivity and Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy in Time of Pandemic COVID-19","Despite several empirical studies on the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that have highlighted its detrimental effect on individuals&rsquo;mental health, the identification of psychological factors that may moderate its impact on individuals&rsquo;behavior and well-being remains partly unexplored. The present study was conceived to examine the mediation role of regulatory emotional self-efficacy in the relationship between positivity and anxiety, depression, and perceived self-efficacy in complying with the containment measures to contrast the COVID-19 spread. Furthermore, the moderation role of age was tested. A sample of 1258 participants (64.2% women;Mage = 42.09, SD = 13.62) enrolled from the Italian general population answered an online survey aimed at investigating the role of individual differences in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. We opted for a snowball recruiting procedure to find participants. The online survey was disseminated through email invitation and using social media platforms (i.e., Facebook, Instagram). A multi-group path analysis model was performed using Mplus 8.4 to explore the hypothesized relations among variables. The following criteria were employed to evaluate the goodness of fit: &chi;2 likelihood ratio statistic, CFI and TLI &gt; 0.95, RMSEA &lt; 0.06 and SRMR &lt; 0.08. The findings corroborated the protective role of both positivity and regulatory emotional self-efficacy in reducing individuals&rsquo;anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as in fostering individuals&rsquo;capabilities in complying with the containment measures imposed by the government to reduce the risk of illness and to contain the spread of the virus COVID-19. Specifically, regulatory emotional self-efficacy beliefs partially mediated the relations between positivity and anxiety and depressive symptoms and fully mediated the effect of positivity on perceived self-efficacy beliefs in complying with the containment measures. These paths were equal across ages. The results of the present study appear relevant to implementing psychological interventions aimed to reduce the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health through the promotion of individuals&rsquo;optimistic orientation and emotion regulation.","Thartori, Eriona, Pastorelli, Concetta, Cirimele, Flavia, Remondi, Chiara, Gerbino, Maria, Basili, Emanuele, Favini, Ainzara, Lunetti, Carolina, Fiasconaro, Irene, Caprara, Gian Vittorio","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413171","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(24):13171, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24056,""
"Accept Anxiety to Improve Sleep: The Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on the Relationships between Mindfulness, Distress, and Sleep Quality","It has been recently proposed that mindfulness can improve sleep quality through the mediating role on psychological distress and that acceptance may play a pivotal role in mindfulness beneficial effects. The aim of the present work was to understand the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on dispositional mindfulness, sleep, and distress, and on their relationships. In particular, we wanted to test the hypothesis that the detrimental effects of lockdown on sleep depended on mindfulness and distress (including anxiety and depression) and that the acceptance facet of mindfulness played the leading role. A longitudinal study based on self-report questionnaires was conducted on 39 Italian adults (M age = 35.03, SD = 14.02;21 men) assessing mindfulness, distress, and sleep quality before (23 December 2019&ndash;8 March 2020) and during (27 April 2020&ndash;10 May 2020) the first Italian COVID-19 lockdown. Lockdown decreased mindfulness while increasing distress and sleep problems. Path analysis showed that the effects of lockdown on sleep were fully mediated by mindfulness and distress. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis showed that these effects were mainly dependent on the acceptance component of mindfulness working through anxiety. The present study confirms, in the context of the COVID-19 lockdown, a model according to which mindfulness, and specifically acceptance, influences sleep through the mediating role of distress.","Mirolli, Marco, Simione, Luca, Martoni, Monica, Fabbri, Marco","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413149","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(24):13149, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24057,""

"Parks and the Pandemic: A Scoping Review of Research on Green Infrastructure Use and Health Outcomes during COVID-19","Green infrastructure (GI) has long been known to impact human health, and many academics have used past research to argue for the potential importance of GI as a mechanism for maintaining or improving health within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This scoping review addresses the question: What evidence, if any, have researchers found of a relationship between green infrastructure use and health during the COVID-19 pandemic? Specifically, evaluating the (a) association of GI use with COVID-19 disease outcomes and (b) association of GI use with other health outcomes as impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty-two studies were identified that measured GI use and studied it in relation to health outcomes during the pandemic. The studies were reviewed for the specific measures and types of GI use, level of analysis, specific types of health outcomes, and the conclusions reached with regard to GI use and health. Studies exploring COVID-19-specific health outcomes showed mixed results, while non-COVID health outcomes were more consistently improved through GI use, particularly with regard to improved mental health. While the evidence strongly suggests that GI use has played a protective role in non-COVID-19 physical and mental health during the pandemic, questions remain with regard to possible impacts on COVID transmission and mortality.","Heckert, Megan, Bristowe, Amanda","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413096","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(24):13096, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24059,""

As a result, overall indoor physical activity significantly decreased in a before&ndash;during COVID-19 crisis comparison, although exercising at home with online instructions increased by about 63%. Exercising outdoors increased overall, specifically in periurban forests and rural areas, both by about 9%. Life satisfaction decreased significantly by 19.7% (p &lt; 0.001).

"Stroke Survivors&rsquo;Personal Efficacy Beliefs and Outcome Expectations of Tai Chi Exercise: A Qualitative Descriptive Study","Prior qualitative research conducted among stroke survivors to explore the potential benefits and challenges of participating in tai chi exercise during stroke recovery is limited to those without depression. A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Social Cognitive Theory and Complex Systems Biology provided the theoretical framework, with focus group interview data collected from stroke survivors after participation in a tai chi intervention. Due to COVID-19, the focus group interview was conducted via online video conferencing. Content analysis of the de-identified transcript was conducted with a-priori codes based on the theoretical framework and inductive codes that were added during the analysis process. Lincoln and Guba&rsquo;s criteria were followed to ensure trustworthiness of the data. Community-dwelling stroke survivors (n = 7) participating in the focus group interviews were on average 68 years old, mainly retired (71%, n = 5), married women (57%, n = 4) with &gt;13 years education (86%, n = 6). The three major themes were: personal efficacy beliefs, tai chi intervention active ingredients, and outcome expectations. Social Cognitive Theory underscored stroke survivors&rsquo;personal efficacy beliefs, behavior, and outcome expectations, while Complex Systems Biology highlighted the active ingredients of the tai chi intervention they experienced. Participation in the 8-week tai chi intervention led to perceived physical, mental, and social benefits post stroke.","Taylor-Piliae, Ruth, Dolan, Hanne, Yako, Aodet","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413001","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(24):13001, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24061,""
"Mental Health and Adherence to COVID-19 Protective Behaviors among Cancer Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An International, Multinational Cross-Sectional Study","A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted during the first COVID-19 wave, to examine the impact of COVID-19 on mental health using an anonymous online survey, enrolling 9565 individuals in 78 countries. The current sub-study examined the impact of the pandemic and the associated lockdown measures on the mental health, and protective behaviors of cancer patients in comparison to non-cancer participants. Furthermore, 264 participants from 30 different countries reported being cancer patients. The median age was 51.5 years, 79.9% were female, and 28% had breast cancer. Cancer participants reported higher self-efficacy to follow recommended national guidelines regarding COVID-19 protective behaviors compared to non-cancer participants (p &lt; 0.01). They were less stressed (p &lt; 0.01), more psychologically flexible (p &lt; 0.01), and had higher levels of positive affect compared to non-cancer participants. Amongst cancer participants, the majority (80.3%) reported COVID-19, not their cancer, as their priority during the first wave of the pandemic and females reported higher levels of stress compared to males. In conclusion, cancer participants appeared to have handled the unpredictable nature of the first wave of the pandemic efficiently, with a positive attitude towards an unknown and otherwise frightening situation. Larger, cancer population specific and longitudinal studies are warranted to ensure adequate medical and psychological care for cancer patients.","Kassianos, Angelos P.; Georgiou, Alexandros, Kyprianidou, Maria, Lamnisos, Demetris, Lubenko, Jelena, Presti, Giovambattista, Squatrito, Valeria, Constantinou, Marios, Nicolaou, Christiana, Papacostas, Savvas, Aydin, GÃ¶kÃ§en, Chong, Yuen Yu, Chien, Wai Tong, Cheng, Ho Yu, Ruiz, Francisco J.; Garcia-Martin, Maria B.; Obando, Diana, Segura-Vargas, Miguel A.; Vasiliou, Vasilis S.; McHugh, Louise, HÃ¶fer, Stefan, Baban, Adriana, Neto, David Dias, Silva, Ana Nunes da, MonestÃ¨s, Jean-Louis, Alvarez-Galvez, Javier, Blarrina, Marisa Paez, Montesinos, Francisco, Salas, Sonsoles Valdivia, Ori, Dorottya, Kleszcz, Bartosz, Lappalainen, Raimo, Ivanovic, Iva, Gosar, David, Dionne, Frederick, Merwin, Rhonda M.; Chatzittofis, Andreas, Konstantinou, Evangelia, Economidou, Sofia, Gloster, Andrew T.; Karekla, Maria, Constantinidou, Anastasia","https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13246294","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Cancers; 13(24):6294, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24062,""
"Recent Advances in Consumer Behavior Theory: Shocks from the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic has had an enormous impact on people&rsquo;s lives, particularly aspects of life such as consumption, and has therefore brought new elements to the expansion of Consumer behavior theory. Methods: This paper searches the literature on consumption research conducted from 1981 to 2021, including sources such as CNKI, Wanfang, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Through the exploration of the existing relevant literature, this article found that the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic has had a profound impact on consumption willingness, consumption patterns, and consumption objects, and, as such, has newly expanded the theoretical model of consumer behavior. Results: Through reviewing the literature, this paper found some results. For example with regard to consumption patterns, early studies and the impact of COVID-19 was focused on online consumption, however in the context of COVID-19, scholars proposed paying attention to the combination of online and offline development. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic has had a profound effect on consumer behavior worldwide. Under the current economic depression, the government should take adequate measures in order to respond to the new changes in consumer behavior and therefore promote economic growth. For example, the government should encourage the combination of online and offline business operation modes to break the boundaries of customer groups and supply chains, so that consumers can buy anytime and anywhere.","Yin, Bibo, Yu, Yajing, Xu, Xiaocang","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs11120171","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 11(12):171, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24063,""
"Effect of Sensory Deprivation of Nasal Respiratory on Behavior of C57BL/6J Mice","Nasal breathing is a dynamic cortical organizer involved in various behaviors and states, such as locomotion, exploration, memory, emotion, introspection. However, the effect of sensory deprivation of nasal respiratory breath (NRD) on behavior remain poorly understood. Herein, general locomotor activity, emotion, learning and memory, social interaction, and mechanical pain were evaluated using a zinc sulfate nasal irrigation induced nasal respiratory sensory deprivation animal model (ZnSO4-induced mouse model). In the open field test, the elevated O-maze test, and forced swim test, NRD mice exhibited depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. In memory-associated tests, NRD mice showed cognitive impairments in the hippocampal-dependent memory (Y maze, object recognition task, and contextual fear conditioning (CFC)) and amygdala-dependent memory (the tone-cued fear conditioning test (TFC)). Surprisingly, NRD mice did not display deficits in the acquisition of conditional fear in both CFC and TFC tests. Still, they showed significant memory retrieval impairment in TFC and enhanced memory retrieval in CFC. At the same time, in the social novelty test using a three-chamber setting, NRD mice showed impaired social and social novelty behavior. Lastly, in the von Frey filaments test, we found that the pain sensitivity of NRD mice was reduced. In conclusion, this NRD mouse model showed a variety of behavioral phenotypic changes, which could offer an important insight into the behavioral impacts of patients with anosmia or those with an impaired olfactory bulb (OB) (e.g., in COVID-19, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, etc.).","Zhu, Yongji, Ye, Yujing, Zhou, Chenyang, Sun, Siqi, Zhang, Jingjing, Zhao, Zixuan, Sun, Tingting, Li, Jing, Yang, Jing, Li, Weiyun, Li, Shanshan","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11121626","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(12):1626, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24064,""
"Indoor Air Quality and Health Outcomes in Employees Working from Home during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Study","Indoor air quality (IAQ) has a substantial impact on public health. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, more employees have worked remotely from home to minimize in-person contacts. This pilot study aims to measure the difference in workplace IAQ before and during the pandemic and its impact on employees&rsquo;health. The levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and total volatile organic chemicals (tVOC) were measured in the employees&rsquo;offices before the COVID-19 pandemic and at homes while working from home during the pandemic using Foobot air monitors. The frequencies of six sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms were evaluated at each period of monitoring. The result showed PM2.5 levels in households while working from home were significantly higher than in offices while working at the office for all participants (p &lt; 0.05). The PM2.5 levels in all households exceeded the health-based annual mean standard (12 &micro;g/m3), whereas 90% of offices were in compliance. The tVOC levels were all below the standard (500 &micro;g/m3). We also found a higher frequency of SBS symptoms were observed while working from home as the IAQ was worse at home. This study suggested that working from home might have a detrimental health impact due to poor IAQ and providing interventions to remote employees should be considered.","Roh, Taehyun, Moreno-Rangel, Alejandro, Baek, Juha, Obeng, Alexander, Hasan, Nishat Tasnim, Carrillo, Genny","https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12121665","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Atmosphere; 12(12):1665, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24065,""

This study is based on a content analysis of memes posted on one of the most popular emerging?adult-focused Facebook groups established during the pandemic. It finds that three themes emerged: pandemic humor, generational identity humor, and generational conflict humor. Memes about the pandemic include sub-themes of a coming apocalypse, adults who deny the seriousness of COVID-19, and a more general expression of negative feelings, particularly anger and fear, through humor. Posts also emphasize the existence of a shared generational identity through humor, with commonly understood references to issues like online learning, productivity, and mental health. Finally, generational conflict humor emphasizes antagonism with older generations, including mistrust of government and political leaders, professors, and universities.","Aronson, Pamela, Jaffal, Islam","https://doi.org/10.1177/21676968211058513","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Emerging Adulthood;: 21676968211058513, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24066,""
"Mental Health Outcomes of Peer-led Therapeutic Adventure for Military Veterans","Background: Skepticism of therapy and stigma are significant barriers for veterans with mental health issues. Therapeutic adventure shows promise in addressing veteransâ€™ mental health needs while circumventing the stigma many veterans face in initiating treatment. Purpose: Given the small group model of therapeutic adventure programs, such programs may be ideal to provide social support for veterans and reduce mental health symptomology. The present study investigated: can a brief peer-led therapeutic adventure program modify veteransâ€™ mental health symptoms? Methodology/Approach: The study's sample included 56 participants attending one Sierra Club Military Outdoors trip lasting at least three days and two nights and involving camping. Participants completed study measurements assessing depression, anxiety, stress, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms, substance misuse symptoms, and suicidality at pre-trip, post-trip, one-month post trip, six-months post trip, and 12-months post trip. Six-month and 12-month post-trip data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings/Conclusions: Results indicated significant reduction in mental health symptomology from pre-trip to post-trip, but showed few longer-term changes in mental health symptomology. Implications: The present study's findings are consistent with research suggesting improvements in overall psychological well-being immediately following a nature-based intervention and suggest the need for on-going, community-based interventions to support optimally military veteransâ€™ mental health.

"SARS-Cov-2 vaccine in cancer patient: Real life experience in a North West Piedmont spoke hospital","Background: Cancer patients (Pts) present an increased risk of a severe form of SARS-cov-2 disease because of immunodepression status induced by treatments and cancer. National and international organizations recommend vaccination against SARS-cov-2 in this specific population. An efficient vaccination procedure in oncologic Pts is particularly relevant. ASLVC Oncology spoke (North West Piedmont, Italy) includes two hospitals: one in Vercelli and one in Borgosesia. We report here our real life experience about SARS-Cov-2 vaccination in cancer patients, in both hospitals. Material and methods: Hospital Administration approved a local vaccination procedure for cancer pts on April 2021. Medical, nursing and administrative staff of Oncology Unit were trained for the vaccination of their Pts and worked out a specific disclosure. A member of a Voluntary Association welcomed and helped Pts. Each patient benefited from an individual medical examination with an oncologist before the first administration of the vaccine. Medical history, allergy and ongoing treatments were reviewed before administration. Blood tests were performed to every patient treated by chemotherapy. A consent form was signed. Information about Covid-19 status and vaccination were reported in the oncologic medical record. Results: Vaccines used for vaccination were Pfizer- BioNTech according to current guidelines. Two doses were scheduled three to four weeks apart. Since April 26th to May 19th in Vercelli there were 9 injection sessions;115 Pts.were vaccinated: 91 (79%) had first dose and 24 (21%) second;while in Borgosesia 45 Pts were vaccinated, 32 (73%) had first dose and 12 (27%) second. Nobody had acute reaction or serious adverse event, 20 (12.5%) Pts had late and mild adverse events. Most frequently reported adverse event were arm pain, arthralgia, muscle weakness, headache. Only one patient (0.6%) with a history of severe allergic reaction was vaccinated in intensive care. Conclusions: Vaccination against Sars-Cov-2 in cancer Pts is safe and is still ongoing in our hospitals. An appropriate and specific procedure permitted to manage and efficient vaccination in cancer Pts even through chemotherapy.","Posca, T.; Fora, G.; Gasparre, T.; Lattuada, S.; Manachino, D.; Oinino, S.; Torazzo, R.; Virone, D.; De Marino, E.","https://doi.org/10.1177/03008916211041664","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Tumori; 107(2 SUPPL):91, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24068,""

"A research program to provide a comparative contextualized analysis of occupational COVID-19 among health workers: Preliminary insights from a South African-Canadian collaboration","A research program to provide a comparative contextualized analysis of occupational COVID-19 among health workers: Preliminary insights from a South African-Canadian Collaboration. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that healthcare workers (HCWs) in many settings are at high risk of occupational exposure to infectious diseases, especially where attention to occupational protection was lacking. In July 2020 our World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating centres in Canada and South Africa launched a joint Rapid Response Research program in partnership with local government health service delivery agencies in both countries to better understand how local contexts affect policies and practice;scrutinize their respective scientific and contextual rationales as well as outcome;grasp why and how these change over time;and understand organizational factors that enhance implementing resilient policies. Methods The collaboration includes cohort studies, in the Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) region in Canada, and Gauteng province in South Africa respectively, to assess risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs as well as evaluate the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control measures. It also includes a cross-sectional study in Gauteng to explore mental health of HCWs during the pandemic and identify areas for intervention;a quasi-experimental study of the role of information systems in strengthening occupational health services for healthcare workers;and global policy analyses including an analysis of a global survey of HCWs from 161 countries. Results The global survey revealed considerable variations in the degree to which prevention and control measures were deemed adequate;the South African baseline audit of 42 hospitals also revealed considerable variations in implementing occupational health protection. We demonstrated the utility of information systems to assess risk by occupation and setting in VCH;preliminary results of the VCH case-control study demonstrated the feasibility of this design;and, importantly, we identified challenges in leveraging operational research to inform policy, practice and world-knowledge in both VCH and South Africa. Conclusion Our research activities showed the impact of vaccine roll-out and new variants on rates of COVID-19 among HCWs within different healthcare settings and occupational groups and how policies to protect HCWs have evolved (e.g., masking policies and vaccine protocols for HCWs). We conclude that lessons regarding procedural barriers to data acquisition and sharing must be addressed with an ethical framework in mind.","Spiegel, J.

"Association between occupational stress and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers in north-eastern Brazil: A pre-pandemic scenario","Introduction Healthcare workers (HCW) have been reported to be at high risk for several mental health problems due to occupational stress. The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 raised new concerns about the mental health of HCW workers, which may be affected by new demands and the organization of work. Studies comparing pre-and post-pandemic work environments in health settings are necessary to evaluate the effect of the pandemic on HCWs mental health. Objectives We aimed to investigate the association between occupation stress and depressive symptoms among HCW in a city in northeastern Brazil at the end of 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods This is a cross-sectional study with a representative sample of 355 HCW from a city in northeastern Brazil. Occupational stress, based on the demand-control model, was measured by the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), and depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Poisson regressions were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and to analyse associations of interest. Results The prevalence of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 &gt; 9) was 22.4%. Occupational stress was strongly associated with the outcome. In the crude analyses, the prevalence of depression symptoms among workers eposed to high job strain was 3.54 (95% CI: 1.60-6.90) times that of those with low strain. After adjustment for sex, age and income, the prevalence ratio remained highly significant (PR=3.34;95%CI: 1.80-6.18). Conclusions Occupational stress was a strong risk factor for depressive symptoms in a pre-pandemic scenario. The prevalence of depressive symptoms is expected to increase during the pandemic. Assessing occupational stress and depression during follow-up over the next few years may elucidate the impact of the pandemic on work processes and on HCWs mental health.","Helioterio, M.

"Unmasking the truth: A longitudinal study examining workplace protective strategies, working arrangements, and their impact on workers' health, safety and productivity in Newfoundland and Labrador Dur","Introduction Under federal and provincial legislations, employers across Canada have a responsibility to reasonably protect the health and safety of their workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has created many challenges for employers to meet these responsibilities. Employers have been particularly hindered in their efforts to protect their workers due to changing understandings of COVID-19 risks over time. Knowledge of effective public health measures is continuously evolving, with new evidence emerging almost daily. Workplace-led strategies have been designed and implemented to specifically protect workers from exposure to the COVID-19 virus. What we don't know is the unintended long-term consequences these workplace protection measures may be having on workers' health and ability to work safely during the pandemic. Objectives To examine the influences of geographical region, sex and gender, industry, occupation, and perceptions of worker autonomy on the relationship between workplace-led strategies to protect workers from exposure to COVID-19 on measures of worker health safety and productivity. Methods Using a longitudinal survey with a purposive sampling of Newfoundland and Labrador workers at regular intervals over a 12-month period, data were collected across six domains: participant demographics, pandemic-specific workplace policies and practices, working environment (including remote and on-campus work), psychosocial working conditions, physical health and mental health. Results Findings from the baseline, 3 month and 6-month follow-up surveys will be presented. Preliminary results from this work highlight the challenges faced by workers under remote and standard work arrangements and the relationship among these working conditions and impacts on worker health, safety and productivity during the changing nature of work throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion The outcomes from our research will provide new knowledge through the collection of stakeholder perspectives about how current workplace strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 may be having unintentional consequences on worker health and safety.","Cullen, K.; Ford, D.

"Mental health and life satisfaction among canadian paramedics during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Paramedics have treated many patients suspected of having COVID-19 throughout this pandemic. The uncertainty regarding COVID-19 contagion, effectiveness of infection protection and controls, and the uncontrolled environments in which paramedics work may adversely impact their mental health. Objectives To characterize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Canadian paramedics using preliminary data. Methods Self-reported questionnaire data was collected from paramedics across five Canadian provinces as part of the COVID-19 Occupational Risks, Seroprevalence and Immunity among Paramedics (CORSIP) project. Validated screening scores were calculated for major depressive disorder (MDD, PHQ-9 questionnaire) and probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, PC-PTSD-5 questionnaire). Satisfaction with life (SWL) measures were adapted from validated Canadian Census questions and confirmed by reliability analysis. Bivariate relationships of screening scores were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-ranked, Cliff's d, and differences in proportions tests where appropriate. Results Completed questionnaires from 1,906 recruited paramedics were analyzed (95% completion rate). The overall prevalence of MDD was 31.6%. Suicidal ideation (i.e., 'thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way') was reported by 8.3% of paramedics. In addition, 40.2% of paramedics screened positive for probable PTSD, with no significant difference being reported before vs. during the pandemic. Paramedics reported higher median SWL prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (20 vs. 16, p&lt;0.001). There was a large effect size (d=0.52), suggesting a greater probability that paramedics would report higher SWL prior to COVID-19. Conclusion Canadian paramedics appear to be at risk for MDD and PTSD. While the proportion of paramedics with probable PTSD does not appear to have changed during the pandemic, a reduction in SWL was observed. Incorporating follow-up data that will be collected from participants over the next year will be imperative to assess the stability of these findings and evaluate differences by province.","MacDonald, C.; Demers, P.; Grunau, B.; Goldfarb, D.; O'Neill, D.; Armour, R.; Kirkham, T.","https://doi.org/10.1136/OEM-2021-EPI.319","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(SUPPL 1):A117, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24074,""
"A media surveillance analysis of COVID-19 workplace outbreaks in Canada and the United States","Introduction The news media is one of the most accessible sources of information regarding COVID-19 transmission in the workplace in the absence of other occupational data. Only a few public health agencies in Canada and the United States have publically reported detailed occupation information for non-health care worker COVID-19 cases. Objective We conducted a media surveillance analysis to identify new or emerging occupational groups at risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus ('COVID-19 exposure'). Methods We searched the Factiva database for media articles reporting COVID-19 workplace outbreaks (February 1-December 22, 2020). Job titles were coded to the 2016 National Occupational Classification (V1.3) and industries to the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (V3.0). Occupations with COVID-19 workplace transmission identified in media articles were compared and contrasted with the same occupation in the Vancouver School of Economics (VSE) COVID Risk Tool by risk rating (seven categories between very high to very low). Results We identified 1,111 unique COVID-19 workplace outbreaks in the media. After nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates, industrial butchers and meat cutters, poultry preparers and related workers had the most workplace outbreaks reported in the media (n=79) but were rated as medium risk occupations for COVID-19 transmission in the VSE COVID Risk Tool. Outbreaks were also reported in the media among material handlers (n=61) and general farm workers (n=28) but were rated medium-low risk and low risk, respectively. Outbreaks reported in the media among food and beverage services (n=72) and cashiers (n=60) were identified as high risk occupations in the VSE COVID Risk Tool. Conclusion Media surveillance can identify COVID-19 workplace outbreaks and indicate transmission risk. Our results point to key determinants of health that compound the risk of COVID-19 exposure in the workplace, and highlight the importance of collecting occupation data during a pandemic.","Fenton, S.; Peters, C.; Quinn, E.; Rydz, E.; Davies, H.; MacPherson, R.; McLeod, C.; Koehoorn, M.; Heer, E.","https://doi.org/10.1136/OEM-2021-EPI.267","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(SUPPL 1):A99, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24075,""
"Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in health care workers following covid-19: Preliminary results of a two-group cross-sectional study","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has attracted worldwide attention for its rapid and exponential diffusion. The history of past human coronavirus outbreaks resulting in similar health emergencies suggests there will be post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) among COVID-19 survivors. This might add to the increasing stress that health care professionals are enduring. Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and the determinant factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health care workers with COVID-19. Methods A two-group cross-sectional study among health care workers (150 cases of COVID-19 and 150 randomly sampled matched controls) was conducted. We present the preliminary results of 91 cases of COVID-19. Demographic data, occupational information and some psychological dimensions were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Post-traumatic stress disorder was evaluated using the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist based on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Results The average age of the population was 36.5 Â± 9.35 years, with a female predominance and a sex ratio of 0.21. The most represented professional categories were nurses and medical residents. The acute clinical manifestations lasted between 10 to 20 days in 41% of the patients. Moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression were noted among respectively 27.5% and 14% of the population. PTSD was found among 8.8% of the study population. Significant correlations were found between COVID-19-PTSD scores and caring for children or parents (p=10-3), anxiety level (p=10-3), being admitted to the hospital (p=0.008) and the symptoms presented (p=0.003). Conclusion These preliminary results are relevant from a clinical point of view because they suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could be considered as a traumatic event among health care workers. Psychological and organizational interventions to counteract short-and long-term psychopathological effects, consequent to the COVID-19 pandemic, appear to be necessary.","MacHghoul, S.; Hayouni, M.; Makhloufi, M.; Jammeli, I.; Chaari, N.; Hanchi, A.; Akrout, M.; Merchaoui, I.; Rassas, I.","https://doi.org/10.1136/OEM-2021-EPI.207","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(SUPPL 1):A77, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24076,""
"Levels of anxiety and depression and the perceived risk of COVID-19 at work","Introduction Workers who frequently contact to public or provide close-contact service may have higher anxiety and depression levels, as they may be worried about getting infected with the coronavirus at work. Objectives To examine the association of perceived risk of COVID-19 at work (including contact with people and close contact to public) with anxiety and depression levels among non-healthcare worker, taking perceived effectiveness of company's preventive measures into account. Methods This is a multi-city cross-sectional study in Hong Kong, Nanjing and Wuhan. We recruited 7391 non-healthcare workers who were aged&gt;18 during 07/2020-04/2021. We used standardized questionnaire to collect sociodemographic, job-related information and their satisfaction of effectiveness of company's preventive measures. Participants' frequency of contact and close contact to public were collected and classified into occasionally, sometimes and often, and their anxiety and depression levels were measured using DASS-21. We performed multinomial logistic regression models to examine the association of frequency of contact and close contact to public with anxiety and depression levels. Path models were developed to analyze the potential modification of perceived effectiveness of company's preventive measures on these associations. Results Compared with workers with occasional contact to population, workers with sometimes contact were associated with severe anxiety (AOR=1.59, 95%CI=1.27-1.99). The AOR for workers with often close contact to public compared with no contact were 1.53 (95%CI= 1.25-1.87) for severe anxiety, and 1.43 (95%CI=1.14-1.79) for severe depression. Additionally, according to path analysis, the indirect path between contact or close contact to public and anxiety/depression were modified by perceived effectiveness of company's preventive measures. Conclusion Workers with frequent contact with people or close contact to public was associated with worse anxiety and depressive symptoms. Companies should consider effective and sustainable measures in mitigating the risk and thereby reducing employees' anxiety and depression levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yi Lee, P.

"The impact of COVID-19 on diabetes management for adolescents with T1D and their parents","Introduction: For families with type 1 diabetes (T1D), anxiety from the COVID-19 pandemic may be elevated due to potential for increased vulnerability. Objectives: We aimed to describe the impact of the pandemic on adolescents with T1D and their parents. Methods: In a 2-site (Seattle WA, Houston TX USA) clinical trial of a psychosocial intervention targeting stress/resilience, adolescents 13-18 years old with T1D = 1 year and diabetes distress (PAID-T =30) were enrolled with a parent. Using a mixed-methods approach, participants enrolled August 2020-June 2021 completed a survey about the pandemic, including an open-ended question about how COVID impacted T1D management. Survey responses were summarized using frequencies and percentages, and associations between variables were assessed by Chi-squared tests. A1C was extracted from clinical records. Results: Adolescents (n=122) were 56% female, 80% White race, 18% Hispanic, mean A1c = 8.5Â±2.1%. Parents (n=102) were 79% White, 14% Hispanic, 61% college graduate, 67% reporting annual household income =75K USD. 10% of adolescents reported history of COVID-19 infection, 51% had a family member/other important person diagnosed, and 12% had a family member/other important person die from COVID-19 complications. 49% of parents reported loss of job or salary reduction. 29% of adolescents and 33% of parents reported significant struggle to manage T1D during the pandemic (Table 1). Adolescents who reported more difficulty with T1D management were more likely to have A1C = 8%, p&lt;.01. Qualitative themes indicated perceived positive, negative, and neutral effects of the pandemic on: T1D self-care, exercise, food, mental health, telehealth, and motivation. Conclusions: Discussing how the pandemic impacted families' T1D management may be an important focus for clinicians, especially for adolescents with above-target A1C. Strategies to improve resilience for ongoing and future stress may be of value. (Table Presented).","Yi-Frazier, J. P.; O'Donnell, M. B.; Bradford, M.

"A longitudinal study of COVID-19's effects upon the religious group resources, psychosocial resources, and mental health of Orthodox Jews","In this article, we examine how COVID-19 has affected the mental health of Orthodox Jews and how religious resources cushion the effects of isolation and deprivation of religious gatherings over time. Using longitudinal data from the COVID-19 Community Portrait Study, fixed-effects regression models are employed to predict how religious resources are affected by COVID-19 and how mental health is affected by both COVID-19 and religious resources. We find two competing effects upon participants? religious resources. While group resources decreased as a result of the pandemic, psychosocial resources were strengthened. A Closeness-to-God Index predicted lower levels of depression and anxiety, less perceived stress, and less loneliness. Congregational prayer also predicted lower stress and less loneliness, but the magnitude of the effect was smaller. The findings provide empirical support for theoretical frameworks emphasizing the positive effects of religion on mental health and suggest psychosocial resources enable religious coping during particularly challenging times.","Bankier-Karp, Adina Leah, Shain, Michelle","https://doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12770","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24079,""
"Secondary acrocyanosis: Case report","Introduction: Acrocyanosis is a painless condition characterized by discoloration of different shades of blue in the distal parts of the body, marked by symmetry and persistence of color changes exacerbated by cold exposure. It is less common than other acrosyndromes (erythromelalgia, Raynaud's phenomenon, erythema pernio) According to its ethiology could be classified: a) Primary: mostly in young adults. B) Secundy: anorexia nervosa, mitochondrial diseases, neoplasms, connective tissue/rheumatologic disorders, cryoglobulinemia, exposure to drugs among others. We describe a case of secondary acrocyanosis. Clinical case: A 15-year-old boy with atopic dermatitis since childhood, was referred by Dermatology to rule out a possible contact eczema in hands, four months long. In the outpatient allergy office he showed painless cold symmetrical erythematous-violaceous macules affecting fingers and hands that aggravated by cold exposure. There was also local hyperhidrosis on a scaly-itchy base in distal areas of both hands without paroxysmal pallor or chilblains. These symptoms had been more evident a month ago and did not respond to topical corticosteroids and anti-H1. Neurologist had prescribed four weeks before amitriptyline to treat headache. Material and methods: Patch test with the standard series of the Spanish Contact Dermatitis and analysis for acrocyanosis screening were performed. Results: Patch tests with the standard battery: negative. Hemoglobin concentration: 16 g/dl, white blood cell count: 5.000/ mm3, platelet: 182.000/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate: &lt; 10 mm/h. Coagulation, urinalysis, immunoglobulin concentrations, C3, C4: normal. Cryoagglutinins, rheumatoid factor, anti-double stranded DNA antibody (Anti-ds-DNA), anti-cardiolipin and anti-Scl 70 antibodies: absents. COVID-19 RT-PCR-test: negative. Lues, HIV and Hepatitis B, C serologies:negatives. Arterial blood gas: pH: 7.43, PaO2: 113 mmHg, PaCO2: 31 mmHg. Chest radiographs: normal. Amitriptyline treatment was discontinued after suspicion of being the causal agent and 15 days later hands were pink and warm. Conclusions: We report a case of secondary acrocyanosis due to amitriptyline, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. We emphasize the importance of a detailed clinical history to achieve the diagnosis and to verify the reversibility of acrocyanosis when its etiology is due to medication. Physicians should be aware of this possible side effect of tricyclic antidepressants.","Mur Gimeno, P.; Extremera Ortega, A.

"Determinants of the decision to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as exemplified by employees of a long-term health care centre","Health care professionals cover the front line in the battle against infectious diseases. Vaccination of healthcare workers represents a vital element of the strategy for enhancing epidemic safety and improving the quality of health care, inter alia, by limiting microorganism transmission, and reducing patient morbidity and mortality. The study group consisted of all employees of the long-term health care centre in Lublin, Poland. Participants were requested to complete a questionnaire prepared for the purpose of the study, along with a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination interview questionnaire. The vaccination coverage rate for the group of medical workers was 77.3% and of non-medical 86%. The most frequently indicated sources of information on vaccination were the mass media. Males more often than females used the press as a source of information on vaccination. Scientific articles were the most common source of information for both people with higher education and medical professionals. The most common motive for vaccination for females is concern for the health of one's family, and for HCWs and people with at least secondary education-concern for the health of patients. At least one assessed factor influences the decision to be vaccinated. The mass media are of the greatest importance in obtaining information about vaccination.","Tylec, Janiszewska, Siejko, Kucharska","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab395","20211220","behavior; mental health; migration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24083,""
"Elevated serious psychological distress, economic disruption, and the COVID-19 pandemic in the nonmetropolitan American West","In this study we examined the psychological distress, self-rated health, COVID-19 exposure, and economic disruption of a sample of the nonmetropolitan western U.S. population and labor force one year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using novel primary survey data from non-metropolitan counties in the eleven contiguous western United States collected from February 28 until April 3, 2021 (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1203), we descriptively analyzed variables and estimated binomial and multinomial logit models of the association between economic disruption, COVID-19 exposure, self-rated health, and psychological distress. Results showed there was widespread presence of psychological distress, COVID-19 exposure, and economic disruption among the overall sample and members of the labor force. There was extremely high incidence of serious psychological distress (14.8% CI [12.1,17.8] of the weighted sample), which was heightened among the labor force (16.6%, CI [13.0,20.9] of those in the labor force). We found economic disruption was associated with severe psychological distress, but exposure to infection was not. Comparatively, overall self-rated health was at similar levels as prior research and was not significantly associated with economic disruption or COVID-19 exposure. COVID-19, particularly its associated economic effects, had a significant relationship with serious psychological distress in this sample of adults in the nonmetropolitan western United States.","Mueller, Merdjanoff, McConnell, Burow, Farrell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106919","20211220","COVID-19; Economy; Mental Health; Nonmetropolitan America; Self-rated Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24084,""
"Social distancing practice and associated factors in response to COVID-19 pandemic at West Guji Zone, Southern Ethiopia, 2021: A community based cross-sectional study","Curtailing physical contact between individuals reduces transmission and spread of the disease. Social distancing is an accepted and effective strategy to delay the disease spread and reduce the magnitude of outbreaks of pandemic COVID-19. However, no study quantified social distancing practice and associated factors in the current study area. Therefore, the study aimed to assess social distancing practice and associated factors in response to COVID-19 pandemic in West Guji Zone, Southern Ethiopia, 2020. A Community based cross-sectional study design was conducted among randomly selected 410 household members of Bule Hora Town, West Guji Zone. Data were collected by pre-tested interviewer administered structured questionnaire adapted from previous peer reviewed articles. The data were coded and entered in to Epi data version 3.5 and analyzed by SPSS version 23. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions analysis was done to identify factors associated with social distancing practice. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval and p value &lt;0.05 were used to declare statistical significance. Out of 447 planned samples, 410 participants were successfully interviewed and included into final analysis; making the response rate of 91.7%.

"The Sense of Coherence and Subjective Well-Being as Resources of Resilience in the Time of Stressful Situations: COVID-19 Outbreak and Earthquakes","The coronavirus outbreak was labeled a global pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Simultaneously, an earthquake of 5.5 hit Croatia's capital Zagreb. The present study investigated the association between the sense of coherence, subjective well-being, and emotional distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) that people went through while facing an acute stress situation of COVID-19 outbreak and the earthquakes. This cross-sectional study included 1152 subjects. Orientation to Life Questionnaires (OLQ-13), Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) and DASS-21 scale were used in an anonymous online survey which was conducted on 22 March 2020 (the twelfth day of the COVID-19 outbreak in Croatia and the day of the earthquakes in the Capital). The results of the questionnaires were determined by the correlation analysis. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to evaluate the association between the subjective well-being and the sense of coherence on the emotional distress. The sense of coherence correlated positively with subjective well-being (p&lt;0.01) and negatively with all distress domains (p&lt;0.01) as well as subjective well-being (p&lt;0.01). Mild emotional distress was detected. Subjects who experienced the earthquakes showed a significantly higher degree of anxiety (p=0.005) and stress (p=0.003), with significantly decreased the two personal well-being domains: standard of living (p=0.023) and personal safety (p=0.026). Sense of coherence made a major contribution in explaining emotional distress (p&lt;0.001). The results support the importance of improving coping efficiency of the sense of coherence with respect to obtaining an appropriate level of well-being and reducing emotional distress in acute stressful situations.","MatiÃ„â€¡, TakÃ…Â¡iÃ„â€¡, BoÃ…Â¾iÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.639","20211220","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24088,""

"Intervention Effect of Time Management Training on Nurses' Mental Health during the COVID-19 Epidemic","The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has put nurses into a severe test, both physiologically and psychologically. While being required to provide patients with high-quality medical services, nurses also bear the responsibilities and pressures from work, face trauma, disease and even death events, and are thereby more inclined to negative psychological feelings, decline in mental health, and reduction in the quality of their clinical nursing services. Under the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is urgent to carry out related intervention in nurses' psychological crisis. The mental health of 400 nurses from three tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China was assessed from September to December 2020. Then, time management training was conducted for 66 nurses who were voluntarily enrolled in the study. They were divided into the intervention group (35 participants) and the control group (31 participants). After the 16-week intervention, (1) there is a significant decrease in the total SCL-90 score of the intervention group and significant decreases in the scores in the 9 dimensions of the scale, suggesting significant improvement in the mental health level; (2) there is a significant increase in the score of the intervention group in subjective well-being, while there is no significant increase in the control group; (3) There is a significant decrease in the score of the intervention group in work stress reaction, but there is no significant decrease in the control group, and there is a significant increase in the physiological reaction of the control group in the measurement after 8 weeks. It is critical to pay attention to and solve the low mental health level of nurses during the COVID-19 epidemic; Time management training can effectively improve the mental health level of nurses, and it is an effective intervention model to promote nurses' mental health and relieve their work stress.","Sun","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.626","20211220","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24090,""
"Physicians' Reactions to COVID-19: The Results of a Preliminary International Internet Survey","Physicians across the world have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was designed and conducted to assess the emotional and behavioural reactions of physicians to the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey questionnaire using the google forms platform was constructed by the authors. The items in the questionnaire were based on clinical experience, relevant literature review and discussion with peers. A list of issues that were deemed as essential components of the experience of the pandemic relevant to physicians was arrived at. Thereafter these issues were operationalized into question form and hosted on the google forms platform. The link to this questionnaire was circulated by the authors among their peer groups in the month of April 2020. We received 295 responses and 3 were unusable. Most of the responses were from India, the United States of America, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. About 60% of the respondents identified themselves as frontline and had a decade of clinical experience. Most respondents reported being anxious due to the pandemic and also observed the same in their peers and families. A majority also observed changes in behaviour in self and others and advanced a variety of reasons and concerns. A sense of duty was the most commonly employed coping mechanism. Physicians are not immune from information and misinformation, or cues in the environment. Behavioural choices are not always predicted by knowledge but by a combination of knowledge, emotional state, personality and environment. Healthcare settings need to be ready for emergencies and should focus on reducing uncertainty in physicians. These factors may also be gainfully used in the mental health promotion of physicians in COVID-19 care roles.","Aneja, Singh, Singh, Kundi, Singh, Kathiravan, Singh","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.620","20211220","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24091,""
"Assessment of Psychological Responses and Related Factors of Discharged Patients Who Have Been Hospitalized with COVID-19","COVID-19 is the biggest pandemic of the last century. While a large number of cases and mortality rates direct the research to the clinic and prognosis of the disease, the mental health of these patients has recently become a matter of concern. This study aims to predict psychiatric morbidity and possible associated markers in COVID-19 survivors. A total of 102 survivors with COVID-19 infection participated in this study. A questionnaire was applied to the participants to evaluate demographic variables, history of comorbid diseases, smoking, loss of a relative due to COVID-19, and environmental attitudes after the discharge. Length of hospitalization, lung findings, intensive care history and treatments were recorded. Psychiatric morbidities were evaluated with General Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and The National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale. Anxiety was found in 20.6%, depression in 13.7% based on moderate and above levels, 21.6% had significant PTSD. Female gender, history of psychiatric and comorbid diseases, smoking, perceived discrimination, and lack of long-lasting immunity posed a risk in terms of psychological response. There was a negative correlation between age and depression scores. No relation was found between the duration of hospitalization, presence of lung involvement, receiving intensive care treatment, losing a relative due to COVID-19 and psychological response. On patients treated for COVID-19 infection, psychological response continue after discharge. Mental health support and efforts to reduce stigma among infected subjects can reduce the psychological impact caused by the pandemic.","Cansel, Tetik, Demir, Kurt, Evren, YÃƒÂ¼cel","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.611","20211220","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24092,""
"Anxiety, Depression and Influencing Factors of the Elderly Disabled Under the Influence of COVID-19 Outbreak: Evidence from China","The elderly disabled have experienced serious negative emotions during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the causes of anxiety and depression are not clear. This study aims to explore changes in mental states and influencing factors of the elderly disabled under the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 253 cases of elderly disabled in Wuhan, China were selected as the research group and observed from April to June 2020. Another 181 cases of elderly disabled in Yichang, China were observed from April to June 2020 and denoted Group A, while 100 cases of elderly disabled in Wuhan were investigated from August to November 2020 and denoted Group B. Another 100 cases of the elderly without disability were chosen as the control group. The Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) were used. HAMA and HAMD scores of the research group are higher than those of Groups A and B and the control group. HAMA and HAMD scores of Groups A and B are higher than those of the control group (p&lt;0.05). Solitude; pre-existing diseases; no stable and fixed friends; disability level-3 or -4; unmarried, divorced, or widowed; living in Wuhan; COVID-19 are risk factors for developing anxiety and depression in the elderly disabled after multivariate logistics regression (p&lt;0.05).

"Colossal Breed and Backlash of the 'Sesame Street': Brunt of COVID-19 Pandemic in the 'High-Tech' Era of Learning on Children and Adolescents and Suggestions","The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the closure of various academic institutions, leaving online learning the only option for continuity of education and curricular activities among children and adolescents. It is unclear whether the adoption of online learning will persist in the post-pandemic period. However, enhanced exposure to gadgets impacts the socio-emotive-adaptive development of young children. It sprouts various short-term as well as long-term deleterious physical and mental health effects among children and adolescents. Research has focused mainly on the epidemiology, risks modeling, pathophysiology, and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2, but the impact of increased exposure to gadgets and technology due to online learning activity and the ""digital new-norm"" has largely been unnoticed. The enforced/self-quarantine leading to less outdoor activities during this pandemic, may have a cumulative poor health consequence. Early detection and management of those at risk and signs and symptoms of these adverse health effects are important.

"Psychiatria Danubina and Challenges of the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Answer Is in the Knowledge, Empathy, Coherence and Global Ethics","The COVID-19 pandemic crisis is cruel but crucial lesson for the future of humankind. This crisis involves very complex events, complex in its origin, its spread, its effects and its consequences at multiple levels and fields with a big impact on people's mental health. On the other side, the quality of our individual, collective and public mental health is very important for successful fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic and infodemic. For a better public and global mental health we need a common background, common values and virtues on which we agree and follow them. Knowledge, ethics, empathy, coherence, solidarity, cooperation and unity are the key factors to long-term survival and flourishing of humankind. COVID-19 pandemic and infodemic can be effectively overcome only in spirit of common ethic and mutual empathy, respect, trust and public/global cooperation sowing the seeds for humanistic self, compassionate society and empathic civilization, rather than blaming, scapegoating and xenophobia.

"The mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents: Risk and protective factors","The restrictions to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have led to considerable social isolation, posing significant threats to mental health worldwide. The preventive lockdowns may be especially difficult for children and adolescents, who rely extensively on their daily routines and peer connections for stability and optimal development. However, there is a dearth of longitudinal research examining the mental health and daily life impact of the pandemic among children and adolescents. This study addresses this gap by examining the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents' mental health and well-being, and potential risk and protective moderators of mental health change. In the present study, 1,537 Israeli children and adolescents (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 13.97; 52% girls) completed a battery of questionnaires in September 2019; before the COVID-19 outbreak and immediately after an 8-week lockdown period when schools reopened in May 2020. A repeated measures multivariant analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed significantly greater anxiety, depression, and panic symptoms, increases in video game, Internet and TV screen time use, and decreases in positive emotions, life satisfaction, social media use, and peer support during the pandemic. Participants with higher baseline mental health symptoms showed greater symptoms after the lockdown period. Perceived social support and consistent daily routines were found to act as significant protective factors against symptomatology. The results highlight the significant mental health consequences of the pandemic on children and adolescents, and substantiate the significant parents' and peers' roles in children's and adolescents' coping during this global pandemic.

"The roles of resilience, peer relationship, teacher-student relationship on student mental health difficulties during COVID-19","The present cross-sectional study aimed to (a) expand our understanding of the role of risk and resilience factors for adolescent adjustment during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and (b) examine personal resilience, peer and teacher-student relationships as protective factors against mental health difficulties. A total of 3,662 students from 4th to 11th grades in Urumchi, China completed a survey in June 2020. Urumchi is an ethnically diverse city, with nearly 40% of the population in this school district being ethnic minority students. The schools of Urumchi closed in February 2020 and reopened in April 2020. The results of latent moderated structural equation modeling suggested that peer victimization was associated with greater mental health difficulties in students. Personal resilience and teacher-student relationships were promotive factors for better mental health and also served as a buffer from the negative effect of peer victimization on mental health. The results also showed divergent patterns for elementary versus secondary school students as well as gender differences. Implications for how schools can support students during COVID-19 were discussed.

The author adopted the descriptive analytical approach and designed a questionnaire to collect data. The results showed that the consequence of ""concern about losing relatives and friends because of Coronavirus"" was ranked the first. However, the consequence of ""self-harm that may induce suicide due to the social restrictions imposed by home quarantine"" was ranked the last. In addition, the most prominent role of the clinical social worker in addressing this crisis was educating community members about its risks and the relevant social behaviors. Moreover, the most prominent obstacle was lack of training social workers to address this issue. To improve his/her roles, the research recommends presenting courses and workshops to raise the competence of clinical social workers dealing with crises, in general, and Coronavirus, in particular.","Alqahtani","https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2021.2015035","20211220","Clinical social worker; Coronavirus (Covid-19); role; social consequences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24099,""
"Knowledge, perception, and protective measures of Turkish pregnant women towards COVID-19 pandemic and their effects on anxiety levels","The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of pregnant women regarding COVID-19 while evaluating the ability of protective measures and their effects on the level of anxiety during this pandemic. Using a prospective cross-sectional survey, 304 pregnant women attending prenatal polyclinics were included in our study between June 10 and July 10, 2020. The mean age of participants was 29.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. The median gestational week was 25, ranging from 25 to 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of gestation. There was no significant correlation between a gestational week or complicated pregnancy and anxiety. Most participants possessed adequate knowledge and practical skills concerning Covid-19. Women with adequate knowledge were found to be statistically related to a high practice skills score and lower anxiety levels. Good knowledge levels are related to good practice skills and lower anxiety levels. Although pregnancy is not currently considered a risk factor, we believe it is vital to inform pregnant women about COVID-19 since they are naturally prone to mental problems and respiratory infections during pregnancy. Therefore, healthcare professionals should be encouraged to play an active role in this issue, replacing social media, a common source of misinformation for this target demographic.Impact statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant women increased significantly after the declaration of human-to-human transmission and the increasingly rapid spread of COVID-19.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> Pregnant women with good knowledge of COVID-19 were found to have adequate practice skills and lower anxiety levels.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> The act of informing pregnant women is essential in reducing anxiety levels and taking more accurate measures against COVID-19 because high levels of anxiety and depression can have long-term effects on maternal and foetal health. To minimise the potential for information pollution on social media, health professionals must play a more significant role in informing pregnant women and provide evidence-based information to pregnant women about the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy.","Demircan, DemirÃƒÂ§ivi BÃƒÂ¶r","https://doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2021.1990232","20211220","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; anxiety; hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS); knowledge; pregnancy; preventive measures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24100,""
"Building long-term family resilience through universal prevention: 10-year parent and child outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic","As the COVID-19 pandemic has been highly stressful for parents and children, it is clear that strategies that promote long-term family resilience are needed to protect families in future crises. One such strategy, the Family Foundations program, is focused on promoting supportive coparenting at the transition to parenthood. In a randomized trial, we tested the long-term intervention effects of Family Foundations on parent, child, and family well-being one to two months after the imposition of a national shelter-in-place public health intervention in 2020. We used regression models to test intervention impact on outcomes reported on by parents in a standard questionnaire format and a series of 8Ã‚Â days of daily reports. We also tested moderation of intervention impact by parent depression and coparenting relationship quality. Relative to control families, intervention families demonstrated significantly lower levels of individual and family problems (general parent hostility, harsh and aggressive parenting, coparenting conflict, sibling relationship conflict, and children's negative mood and behavior problems), and higher levels of positive family relationship quality (positive parenting, couple relationship quality, sibling relations, and family cohesion). For some outcomes, including coparenting conflict, harsh parenting, and child behavior problems, intervention effects were larger for more vulnerable families-that is, families with higher pre-pandemic levels of parent depression or lower levels of coparenting relationship quality. We conclude that targeted family prevention programming is able to promote healthy parent and child functioning during unforeseen future periods of acute stress. The long-term benefits of a universal approach to family support at the transition to parenthood indicate the need for greater investment in the dissemination of effective approaches. Dado que la pandemia de COVID-19 ha sido muy estresante para padres e hijos, estÃƒÂ¡ claro que se necesitan estrategias que promuevan la resiliencia familiar a largo plazo para proteger a las familias en crisis futuras. Una de esas estrategias, el programa Family Foundations, se centra en promover la crianza compartida de apoyo en la transiciÃƒÂ³n a la paternidad. En un ensayo aleatorizado, probamos los efectos de la intervenciÃƒÂ³n a largo plazo de Family Foundations en el bienestar de los padres, el niÃƒÂ±o y la familia uno o dos meses despuÃƒÂ©s de la imposiciÃƒÂ³n de una intervenciÃƒÂ³n nacional de salud pÃƒÂºblica de refugio en el lugar en 2020. Usamos modelos de regresiÃƒÂ³n para evaluar el impacto de la intervenciÃƒÂ³n en los resultados informados por los padres en un formato de cuestionario estÃƒÂ¡ndar y una serie de 8 dÃƒÂ­as de informes diarios. TambiÃƒÂ©n probamos la moderaciÃƒÂ³n del impacto de la intervenciÃƒÂ³n por la depresiÃƒÂ³n de los padres y la calidad de la relaciÃƒÂ³n de coparentalidad. En relaciÃƒÂ³n con las familias de control, las familias de intervenciÃƒÂ³n demostraron niveles significativamente mÃƒÂ¡s bajos de problemas individuales y familiares (hostilidad general de los padres, crianza dura y agresiva, conflicto de crianza conjunta, conflicto de relaciones entre hermanos y problemas de comportamiento y estado de ÃƒÂ¡nimo negativos de los niÃƒÂ±os) y niveles mÃƒÂ¡s altos de calidad de relaciÃƒÂ³n familiar positiva (crianza positiva, calidad de la relaciÃƒÂ³n de pareja, relaciones entre hermanos y cohesiÃƒÂ³n familiar). Para algunos resultados, incluido el conflicto de crianza compartida, la crianza severa y los problemas de comportamiento infantil, los efectos de la intervenciÃƒÂ³n fueron mayores para las familias mÃƒÂ¡s vulnerables, es decir, familias con niveles mÃƒÂ¡s altos de depresiÃƒÂ³n de los padres prepandÃƒÂ©micos o niveles mÃƒÂ¡s bajos de calidad de la relaciÃƒÂ³n de crianza compartida. Concluimos que los programas de prevenciÃƒÂ³n familiar especÃƒÂ­ficos pueden promover el funcionamiento saludable de padres e hijos durante perÃƒÂ­odos futuros imprevistos de estrÃƒÂ©s agudo. Los beneficios a largo plazo de un enfoque universal del apoyo familiar en la transiciÃƒÂ³n a la paternidad indican la necesidad de una mayor inversiÃƒÂ³n en la difusiÃƒÂ³n de enfoques eficaces.

"Changes in stroke rehabilitation during the SARS-CoV-2 shutdown in Switzerland","Many stroke survivors require continuous outpatient rehabilitation therapy to maintain or improve their neurological functioning, independence, and quality of life. In Switzerland and many other countries, the shutdown to contain SARS-CoV-2 infections led to mobility restrictions and a decrease in therapy delivery. This study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on stroke survivors' access to therapy, physical activity, functioning and mood. A prospective observational cohort study in stroke subjects. At 4 time-points (before, during, after the shutdown, and at 3-month follow-up), the amount of therapy, physical activities, motor function, anxiety, and depression were assessed. Thirty-six community-dwelling stroke subjects (median 70 years of age, 10 months post-stroke) were enrolled. Therapy reductions related to the shutdown were reported in 72% of subjects. This decrease was associated with significantly extended sedentary time and minimal deterioration in physical activity during the shutdown. Both parameters improved between reopening and 3-month follow-up. Depressive symptoms increased slightly during the observation period. Patients more frequently reported on self-directed training during shutdown. The COVID-19 shutdown had measurable immediate, but no persistent, effects on post-stroke outcomes, except for depression. Importantly, a 2-month reduction in therapy may trigger improvements when therapy is fully re-initiated thereafter.","Held, Schwarz, Pohl, ThÃƒÂ¼rlimann, Porrtmann, Branscheidt, Fratian, Van Duinen, Veerbeek, Luft","https://doi.org/10.2340/jrm.v53.1118","20211220","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24102,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic as experienced by adults with congenital heart disease from Belgium, Norway, and South Korea: impact on life domains, patient-reported outcomes, and experiences with care","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses significant challenges to many groups within societies, and especially for people with chronic health conditions. It is, however, unknown whether and how the pandemic has thus far affected the physical and mental health of patient populations. Therefore, we investigated how the pandemic affected the lives of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD), compared pre- and peri-pandemic patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and a patient-reported experience measure (PREM), and investigated whether having had COVID-19 impacted pre-/peri-pandemic differences of the PROMs and PREM. As part of the ongoing APPROACH-IS II project, we longitudinally surveyed 716 adults with CHD from Belgium, Norway, and South Korea. Pre-pandemic measures were administered from August 2019 to February 2020 and the peri-pandemic surveys were completed September 2020-April 2021. The majority of patients indicated that their social lives (80%), mental health (58%), and professional lives/education (51%) were negatively impacted by the pandemic. Patients felt worried (65%), were afraid (55%), reported the pandemic felt 'close' to them (53%), and were stressed (52%). However, differences between pre- and peri-pandemic scores on the PROMs and PREM were negligibly small (Cohen's d &lt; 0.20). Across measures, 5.8-15.8% of patients demonstrated changes (improved or worsened scores) that exceeded the minimal clinically important difference. There were no difference-in-differences for PROMs and PREM between patients who did vs. did not have COVID-19. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has been disruptive in many ways, pre- to peri-pandemic changes in PROMs and PREM of adults with CHD were negligibly small.","Moons, Goossens, Luyckx, Kovacs, Andresen, Moon, Van De Bruaene, Rassart, Van Bulck, Budts, Goossens, Luyckx, Moons, Rassart, Van Bulck, Van De Bruaene, Andresen, Eriksen, Estensen, Moon","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjcn/zvab120","20211220","COVID-19; Depression; Heart defect congenital; Pandemic; Patient-reported outcomes; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24103,""
"Perceptions of Telehealth Physical Therapy Among Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain","<b>Background:</b> Coronavirus disease 2019 prompted the rapid adoption of telehealth to provide physical therapy. Patients' perceptions about telehealth physical therapy are mostly unknown. This study describes perceptions of telehealth physical therapy among patients with chronic low back pain (LBP). <b>Methods:</b> This study surveyed participants in an ongoing multisite clinical trial of nonpharmacological LBP treatments. Participants were asked about their willingness to use telehealth for physical therapy and with other providers and completed the PROMIS-29. <b>Results:</b> Surveys were received from 102 participants (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°48.5 [standard deviation; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.6]). Thirty-six (35.3%) expressed willingness to receive telehealth physical therapy, 22 were neutral (21.6%), and 44 were unwilling (43.1%). The percentage expressing willingness for telehealth physical therapy was lower than it was for family medicine (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) or mental health (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"Young People's Use of Digital Tools to Support Their Mental Health During Covid-19 Restrictions","Young adulthood represents a sensitive period for young people's mental health. The lockdown restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced young people's access to traditional sources of mental health support. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the online resources young people were using to support their mental health during the first lockdown period in Ireland. It made use of an anonymous online survey targeted at young people aged 18-25. Participants were recruited using ads on social media including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and SnapChat. A total of 393 respondents completed the survey. Many of the respondents indicated that they were using social media (51.4%, 202/393) and mental health apps (32.6%, 128/393) as sources of support. Fewer were making use of formal online resources such as charities (26%, 102/393) or professional counseling services (13.2%, 52/393). Different social media platforms were used for different purposes; Facebook was used for support groups whilst Instagram was used to engage with influencers who focused on mental health issues. Google search, recommendations from peers and prior knowledge of services played a role in how resources were located. Findings from this survey indicate that digital technologies and online resources have an important role to play in supporting young people's mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted these digital tool's potential as well as how they can be improved to better meet young people's needs.","Pretorius, Coyle","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.763876","20211220","COVID-19; help-seeking; isolation; mental health; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24105,""

"Transportation in the Mediterranean during the COVID-19 pandemic era","The recent pandemic has considerably changed urban transportation while highlighting the weaknesses of the current transport modes. The crisis provided a unique opportunity to redesign the urban mobility plans in a more sustainable and resilient way. This study captured the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent restrictive measures on citizens' commuting habits and travel mode choice in two Cretan cities with academic communities and intense seasonality of tourism, in two phases (four periods) before, during, and after the quarantine. The sample consisted of 308 (1st phase) and 193 (2nd phase) citizens, 60% and 30% permanent residents of Chania and Rethymno, respectively. During the weeks before the pandemic, 4/10 participants opted for travelling by car daily, either as a driver or as a passenger; almost the same ratio chose walking; 1/10 used public transport (bus). During the first week of the quarantine, one-quarter had decreased car usage and opted for sustainable transport modes (walking, cycling, public transport). The population who chose walking 1-2 times weekly almost doubled. Nevertheless, most factors were found to affect men and women differently; personal safety and road safety are significantly more important for women; ecological footprint is a less essential parameter for men's travel mode choice. Private vehicle use still holds a considerable role in urban transportation, and noteworthy is due to the sharp decline in public transit in January-February and April and the meager percentage of public transport ridership (1%). The analysis and modelling could be useful in the future design of more sustainable and resilient mobility strategies.","Tarasi, Daras, Tournaki, Tsoutsos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.glt.2020.12.003","20211220","COVID-19; Daily commuting; Public transport; Sustainable mobility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24107,""
"Effects of test timing and isolation length to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection associated with airplane travel, as determined by infectious disease dynamics modeling","Effective measures to reduce the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in overseas travelers are urgently needed. However, the effectiveness of current testing and isolation protocols is not yet fully understood. Here, we examined how the timing of testing and the number of tests conducted affect the spread of COVID-19 infection associated with airplane travel. We used two mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics to examine how different test protocols changed the density of infected individuals traveling by airplane and entering another country. We found that the timing of testing markedly affected the spread of COVID-19 infection. A single test conducted on the day before departure was the most effective at reducing the density of infected individuals travelling; this effectiveness decreased with increasing time before departure. After arrival, immediate testing was found to overlook individuals infected on the airplane. With respect to preventing infected individuals from entering the destination country, isolation with a single test on day 7 or 8 after arrival was comparable with isolation only for 11 or 14 days, respectively, depending on the model used, indicating that isolation length can be shortened with appropriately timed testing.","Kamo, Murakami, Imoto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2021.100199","20211220","COVID-19; Continuous time model; Discrete time model; Effectiveness of isolation and testing; Infectious disease dynamics; Infectious disease risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24108,""
"Wearing time and respiratory volume affect the filtration efficiency of masks against aerosols at different sizes","Face masks are critical in preventing the spread of respiratory infections including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Different types of masks have distinct filtration efficiencies (FEs) with differential costs and supplies. Here we reported the impact of breathing volume and wearing time on the inward and outward FEs of four different mask types (N95, surgical, single-use, and cloth masks) against various sizes of aerosols. Specifically 1) Mask type was an important factor affecting the FEs. The FEs of N95 and surgical mask were better than those of single-use mask and cloth mask; 2) As particle size decreased, the FEs tended to reduce. The trend was significantly observed in FEs of aerosols with particle size &lt; <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mspace/> <mml:mi>ÃŽÂ¼</mml:mi> <mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow> </mml:math> ; 3) After wearing N95 and surgical masks for 0, 2, 4, and 8 h, their FEs (%) maintained from 95.75Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 0.09 to 100Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 0 range. While a significant decrease in FEs were noticed for single-use masks worn for 8 h and cloth masks worn &gt;2 h under deep breathing (30 L/min); 4) Both inward and outward FEs of N95 and surgical masks were similar, while the outward FEs of single-use and cloth masks were higher than their inward FEs; 5) The FEs under deep breathing was significantly lower than normal breathing with aerosol particle size Ã‚Â¡1 <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mi>ÃŽÂ¼</mml:mi></mml:math> m. In conclusion, our results revealed that masks have a critical role in preventing the spread of aerosol particles by filtering inhalation, and FEs significantly decreased with the increasing of respiratory volume and wearing time. Deep breathing may cause increasing humidity and hence decrease FEs by increasing the airflow pressure. With the increase of wearing time, the adsorption capacity of the filter material tends to be saturated, which may reduce <i>FEs</i> Findings may be used to provide information for policies regarding the proper use of masks for general public in current and future pandemics.","Li, Ding, Deng, Mao, Zhou, Ding, Wang, Luo, Zhou, MacIntyre, Tang, Xu, Shi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.102165","20211220","COVID-19; Face covering; Inward protection; Outward protection; Particle size distribution; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24109,""

Every 1 h decrease in sleep time was associated with a 0.12-point increase in depression score. <b>Conclusion:</b> Myopia was associated with anxiety and anxiety scores. The greater the degree of myopia, the higher the anxiety score. However, myopia was not found to be associated with depression. The results highlight the importance of providing psychological support to students with myopia during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Gao, Zhu, Zhu, Dang, Wei, Yan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.774237","20211220","anxiety; depression; epidemiology; myopia; psychological health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24110,""
"Appropriate Strategies for Reducing the Negative Impact of Online Reports of Suicide and Public Opinion From Social Media in China","Suicide events may have a negative impact on all of society. The media plays a significant role in suicide prevention. Therefore, the aims of this study are (a) to understand the association between characteristics of suicide events and characteristics of who committed suicide, and event impact indexes (EIIs) of suicide reported on the internet; (b) to analyze violation of recommendations for reporting suicide by Weibo, and (c) to investigate the effect of online reports of suicide on public opinion. We carried out a content analysis of online reports of suicide. This study analyzed 113 suicide events, 300 news reports of suicide, and 2,654 Weibo comments about suicide collected from the WeiboReach between 2015 and 2020. We used a <i>t</i>-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to explore the potential factors associated with the EIIs of suicide events. The results found that (a) The suicide events reported on the internet during COVID-19 and those related to celebrities and students tend to have higher EIIs; (b) suicide reports on Weibo frequently violated WHO recommendations for suicide reporting in the media; and (c) public opinion of suicide reporting in the online media was mostly emotional and irrational, which is not beneficial for public mental health and suicide prevention. In conclusion, first, the situation of many people working from home or studying from home and spreading more time online during COVID-19 may lead to suicide events obtain more public attention. Online media could further improve public responsible reporting and daily media-content surveillance, especially taking particular care in those suicide events during COVID-19, and related to celebrities and students, which may have a higher event impact on the internet. Second, health managers should regular assessment of observance of the WHO recommendations for suicide reporting by online social media to prevent suicide. Third, health communication managers should use big data to identify, assess, and manage harmful information about suicide; and track anyone affected by suicide-related reports on social media to reduce the negative impact of public opinion to intervene suicide in the early stage of suicide.","Chu, Li, Lin, Cai, Li, Chen, Zhang, Man, Lee, Chiang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.756360","20211220","China; negative impact; online media; public opinion; suicide reporting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24111,""
"Clusters of COVID-19 protective and risky behaviors and their associations with pandemic, socio-demographic, and mental health factors in the United States","Individual behaviors are critical for preventing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Given that both protective <i>and</i> risky behaviors influence risk of infection, it is critical that we understand how such behaviors cluster together and in whom. Using a data-driven approach, we identified clusters of COVID-19-related protective and risky behaviors and examined associations with socio-demographic, pandemic, and mental health factors. Data came from a cross-sectional online U.S. nationwide study of 832 adults with high levels of pre-pandemic trauma. Latent class analysis was performed with ten protective (e.g., washing hands, wearing masks) and eight risky (e.g., attending indoor restaurants, taking a flight) behaviors for COVID-19. Then, we examined distributions of socio-demographic and pandemic factors across behavior classes using ANOVA or Chi-square tests, and associations between mental health factors (depressive, anxiety, posttraumatic stress symptoms) and behavior classes using multinomial logistic regression. We identified four classes, including three classes with relatively low risky but high (28.8%), moderate (33.5%) and minimal (25.5%) protective behaviors and one high risky behaviors class with associated moderate protective behaviors (12.1%). Age, sexual orientation, political preference, and most pandemic factors differed significantly across behavior classes. Anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms, but not depression, were higher in the High Risk, but also Highly and Moderately Protective classes, relative to Minimally Protective. Prevention and intervention efforts should examine constellations of protective and risky behaviors to comprehensively understand risk, and consider current anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms as potential risk indicators.","Nishimi, Borsari, Marx, Rosen, Cohen, Woodward, Maven, Tripp, Jiha, Woolley, Neylan, O'Donovan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101671","20211220","ANOVA, analysis of variance; AWE, Approximate Weight of Evidence Criterion; AvePP, average posterior class probability; BF, Bayes Factors; BIC, Bayesian Information Criterion; COVID-19; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; DASS, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; LCA, latent class analysis; Latent class analysis; Mental health; OCC, odds of correct classification; PTSD Checklist-5, PCL-5; PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder; Protective behaviors; Risky behaviors; cAIC, consistent Akaike's Information Criterion; mcaP, modal class assignment proportion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24112,""
"Acupressure: An Effective and Feasible Alternative Treatment for Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Anxiety is highly reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of acupressure for anxiety is a common practice in integrative medicine, and previous literature has shown that acupressure can be an effective and feasible alternative treatment for decreasing anxiety. Given the social distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears reasonable to assume that acupressure may be especially suited to treat anxiety under these circumstances. However, there has been relatively little reported use of acupressure for anxiety during the pandemic. This viewpoint aims to highlight the possible role of acupressure as a self-administered therapeutic approach for anxiety amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and to outline key areas for future research.","Yang, Do, Mallory, Wahner-Roedler, Chon, Bauer","https://doi.org/10.1177/21649561211058076","20211220","COVID-19; Tuina; acupressure; anxiety; mental health disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24113,""
"Are medical students equipped for digital studies?Have their hopes and fears been confirmed during Covid-19? What should we consider in the future?","Digitisation in the education of future doctors was still in its infancy before the Covid pandemic. For the successful implementation of digital teaching, students need the technical equipment and the necessary skills to use it in a meaningful way. Furthermore, it requires a willingness to adapt the learning environment and to take responsibility for self-directed learning. At the beginning of 2020, faculties were forced to convert all teaching to digital formats. Initial research shows that students prefer face-to-face teaching. To determine whether medical students were prepared for digital studies and what should be considered for the future, we analysed surveys at the beginning of online studies and after two Corona semesters at a medical faculty. We were able to show that although our students had good technology equipment, they had a rather negative attitude towards online teaching for various reasons and developed negative emotions. Deficits in design of educational material, and personal learning habits raised concern. A lack of guidance and a lack of interaction with fellow students contributed to this. Adjustments in these areas will be necessary in the future to provide students with positive access to digital studies and thus increase learning success.","Herbstreit, Gestmann, Szalai, Diehl","https://doi.org/10.1080/21614083.2021.2014098","20211220","Digital teaching; covid-19; interaction with fellow students; self-learning responsibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24114,""
"COVID-19 Infection - the Possibility to Involve Oxygen as Immunogen in the ARDS Determinism (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)","Since its onset, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has manifested multiple paradoxes related to both complications of the infection and treatment resistance. The experiences in therapy started from the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and anti-cytokine therapy (anti IL-6, anti-TNF-alpha and CCR5) up to experiments of immunomodulation with glucocorticoids and proposal of very powerful immunomodulatory drugs like cyclophosphamide in optimized diagrams in order to induce the depression of the immune hyperergic reaction with the maintenance of TH and TC lymphocyte resistance to keep the anti-viral activity in the absence of an etiological treatment. In this context, also the second major immunologic mechanism could function: the molecular mimicry - cross-reactivity between viral epitopes and various antigenic determinants from the body, other than the tissue structures of the respiratory system. In a similar manner, in the past, genital staphylococcal infections among women wearing tampons, sometimes generated a toxic-septic shock with an unexpected evolution to death. It is also about an atypical cytokine storm, generated by the staphylococcal toxins (super-antigenic) but probably, the aggressiveness was also generated by the cross reactivity with chemical antigens from the cotton fibers, because this disorder generally appeared among women in the menstrual period, sometimes the local genital infection being minor. Moreover, with the lapse of time, the reaction of shock no longer appeared, probable through the increase of immunologic tolerance to cotton fibers. In a similar manner, in COVID-19 a reaction of hyper-sensitivity to a gaseous antigen could overlap, considering the decrease of tolerance at the invasive administration of oxygen (the contact with BALT - the lymphatic system associated to the bronchia, where the resident macrophage is the siderophage) and partial maintenance at the non-invasive administration through mask or extracorporeal, which induces the first contact with the lymphatic elements associated to the oropharyngeal cavity or blood, where the siderophage can no longer be observed. In this context, some adult patients with COVID-19 could manifest an immunologic genetic defect of TS at BALT level, as women with staphylococcal toxic-septic shock had a local defect at the VALT level (lymphatic tissue associated with the genital tract). In children, the syndrome is rare and more multisystem, which rather suggests the breaking of central tolerance through the lack of intra-thymus or intra-medullary deletion of the auto-reactive clones of (Th TC), while among adults the defect seems to be more peripheral, local, with the involvement of TS and resident macrophages (siderophages). This could explain not only the higher level of severity in elder patients and those with cardiac disorders but also the rarity of the pathology in patients aged under nine years.","Ghimpu","https://doi.org/10.26574/maedica.2020.16.3.507","20211220","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24115,""
"The Impact of Coping Skills in Post-traumatic Growth of Healthcare Providers: When Mental Health Is Deteriorating Due to COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Frontline healthcare providers are consistently exposed to potentially traumatic events while assisting patients with COVID-19. Post-traumatic growth (PTG) happens when a person can transform trauma and use adversity in one's advantage. In response to limited studies on positive outcomes that may occur from the pandemic; this study aimed to elucidate the positive impact of coping with COVID-19 outbreak on mental health, such as PTG. <b>Methodology:</b> The study comprised a sample of 691 healthcare providers 59% female, including physicians (<i>n</i> = 138) and nurses (<i>n</i> = 550), working in public health facilities in Kosovo, with an average age of 41.6 years (<i>SD</i> = 10.79). They were asked to complete a questionnaire with four parts: Socio-demographic, GHQ-28, COPE and PTGI. A deterioration of mental health with somatic symptoms leading to the escalation due to COVID-19 outbreak was found. <b>Results:</b> Female healthcare providers reported more clinical symptoms as well as higher coping skills scores than men. The domains in which positive changes were most frequently observed were Relating to Others, New Possibilities and Personal Strength. There was no significant direct effect of mental health on PTG in the mediation model, though a significant indirect effect was observed for coping skills. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results suggest that levels of mental health exacerbation do not play a conclusive role in determining levels of PTG, as long coping mechanisms are in place. The development and implementation of interventions to minimize COVID-19-related mental health consequences, by fostering PTG among healthcare providers could be highly beneficial in pandemic response work.","Prekazi, Hajrullahu, Bahtiri, Kryeziu, Hyseni, Taganoviq, Gallopeni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.791568","20211220","COVID-19; coping; healthcare providers; mental health; post-traumatic growth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24116,""
"Developing a Brief Tele-Psychotherapy Model for COVID-19 Patients and Their Family Members","<b>Objective:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting the mental health of COVID-19 patients and family members. Given the restrictions limiting in person contact to reduce the spread of the virus, a digital approach is needed to tackle the psychological aftermath of the pandemic. We present the development of a brief remote psychotherapy program for COVID-19 patients and/or their relatives. <b>Methods:</b> We first reviewed the literature on psychotherapeutic interventions for COVID-19 related symptoms. Based on this evidence, we leveraged ongoing clinical experiences with COVID-19 survivors and family members to design an intervention model that could be disseminated and integrated into the workflow of the mental health system. <b>Results:</b> This 8-session model -inspired by constructivist and hermeneutic-phenomenological therapies- serves COVID-19 patients during hospitalization, remission and recovery. This model can also be delivered to people dealing with the COVID-19 hospitalization/discharge of a family member, or the loss of a family member due to COVID-19. <b>Conclusion:</b> We described a remote psychotherapeutic approach to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic psychological aftermath.

"My Health Too: Investigating the Feasibility and the Acceptability of an Internet-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Program Developed for Healthcare Workers","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 crisis has had a considerable mental health impact on healthcare workers. High levels of psychological distress are expected to have a significant impact on healthcare systems, warranting the need for evidence-based psychological interventions targeting stress and fostering resilience in this population. Online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has proved to be effective in targeting stress and promoting resilience. However, online CBT programs targeting stress in healthcare workers are lacking. <b>Objective:</b> The aim of our study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an internet-based CBT intervention, the <i>My Health Too</i> program we developed during the first COVID-19 epidemic peak in France. <b>Methods:</b> We recruited 10 participants among Alsace region hospital staff during the first peak of the pandemic in France. They were given 1 week to test the website and were then asked to answer an internet survey and a semi-structured phone interview. <b>Results:</b> We conducted a thematic analysis of the content from the phone interviews. Major themes were identified, discussed and coded: the technical aspects, the content of the website and its impact on participants' emotions and everyday life. Overall, the participants reported finding the website easy to use and interactive. They described the resources as easy to understand, readily usable, and useful in inducing calm and in helping them practice self-compassion. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results suggest that the <i>My Health Too</i> online CBT program is highly feasible and acceptable to healthcare workers during the highly stressful times of the pandemic peak.

"Improving Healthcare Worker Resilience and Well-Being During COVID-19 Using a Self-Directed E-Learning Intervention","<b>Introduction:</b> High rates of burnout, depression, anxiety, and insomnia in healthcare workers responding to the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported globally. <b>Methods:</b> Responding to the crisis, the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) developed an e-learning course to support healthcare worker well-being and resilience. A self-paced, asynchronous learning model was used as the training intervention. Each module included practical, skill-building activities. An outcome evaluation was conducted to determine if completing the course improved healthcare worker knowledge of and confidence in the learning outcomes of the course, their use of resilience-building behaviours, their resilience, and their well-being. A secondary objective was to explore if there were any associations between behaviours, resilience, and well-being. Participants completed pre- and post-course questionnaires to measure knowledge of and confidence in the learning outcomes, y, frequency of self-reported resilience-building behaviours, and levels of resilience (CD-RISC) and well-being (WHO-5). Results were analysed in STATA using paired <i>T</i>-tests, univariate and multivariate linear regression models. <b>Results:</b> Participants (<i>n</i> = 474; 77.6% female; 55.7% primary care) exhibited significant increases in knowledge, confidence, resilience-building behaviour, resilience, and well-being scores. Statistically significant improvements in the frequency of resilience-building behaviours led to significant improvements in resilience (0.25 points; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.43) and well-being (0.21 points; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.36). Increasing changes in well-being scores had a positive effect on change in resilience scores (ÃŽÂ² = 0.20; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.29), and vice versa (ÃŽÂ² = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.41). <b>Conclusion:</b> A healthcare worker e-learning course can build knowledge and skills that may prompt changes in resilience-building behaviours and improvements in well-being and resilience scores. The findings suggest that e-learning courses may improve more than competency-based outcomes alone but further research is warranted to further explore these relationships.","Kelly, Uys, Bezuidenhout, Mullane, Bristol","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.748133","20211220","COVID-19; continuing professional development; e-learning; healthcare worker; mental health; resilience; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24119,""

This study aimed to test the series mediation model triggered by childhood trauma, in which perceived psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic and sleep quality mediated the path sequentially and led to adverse mental health outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional design involving 817 participants were enrolled <i>via</i> WeChat online survey. Participants completed questionnaires, including demographic features, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Pearson correlations and hierarchical multiple linear regression were employed to examine the association of childhood trauma and psychological stress of COVID-19, sleep quality, and mental health status. In addition, a series mediate analysis was carried out to examine sequence mediating effects of psychological impact of COVID-19 and sleep quality between childhood trauma and mental health status. <b>Results:</b> The results showed that childhood trauma is positively and significantly related to psychological distress of COVID-19 pandemic, sleep quality, and mental health status (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis shown that demographic features explained 4.4, 2.1, and 4.0% of the total variance in DASS-21, IES-R, and PSQI total scale scores, respectively. Adding childhood trauma significantly increased the model variance of DASS-21 (ÃŽâ€<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.129, <i>F</i> = 126.092, <i>p</i> = 0.000), IES-R (ÃŽâ€<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.062, <i>F</i> = 54.771, <i>p</i> = 0.000), and PSQI total scale scores (ÃŽâ€<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.055, <i>F</i> = 48.733, <i>p</i> = 0.000), respectively. Moreover, the series mediation model showed that the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and sleep quality were sequential mediators between childhood trauma and mental health status (proportion explained: 49.17%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Amid the ravages of COVID-19, childhood trauma predicts poor mental health status, in part because of greater psychological impact related to COVID-19 and poorer global sleep quality.

Our study estimated the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder and insomnia among the residents of the informal settlements of Dhaka, Bangladesh, during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional phone-based survey was conducted from October to November 2020 among adult residents of five informal settlements of Dhaka city randomly chosen from an existing Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (UHDSS) run by icddr,b. Data on Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were collected. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to assess the associated factors of anxiety and insomnia. <b>Results:</b> Of the total 586 participants, the prevalence of mild to severe anxiety and insomnia were 53% and 43%, respectively. As per the multinomial regression analysis, participants with mild anxiety were significantly more likely to be older (&gt;50 years) and afraid of COVID-19 infection. Likewise, participants with moderate/severe anxiety were significantly more likely to share less household facilities (e.g., toilet, kitchen, water) (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.31-3.79), to have difficulties in food availability (OR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.10-6.93), to be afraid of self (OR: 5.27; 95% CI: 2.82-9.88), and to worry about the family members (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.23-4.17) getting infected. Participants with mild insomnia were significantly more likely to share fewer household facilities and be afraid of being infected with COVID-19 infection. Moreover, participants with moderate/severe insomnia were significantly more likely to be female (OR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.02-3.56), to receive food aid (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.29-0.88), to be afraid of self (OR: 3.85; 95% CI: 1.81-8.19), and to worry about someone like friends or neighbors (OR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.07-5.58) getting infected with COVID-19. <b>Conclusions:</b> We found elevated prevalence of both anxiety and insomnia among the urban poor of Bangladesh in the context of COVID-19.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the General Mental Health in Sweden: No Observed Changes in the Dispensed Amount of Common Psychotropic Medications in the Region of Scania","Some first investigations have focused on the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the general mental health after its outbreak in 2020. According to multiple self-reporting surveys, symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression have risen worldwide. Even some studies based on health care records start to be published, providing more objective and statistically reliable results. Additionally, concerns have been raised, to what extend the access to mental health care has been compromised by the COVID-19 outbreak. The aim of this study was to detect changes in prescription trends of common psychotropic medications in the Swedish region of Scania. The monthly dispensed amounts of selected pharmaceuticals were compared from January 2018 until January 2021, regarding the prescription trends before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. Using an interrupted time series analysis for each medication, no general trend changes were observed. On the one hand, a possible deterioration of the general mental health could not be confirmed by these results. On the other hand, the access to mental health care did not seem to be impaired by the pandemic. When interpreting findings related to the COVID-19 pandemic, regional differences and country-specific approaches for coping with the pandemic should be considered. The Swedish population, for instance, never experienced a full ""lock-down"" and within Sweden the time point of the outbreak waves differed regionally. In general, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health are still unclear and need to be investigated further in an international comparison.","Wolfschlag, Grudet, HÃƒÂ¥kansson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.731297","20211220","COVID-19; antidepressants; anxiety; benzodiazepines; interrupted time series analysis; prescription trends; psychotropic medication; public mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24123,""
"Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children's Mental Health: A Meta-Analysis","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health problems in many individuals, including children. Children with pre-existing socio-demographic or developmental risk factors may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of the pandemic and associated public health preventive measures. <b>Objective:</b> This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children aged 5-13 years-old, while highlighting the specific difficulties experienced by children with neurodevelopmental issues or chronic health conditions. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic search of the published literature was conducted in Medline, ERIC, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, followed by a quantitative meta-analysis of the eligible studies. <b>Results:</b> Out of the 985 articles identified, 28 empirical studies with prospective or retrospective longitudinal data were included in the quantitative synthesis. COVID-19 lockdown measures were associated with negative general mental health outcomes among children (<i>g</i> = 0.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, and <i>k</i> = 21), but of small magnitude. Sleep habits were also changed during the pandemic, as sleep duration significantly increased in children (<i>g</i> = 0.32; <i>p</i> = 0.004, and <i>k</i> = 9). Moreover, results did not differ between children from the general population and those from clinical populations such as children with epilepsy, oncology, neurodevelopmental disorders, or obesity. Effect sizes were larger in European vs. Asian countries. <b>Conclusions:</b> Studies included in this review suggest that children's mental health was generally negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's mental health and the influence of specific risks factors as they evolve over time.","BussiÃƒÂ¨res, Malboeuf-Hurtubise, Meilleur, Mastine, HÃƒÂ©rault, Chadi, Montreuil, GÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©reux, Camden, Camden, Malboeuf-Hurtubise, Roberge, GÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©reux, Lane, Jasmin, Kalubi, BussiÃƒÂ©res, Chadi, Montreuil, Hurtubise, Bach, Mastine, Chrysagis, Turner, Gauvin, HÃƒÂ©rault","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.691659","20211220","COVID-19; children; impact; mental health; meta-analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24124,""
"Sleep in post-COVID-19 recovery period and its impact on different domains of quality of life","COVID-19 pandemic became a global health problem affecting the life of millions of people all over the world. The effects of this pandemic were not only on the physical and medical aspects but also on the psychological issues including anxiety disorders, depressive manifestations, sleep problems and others. Sleep disorders were very commonly reported during the novel Coronavirus-19 pandemic either in the acute phase of COVID-19 infection or after recovery. These sleep problems might have a drastic burden on the recovered patients' life. This study aimed to investigate the sleep in the post-Coronavirus-19 period and if has an impact on the different items of patients' quality of life. This cross-sectional observational study investigated the sleep problems in 500 patients in the post recovery period using Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), their relation to this critical period and their impact on different domains of Quality of Life which was assessed by the SF36 Health Survey. Socio-demographic characteristics of 500 post-Coronavirus-19 patients were collected; the insomnia severity index and Pittsburgh sleep quality index evaluated the sleep pattern. The quality of life was investigated using Short Form 36 scale. The study revealed high scores of insomnia severity index (13.01Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.9), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (15.37Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.43), also high scores of different items of scale of quality of life in the studied group. Post-COVID-19 sleep disturbances were commonly reported in the recovery period, also these sleep deficits had an impact on the physical and mental aspects of quality of life, so these sleep problems must be managed properly especially in this critical pandemic era.","El Sayed, Gomaa, Shokry, Kabil, Eissa","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41983-021-00429-7","20211220","COVID-19; Quality; Recovery; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24125,""
"Tracking the impact of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia: Shocks, vulnerability and insurances among residents of share houses","COVID-19 is re-shaping cities and regions, as residents respond to large disruptions to employment and social interaction and threats to public health. While the impacts of COVID-19 are extensive, certain groups are more vulnerable than others. Our research examines the impact of COVID-19 on members of share houses in the state of Victoria, Australia. This cohort is more likely to be young, casually employed, living in informal arrangements and at risk of homelessness than the broader population. We propose a conceptual framework for investigating the factors driving vulnerability to shocks and the resources most likely to support individuals to respond to or recover from these shocks. We surveyed 1052 share house occupants in June 2020. We found dramatic results, with 74% losing their job or having their hours reduced, 47% experiencing a reduction in their financial situation and 50% reporting that their mental health had deteriorated. These outcomes were worse for young people, casual employees or immigrants. Our research highlights the positive influence of social support for low-income individuals. We find that government social welfare payments are the most impactful form of insurance, calling for a greater appreciation of the role of social welfare in supporting resilience following a disaster.","Raynor, Panza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103332","20211220","COVID-19; Insurances; Rental housing; Resilience; Share houses; Vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24126,""
"The impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown in the UK for doctoral and early career researchers","Doctoral researchers and early career researchers (ECRs) are crucial to producing scientific advancements and represent the future of academic leadership. Their research endeavours were changed radically by lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to explore the perceived benefits and challenges of the national lockdown in the UK from the perspective of doctoral researchers and ECRs. We present analysis of qualitative survey data from 1,142 doctoral researchers and ECRs on their experiences of the first UK lockdown collected from April 16, 2020-May 14, 2020. Our findings suggest considerable heterogeneity in how the pandemic impacted this key group of academic workers. Challenges arising from the lockdown largely cohered around a poor work environment, limited access to resources, perceptions of pressure, and negative psychological outcomes. Conversely, respondents also highlighted several benefits in the early stages of the pandemic, with the change to working from home creating more time, resulting in greater productivity and a better work-life balance. Collectively, findings indicate the importance of considering the personal circumstances and needs of individual researchers. We discuss the implications for support these researchers require to rebuild their careers in the wake of the initial disruption.","Jackman, Sanderson, Haughey, Brett, White, Zile, Tyrrell, Byrom","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-021-00795-4","20211220","Isolation; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychological wellbeing; University","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24127,""
"Concerns and mental health of teachers from digitally underdeveloped countries regarding the reopening of schools after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","Torn between the decision to return to school classrooms or continue holding online classes during COVID-19, teachers around the world feel great uncertainty. Bearing in mind that the study of mental health during the pandemic is of great importance for vulnerable categories, and given the role of teachers in society, the aim of this research is to assess teachers' concerns and anxiety before the start of the school year, and also to examine the factors related to them and propose measures in line with the results. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study before the start of the 2020/2021 school year. The research sample consisted of 286 teachers. For the purposes of this research, a special questionnaire was constructed consisting of a general questionnaire and a Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). The strongest predictor of a teacher's answer that they were concerned about the reopening of schools was their concern for their own life and health and for the life and health of their family members, followed by the amount of information received about COVID-19, and, finally, older age. Only 2% of teachers had mild anxiety. This research indicated that it is necessary to examine in more detail the degree of teachers' concern and its impact on their functionality and work process. It is also necessary to repeat the research on the mental health status of teachers and implement procedures in the form of a regular screening program of the mental health status of teachers or implement procedures of support in concern management.","MiliÃ„â€¡, MariÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210885","20211220","COVID-19; anxiety; concerns; mental health; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24128,""
"The impact of perinatal healthcare changes on birth trauma during COVID-19","Since the onset of COVID-19, giving birth has involved navigating unprecedented healthcare changes that could significantly impact the psychological birth experience. Research has demonstrated increasing rates of birth trauma and birth plan alterations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study specifically examined these intersecting experiences to understand how COVID-related healthcare changes have impacted birth trauma during the pandemic. 269 people who gave birth in the U.S. during COVID-19 completed an online survey between November, 2020-May, 2021 which included questions about COVID-related perinatal healthcare changes and birth-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; The City Birth Trauma Scale). T-tests were run on birth demographics to assess for significant indicators of PTSD; variables having significant effects were used to build a hierarchical regression model to predict PTSD symptoms. 5.9% of the sample met criteria for PTSD and 72.3% met partial criteria. The overall regression model predicted approximately 19% of variance in total PTSD symptoms. Labor and birth demographics were entered in Step 1 and predicted approximately 11% of variance: limited length of stay for support person, being allowed 1 support person who had to be the same, and mask requirements were significant predictors of PTSD. Variables related to birth plan changes were entered in Step 2 and predicted approximately 8% of variance: changes to support person(s) for labor and birth, breastfeeding plans, and birth location were significant predictors of PTSD. The present study demonstrates the importance of COVID-related perinatal healthcare changes to the development of trauma symptoms following childbirth.","Diamond, Colaianni","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2021.12.003","20211220","Birth; Birth trauma; COVID-19; Mental health; Postpartum; Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24129,""

In a sample of U.S. adults (<i>N</i> = 5,010), we investigated how mental health, COVID-19 health beliefs, and general news consumption influenced the odds of suicidal ideation using hierarchical logistic regression models. Both worsening mental health overall and specifically in regard to COVID-19 increased suicidal ideation. Perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection did not increase suicidal ideation, yet higher levels of COVID-19 self-efficacy reduced suicidal ideation. Overall news consumption did not affect suicidal ideation, but media-specific post-hoc analyses revealed that TV news watching decreased suicidal ideation as much as high levels of COVID-19 self-efficacy decreased suicidal ideation. Furthermore, online news consumption increased suicidal ideation as much as worsening mental health overall increased suicidal ideation.

"Home direct-to-consumer telehealth solutions for children with mental health disorders and the impact of Covid-19","Delivery of mental health treatment in the home can close gaps in care. Telehealth also provides access to healthcare that has been disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2016, a home direct-to-consumer telehealth program was initiated. Mental health encounters made up a significant portion of all telehealth encounters and COVID-19 had a significant impact on accelerating the utilization of telehealth. Telemental health has been more successful at meeting targeted volumes than the overall health system. Of all the mental health diagnoses before and during COVID-19, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder were most common. The direct-to-consumer telehealth program saved patients a significant amount of travel miles and associated time, based on data from the period before COVID-19. Payment reimbursement for direct-to-consumer telehealth professional services was similar to reimbursement for in-person visits.

"Alcohol access and purchasing behaviour during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions: An exploration of sociodemographic, health and psychosocial correlates in two Canadian provinces","Alcohol access has changed in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study compares the use of two novel purchasing modes (via delivery and in excess/stockpiling) to traditional, in-person purchasing to determine if their use is associated with sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics, perceived COVID-19 health risk or consumption frequency. We draw on cross-sectional survey data from 2000 residents of the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, ages 19Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and older that were administered online and by telephone. Associations between purchasing modes and sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics, perceived COVID-19 health risk or consumption frequency were assessed using logistic regression. About 70% of people who drink purchased in-person, 17% used delivery and 30% purchased in excess/stockpiled. Sociodemographic and psychosocial attributes varied among those at increased odds of using each purchasing mode. Those at higher COVID-19 health risk were at higher odds of getting alcohol delivered. Increased drinking frequency was associated with alcohol delivery and purchasing in excess/stockpiling. This study highlights the need for increased public health considerations regarding changes to alcohol regulations. Alcohol delivery and purchasing in excess/stockpiling is positively associated with heavier drinking. Drinkers at higher COVID-19 health risk were more likely to purchase online for delivery, which suggests novel purchasing modes may serve a partial public health function.","MacNabb, Blades, Thompson, Dutton, Liu, Asbridge","https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13423","20211219","COVID-19; alcohol; demography; drinking behaviour; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24134,""
"Movement behaviors and mental health of caregivers of preschoolers in China during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to examine the associations between physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior (SB), sleep, and the mental health of caregivers of preschool children following the COVID-19 outbreak. From 5 October to 16 December 2020, responses from 2476 respondents in China were collated through an online survey or a written questionnaire. Movement behaviors (PA, SB, screen time, and sleep), mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress), and demographic information were self-reported by the respondents. Linear mixed models were used for data analysis. Valid responses were received from 2002 caregivers (35.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4.9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years old, 76.3% females) of children between 3 and 6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years old in China (Hong Kong 3.2%, Shanghai 20.6%, Guangzhou 34.1%, Guiyang 26.7%, Xuzhou 11.3%, Xi'an 4.1%).

"The upside: coping and psychological resilience in Australian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","Since the COVID-19 outbreak, few studies have investigated the positive psychological consequences on young people. This study examined resilience, positive experiences, and coping strategies reported by Australian adolescents during COVID-19. Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18Ã‚Â years. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to assess resilience, positive experiences, and coping strategies. Exploratory regression analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between resilience and demographics and mental illness history, as well as between resilience and positive experiences. Overall, adolescents were somewhat resilient (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.93, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.29). They reported positive experiences during COVID-19, including increased empathy, compassion, gratitude, and connection with others, and reported using a range of active coping strategies. Having a mental illness history and identification as female or non-binary gender were associated with lower resilience (BsÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.82, psÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Further, resilience was associated with decreased psychological distress (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.89, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and with increased positive experiences (ORsÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.03, psÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt; 0.001). Our results indicate that Australian adolescents commonly reported positive experiences and used active coping strategies during COVID-19. Some young people demonstrated higher levels of resilience and were able to make the most out of an unpredictable situation that severely disrupted their daily routine. However, further prospective research using longitudinal methods is necessary to examine causal relationships between variables. An implication of our findings is that resilience-building programs for adolescents may be effective in increasing adaptability after adversity (e.g., climate change, bushfires, pandemics).","Beames, Li, Newby, Maston, Christensen, Werner-Seidler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00432-z","20211219","Adolescent; Coping; Covid-19; Pandemic; Resilience; Youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24137,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on the safety, housing stability, and mental health of unstably housed domestic violence survivors","Using data from an ongoing longitudinal study, we examined the impact of the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders on a racially diverse population of unstably housed domestic violence (DV) survivors over time. Specifically, we examined survivors' safety, housing stability, and mental health before, during, and after the onset of COVID-19, and how demographic, social, and familial factors attenuated or exacerbated the effect of the stay-at-home orders. Approximately 300 participants were initially interviewed after they sought services from a DV agency, and then again, every 6 months over 2 years. COVID-19 stay-at-home orders occurred midway through the completion of this multi-year study. Longitudinal mixed effects models were estimated to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the safety, housing stability, and mental health of survivors over time. We also examined models with several time-varying (e.g., employment, income, social support, and number of children) and time-invariant (baseline outcome scores, racial/ethnic identity, education, and disability status) control variables. Results revealed that safety, housing stability and mental health were improving for study participants before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic but plateaued after the stay-at-home orders were issued. Experiences of abuse, housing instability, and mental health symptomatology did not worsen as a result of the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Notably, social support and housing services emerged as important predictors of outcomes, such that participants who received housing-related services and greater social support reported less abuse, less housing instability, and lower mental health distress. COVID-19 temporarily disrupted the positive trajectory unstably housed DV survivors were experiencing in regard to safety, housing stability and mental health. These findings provide critical insight into the importance of service access during and after global catastrophes. Additional resources and support may be helpful in assisting survivors to return to their pre-pandemic recovery and growth trajectories.","Chiaramonte, Simmons, Hamdan, Ayeni, LÃƒÂ³pez-ZerÃƒÂ³n, Farero, Sprecher, Sullivan","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22765","20211218","COVID-19; intimate partner violence; longitudinal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24138,""
"The hidden minority: Discrimination and mental health among international students in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic","International students in the US occupy a precarious position at the intersection of immigration policy and global education mobility, one made more challenging by the disparate impact of COVID-19 on college students' mental health. Few studies, however, have explored the pandemic's effects on mental well-being among the international student population in the US. Our study aims to provide initial empirical evidence on the mental health status of these students, with a specific focus on discrimination, loneliness, anxiety, and depression. We propose a mediation framework and estimate the mediating effects of loneliness and anxiety in the relationships between discrimination and depression in a sample of US-based international students (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 103). We collected cross-sectional data from July to August 2020, using a 50-item online survey instrument with three open-ended questions. Mediation analyses using PROCESS Macro were used to analyse quantitative data and thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative data. Findings showed that higher levels of discrimination were significantly associated with higher levels of loneliness. Higher levels of loneliness were significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety, which in turn led to high levels of depressive symptoms.

"Anxiety and depressive symptoms in college students during the late stage of the COVID-19 outbreak: a network approach","Mental health problems are common in college students even in the late stage of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Network analysis is a novel approach to explore interactions of mental disorders at the symptom level. The aim of this study was to elucidate characteristics of depressive and anxiety symptoms network in college students in the late stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 3062 college students were included. The seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to measure anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Central symptoms and bridge symptoms were identified based on centrality and bridge centrality indices, respectively. Network stability was examined using the case-dropping procedure. The strongest direct relation was between anxiety symptoms ""Nervousness"" and ""Uncontrollable worry"". ""Fatigue"" has the highest node strength in the anxiety and depression network, followed by ""Excessive worry"", ""Trouble relaxing"", and ""Uncontrollable worry"".

"Risk factors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: The roles of coping style and emotional regulation","When COVID-19 emerged in China in late 2019, most citizens were home-quarantined to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Extended periods of isolation have detrimental effects on an individual's mental health. Therefore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic should include assessment of psychological distress and its known risk factors, including coping style and emotional regulation. This cross-sectional study surveyed 6,027 Chinese university students recruited from May 25, 2020 to June 10, 2020. In addition to sociodemographic information, participant data were collected using online versions of the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). The incidence of psychological distress was found to be 35.34%. Negative coping style and expressing panic about COVID-19 on social media were the most important predictors of psychological distress. In addition, being male, being a ""left-behind child"" or having a monthly household income lower than 5000 CNY or higher than 20,000 CNY were associated with higher psychological distress. The psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic could be serious. Psychological interventions that reduce nervousness and negative coping style need to be made available to home-quarantined university students, especially those who are male, are ""left-behind"", have a monthly household income lower than 5000 CNY or higher than 20,000 CNY, or express panic on social media.","Li, Fan, Wang, Wang, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.026","20211220","COVID-19 pandemic; Coping style; Emotional regulation; Psychological distress; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24142,""

"Determining the Knowledge, Attitude and Perception towards COVID-19 among Newly Recruited Surveillance Team in Ikeja, Lagos State, Nigeria: How justified are we in the Recruitment?","In the current pandemic, real-time analyses of epidemiological data generated from a reliable source are required for increasing awareness about COVID-19. Therefore, it is important to assess the perception of risk of the surveillance team that would be deployed, as this will contribute to their commitment towards rapid surveillance of COVID-19. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude and perception towards COVID-19 among newly recruited surveillance team in Ikeja, Lagos State, Nigeria. A descriptive cross-sectional study, with the respondents being active surveillance volunteers recruited by the World Health Organization. One hundred respondents were purposively recruited and data collection was done using a pretested self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 25; bivariate and multivariate analyses were done using Chi-square and binary logistic regression respectively at 5% level of significance. The mean age of the study participants was 37.1 Ã‚Â±11.9 years. Of all the respondents, 58.6% had poor knowledge of COVID-19. Less than half of the respondents (44.8%) had negative attitude towards COVID-19 while majority (90.8%) of them had low risk perception about COVID-19. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that married respondents had significantly lesser odds (67%) of having poor knowledge about COVID-19 compared with the respondents who were single/Widowed/Widower. (aOR; 0.33, CI; 0.04 - 0.88). The study highlights the poor knowledge, negative attitude, as well as low risk perception about COVID19 among newly recruited active surveillance workers.

"Variation in State-Level Eviction Moratorium Protections and Mental Health Among US Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Although evictions have been associated with adverse mental health outcomes, it remains unclear which stages of the eviction process are associated with mental distress among renters. Variation in COVID-19 pandemic eviction protections across US states enables identification of intervention targets within the eviction process to improve renters' mental health. To measure the association between the strength of eviction protections (ie, stages blocked by eviction moratoriums) and mental distress among renters during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cohort study used individual-level, nationally representative data from the Understanding Coronavirus in America Survey to measure associations between state eviction moratorium protections and mental distress. The sample of 2317 respondents included renters with annual household incomes less than $75Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 who reported a state of residence and completed surveys between March 10 and September 3, 2020, prior to the federal eviction moratorium order by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Time-varying strength of state moratorium protections as a categorical variable: none, weak (blocking court hearings, judgments, or enforcement without blocking notice or filing), or strong (blocking all stages of the eviction process beginning with notice and filing). Moderate to severe mental distress was measured using the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Linear regression models were adjusted for time-varying state COVID-19 incidence and mortality, public health restrictions, and unemployment rates. Models included individual and time fixed effects as well as clustered standard errors. The sample consisted of 2317 individuals (20Ã¢â‚¬Â¯853 total observations) composed largely (1788 [78%] weighted) of middle-aged adults (25-64 years of age) and women (1538 [60%]); 640 respondents (23%) self-reported as Hispanic or Latinx, 314 respondents (20%) as non-Hispanic Black, and 1071 respondents (48%) as non-Hispanic White race and ethnicity. Relative to no state-level eviction moratorium protections, strong protections were associated with a 12.6% relative reduction (risk ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99) in the probability of mental distress, whereas weak protections were not associated with a statistically significant reduction (risk ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.86-1.06). This analysis of the Understanding Coronavirus in America Survey data found that strong eviction moratoriums were associated with protection against mental distress, suggesting that distress begins early in the eviction process with notice and filing. This finding is consistent with the idea that to reduce mental distress among renters, policy makers should focus on primary prevention of evictions.","Leifheit, Pollack, Raifman, Schwartz, Koehler, Rodriguez Bronico, Benfer, Zimmerman, Linton","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.39585","20211220","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24145,""
"Long-Term Follow up of Renal and Other Acute Organ Failure in Survivors of Critical Illness Due to Covid-19","Little is known about the long-term health sequelae and outcomes of various organ failures in ICU survivors of Covid-19. The aim of our research was to study the characteristics of 120-day ICU survivors of the initial pandemic surge and report their long term (&gt;6Ã¢â‚¬â€¦months) outcomes. We conducted a telephone questionnaire-based follow up study of 120- day survivors of Covid-19 admitted to ICUs at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY from 3/10/2020 to 4/11/2020. The study period was 2Ã¢â‚¬â€¦months (11/1/2020-12/31/2020). 126 out of 300 (42%) survived to 120-days post-hospital discharge. The median age of survivors was 54 (47-61) years. Seventy-eight (62%) patients developed acute kidney injury (AKI); thirty-five (44.9%) of them required renal replacement therapy (RRT). One hundred-five (83.3%) required invasive mechanical ventilation; ten of them required tracheotomy. 103 (81.7%) completed the telephone questionnaire-based study, at a median (IQR) of 216.5 (200-234.5) days after hospital discharge. 29 (28.2%) patients reported persistent shortness of breath, 24, (23.3%) complained of persistent cough, and persistent anosmia in 9 (8.8%). AKI resolved completely in 58 (74.4%) patients. Of 35 AKI patients who required initiation of RRT during hospitalization, 27 (77%) were liberated from RRT and 20 (57%) had resolution of AKI. Of 20 patients without AKI resolution, 12 developed chronic kidney disease, whereas 8 still require RRT. Thirty-three (32.4%) patients developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 10 (11.8%) reported major depression. Many of the patients (68%) regained baseline functional status. Readmissions occurred in 22.3% patients within first 6Ã¢â‚¬â€¦months after discharge. Persistent symptoms of long Covid have been reported in ICU survivors of Covid-19 for extended durations. Outcomes of Covid-19 associated acute kidney injury are excellent. There is a high incidence of PTSD and depression in COVID-19 ICU survivors. Functional outcomes are good, but these patients remain at increased risk of hospital readmission.","Chand, Kapoor, Naqvi, Thakkar, Fazzari, Orsi, Dieiev, Lewandowski, Dicpinigaitis","https://doi.org/10.1177/08850666211062582","20211217","ICU; acute kidney injury; covid-19; organ failure; renal replacement therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24146,""
"Experience of early motherhood during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Germany: a single-centre before and after comparison","To assess maternal mental health during the first weeks after birth including birth experience, postpartum adjustment to early motherhood and the perception of newborn behaviour, and how this may be influenced by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety women who gave birth after the first enforcement of nation-wide disease control restrictions in Germany between 16 March and 10 May 2020 were surveyed and compared with 101 women who had given birth before the pandemic. Information on maternal mental health and maternal perception of early motherhood and neonatal behaviour were assessed at 3-8Ã‚Â weeks postpartum. Mothers who gave birth under the COVID-19-associated disease control restrictions did not show significant differences in depression, anxiety and social support scales compared to mothers before the pandemic. Birth experience was similar, while support during birth was perceived to be higher under the COVID-19 restrictions. Confidence in caretaking of the newborn and perception of neonatal behaviour were comparable between the two groups. Mothers expressed significantly higher dissatisfaction with the maternal role during the pandemic. Overall, maternal mental health and the perception of the newborn and early caretaking during the first COVID-19 wave did not substantially differ from the perceptions of mothers before the pandemic. A potential influence of the pandemic on higher dissatisfaction with the maternal role may be associated with the pandemic conditions affecting everyday life and should be addressed in postpartum care and in future qualitative and longitudinal studies.","Perez, Schepanski, GÃƒÂ¶bel, Stuhrmann, Singer, Bindt, Mudra","https://doi.org/10.1080/02646838.2021.2013458","20211217","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; adjustment to motherhood; childbirth experience; maternal mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24147,""

"Characterizing the COVID-19 Illness Experience to Inform the Study of Post-acute Sequelae and Recovery","There is an urgent need to fully understand the impact of variable COVID-19 experiences and the optimal management of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We characterized the variability in the acute illness experience and ongoing recovery process from participants in a COVID-19 recovery cohort study in Northern California in 2020. We completed 24 semi-structured in-depth interviews with adults with confirmed positive SARV-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test result, had recovered or were recovering from acute infection, and underwent serial evaluations. We purposefully sampled English- and Spanish-speaking adults with asymptomatic, mild, and severe symptomatic infection, including those who were hospitalized and those with HIV co-infection. We used a thematic analysis to analyze interviews and identify salient themes. After integrating the thematic analysis with clinical data, we identified key themes: (1) across symptom profiles and severity, experiencing COVID-19 was associated with psychological distress; (2) symptomatic infection carried uncertainty in symptom presentation and ongoing recovery (e.g., long COVID); and (3) health information-seeking behavior was facilitated by access to medical care and uncertainty with the recovery process. Our data informs the emerging field of ""long COVID"" research and shows a need to provide information and continuous support to persons with post-acute sequelae to ensure they feel secure along the path to recovery.","Santiago-Rodriguez, Maiorana, Peluso, Hoh, Tai, Fehrman, Hernandez, Torres, Spinelli, Gandhi, Kelly, Martin, Henrich, Deeks, Sauceda","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-021-10045-7","20211217","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Long COVID; Mental health; Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC); Recovering from COVID-19; SARS-Cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24149,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health, Occupational Functioning, and Professional Retention Among Health Care Workers and First Responders","The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected front-line health care workers (HCW) and first responders (FR). The specific components of COVID-19 related occupational stressors (CROS) associated with psychiatric symptoms and reduced occupational functioning or retention remain poorly understood. Examine the relationships between total and factored CROS, psychiatric symptoms, and occupational outcomes. Observational, self-report, single time-point online assessment. A total of 510 US HCW (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°301) and FR (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°200) with occupational duties affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. CROS were assessed using a custom 17-item questionnaire. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, insomnia, and generalized anxiety symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL5), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7). Respondents' likelihood of leaving current field and occupational functioning were assessed with 2-item PROMIS subscales. Relationships were modeled using multivariable regression. Open-ended responses were coded using rapid template analysis. CROS total scores correlated significantly with all four psychiatric symptom domains (R'sÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.42-.53), likelihood of leaving one's current occupation (RÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.18), and trouble doing usual work (RÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.28), all p'sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001. Half of HCW indicated a decreased likelihood of staying in their current occupation as a result of the pandemic. CROS were fit to a 3-factor model consisting of risk, demoralization, and volume factors. All CROS factors were associated with psychiatric symptom burden, but demoralization was most prominently associated with psychiatric symptoms and negative occupational outcomes. Among psychiatric symptoms, PTSD symptoms were most strongly associated with negative occupational outcomes. Open-ended statements emphasized lack of protection and support, increased occupational demands, and emotional impact of work duties. These results demonstrate potentially treatable psychiatric symptoms in HCW and FR experiencing CROS, impacting both wellbeing and the health care system. Mitigating CROS, particularly by addressing factors driving demoralization, may improve HCW and FR mental health, occupational functioning, and retention.","Hendrickson, Slevin, Hoerster, Chang, Sano, McCall, Monty, Thomas, Raskind","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-07252-z","20211217","COVID-19; Insomnia; Occupational trauma; PTSD; Professional retention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24150,""

"Prevalence of sleep disturbance and anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia","In the COVID-19 pandemic, physical and psychological health are of immense concern for the governing bodies and health policymakers in the period of lockdown and self-isolation. An in-depth analysis is required to recognize the changes in mental health among the public of different geographical areas. The study aimed to investigate the sleep quality and anxiety among the population in Saudi Arabia during the lockdown period from March to June 2020. We conducted a cross-sectional study and surveyed the population in Saudi Arabia during the lockdown. We analyzed the anxiety and sleep quality in a population with variable socio-demographic profiles. We assessed anxiety using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) questionnaire and tested the sleep quality by using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) questionnaire. We analysed the questionnaire responses to determine the relationships between anxiety, stress, sleep disturbances by using SPSS, and considered the p-value&lt;0.05 statistically significant. We collected 397 questionnaires from the participants. The respondents were mostly of youth age (19-24 years), 66.5% of respondents were male, while there were 33.5% females. Most of the participants did not contact any COVID-19 patients (75.1%, n=298). The finding revealed that most people did not consider associated anxiety as a worrying disorder as the vast majority were normal with only 12.6% had mild-to-moderate anxiety and almost 1% had moderate-to-severe anxiety. While correlating the sleep patterns disturbance in individuals who had contact with COVID-19 patients, there was a significant sleep disturbance. The disturbance of sleep was in having problems falling sleep (p-value=0.024), having bad/horrible dreams (p-value=0.017), feeling cold at sleeping (p-value=0.038), and difficulty staying active during eating or driving (p-value=0.012). There was a significant correlation with anxiety related to the COVID-19 contact and problems affecting the routine work (p-value=0.001). There is a significant correlation with anxiety related to the contact with COVID-19 positive patients and problems affecting the routine work among operational professionals.

"Pilot Study of Mindfulness Training on the Self-Awareness of Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease - A Randomized Controlled Trial","<b>Objective:</b> This study aims to evaluate feasibility and effects of a newly developed mindfulness intervention tailored to specific needs of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). <b>Background:</b> The phenomenon of impaired self-awareness of motor symptoms (ISAm) in PD might be reduced by increasing patients' mindfulness. A PD-specific mindfulness intervention has been developed and evaluated as a potential treatment option: IPSUM (""Insight into Parkinson's Disease Symptoms by using Mindfulness""). <b>Methods:</b> IPSUM's effectiveness is evaluated by comparing an intervention with a waitlist-control group. Applying a pre-post design, patients were assessed before, directly after and 8weeks after treatment. The primary outcome was the change in a quantitative ISAm score from baseline to post-assessment. Secondary outcome measures were PD-related affective changes and neuropsychological test performance. Feasibility was evaluated <i>via</i> feedback forms. <b>Results:</b> In total, 30 non-depressed and non-demented PD patients were included (intervention: <i>n</i>=14, waitlist-control: <i>n</i>=16). ISAm score did not change significantly, but the training group showed greater performance in sustained attention and language tasks over time. Additional changes included greater mindfulness as well as less sleeping problems and anxiety. Cognitive disturbances, apathy, and sleeping problems worsened only in the waitlist-control group. Patients' feedback regarding the training concept and material was excellent. <b>Conclusion:</b> Insight into Parkinson's Disease Symptoms by using Mindfulness has not been capable of reducing ISAm in PD patients but appears to be a feasible and effective concept to, among others, support mental health in the mid-term. It has to be noted though that the study was stopped beforehand because of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. The lack of findings might therefore be caused by a lack of statistical power. The need for further research to better understand the mechanisms of ISAm and its connection to mindfulness in PD is highlighted.","Buchwitz, Maier, Greuel, Thieken, Steidel, Jakobs, Eggers","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.763350","20211218","ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; anosognosia; mindfulness; randomized controlled trial; self-awareness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24153,""
"Association Between Online Self-Directed Learning Ability and Negative Emotions Among College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in Anhui Province, East China","<b>Background:</b> This study investigated the correlation between depression, anxiety, and stress among college students engaged in online learning during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and self-directed learning (SDL) ability, which could provide a scientific basis for mental health education of the college students. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted among 5,558 students from two universities in Anhui province, East China. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and the Self-directed Learning Ability Scale were used to conduct an online questionnaire survey. <b>Results:</b> A total of 35.15, 36.32, and 17.24% of college students reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Males and nonmedical students were at higher risks to suffer from depression, anxiety, and stress. In adjusted model, compared with Q1 of self-management ability, the odds ratio (OR) of the Q2, Q3, and Q4 were as follows: 0.635 (0.531-0.759), 0.504 (0.415-0.611), and 0.312 (0.248-0.392) for depression; 0.639 (0.535-0.764), 0.653 (0.540-0.789), and 0.421 (0.338-0.525) for anxiety; and 0.649 (0.523-0.805), 0.579 (0.457-0.733), and 0.482 (0.364-0.637) for stress. For information capability, decrease in risk was even more pronounced: Q2 (0.654, 0.540-0.794), Q3 (0.560, 0.454-0.690), and Q4 (0.233, 0.181-0.301) for depression; Q2 (0.781, 0.646-0.945), Q3 (0.616, 0.501-0.757), and Q4 (0.276, 0.216-0.353) for anxiety; and Q2 (0.444, 0.357-0.553), Q3 (0.454, 0.357-0.578), and Q4 (0.272, 0.202-0.368) for stress.

"Patterns of Suicide in the Context of COVID-19: Evidence From Three Australian States","<b>Aims:</b> We aimed to determine whether there has been a change in the number of suicides occurring in three Australian states overall, and in age and sex subgroups, since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and to see if certain risk factors for suicide have become more prominent as likely underlying contributing factors for suicide. <b>Method:</b> Using real-time data from three state-based suicide registers, we ran multiple unadjusted and adjusted interrupted time series analyses to see if trends in monthly suicide counts changed after the pandemic began and whether there had been an increase in suicides where relationship breakdown, financial stressors, unemployment and homelessness were recorded. <b>Results:</b> Compared with the period before COVID-19, during the COVID-19 period there was no change in the number of suicides overall, or in any stratum-specific estimates except one. The exception was an increase in the number of young males who died by suicide in the COVID-19 period (adjusted RR 1.89 [95% CI 1.11-3.23]). The unadjusted analysis showed significant differences in suicide in the context of unemployment and relationship breakdown during the COVID-19 compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Analysis showed an increase in the number of suicides occurring in the context of unemployment in the COVID-19 period (unadjusted RR 1.53 [95% CI 1.18-1.96]). In contrast, there was a decrease in the number of suicides occurring in the context of relationship breakdown in the COVID-19 period (unadjusted RR 0.82 [95% CI 0.67-0.99]). However, no significant changes were identified when the models were adjusted for possible over-dispersion, seasonality and non-linear trend. <b>Conclusion:</b> Although our analysis found no evidence of an overall increase in suicides after the pandemic began, the picture is complex. The identified increase in suicide in young men indicates that the impact of the pandemic is likely unevenly distributed across populations. The increase in suicides in the context of unemployment reinforces the vital need for mitigation measures during COVID-19, and for ongoing monitoring of suicide as the pandemic continues.","Clapperton, Spittal, Dwyer, Garrett, KÃƒÂµlves, Leske, Millar, Edwards, Stojcevski, Crompton, Pirkis","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.797601","20211218","COVID-19; epidemiology; mental health; risk factors; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24155,""
"Survivors of COVID-19 exhibit altered amplitudes of low frequency fluctuation in the brain: a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study at 1-year follow-up","Although some short-term follow-up studies have found that individuals recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibit anxiety, depression, and altered brain microstructure, their long-term physical problems, neuropsychiatric sequelae, and changes in brain function remain unknown. This observational cohort study collected 1-year follow-up data from 22 patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 (8 males and 11 females, aged 54.2 Ã‚Â± 8.7 years). Fatigue and myalgia were persistent symptoms at the 1-year follow-up. The resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that compared with 29 healthy controls (7 males and 18 females, aged 50.5 Ã‚Â± 11.6 years), COVID-19 survivors had greatly increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) values in the left precentral gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus of operculum, inferior frontal gyrus of triangle, insula, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, thalamus, middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, caudate, and putamen. ALFF values in the left caudate of the COVID-19 survivors were positively correlated with their Athens Insomnia Scale scores, and those in the left precentral gyrus were positively correlated with neutrophil count during hospitalization. The long-term follow-up results suggest that the ALFF in brain regions related to mood and sleep regulation were altered in COVID-19 survivors. This can help us understand the neurobiological mechanisms of COVID-19-related neuropsychiatric sequelae.

"The effectiveness of telepsychiatry: thematic review","This review aims to clarify the evidence on the effectiveness of telepsychiatry following the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a literature review of three databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed and PsycINFO), using the terms virtual consultation/telepsychiatry/video consultation AND psychiatry/mental illness. We identified 325 eligible papers and conducted a thematic analysis resulting in five themes: patient and clinical satisfaction, diagnostic reliability, outcomes, technology and professional guidance. The most significant factors linked to effectiveness of telepsychiatry were patient and clinician satisfaction and adequate technology to facilitate examination of the patient. The consistent diagnostic reliability, satisfactory clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction linked to telepsychiatry favour its continued use once the pandemic ends. The main barrier is reluctance among clinicians and lack of professional guidance. We recommend education on the uses of telepsychiatry among clinicians, and the provision of professional guidance for its use from medical bodies and organisations.","Sharma, Devan","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2021.115","20211217","Community mental health teams; education and training; in-patient treatment; information technologies; out-patient treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24157,""
"A case of catatonia in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic: does autism spectrum matter?","There is growing concern about the psychopathological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prolonged stress due to the spreading fear of the contagion and to the enforced containment measures are deemed to trigger recurrences of preexisting mental disorders as well as the onset of new ones. From such perspective, clinical cases may be of primary ground to identify individual features and pandemic-related factors predisposing to the development of serious psychiatric symptoms. Mr. R. is a 64-year-old, married, unemployed man, whose premorbid personality was characterized by relevant autistic traits. The patient developed catatonia in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed at discussing the role of both preexisting and precipitating factors. Autism spectrum could represent a predisposing factor for severe psychopathological outcome and catatonia. Furthermore, the present clinical case highlights the role of COVID-19 pandemic in influencing physical and mental health.","Dell'Osso, Amatori, Gesi, Carmassi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-021-00377-9","20211217","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); COVID-19; Catatonia; Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); Neurodevelopmental disorder; Rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24158,""
"Difficulties accessing health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: examining the intersectionality between immigrant status and visible minority status","Difficulties accessing health care services can result in delaying in seeking and obtaining treatment. Although these difficulties are disproportionately experienced among vulnerable groups, we know very little about how the intersectionality of realities experienced by immigrants and visible minorities can impact their access to health care services since the pandemic. Using Statistics Canada's Crowdsourcing Data: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians-Experiences of Discrimination, we combine two variables (i.e., immigrant status and visible minority status) to create a new variable called visible minority immigrant status. This multiplicative approach is commonly used in intersectionality research, which allows us to explore disadvantages experienced by minorities with multiplicative identities. Main results show that, compared to white native-born, visible minority immigrants are less likely to report difficulties accessing non-emergency surgical care (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.55, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), non-emergency diagnostic test (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.74, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), dental care (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.71, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), mental health care (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.77, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), and making an appointment for rehabilitative care (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.56, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) but more likely to report difficulties accessing emergency services/urgent care (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.46, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). We conclude that there is a dynamic interplay of factors operating at multiple levels to shape the impact of COVID-19 related needs to be addressed through changes in social policies, which can tackle unique struggles faced by visible minority immigrants.","Etowa, Sano, Hyman, Dabone, Mbagwu, Ghose, Osman, Mohamoud","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01593-1","20211217","COVID-19; Canada; Health care; Immigrants; Visible minorities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24159,""

"With age comes well-being: older age associated with lower stress, negative affect, and depression throughout the COVID-19 pandemic","<b>Objectives:</b> Despite initial concerns about older adult's emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, reports from the first months of the pandemic suggested that older adults were faring better than younger adults, reporting lower stress, negative affect, depression, and anxiety. In this study, we examined whether this pattern would persist as the pandemic progressed.<b>Method:</b> A convenience sample of 1,171 community-dwelling adults in the United States, ages 18-90, filled out surveys on various metrics of emotional well-being starting in March 2020 and at various time points through April 2021. We created time bins to account for the occurrence of significant national events, allowing us to determine how age would relate to affective outcomes when additional national-level emotional events were overlaid upon the stress of the pandemic.<b>Results:</b> Older age was associated with lower stress, negative affect, and depressive symptomatology, and with higher positive affect, and this effect was consistent across time points measured from March, 2020 through April, 2021. Age was less associated with measures of worry and social isolation, but older adults were more worried about their personal health throughout the pandemic.<b>Conclusion:</b> These results are consistent with literature suggesting that older age is associated with increased resilience in the face of stressful life experiences and show that this pattern may extend to resilience in the face of a prolonged real-world stressor.Supplemental data for this article can be accessed online at https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.2010183 .","Fields, Kensinger, Garcia, Ford, Cunningham","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.2010183","20211217","Age; COVID-19; aging; emotional well-being; positivity effect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24161,""
"Perceived Control, Preventative Health Behaviors, and the Mental Health of Nursing Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Introduction:</b> Perceived control is an individual's subjective beliefs about the amount of control he or she has over the environment or outcome. <b>Objective:</b> To examine the relationship between perceived control, preventive health behaviors, and mental health effects of undergraduate nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional correlational study used online self-administered questionnaires. Participants were nursing students attending 3 universities in Tokyo, Japan. Relationships among variables were quantitatively analyzed using linear regressions and a structural equation modeling after adjusting for demographic factors. <b>Results:</b> A total of 557 students participated in the survey. The analysis indicated that higher levels of perceived control were significantly related to higher levels of preventive health behaviors. Although higher preventive health behaviors were related to negative mental health effects, higher levels of perceived health competence translated to improved mental health effects. Perceived control was not directly related to mental health effects but positively related to perceived health competence. Long work hours per week and short hours of sleep per day were associated with lower preventive health behaviors. There were significant differences in the levels of perceived control and preventive health behaviors among students at the 3 universities. <b>Discussion:</b> To improve health behaviors and health competence and subsequently alleviate the mental health effects caused by strictly adhering to recommended health behaviors, students may be supported by the strategies that increase their perceived control. In addition to institutional support, students also require adequate sleep and financial stability to help prevent infections while protecting their mental health.","Kondo, Abuliezi, Naruse, Oki, Niitsu, Ezeonwu","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580211060279","20211217","COVID-19; health behavior; mental health; nursing; sense of control; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24162,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns on the consumption of anxiolytics, hypnotics and antidepressants according to age groups: a French nationwide study","Previous studies have shown a negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated sanitary measures on mental health, especially among adolescents and young adults. Such a context may raise many concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic long-term psychological effects. An analysis of administrative databases could be an alternative and complementary approach to medical interview-based epidemiological surveys to monitor the mental health of the population. We conducted a nationwide study to describe the consumption of anxiolytics, antidepressants and hypnotics during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the five previous years. A historic cohort study was conducted by extracting and analysing data from the French health insurance database between 1 January 2015 and 28 February 2021. Individuals were classified into five age-based classes. Linear regression models were performed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period on the number of drug consumers, in introducing an interaction term between time and COVID-19 period. Since March 2020, in all five age groups and all three drug categories studied, the number of patients reimbursed weekly has increased compared to the period from January 2015 to February 2020. The youngest the patients, the more pronounced the magnitude. Monitoring the consumption of psychiatric medications could be of great interest as reliable indicators are essential for planning public health strategies.

"A Review of Prenatal Care Delivery to Inform the Michigan Plan for Appropriate Tailored Healthcare in Pregnancy Panel","To perform a literature review of key aspects of prenatal care delivery to inform new guidelines. A comprehensive review of Ovid MEDLINE, Elsevier's Scopus, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included studies addressing components of prenatal care delivery (visit frequency, routine pregnancy assessments, and telemedicine) that assessed maternal and neonatal health outcomes, patient experience, or care utilization in pregnant individuals with and without medical conditions. Quality was assessed using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodology approach. Articles were independently reviewed by at least two members of the study team for inclusion and data abstraction. Of the 4,105 published abstracts identified, 53 studies met inclusion criteria, totaling 140,150 participants. There were no differences in maternal and neonatal outcomes among patients without medical conditions with reduced visit frequency schedules. For patients at risk of preterm birth, increased visit frequency with enhanced prenatal services was inconsistently associated with improved outcomes. Home monitoring of blood pressure and weight was feasible, but home monitoring of fetal heart tones and fundal height were not assessed. More frequent weight measurement did not lower rates of excessive weight gain. Home monitoring of blood pressure for individuals with medical conditions was feasible, accurate, and associated with lower clinic utilization. There were no differences in health outcomes for patients without medical conditions who received telemedicine visits for routine prenatal care, and patients had decreased care utilization. Telemedicine was a successful strategy for consultations among individuals with medical conditions; resulted in improved outcomes for patients with depression, diabetes, and hypertension; and had inconsistent results for patients with obesity and those at risk of preterm birth. Existing evidence for many components of prenatal care delivery, including visit frequency, routine pregnancy assessments, and telemedicine, is limited.","Barrera, Powell, Biermann, Siden, Nguyen, Roberts, James, Chopra, Peahl","https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000004535","20211217","COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Infant, Newborn; Michigan; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; Prenatal Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; SARS-CoV-2; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-21","",24164,""
