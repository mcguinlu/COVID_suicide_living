"The Evidence Base for the Benefits of Functional Septorhinoplasty and its Future Post COVID-19","Ever since the introduction of the concept of Procedures of Limited Clinical Value (PoLCV), procedures such as functional septorhinoplasty have been subject to additional funding restrictions within the British National Health Service. Recent publications have suggested that 10% of Clinical Commissioning Groups in the United Kingdom no longer fund septorhinoplasty surgery irrespective of the indications, including congenital malformations or post-trauma, and despite the strong evidence available in the literature in treating a range of health conditions. Thus, inequity exists across the country. At present functional septorhinoplasty surgery is frequently but incorrectly grouped together with aesthetic rhinoplasty, both of which are deemed to be cosmetic interventions. Moreover, as we exit the peak of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, procedures deemed to be of lower clinical priority will potentially be at risk throughout Europe. The purpose of this review is twofold; the first is to put forward the evidence to commissioners in favor of functional septorhinoplasty surgery on patient well-being and mental health; the second is to demonstrate why functional septorhinoplasty surgery is a distinct procedure from aesthetic rhinoplasty and why it ought not to be classified as a procedure of limited clinical value.","Unadkat, Pendolino, Auer, Khwaja, Randhawa, Andrews, Saleh","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1725162","20210306","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-07","",11589,""
"Implementation of a fully digital histology course in the anatomical teaching curriculum during COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, many medical schools are forced to switch courses of the mandatory curriculum to online teaching formats. However, little information about feasibility and effectiveness is available yet about distance teaching in anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a histology course previously taught in a classroom setting into an online-only format based on video conference software. Our course design included theoretical introductions, an online-adaptation of virtual microscopy used previously in the classroom, and active learning elements such as collaborative learning in breakout rooms, annotation assignments and multiple-choice questions. Two preclinical semester cohorts of around 400 second and third semester students were taught in histology in parallel courses, using the Zoom software platform. We analyzed data about student attendance during the course, summative quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the students and results of a written test required to pass the course. We observed that student attendance was high and stable during the 19 course days for both second and third semester, and only few students reported technical problems. There were no significant differences in examination results of second semester compared to the third semester, an unexpected result as the third semester already participated in the dissection course before. Similarly, no significant gender-related effects on the examination performance could be noted in both semesters. However, the age of students was negatively correlated with test scores in the second and third semester. Importantly, the overall evaluation of the digital version of the histology course was at least as positive as the in-person version over the past years. Together, we experienced that the implementation of a curricular histology course in an online-format is technically realizable, effective and well accepted among students. We also observed that availability and prior experience with digitized specimen in virtual microscopy facilitates transition into an online-only setting. Thus, our study supports the positive potential of distance learning for teaching anatomy during and after COVID-19 pandemic but also emphasizes the need for a synchronous learning environment with partially personnel-intensive small group settings to overcome passivity and inequality aspects, and to foster active learning elements.","Darici, Reissner, Brockhaus, Missler","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aanat.2021.151718","20210306","COVID-19; anatomy teaching; digital histology course; histology teaching; medical education; online histology course","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-07","",11590,""
"Sports Medicine Physician Decision-Making, Practice Changes, and Mental Health During the Early Phase of the SARS-CoV-2 Global Pandemic","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a profound effect on the healthcare system. This study aimed to identify its effects on sports medicine physicians during the early phase of this pandemic. Survey study. Sports medicine providers. Physician members of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine were surveyed between March 25 and April 4, 2020. A total of 810 responses were obtained from 2437 physicians who viewed the survey. The survey consisted of questions examining demographics, prepandemic practice patterns, anxiety and depression screening, and new beliefs and behaviors following government-based medical policy changes resulting from the pandemic. Changes in clinical volume and treatment practices, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). The mean in-person clinic visits reduced to 17.9%, telephone visits to 24.4%, telemedicine (video) visits to 21.8%, and procedural visits to 13.8% of prepandemic practice volume. The mean PHQ-4 scores for physicians were 2.38 Ã‚Â± 2.40. Clinic and procedural volumes were reduced less by male physicians, as well as more experienced physicians, nonphysical medicine and rehabilitation training background, in government or private practice, and in the Southern region of the United States (P &lt; 0.05). Physicians were more likely to reduce their anti-inflammatory (37.8% decreasing vs 6.8% increasing, P &lt; 0.001) and opioid (10.5% vs 6.8%, P = 0.003) prescriptions rather than increase. During the early phase of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic sports medicine physicians reported reducing in-person evaluation, management, and procedure volume by over 80%.

"Analysis of the prevalence and influencing factors of depression and anxiety among maintenance dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","Currently, the COVID-19 outbreak and its spread around the globe is significantly affecting mental health and health in general, worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only a few studies address the potential direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health. A total of 321 maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were selected using random sampling from the hemodialysis center of the second people's Hospital of Yibin. They completed Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, Zung's self-rating depression scale (SDS) for depression, and the activity of daily living scale (ADL) for the ability of living. Demographic data and laboratory tests were used to analyze the risk factors. The proportions of the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were between 34.89% and 30.02%, respectively, among the MHD patients. The SAS and SDS scores of the 321 patients were 45.42(Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.99) and 45.23(Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.59), respectively. The results show that monthly income, medical insurance, vascular access, the duration of dialysis, complication, hemoglobin (HGB), immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and blood phosphorus (P) are factors that influence anxiety among patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 for all). Vascular access, monthly income, medical insurance, complication, CRP, Alb, are factors that influence depression among patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 for all). Our results suggest that during the pandemic period, the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among MHD patients increased. Some demographic and clinical variables were associated with it. We should, therefore, pay more attention to the patients' psychology, start targeted intervention to alleviate the patients' anxiety and further improve their quality of life.","Hao, Tang, Huang, Ao, Wang, Xie","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11255-021-02791-0","20210306","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Logistic models; Maintenance hemodialysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-07","",11592,""

"The relationship between frontline nurses' psychosocial status, satisfaction with life and resilience during the prevalence of COVID-19 disease","The present study aimed to investigate the association between frontline nurse's psychosocial status, satisfaction with life and resilience during the prevalence of COVID-19 disease. A cross-sectional study. 185 frontline nurses taking care of the COVID-19 patients participated in the study from March to April 2020. The data were collected using demographic questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). The results showed that not being at risk of coronavirus infection, poor/no satisfaction with life and non-resilience were significantly associated with higher psychological disorders. The coronavirus disease has significant consequences for the mental health of nurses. The factors affecting the mental health of nurses should be considered to support nurses in crises such as coronavirus.

"Drivers and mediators of healthcare workers' anxiety in one of the most affected hospitals by COVID-19: a qualitative analysis","To report the driving and mediating factors of healthcare workers' anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative indepth interview study. The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. 53 healthcare workers who were or were not diagnosed with COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers were initially not sufficiently psychologically prepared. Then they suffered from severe anxiety and apprehension during the peak stage, regardless of whether they were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not. These negative emotions were exacerbated by four drivers, namely infection risk, supplies, isolation and media. As the epidemic gradually came under control, healthcare workers experienced less anxiety from these factors, but became concerned about their low financial status. To reduce anxiety, healthcare workers diverted their attention from the risk of infection through personal entertainment and religious beliefs and focused on treating their patients. Furthermore, assistance from other people, including colleagues, families, friends, patients and society, helped protect healthcare workers from anxiety. Personal and social support can relieve healthcare workers' anxiety to some extent during the different stages of an epidemic. Both protective equipment and financial allowance motivate healthcare workers to focus on patient care, although the latter matters more as the epidemic comes under control.","Fang, Xia, Tian, Hao, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045048","20210306","COVID-19; mental health; qualitative research; quality in health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-07","",11595,""
"Scaling Up Maternal Mental healthcare by Increasing access to Treatment (SUMMIT) through non-specialist providers and telemedicine: a study protocol for a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial","Depression and anxiety impact up to 1 in 5 pregnant and postpartum women worldwide. Yet, as few as 20% of these women are treated with frontline interventions such as evidence-based psychological treatments. Major barriers to uptake are the limited number of specialized mental health treatment providers in most settings, and problems with accessing in-person care, such as childcare or transportation. Task sharing of treatment to non-specialist providers with delivery on telemedicine platforms could address such barriers. However, the equivalence of these strategies to specialist and in-person models remains unproven. This study protocol outlines the Scaling Up Maternal Mental healthcare by Increasing access to Treatment (SUMMIT) randomized trial. SUMMIT is a pragmatic, non-inferiority test of the comparable effectiveness of two types of providers (specialist vs. non-specialist) and delivery modes (telemedicine vs. in-person) of a brief, behavioral activation (BA) treatment for perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Specialists (psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers with Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of therapy experience) and non-specialists (nurses and midwives with no formal training in mental health care) were trained in the BA protocol, with the latter supervised by a BA expert during treatment delivery. Consenting pregnant and postpartum women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1368) will be randomized to one of four arms (telemedicine specialist, telemedicine non-specialist, in-person specialist, in-person non-specialist), stratified by pregnancy status (antenatal/postnatal) and study site. The primary outcome is participant-reported depressive symptoms (EPDS) at 3Ã‚Â months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes are maternal symptoms of anxiety and trauma symptoms, perceived social support, activation levels and quality of life at 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-randomization, and depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-month post-randomization. Primary analyses are per-protocol and intent-to-treat. The study has successfully continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with needed adaptations, including temporary suspension of the in-person arms and ongoing randomization to telemedicine arms. The SUMMIT trial is expected to generate evidence on the non-inferiority of BA delivered by a non-specialist provider compared to specialist and telemedicine compared to in-person. If confirmed, results could pave the way to a dramatic increase in access to treatment for perinatal depression and anxiety. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04153864 .

"A thematic study: impact of COVID-19 pandemic on rare disease organisations and patients across ten jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region","This study assesses the areas and extent of impact of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on rare disease (RD) organisations in the Asia Pacific region. There is no existing literature that focuses on such impact on RD organisations in any jurisdictions, nor RD populations across multiple jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to RD organisations between April and May 2020. Quantitative and qualitative data on the impact of COVID-19 on RD organisations and patients were collected from the organisation representative's perspective. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. A follow-up focus group meeting was conducted in August 2020 to validate the survey findings and to discuss specific needs, support and recommendations for sustainable healthcare systems during the pandemic. A total of 80 RD organisations from Australia, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, India, Japan, mainland China, Malaysia, New Zealand, theÃ‚Â Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan participated in the study. Of all, 89% were concerned about the impact of pandemic on their organisations. Results indicate that 63% of the organisations functioned at a reduced capacity and 42% stated a decrease in funding as their biggest challenge. Overall, 95% believed their patients were impacted, particularly in healthcare access, social lives, physical health, psychological health and financial impact. Specifically, 43% identified the reduced healthcare access as their top impact, followed by 26% about the impact on daily living and social life. Focus group meeting discussed differential impact across jurisdictions and point towards telemedicine and digitalisation as potential solutions. This serves as the first study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on RD patients and organisations across multiple jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region, identifying major themes on the impact on both RD patients and organisations. By including 80 organisations from ten jurisdictions, our study presents the most comprehensive assessment of the pandemic's impact to date. It highlights the need for mental health support and sheds light on moving towards telemedicine and digitalisation of organisation operation, which constitutes a sustainable model in times of pandemics and beyond.","Chung, Ng, Jain, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-021-01766-9","20210306","Asia Pacific; COVID-19; Rare disease; Rare disease organisation; Rare disease patients; Thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-07","",11597,""
"Cross-sectional survey of depressive symptoms and suicide-related ideation at a Japanese national university during the COVID-19 stay-home order","We aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms as well as suicide-related ideation among Japanese university students during the stay-home order necessitated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Japan, and offer evidence in support of future intervention to depression and suicide prevention strategies among college and university students. The data for this cross-sectional study were derived from the Student Mental Health Survey conducted from May 20 to June 16, 2020 at a national university in Akita prefecture. Among the 5111 students recruited, 2712 participated in this study (response rate, 53%; mean age Ã‚Â± standard deviation, 20.5 Ã‚Â±3.5 years; men, 53.8%). Depressive symptoms were identified by using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The prevalence of moderate depressive symptoms based on a PHQ-9 score Ã¢â€°Â¥10 and suicide-related ideation based on question 9 of PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥1, which encompasses thoughts of both suicide and self-harm, was 11.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that risk factors for depression included being a woman, smoking, alcohol consumption, and social network communication using either video or voice. For suicide-related ideation, alcohol consumption was the only risk factor. Exercise and having someone to consult about worries were associated with decreased risk of both depressive symptoms and suicide-related ideation. Negative lifestyles of smoking and drinking, and being a woman, may be important risk factors for depressive symptoms, whereas exercise and having someone to consult about worries may be protective factors.","Nomura, Minamizono, Maeda, Kim, Iwata, Hirayama, Ono, Fushimi, Goto, Mishima, Yamamoto","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12199-021-00953-1","20210306","COVID-19 pandemic; Depressive symptoms; Stay-home order; Suicide-related ideation; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-07","",11598,""
"Harm Reduction for Adolescents and Young Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of Community Care in Reach","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged the ability of harm reduction programs to provide vital services to adolescents, young adults, and people who use drugs, thereby increasing the risk of overdose, infection, withdrawal, and other complications of drug use. To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on harm reduction services for adolescents and young adults in Boston, we conducted a quantitative assessment of the Community Care in Reach (CCIR) youth pilot program to determine gaps in services created by its closure during the peak of the pandemic (March 19-June 21, 2020). We also conducted semistructured interviews with staff members at 6 harm reduction programs in Boston from April 27 through May 4, 2020, to identify gaps in harm reduction services, changes in substance use practices and patterns of engagement with people who use drugs, and how harm reduction programs adapted to pandemic conditions. During the pandemic, harm reduction programs struggled to maintain staffing, supplies, infection control measures, and regular connection with their participants. During the 3-month suspension of CCIR mobile van services, CCIR missed an estimated 363 contacts, 169 units of naloxone distributed, and 402 syringes distributed. Based on our findings, we propose the following recommendations for sustaining harm reduction services during times of crisis: pursuing high-level policy changes to eliminate political barriers to care and fund harm reduction efforts; enabling and empowering harm reduction programs to innovatively and safely distribute vital resources and build community during a crisis; and providing comprehensive support to people to minimize drug-related harms.","Noyes, Yeo, Yerton, Plakas, Keyes, Obando, Gaeta, Taveras, Chatterjee","https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354921999396","20210306","COVID-19; adolescent; harm reduction; opioid epidemic; opioid-related disorders; substance use; young adult; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-07","",11599,""
"Changes of Gambling Patterns during COVID-19 in Sweden, and Potential for Preventive Policy Changes A Second Look Nine Months into the Pandemic","Gambling has been suggested as one of the potential mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In earlier self-report studies, increased gambling has been reported by a limited proportion of respondents characterized with a high degree of problem gambling. The present study, carried out with the same methodology and in the same geographical setting, around seven months later in the pandemic, aimed to repeat and to extend the understanding of potential gambling changes in the population during COVID-19. An anonymous sample of web panel members was assessed, altogether 2029 individuals (52% women, 10% moderate-risk or problem gamblers). Results indicated that 6% reported increased gambling, and 4% reported decreased gambling during the pandemic. Having increased gambling was associated with more severe gambling problems (OR 2.78, 95% confidence interval 2.27-3.40), increased alcohol consumption (OR 2.92, 1.71-4.98), and psychological distress (OR 3.38, 1.83-6.23). In the group reporting increased gambling during COVID-19, moderate-risk/problem gambling was very common (62%). Recent governmental policy interventions in the area were known to a minority (30%) of respondents, but awareness of the regulations was markedly more common in individuals with at least moderate-risk gambling (56%) and in self-excluders (78%). Reporting of any perceived influence from policy changes was low (3%), and divided between those reporting an increasing and decreasing effect, respectively. Increased gambling may be a consequence of COVID-19-related changes in everyday lives of individuals with problematic gambling patterns. Thus, a vulnerable group demonstrates higher rates of gambling migration and psychosocial problems, and may require particular attention in screening and treatment contexts, and further scientific evaluations.","HÃƒÂ¥kansson, Widinghoff","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052342","20210306","COVID-19; gambling disorder; legislation; pandemic; policy; problem gambling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-07","",11600,""
"Assessing the Psychological Impact of COVID-19 among College Students: An Evidence of 15 Countries","Mental health issues among college students is a leading public health concern, which seems to have been exacerbating during the COVID-19 pandemic. While previous estimates related to psychological burden among college students are available, quantitative synthesis of available data still needs to be performed. Therefore, this meta-analysis endeavors to present collective evidence discussing the psychological impact of COVID-19 among college students. Bibliographical library databases, including Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO, were systematically searched for relevant studies. Titles, abstracts, and full articles were screened, and two reviewers extracted data. Heterogeneity was assessed by I<sup>2</sup> statistic. The random-effects model was utilized to obtain the pooled estimates of psychological indicators among college students. Location, gender, level of severity, and quality scores were used as moderator variables for subgroup analyses. Funnel plot and Egger linear regression test was used to assess publication bias. Twenty-seven studies constituting 90,879 college students met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated 39.4% anxiety (95% CI: 28.6, 51.3; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.8%; <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.0001) and 31.2% depression (95% CI: 19.7, 45.6; I<sup>2</sup>= 99.8%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) among college students. The pooled prevalence of stress (26.0%), post-traumatic stress disorder (29.8%), and impaired sleep quality (50.5%) were also reported. College students bear a disproportionate burden of mental health problems worldwide, with females having higher anxiety and depression levels than males.

The policies should be reflective of demographic and socioeconomic differentials.","Batra, Sharma, Batra, Singh, Schvaneveldt","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9020222","20210306","COVID-19; SARS-COV-2; anxiety; depression; stress; students; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-07","",11601,""
"Nationwide Lockdown, Population Density, and Financial Distress Brings Inadequacy to Manage COVID-19: Leading the Services Sector into the Trajectory of Global Depression","The service industry provides distributive services, producer services, personal services, and social services. These services largely breakdowns due to restrictions on border movements, confined travel and transportation services, a decline in international tourists' visitation, nationwide lockdowns, and maintaining social distancing in the population. Although these measures are highly needed to contain coronavirus, it decreases economic and financial activities in a country, which requires smart solutions to globally subsidize the services sector. The study used different COVID-19 measures, and its resulting impact on the services industry by using world aggregated data from 1975 through 2020. The study benefited from the Keynesian theory of aggregate demand that remains provided a solution to minimize economic shocks through stringent or liberalizing economic policies. The COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than the financial shocks of 2018 that affected almost all sectors of the globalized world, particularly the services sector, which has been severally affected by COVID-19; it is a high time to revisit economic policies to control pandemic recession. The study used quantiles regression and innovation accounting matrix to obtain ex-ante and ex-post analysis. The quantile regression estimates show that causes of death by communicable diseases, including COVID-19, mainly decline the share of services value added to the global GDP at different quantiles distribution. In contrast, word-of-mouth helps to prevent it from the transmission channel of coronavirus plague through information sharing among the general masses. The control of food prices and managing physical distancing reduces suspected coronavirus cases; however, it negatively affects the services sector's value share. The smart lockdown and sound economic activities do not decrease coronavirus cases, while they support increasing the percentage of the services sector to the global GDP. The innovation accounting matrix suggested that smart lockdown, managing physical distancing, effective price control, and sound financial activities will help to reduce coronavirus cases that will further translate into increased services value-added for the next ten years. The social distancing will exert a more considerable variance error shock to the services industry, which indicates the viability of these measures to contained novel coronavirus over a time horizon. The study used the number of proxies to the COVID-19 measures on the service sector that can be continued with real-time variables to obtain more inferences.","Yu, Anser, Peng, Nassani, Askar, Zaman, Abdul Aziz, Qazi Abro, Sasmoko, Jabor","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9020220","20210306","COVID-19; lockdown; quantile regression; services value-added; social distancing; word-of-mouth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-07","",11602,""

"A Review of Canadian Cancer-Related Clinical Practice Guidelines and Resources during the COVID-19 Pandemic","(1) Background: Preventive measures taken in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have adversely affected an entire range of cancer-related medical activities. The reallocation of medical resources, staff, and ambulatory services, as well as critical shortages in pharmaceutical and medical supplies have compelled healthcare professionals to prioritize patients with cancer to treatment and screening services based on a set of classification criteria in cancer-related guidelines. Cancer patients themselves have been affected on multiple levels, and addressing their concerns poses another challenge to the oncology community. (2) Methods: We conducted a Canada-wide search of cancer-related clinical practice guidelines on the management and prioritization of individuals into treatment and screening services. We also outlined the resources provided by Canadian cancer charities and patient advocacy groups to provide cancer patients, or potential cancer patients, with useful information and valuable support resources.
