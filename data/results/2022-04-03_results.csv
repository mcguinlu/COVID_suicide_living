"Psychometric validity and reliability of the 10- and 2-item Connor-Davidson resilience scales among a national sample of Americans responding to the Covid-19 pandemic: an item response theory analysis","Psychometric validity/reliability of 10-item and 2-item abbreviations of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10; CD-RISC-2) was investigated via item response theory and classic approaches. We sampled 5023 adult American participants in a June/July 2020 survey on the COVID-19 pandemic's psychological effects. Our questionnaire incorporated the CD-RISC-10 with other validated measures. CD-RISC-10 items were ranked on item-to-scale correlations, loadings on a one-factor confirmatory factor analysis model, and item slope/threshold parameters plus information curves from a unidimensional graded response model. Concurrent validity of the highest ranked item pair was evaluated vis-ÃƒÂ -vis the CD-RISC-10 and CD-RISC-2. Internal consistency, based on average variance extracted (AVE) and multiple reliability coefficients, was also compared. Convergent/divergent validity was tested by correlating anxiety, depression, fear of COVID-19, anxiety sensitivity, coping, and personality measures with both scales and the highest ranked item pair. Binary agreement/classification indexes assessed inter-rater reliability. Items 2 and 9 from CD-RISC-10 ranked the highest. Reliability coefficients wereÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.93,Ã¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.72, andÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.82 for the CD-RISC-10, CD-RISC-2, vs summation of items 2 and 9. AVEs were 0.66, 0.67, and 0.77. CD-RISC abbreviations and theÃ‚Â summation ofÃ‚Â items 2 and 9 correlated negatively with anxiety (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°- 0.43), depression (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°- 0.42), and fear of COVID-19 (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°- 0.34); positively with emotional stability (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.53) and conscientiousness (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.40). Compared to the CD-RISC-2, summative scores of items 2 and 9 more efficiently classified/discriminated high resilience on the CD-RISC-10. We confirmed construct validity/reliability of copyrighted CD-RISC abbreviations. The CD-RISC-10's items 2 and 9 were psychometrically more salient than the CD-RISC-2.","Waddimba, Baker, Pogue, McAuliffe, Bennett, Baxter, Mohr, Warren","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-022-03125-y","20220402","CD-RISC-10; CD-RISC-2; COVID-19 pandemic; Graded response model; Item response theory; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-03","",29517,""
"Acceptability of the 'Crisis Toolbox': a skills-based intervention delivered in a Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team during COVID-19","Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Teams (CRHTTs) provide 24-hour, seven day per week support for people in crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant demand on urgent care and increased the need for brief interventions in CRHTT settings with flexible methods of delivery. This evaluation aimed to examine client satisfaction with the 'Crisis Toolbox' (CTB), a brief, skills-based intervention delivered in one CRHTT during COVID-19. All participants who received the CTB completed a satisfaction questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were calculated to quantify acceptability and qualitative themes were generated using thematic analysis. Fifty-eight people participated, all of whom reported high levels of satisfaction with the CTB. Four qualitative themes also emerged relating to 'Active ingredients of the CTB', 'The therapeutic relationship', 'Service-user preferences' and 'Expectations and continuity of care'. The CTB appears to be a valued intervention. Further research is now needed to assess its clinical impact and effect on operational indicators.","Mulligan, Neil, Johnstone, Morris, Swift","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-022-00963-5","20220402","Adult Mental Health; Brief psychological interventions, Telephone interventions, service evaluation; Crisis Resolution Home Treatment; Satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-03","",29518,""
"Addressing suicide risk in patients living with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond","Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive illnesses characterized by decline in cognitive function that impairs performing daily activities. People with ADRD are at an increased risk of suicide, especially those who have comorbid mental health conditions, have specific types of ADRD, or have been recently diagnosed. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the distress of people with ADRD, a population also at increased risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus. In this article, we draw on a case study and use the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide to help describe the association between ADRD and suicide risk. Secondly, we call for new strategies to mitigate suicide risk in people living with ADRD during and beyond the current pandemic by using lessons learned from cancer care. Our goal is not to dictate solutions but rather to start the conversation by outlining a framework for future research aimed at preventing death by suicide in people with ADRD. Specifically, we draw on the updated Framework for Developing and Evaluating Complex Interventions to reflect on the complexity of the issue and to break it down into achievable parts to reduce the risk of suicidal behavior (ideation, plans, attempts) in those living with ADRD.","Portacolone, Byers, Halpern, Barnes","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnac042","20220402","Healthcare Policy; Mental health; Physician-patient communication/relationships; Quality of care; Technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-03","",29519,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Oral Health of Patients with Special Needs","In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global public health emergency due to the spread of COVID-19, and medical and dental elective care was suspended, disproportionally affecting persons with special needs. As many of the special needs population live in a communal environment, they were at higher risk of being infected with and dying of COVID-19. Consequently, their access to medical and dental services was limited to emergency care. A method of reaching these populations evolved by the expansion of telehealth, including dentistry, to provide diagnosis, management, prevention, and provision of psychosocial support for patients.","Ettinger, Marchini, Zwetchkenbaum","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cden.2022.01.001","20220402","Aged; COVID-19; Frail elderly; Mental health; Oral health; Special needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-03","",29520,""
"Suicidal behaviours among Ugandan university students: a cross-sectional study","Suicide remains the leading cause of death among university students often resulting from multiple physical and psychological challenges. Moreover, suicidal behaviours among students appear to have increased due to the COVID-19 pandemicÃ‚Â according toÃ‚Â some studies. To explore the prevalence and associated factors for suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts among university students in Uganda. Cross-sectional study data were collected from May to September 2021 from 540 undergraduate university students in south-western Uganda (363 males, mean age 23.3Ã‚Â years). Questions from the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) were used to assess suicidal ideation, while other bespoke questions were used to assess suicide plans and attempts. The survey also investigated the suicide attempt/plan method, location of the suicidal activity, and reason for not enacting the suicide plan. Three independent regression analyses were used to determine the factors associated with different forms of suicidal behaviours. The prevalence of past-year suicidal behaviours was 31.85% for suicidal ideation, 8.15% for suicide plans, and 6.11% for suicide attempts. Having a chronic physical medical condition increased the likelihood of having all forms of suicidal behaviours. Suicidal ideation was associated with having difficulty paying university tuition fees. However, being in the fifth year of university education, and feeling satisfied with current academic grades reduced the likelihood of suicidal ideation. Individuals feeling satisfied with academic performance appeared to be a protective factor against having suicide plans. Suicide attempts were associated with having a history of sexual abuse and having difficulty paying university tuition fees. The most common method used for attempted suicide was a drug overdose, and the most common location for attempted suicide was their homes. University students have prevalent suicide behaviours especially among students with a chronic physical medical condition, a history of sexual abuse, and problems paying university tuition fees. Based on the present study, for students at risk, universities should provide appropriate interventions such as life skills education and suicide prevention techniques.","Kaggwa, Arinaitwe, Muwanguzi, Nduhuura, Kajjimu, Kule, Najjuka, Nkola, Ajuna, Wamala, Machacha, Mamun, Ho, Griffiths, Rukundo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03858-7","20220402","COVID-19; Chronic physical medical conditions; Suicide; Uganda; University students; University tuition fees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-03","",29521,""
"Coping with Covid-19: stress, control and coping among pregnant women in Ireland during the Covid-19 pandemic","The aim of the current study is to investigate the relationship between perceived control, coping and psychological distress among pregnant women in Ireland during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is hypothesised that lower levels of perceived control, greater use of avoidant coping and greater Covid-19 related pregnancy concern will be associated with psychological distress. In addition, it is hypothesised that the relationship between Covid-19 related pregnancy concern and psychological distress will be moderated by perceived control and avoidant coping. The study is cross-sectional, utilizing an online questionnaire, which was completed by 761 women in January 2021. The questionnaire includes measures of perceived control, coping style, perceived stress, anxiety and depression. Correlation analyses found that lower levels of perceived control were associated with higher levels of avoidant coping and psychological distress. There was also a significant positive relationship between avoidant coping and psychologicalÃ‚Â distress. Using multiple regression, perceived control, avoidant coping and Covid-19 related pregnancy concern were found to predict 51% of the variance in psychological distress. However, in the moderation analysis, perceived control and avoidant coping were not found to moderate the relationship between Covid-19 related pregnancy concern and psychological distress. The results from this study suggest that pregnant women in Ireland are experiencing increased levels of psychological distress during the Covid-19 pandemic. The findings also suggest that perceptions of control and avoidant coping are associated with psychological distress in this group and could be used as intervention targets.","Crowe, Sarma","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04579-1","20220402","Control; Coping; Covid-19; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-03","",29522,""
"Factors associated with physical activity reduction in Swedish older adults during the first COVID-19 outbreak: a longitudinal population-based study","Physical activity (PA) decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among older adults, potentially leading to adverse consequences for their health. However, factors associated with reductions of PA during the pandemic have not been examined in a population-based sample of older adults. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the association of pre-pandemic physical, mental, social and lifestyle factors with reductions in PA in older adults during the first wave of COVID-19, and whether the associations differed by age and sex. A population-based sample of 624 participants aged 65-99 years were identified from the Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) COVID19 Study. Information on pre-pandemic factors was collected through clinical examinations, interviews, and self-administered questionnaires in 2016-2019. Changes in light and intense PA during the first wave of the pandemic (May-September 2020) were self-reported. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression models, stratified by age (&lt;70 vs. &gt;80 years) and sex. There was an association between pre-pandemic levels of higher depressive symptom burden (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.6, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.1-6.4, &lt;70 years), and impaired balance (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.8, &gt;80 years old) with reductions in light-intensity PA. Furthermore, the presence of musculoskeletal disease (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-2.9, &lt;70 years; OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2-4.4, men), moderate/high levels of neuroticism (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.6, &lt;70 years; OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3-3.5, women), and poor levels of social support (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-4.3, &gt;80 years) were related to reductions in higher-intensity PA. Those who were current smokers (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.8, &lt;70 years; OR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.06-0.7, women), or had impaired balance (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8, &gt;80 years) were less likely to reduce their levels of higher-intensity PA. For future pandemics or waves of COVID-19, development of strategies is warranted for older individuals with psychiatric- or physical illness/dysfunction, as well as those with poor social support to counteract reductions in physical activities.","SjÃƒÂ¶berg, Triolo, Saadeh, Dekhtyar, CalderÃƒÂ³n-LarraÃƒÂ±aga, Welmer","https://doi.org/10.1186/s11556-022-00287-z","20220402","COVID-19; Epidemiology; Older adults; Physical Activity; Population-based study; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-03","",29523,""
"Opioid-Related Public Health Communication Campaigns: An Environmental Scan","The opioid overdose epidemic continues to devastate lives across the United States and has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we review 166 online-accessible opioid-related campaigns to understand the current state of the science and practice of campaigns to address the opioid crisis. The findings suggest that health promotion practitioners can have a greater impact on reducing overdose deaths if they move beyond awareness-raising messaging about opioid misuse and place a greater emphasis on driving demand for evidence-based treatments such as medications for opioid use disorder and on reducing stigma related to treatment and recovery.","Frkovich, Hedrick, Anakaraonye, Bornkessel, Lefebvre","https://doi.org/10.1177/08901171221082471","20220402","health communication; opioid use disorder; overdose prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-03","",29524,""
