"Informing Canada's Health System Response to COVID-19: Priorities for Health Services and Policy Research","To inform Canada's research response to COVID-19, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Institute of Health Services and Policy Research (IHSPR) conducted a rapid-cycle priority identification process. Seven COVID-19 priorities for health services and policy research were identified: system adaptation and organization of care; resource allocation decision-making and ethics; rapid synthesis and comparative policy analysis of the COVID-19 response and outcomes; healthcare workforce; virtual care; long-term consequences of the pandemic; and public and patient engagement. Three additional cross-cutting themes were identified: supporting the health of Indigenous Peoples and vulnerable populations, data and digital infrastructure, and learning health systems and knowledge platforms. IHSPR hopes these research priorities will contribute to the broader ecosystem for collective research investment and action.","McMahon, Nadigel, Thompson, Glazier","https://doi.org/10.12927/hcpol.2020.26249","20200819","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-20","",3986,""
"The emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with progressive multiple sclerosis","Individuals with pre-existing chronic illness have shown increased anxiety and depression due to COVID-19. Here, we examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional symptomatology and quality of life in individuals with Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PMS). Data were obtained during a randomized clinical trial on rehabilitation taking place at 11 centers in North America and Europe. Participants included 131 individuals with PMS. Study procedures were interrupted in accordance with governmental restrictions as COVID-19 spread. During study closure, a COVID Impact Survey was administered via telephone or email to all participants, along with measures of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and MS symptomatology that were previously administered pre-pandemic. 4% of respondents reported COVID-19 infection. No significant changes were noted in anxiety, quality of life, or the impact of MS symptomatology on daily life from baseline to lockdown. While total HADS-depression scores increased significantly at follow-up, this did not translate into more participants scoring above the HADS threshold for clinically significant depression.Ã‚Â No significant relationships were noted between disease duration, processing speed ability or EDSS, and changes in symptoms of depression or anxiety. Most participants reported the impact of the virus on their psychological well-being, with a little impact on financial well-being. The perceived impact of the pandemic on physical and psychological well-being was correlated with the impact of MS symptomatology on daily life, as well as changes in depression. Overall, little change was noted in symptoms of depression or anxiety or overall quality of life.","Chiaravalloti, Amato, Brichetto, Chataway, Dalgas, DeLuca, Meza, Moore, Feys, Filippi, Freeman, Inglese, Motl, Rocca, Sandroff, Salter, Cutter, Feinstein","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-10160-7","20200819","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Progressive multiple sclerosis; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-20","",3987,""

"Editorial: How in the world are we handling COVID-19?","These are not normal times. As an editorial team, we felt that there was an urgency to reflect on our global experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic with our international colleagues. Instead of our planned debate series, we therefore commissioned a series of reflections on the impact of the pandemic on child and adolescent mental health throughout the world. We hope that you will find these reflections informative, thought-provoking, and in some cases, inspirational.","Dubicka, Carlson","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12417","20200819","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-20","",3989,""
"Debate: Recognising and responding to the mental health needs of young people in the era of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic is a 'perfect storm' for the mental health of young people, because of exposure to known risk factors for psychopathology and lack of support from the infrastructures that are normally in place to ensure safety and provide support. However, it is yet unclear if this 'perfect storm' will flood the Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health Services. The early, normative emotional responses observed may not lead to enduring psychopathology in most young people. Nevertheless, a minority of young people may show complex presentations, particularly in relation to bereavement. As epidemiology and clinical practice will reveal the actual needs of young people, the hope is that we will find the focus and determination to build new solutions to promote young people's mental health.","Danese, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12414","20200819","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-20","",3990,""

"Psychiatrists and Covid-19: What is our role during this unprecedented time?","The declaration of a Covid-19 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 has vastly changed the landscape in which mental health services function. Consideration is required to adapt services during this unusual time, ensuring continued provision of care for current patients, availability of care for patients with new-onset mental health difficulties and delivery of evidence-based support for healthcare professionals working with affected patients. Lessons can be learned from research carried out during the SARS, MERS and Ebola epidemics to ensure the delivery of efficient and effective mental health services both now and into the future.","Scriven, Geary, Kelly","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.95","20200819","COVID-19; mental health services; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-20","",3992,""
"Psychedelic Science in Post-Covid Psychiatry","The medium to long term consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known, though an increase in mental health problems are predicted. Multidisciplinary strategies across socio-economic and psychological levels may be needed to mitigate the mental health burden of COVID-19. Preliminary evidence from the rapidly progressing field of psychedelic science, shows that psilocybin assisted psychotherapy (PAP), offers a promising trans-diagnostic treatment strategy for a range of disorders with restricted and maladaptive habitual patterns of cognition and behaviour, notably depression, addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The COMPASS pathways, phase 2b double blind trial of PAP in antidepressant-free, treatment resistant depression (TRD) is underway across 19 research sites, to determine the safety, efficacy and optimal dose of psilocybin. Results from the Imperial College London Psilodep-RCT comparing the efficacy and mechanisms of action of PAP to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram will soon be published. However, the efficacy and safety of PAP in conjunction with SSRIs in TRD is not yet known. A new COMPASS study, with a centre in Dublin, will answer this question, with implications for the future delivery of PAP. While at an early stage of clinical development, and notwithstanding the immense challenges of COVID-19, PAP is likely to play an important therapeutic role for certain disorders in post COVID-19 clinical psychiatry.","Kelly, Crockett, Alexander, Haran, Baker, Burke, Brennan, O'Keane","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.94","20200819","COVID-19; Depression; coronavirus; psilocybin; psychedelics; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; treatment-resistant depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-20","",3993,""
"Telehealth Beyond COVID-19","Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health care services have been shifted from face-to-face to virtual interactions. Several health policy changes have influenced telehealth uptake during this time, including changes in technology, Internet connectivity, prescriptions, and reimbursement for services. These changes have been implemented for the duration of the pandemic, and it is unclear if all, some, or none of these new or amended policies will be retained after the pandemic has ended. Accordingly, in the wake of changing policies, mental health care providers will need to make decisions about the future of their telehealth programs. This article briefly reviews telehealth policy changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights what providers should consider for future delivery and implementation of their telehealth programs.","Haque","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000368","20200819","COVID-19; Mental health; Public policy issues; Telecommunications; Telehealth; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-20","",3994,""
"[Effects on the integrated treatment of colorectal cancer patients during COVID-19 epidemic in China: a cross-sectional study]","<b>Objective:</b> To understand the treatment status and effects on colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide evidence for decision-making for health-care workers. <b>Methods:</b> The method of cross-sectional study was applied. A questionnaire survey of CRC patients in China was carried out. Their basic and treatment information during the COVID-19 were collected and associated effects on treatment, nursing, state of psychology and needs of social support were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Of the 1147 participants in the study, 635 (55.4%) were male and 512 (44.6%) were female with mean age of (52.8Ã‚Â±12.8) years. The treatment or follow up of 896 (78.1%) CRC patients were affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 253 patients (22.1%) had their treatment regiments changed, of whom 141 (12.3%) had their chemotherapy regiments postponed or changed, and 83 patients (7.2%) had their surgical treatment affected. Among the above 83 patients, 39 patients (3.4%) underwent emergency surgery. A total of 277 patients (24.1%) had their out-of-hospital care needs affected, mainly due to maintenance of PICC (49.5%, 137/277). CRC patients had poorer sleep quality and increased levels of insomnia than before (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and were more distressed, anxious, depressed, and angry than they were before. They presented the more requirements of help (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). In addition, 376 patients (32.8%) had received telemedicine services, but only 36.4% (137/376) of them were satisfied. <b>Conclusions:</b> The COVID-19 epidemic has effect on the integrated treatment of CRC patients include diagnosis, treatment, examination and prognosis. While protecting CRC patients from being infected with SARS-CoV-2, health-care workers should also actively help them to receive timely and correct treatment and pay attention to their nursing, nutritional, psychological and social support needs in the COVID-19 epidemic. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã©ËœÂ²Ã¦Å½Â§Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦ÂÂ¶Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¨â€šÂ¿Ã§ËœÂ¤Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â­Â£Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¨Â¯Å Ã§â€“â€”Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã§Â»â€œÃ§â€ºÂ´Ã¨â€šÂ Ã§â„¢Å’Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¥ÂÅ Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã§Â²Â¾Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€ Â³Ã§Â­â€“Ã¦ÂÂÃ¤Â¾â€ºÃ¤Â¾ÂÃ¦ÂÂ®Ã£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¨Â¿ÂÃ§â€Â¨Ã¦Â¨ÂªÃ¦â€“Â­Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã¥Ââ€“Ã¤Â¾Â¿Ã¥Ë†Â©Ã¦Å Â½Ã¦Â Â·Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¨Å’Æ’Ã¥â€ºÂ´Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§Â»â€œÃ§â€ºÂ´Ã¨â€šÂ Ã§â„¢Å’Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦â€Â¶Ã©â€ºâ€ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Å¸ÂºÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¤Â¿Â¡Ã¦ÂÂ¯Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â§Â£Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¦Å Â¤Ã§Ââ€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ§Â­â€°Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥â€™Å’Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¦Â±â€šÃ¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¥â€¦Â±1 147Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã§Â»â€œÃ§â€ºÂ´Ã¨â€šÂ Ã§â„¢Å’Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§ÂºÂ³Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§â€Â·Ã¦â‚¬Â§635Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†55.4%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¥Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§512Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†44.6%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€žÃ¯Â¼Ë†52.8Ã‚Â±12.8Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Â²ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š78.1%Ã¯Â¼Ë†896/1 147Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»â€œÃ§â€ºÂ´Ã¨â€šÂ Ã§â„¢Å’Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å¸Â¥Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€š253Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†22.1%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â¡Ë†Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã¨Â¿Â«Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦Å½Â¨Ã¨Â¿Å¸Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Å’â€“Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â¡Ë†Ã¨â‚¬â€¦141Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†12.3%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼â€ºÃ¥â€¦Â±Ã¦Å“â€°83Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†7.2%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¦â€°â€¹Ã¦Å“Â¯Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å“â€°39Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†3.4%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦â‚¬Â¥Ã¨Â¯Å Ã¦â€°â€¹Ã¦Å“Â¯Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“â€°277Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†24.1%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©â„¢Â¢Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¦Å Â¤Ã§Ââ€ Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¦Â±â€šÃ¥Ââ€”Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å“â‚¬Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¥â€˜Â¨Ã©Ââ„¢Ã¨â€žâ€°Ã¦Â¤ÂÃ¥â€¦Â¥Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã©Ââ„¢Ã¨â€žâ€°Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã§Â®Â¡Ã§Â»Â´Ã¦Å Â¤Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ¯Â¼Ë†49.5%Ã¯Â¼Å’137/277Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€°ÂÃ§â€ºÂ¸Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§ÂÂ¡Ã§Å“Â Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨â€¹Â¦Ã¦ÂÂ¼Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€žÂ¤Ã¦â‚¬â€™Ã§Â­â€°Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã¦Â¯â€Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¤Â¸â€Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¥Â¾â€”Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¥Â¸Â®Ã¥Å Â©Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥Ââ€¡<i>P</i>&lt;0.001Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“â€°376Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†32.8%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¨Â¿Å“Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¥Å Â¡Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¤Â»â€¦Ã¦Å“â€°36.4%Ã¯Â¼Ë†137/376Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â¿Å“Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¦Â»Â¡Ã¦â€žÂÃ£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§Â»â€œÃ§â€ºÂ´Ã¨â€šÂ Ã§â„¢Å’Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¦ËœÂ¯Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¨Â¯Å Ã¦â€“Â­Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å¸Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã§Â­â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â°Â½Ã§Â®Â¡Ã¨Â¿Å“Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½Â°Ã§Â¼â€œÃ¨Â§Â£Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Æ’Â¨Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Â°Â±Ã¨Â¯Å Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¤Â»ÂÃ©Å“â‚¬Ã¦â€Â¹Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥Å Â Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¦Å Â¤Ã§Â»â€œÃ§â€ºÂ´Ã¨â€šÂ Ã§â„¢Å’Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã©ÂÂ¿Ã¥â€¦ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¹Å¸Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ§Â§Â¯Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¥Â¸Â®Ã¥Å Â©Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¨Â§â€žÃ¨Å’Æ’Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Å Â¤Ã§Ââ€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨ÂÂ¥Ã¥â€¦Â»Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÅ Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ§Â­â€°Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¦Â±â€šÃ£â‚¬â€š.","Yang, Gao, Chen, Wang, Chen, Song, Gu","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn.441530-20200416-00219","20200818","COVID-19; Colorectal neoplasms; Cross-sectional study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-20","",3995,""
