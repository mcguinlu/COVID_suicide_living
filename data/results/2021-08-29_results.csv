"Mental health and substance use associated with hospitalization among people with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in British Columbia: a population-based cohort study","Background: This study identified factors associated with hospital admission among people with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases in British Columbia. Methods: This study was performed using the BC COVID-19 Cohort, which integrates data on all COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, medical visits, emergency room visits, prescription drugs, chronic conditions and deaths. The analysis included all laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases in British Columbia as of January 15th, 2021. We evaluated factors associated with hospital admission using multivariable Poisson regression analysis with robust error variance. Findings: From 56,874 COVID-19 cases included in the analyses, 2,298 were hospitalized. Models showed significant association of the following factors with increased hospitalization risk: male sex (adjusted risk ratio (aRR)=1.27; 95%CI=1.17-1.37), older age (p-trend <0.0001 across age groups with a graded increase in hospitalization risk with increasing age [aRR 30-39 years=3.06; 95%CI=2.32-4.03, to aRR 80+years=43.68; 95%CI=33.41-57.10 compared to 20-29 years-old]), asthma (aRR=1.15; 95%CI=1.04-1.26), cancer (aRR=1.19; 95%CI=1.09-1.29), chronic kidney disease (aRR=1.32; 95%CI=1.19-1.47), diabetes (treated without insulin aRR=1.13; 95%CI=1.03-1.25, requiring insulin aRR=5.05; 95%CI=4.43-5.76), hypertension (aRR=1.19; 95%CI=1.08-1.31), injection drug use (aRR=2.51; 95%CI=2.14-2.95), intellectual and developmental disabilities (aRR=1.67; 95%CI=1.05-2.66), problematic alcohol use (aRR=1.63; 95%CI=1.43-1.85), immunosuppression (aRR=1.29; 95%CI=1.09-1.53), and schizophrenia and psychotic disorders (aRR=1.49; 95%CI=1.23-1.82). Among women of reproductive age, in addition to age and comorbidities, pregnancy (aRR=2.69; 95%CI=1.42-5.07) was associated with increased risk of hospital admission. Interpretation: Older age, male sex, substance use, intellectual and developmental disability, chronic comorbidities, and pregnancy increase the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization.

"History of suicide attempts and COVID-19 infection in Veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder: effect modification by age and obesity","Introduction: Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have a high risk of suicide, and a history of suicide attempt is a strong predictor of suicide; therefore, determining whether a history of suicide attempt is associated with COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder has implications for suicide prevention in this patient population. Methods: We carried out cross-sectional analyses of electronic health records (EHR) of Veterans with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder that received treatment at any United States Veterans Affairs Medical Center from January 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. Logistic regression was applied to estimate unadjusted and adjusted (including age, sex, race, marital status, BMI, and a medical comorbidity score) odds ratios (ORs) for COVID-19 positivity in suicide attempters relative to non-attempters. Results: A total of 101,032 Veterans [mean age 56.67 SD 13.13 years; males 91,715 (90.8%)] were included in the analyses. There were 2,703 (2.7%) suicide attempters and 719 (0.7%) patients were positive for COVID-19. There was effect modification by age and BMI in the association of history of suicide attempt with COVID-19 positivity such that the association was only significant in patients younger than 59 years and in obese (BMI [&ge;] 30) patients respectively (adjusted OR 3.42, 95% CI 2.02 - 5.79 and OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.65 - 4.94 respectively). Conclusions: Young or obese suicide attempters with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have higher rates of COVID-19 diagnosis; due to possible long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of infection with SARS-CoV-2, such patients should be monitored closely.","Olaoluwa O Okusaga; Rachel L Kember; Gina M Peloso; Roseann E Peterson; Marijana Vujkovic; Brian G Mitchell; Jared Bernard; Annette Walder; Tim B Bigdeli","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.25.21262627","20210828","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17498,""
"Depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in pregnant women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study evaluates depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in pregnant women before and during COVID-19 pandemic and analyzes their risk factors. This was a cross-sectional analyses included pregnant women with depression, anxiety, and stress levels evaluated both in the Novel Coronavirus-Pregnancy Cohort study (NCP) and the Healthy Baby Cohort study (HBC). NCP was conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, while HBC was performed before the pandemic. Multiple logistic regressions were employed to evaluate the associations between COVID-19 pandemic and other co-variables and maternal mental health. NCP and HBC studies respectively included 531 and 2352 participants. Depression rates differed significantly between the two studies (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). The mild and moderate-to-severe depression rates in NCP study were 25.8% and 10.36%, respectively, and 19.94% and 0.55% in HBC study. The stress rate of participants was higher in HBC study (69.39%) than in NCP study (60.45%) (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with higher depression but lower stress risks (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05) in pregnant women, with OR and 95% CI as 1.68 (1.16, 2.44) and 0.42 (0.29, 0.61), respectively. Pregnant women with pre-pregnancy obesity and high educational levels might have lower risks for depression, anxiety, and stress than those with normal weight and low educational levels. Depression among pregnant women was impacted by the pandemic. Apart from COVID-19 pandemic impact, pre-pregnant weight status and educational level might also influence depression, anxiety and stress statuses in pregnant women.","Mei, Li, Li, Zhang, Cao, Zhou, Cao, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110586","20210828","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Pregnant women; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17499,""
"Coping strategies adopted by Australian frontline health workers to address psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Australian COVID-19 Frontline Healthcare Workers Study investigated coping strategies and help-seeking behaviours, and their relationship to mental health symptoms experienced by Australian healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Australian HCWs were invited to participate a nationwide, voluntary, anonymous, single time-point, online survey between 27th August and 23rd October 2020. Complete responses on demographics, home and work situation, and measures of health and psychological wellbeing were received from 7846 participants. The most commonly reported adaptive coping strategies were maintaining exercise (44.9%) and social connections (31.7%). Over a quarter of HCWs (26.3%) reported increased alcohol use which was associated with a history of poor mental health and worse personal relationships. Few used psychological wellbeing apps or sought professional help; those who did were more likely to be suffering from moderate to severe symptoms of mental illness. People living in Victoria, in regional areas, and those with children at home were significantly less likely to report adaptive coping strategies. Personal, social, and workplace predictors of coping strategies and help-seeking behaviour during the pandemic were identified. Use of maladaptive coping strategies and low rates of professional help-seeking indicate an urgent need to understand the effectiveness of, and the barriers and enablers of accessing, different coping strategies.","Smallwood, Karimi, Pascoe, Bismark, Putland, Johnson, Dharmage, Barson, Atkin, Long, Ng, Holland, Munro, Thevarajan, Moore, McGillion, Willis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2021.08.008","20210828","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17500,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with primary sjÃƒÂ¶gren syndrome","The aim of this study was to investigate the perspective of Romanian patients with SjÃƒÂ¶gren syndrome (SS) on various aspects of the disease during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, including both the impact of COVID-19 on the disease itself as well as the effects of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in this group of patients. The study is an online questionnaire-based survey. We received responses from 137 SS patients. Regarding the general emotional status, 33 patients (24.0%) and 47 patients (34.3%) declared to have been sadder/depressive and more agitated/anxious during the SARS-CoV2 outbreak, respectively. During the lockdown, 49 (33.7%) patients strictly and 77 patients (56.2%) did their best to respect the home isolation measures. The income was unchanged for most of the patients (94 patients, 68.6%). Regarding access to healthcare providers, 27 patients (18.7%) postponed the consultation for fear of getting SARS-CoV2. In our study group, 31 patients (22.6%) responded that they have had COVID-19. Only one patient was completely asymptomatic, while the most frequently declared symptom was weakness (84.0%). In 17 patients among the respondents (68%) the symptoms lasted for at least 2Ã‚Â weeks; the most frequent long-lasting symptoms were fatigue (40.0%) and weakness (36.0%). Out of all the respondents, 53 patients (41.4%) were vaccinated against SARS-CoV2 with at least one dose. After the first dose, the most prevalent side effect was pain at the site of injection (89.2%), followed by weakness (25.0%) and myalgias (21.4%). This information will be useful for developing special programs dedicated to SARS-CoV2 infection and vaccination in patients with SS and other autoimmune diseases.","Serban, Mihai, Dima, Balaban, Jinga, Jurcut","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-021-04967-4","20210828","COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV2; SjÃƒÂ¶gren syndrome; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17501,""
"Change in Perceived Stress and Health Behaviors of Emerging Adults in the Midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented disruptions, restrictions, and concerns about physical and mental health. Emerging adulthood, including the first year of college, is associated with declines in healthy eating and physical activity, as well as possible heightened distress. The impact of COVID-19 may exacerbate these concerns. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in health behaviors and perceived stress in emerging adults over the first year of college and to determine whether prepandemic health behaviors were protective for mental health and stress during the initial changes after the COVID-19 pandemic. First-year college students (N = 234, 58.6% female) completed three surveys during their first year of school, the third being after the onset of COVID-19 and during a stay-at-home order. At Time 3, we also assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression. Using linear mixed modeling, sedentary time increased and physical activity decreased over time, but 20%-35% of students reported improvements in these behaviors. Dietary changes appeared mixed, with some improvements noted early during COVID-19. Perceived stress increased over time. Multiple regression indicated that of the health behaviors examined for protective effects on mental health and stress during the pandemic, only diet quality emerged as a significant predictor. Although notable declines in some health habits were observed over time, including following COVID-19 disruptions, some students reported improved health behaviors. Efforts should be directed at identifying and intervening with students most at risk for poor functioning.","LaCaille, Hooker, Marshall, LaCaille, Owens","https://doi.org/10.1093/abm/kaab074","20210828","COVID-19; Eating; Health; Mental health; Physical activity; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17502,""
"Suicidal risk and impulsivity-related traits among young Argentinean college students during a quarantine of up to 103-day duration: Longitudinal evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to examine longitudinal changes on suicidal risk levels, adjusting for impulsivity-related traits, quarantine duration, main demographic factors, mental disorder history, and loneliness, in young Argentinean college students with (ideation; attempt) and without suicidal behavior history, during a quarantine of up to 103-day duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. A longitudinal design with two-repeated measures was used (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1202). Follow-up was a month later from the first measurement. Three groups were analyzed: with suicidal ideation history, with suicide attempt history, and without suicidal behavior history. Percentages of college students with high or moderate suicidal risk were alarming (accumulated: 62.23% first measurement, 57.65% second measurement). Multilevel analysis on the three groups showed that suicidal risk diminished from the first measurement to the follow-up, having mental disorder history predicted higher suicidal risk, and negative urgency had the largest increasing effects on suicidal risk which persisted over time. Suicidal risk widely affects college students during lengthy quarantines of the COVID-19 pandemic and it should be tracked in those having pre-existing vulnerabilities, but also in those without. Education on managing negative emotions may help decrease suicide risk in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","LÃƒÂ³pez Steinmetz, Fong, Godoy","https://doi.org/10.1111/sltb.12799","20210828","impulsivity; mental disorders; multilevel analysis; suicidal ideation; suicide, attempted","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17503,""
"Psychological distress of mental health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparison with the general population in high- and low-incidence regions","Despite their essential role during this health crisis, little is known about the psychological distress of mental health workers (MHW). A total of 616 MHW and 658 workers from the general population (GP) completed an online survey including depressive, anxiety, irritability, loneliness, and resilience measures. Overall, MHW had fewer cases with above cut-off clinically significant depression (19% MHW vs. 27%) or anxiety (16% MHW vs. 29%) than the GP. MHW in high-incidence regions of COVID-19 cases displayed the same levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than the GP and higher levels compared to MHW from low-incidence regions. MHW in high-incidence regions presented higher levels of irritability and lower levels of resilience than the MHW in low-incidence regions. Moreover, MHW in high-incidence regions reported more feelings of loneliness than all other groups. Implications for social and organizational preventive strategies to minimize the distress of MHW in times of crisis are discussed.","Brillon, Philippe, Paradis, Geoffroy, Orri, Ouellet-Morin","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23238","20210828","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health workers; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17504,""
"Explaining nurses' experience of stresses and coping mechanisms in coronavirus pandemic","Nurses face several stresses during a pandemic. Therefore, it seems necessary to use appropriate adaptation and coping methods to reduce the destructive effects of physical and psychological stresses. This study aimed to explain nurses' experience of stresses and coping methods used for care of patients with Covid-19. A qualitative approach with descriptive phenomenological method was applied in this study. Sixteen nurses working in hospitals were selected by purposeful sampling. Through in-depth, individual and semi-structured interviews, the nurses shared their experiences in caring for Covid patients. The transcripts of recorded interviews were typed verbatim and then analyzed based on Colaizzi's method. Four main categories and 12 subcategories, which were named conceptually based on their nature were shaped. The main categories included; self-support in the midst of crisis, sheltered by family from distance, hospital influence in the environment, and social support on both sides of infinity. Although healthcare workers have accepted the exposure to Covid-19 as part of their profession, provision of quality care in crisis situations is not possible without supporting the healthcare workers and paying attention to their mental health. It is recommended to take a precise approach to predict, recognize and manage psychological harms of healthcare workers.","Ghorbani, Shali, Matourypour, Salehi Morkani, Salehpoor Emran, Nikbakht Nasrabadi","https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12644","20210828","Covid-19; adaptation; nurse; phenomenology; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17505,""

An additional wave of data was collected from a longitudinal cohort study of the UK Armed Forces. Online survey June-September 2020. Cohort members were included if they had completed a questionnaire at phase 3 of the King's Centre for Military Health Research health and well-being study (2014-2016), had left the Armed Forces after regular service, were living in the UK, had consented to follow-up and provided a valid email address. Invitation emails were sent to N=3547 with a 44% response rate (n=1562). Common mental health disorders (CMDs) (measured using the General Health Questionnaire, 12 items-cut-off Ã¢â€°Â¥4), hazardous alcohol use (measured using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, 10 items-cut off Ã¢â€°Â¥8) and loneliness (University of California, Los Angeles, Loneliness Scale- 3 items-cut-off Ã¢â€°Â¥6). Veterans reported a statistically significant decrease in hazardous drinking of 48.5% to 27.6%, while CMD remained stable (non-statistically significant increase of 24.5% to 26.1%). 27.4% of veterans reported feelings of loneliness. The COVID-19 stressors of reporting difficulties with family/social relationships, boredom and difficulties with health were statistically significantly associated with CMD, hazardous drinking and loneliness, even after adjustment for previous mental health/hazardous alcohol use. Our study suggests a COVID-19 impact on veterans' mental health, alcohol use and loneliness, particularly for those experiencing difficulties with family relationships. Veterans experienced the pandemic in similar ways to the general population and in some cases may have responded in resilient ways. While stable levels of CMD and reduction in alcohol use are positive, there remains a group of veterans who may need mental health and alcohol treatment services.","Sharp, Serfioti, Jones, Burdett, Pernet, Hull, Murphy, Wessely, Fear","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049815","20210828","COVID-19; epidemiology; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17506,""
"What symptoms best predict severe distress in an online survey of UK health and social care staff facing COVID-19: development of the two-item Tipping Point Index","COVID-19 has altered standard thresholds for identifying anxiety and depression. A brief questionnaire to determine when individuals are at a tipping point for severe anxiety or depression would greatly help decisions about when to seek assessment or treatment. Data were collected as part of the Frontline-COVID Study, a cross-sectional national online survey with good coverage of health and social care settings. New questionnaire items reflecting when coping was actually breaking down were compared with standard measures of severe anxiety and depression. Data were collected between 27 May and 23 July 2020. The majority of participants worked in hospitals (53%), in nursing or care homes (15%), or in other community settings (30%). Of 1194 qualifying respondents, 1038 completed the six tipping point items. Respondents included nurses, midwives, doctors, care workers, healthcare assistants, allied healthcare professionals and other non-medical staff. Over 90% were white and female. Threshold for severe anxiety according to the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 or moderately severe depression according to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Answering yes to one of two simple questions ('Over the last week have you been often feeling panicky or on the point of losing control of your emotions?', 'Over the last week have you felt complete hopelessness about the future?') demonstrated very high sensitivity (0.95, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.92 to 0.97) and negative predictive value (0.97, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.95 to 0.98).

"Mental health in the pandemic: a repeated cross-sectional mixed-method study protocol to investigate the mental health impacts of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK","The WHO declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Since then, the world has been firmly in the grip of the COVID-19. To date, more than 211 730 035 million confirmed cases and more than 4 430 697 million people have died. While controlling the virus and implementing vaccines are the main priorities, the population mental health impacts of the pandemic are expected to be longer term and are less obvious than the physical health ones. Lockdown restrictions, physical distancing, social isolation, as well as the loss of a loved one, working in a frontline capacity and loss of economic security may have negative effects on and increase the mental health challenges in populations around the world. There is a major demand for long-term research examining the mental health experiences and needs of people in order to design adequate policies and interventions for sustained action to respond to individual and population mental health needs both during and after the pandemic. This repeated cross-sectional mixed-method study conducts regular self-administered representative surveys, and targeted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with adults in the UK, as well as validation of gathered evidence through citizens' juries for contextualisation (for the UK as a whole and for its four devolved nations) to ensure that emerging mental health problems are identified early on and are properly understood, and that appropriate policies and interventions are developed and implemented across the UK and within devolved contexts. STATA and NVIVO will be used to carry out quantitative and qualitative analysis, respectively. Ethics approval for this study has been granted by the Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee of the University of Cambridge, UK (PRE 2020.050) and by the Health and Life Sciences Research Ethics Committee of De Montfort University, UK (REF 422991). While unlikely, participants completing the self-administered surveys or participating in the virtual focus groups, semi-structured interviews and citizens' juries might experience distress triggered by questions or conversations. However, appropriate mitigating measures have been adopted and signposting to services and helplines will be available at all times. Furthermore, a dedicated member of staff will also be at hand to debrief following participation in the research and personalised thank-you notes will be sent to everyone taking part in the qualitative research.Study findings will be disseminated in scientific journals, at research conferences, local research symposia and seminars. Evidence-based open access briefings, articles and reports will be available on our study website for everyone to access. Rapid policy briefings targeting issues emerging from the data will also be disseminated to inform policy and practice. These briefings will position the findings within UK public policy and devolved nations policy and socioeconomic contexts in order to develop specific, timely policy recommendations. Additional dissemination will be done through traditional and social media. Our data will be contextualised in view of existing policies, and changes over time as-and-when policies change.","Van Bortel, John, Solomon, Lombardo, Crepaz-Keay, McDaid, Yap, Weeks, Martin, Guo, Seymour, Thorpe, Morton, Davidson, Kousoulis","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046422","20210828","COVID-19; mental health; psychiatry; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17508,""
"Early Adolescent Substance Use Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Survey in the ABCD Study Cohort","Evaluate changes in early adolescent substance use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic using a prospective, longitudinal, nationwide cohort. Participants were enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. A total of 7,842 youth (mean ageÃ‚Â = 12.4Ã‚Â years, rangeÃ‚Â = 10.5-14.6) at 21 study sites across the U.S. completed a three-wave assessment of substance use between May and August 2020. Youth reported whether they had used alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, or other substances in the past 30Ã‚Â days. Data were linked to prepandemic surveys that the same youth had completed in the years 2018-2020, before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Past-30-day substance use remained stable in the 6Ã‚Â months since stay-at-home orders were first issued in U.S. states/counties; was primarily episodic (1-2Ã‚Â days in the past month); and was typically limited to a single substance. Using pretest/posttest and age-period designs, we found that compared to before the pandemic, fewer youth were using alcohol and more youth were using nicotine or misusing prescription drugs. During the pandemic, youth were more likely to use substances when they were more stressed by pandemic-related uncertainty; their family experienced material hardship; their parents used alcohol or drugs; or they experienced greater depression or anxiety. Neither engagement in social distancing nor worry about COVID-19 infection was associated with substance use. Several risk factors were stronger among older (vs. younger) adolescents. Among youth in early adolescence, advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased use of alcohol and increased use of nicotine and misuse of prescription drugs.","Pelham, Tapert, Gonzalez, McCabe, Lisdahl, Alzueta, Baker, Breslin, Dick, Dowling, Guillaume, Hoffman, Marshall, McCandliss, Sheth, Sowell, Thompson, Van Rinsveld, Wade, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.06.015","20210828","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Drinking; Drug use; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17509,""
"Denial of Justification for Vaccination: Its Multiple Related Variables and Impacts on Intention to Get Vaccinated against COVID-19","The aims of the present study were (1) to identify the variables related to denying the justification for vaccination during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Taiwan and (2) to examine the associations of such denial with perceived risk of COVID-19 and the extrinsic and intrinsic intentions to get vaccinated against COVID-19. We recruited 1047 participants by using a Facebook advertisement. We investigated whether the participants denied justification for vaccination as well as their sociodemographic characteristics, mental health status, sources of information about COVID-19 vaccination, perceived risk of COVID-19, and extrinsic and intrinsic intentions to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The results indicated that 20.0% of the participants denied justification for vaccination. Participants who were older, had an educational level below college, were not health care workers, were in poor general mental health state, or did not obtain information about COVID-19 vaccination from the Internet were more likely to deny justification for vaccination. Denial was negatively associated with both extrinsic and intrinsic intentions to get vaccinated against COVID-19 but not associated with the perceived risk of COVID-19. Multiple variables related to denying the justification for vaccination; the denial was negatively associated with the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19.","Lin, Chou, Chang, Yen","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080822","20210828","COVID-19; intention; perceived risk; vaccination; vaccine refusal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17510,""
"Distinctive Supramolecular Features of ÃŽÂ²-Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes with Antidepressants Protriptyline and Maprotiline: A Comprehensive Structural Investigation","Depression, a global mental illness, is worsened due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are efficacious for the treatment of depression, even though they have more side effects. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are powerful encapsulating agents for improving molecular stability, water solubility, and lessening the undesired effects of drugs. Because the atomic-level understanding of the ÃŽÂ²-CD-TCA inclusion complexes remains elusive, we carried out a comprehensive structural study via single-crystal X-ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) full-geometry optimization. Here, we focus on two complexes lining on the opposite side of the ÃŽÂ²-CD-TCA stability spectrum based on binding constants (<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>s) in solution, ÃŽÂ²-CD-protriptyline (PRT) <b>1</b>-most stable and ÃŽÂ²-CD-maprotiline (MPL) <b>2</b>-least stable. X-ray crystallography unveiled that in the ÃŽÂ²-CD cavity, the PRT B-ring and MPL A-ring are aligned at a nearly perfect right angle against the O4 plane and primarily maintained in position by intermolecular C-HÃ‚Â·Ã‚Â·Ã‚Â·Ãâ‚¬ interactions. The increased rigidity of the tricyclic cores is arising from the PRT -CH=CH- bridge widens, and the MPL -CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>- flexure narrows the butterfly angles, facilitating the deepest and shallower insertions of PRT B-ring (<b>1</b>) and MPL A-ring (<b>2</b>) in the distorted round ÃŽÂ²-CD cavity for better complexation. This is indicated by the DFT-derived complex stabilization energies (ÃŽâ€<i>E</i><sub>stb</sub>s), although the complex stability orders based on <i>K</i><sub>a</sub>s and ÃŽâ€<i>E</i><sub>stb</sub>s are different. The dispersion and the basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrections were considered to improve the DFT results. Plus, the distinctive 3D arrangements of <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are discussed. This work provides the first crystallographic evidence of PRT and MPL stabilized in the ÃŽÂ²-CD cavity, suggesting the potential application of CDs for efficient drug delivery.","Aree","https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14080812","20210828","DFT calculation; X-ray analysis; maprotiline; protriptyline; tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); ÃŽÂ²-cyclodextrin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-29","",17511,""
