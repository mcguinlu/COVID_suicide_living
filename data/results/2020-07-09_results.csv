"COVID-19: Water Hygiene, Air-Conditioning, and Water Treatment in The Days of COVID-19: Problems on Top of Problems","The current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed there is a need for all areas of public health to work together in a coordinated manner in order for infection prevention and control to be more effective  After a two-month containment phase, Spain is beginning ease the lockdown  In this new scenario, the environmental health services of the Spanish Autonomous Communities face challenges which are different and complementary to those of the previous phase and which must be taken into account  Thus, the reopening of establishments and industries whose water systems have been stagnant for so long can increase microbiological and even chemical risks  Likewise, the resumption of recreational activities that revolve around water-both in public swimming pools and on beaches-requires health recommendations for safe use in this new stage  The same applies to the widespread start of collective HVAC systems or of sanitation facilities, which could in theory facilitate the transmission of SARS- CoV-2 through potential new pathways  The purpose of this paper is to analyze these potential risks from an environmental health perspective in order to better prevent or minimize them, all within the context of the current lockdown-lifting phase and in view of the new scientific knowledge that is currently being generated","Crespi Rotger, Sebastian, Ordonez Iriarte, Jose Maria","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19:+Water+Hygiene,+Air-Conditioning,+and+Water+Treatment+in+The+Days+of+COVID-19:+Problems+on+Top+of+Problems","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Revista De Salud Ambiental;20(1):21-29, 2020.; Publication details: Revista De Salud Ambiental;20(1):21-29, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2572,""

In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. RESULTS: The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","Dosil SantamarÃ­a, MarÃ­a; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Redondo RodrÃ­guez, Iratxe; Jaureguizar Alboniga-Mayor, Joana; Picaza Gorrotxategi, Maitane","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment;2020 Jun 02.; Publication details: Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment;2020 Jun 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2584,""

We aimed to compare the perceived stress of dermatologists and nondermatologists, due to lock-down and COVID-19 pandemic and analyze the role of possible risk factors. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study to determine the perceived stress of doctors using the Perceived Stress Scale-10 and evaluate possible risk factors. Among 384 valid responders, we had 37.5% dermatologists and 62.5% nondermatologists. Perceived stress was more in nondermatologists compared to dermatologists, but not statistically significant (P = 0.1). Degree of stress was also comparable (P = 0.5). Higher stress was significantly associated with females and unmarried individuals in both groups. Risk of infecting self or colleagues or family members and lack of protective gear at work place were top causes of stress. Perceived stress is increased in all doctors due to COVID-19 pandemic and lock-down. Even dermatologists have developed high stress due to current situation, comparable to nondermatologists, despite being traditionally considered an outpatient speciality with minimum stress. Thus, proper mental health care policies should be adopted for all doctors, including dermatologists.","Podder, Indrashis; Agarwal, Komal; Datta, Subhendu","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dth.13788","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Dermatol Ther;: e13788, 2020 Jun 07.; Publication details: Dermatol Ther;: e13788, 2020 Jun 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2585,""
"Survey on Knowledge and Psychological Crisis Related to COVID-19 among Nursing Staff: A Cross-sectional Study","Background: Since December 2019, the prevalence of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading in the world. Nurses play a key role in fighting this disease and are at risk of infection by coronavirus. Therefore, there is a urging need to assess their mental health condition and set up appropriate interventions to reduce the negative psychiatric outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and psychological crisis related to COVID-19 among nursing staff, and to provide evidence for targeted training and psychological intervention. This cross-sectional online survey study was performed in a class three grade A general hospital from a southwest province of China from March 1 to March 15, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire of COVID-19 related prevention and control knowledge and the Triages Assessment Form (TAF) were used to assess nursing staff's knowledge of COVID-19 and their degree of psychological crisis. SPSS 23.0 was applied to compute the collected data. A total of 979 nursing staff completed the questionnaire. The results showed that nursing staff have lower number of correct answers of continuous viral nucleic acid testing specifications (38.7%), debarment criteria (55.1%), and management measures for patients with suspected symptoms (72.8%). The overall score of the TAF was 7.0 (5.0-12.0), and there were statistical significance in scores between different types of personnel, years of work experience and department (P &lt;.05). This study indicated that nursing staff have insufficient knowledge about COVID-19. Meanwhile, despite the psychological damage of nursing staff is slight, nurse manager must continue to monitor their mental health and take timely interventions.","Huang, Zhao, Li","https://doi.org/10.2196/20606","20200708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2586,""

This study aimed to describe patient, family member and potential donor perspectives on the suspension and resumption of kidney transplant programs due to COVID-19. We conducted seven online focus groups involving 31 adult kidney transplant candidates (n=22), caregivers (n=4) and potential donors (n=5). Transcripts were analyzed thematically. We identified five themes: cascading disappointments and devastation (with subthemes of shattering hope, succumbing to defeat, regret and guilt); helplessness and vulnerability (fear of declining health, confronted by the threat of and change in dialysis, disconnected from healthcare, susceptibility to infective complications); stress from uncertainty (confusion from conflicting information, unable to forward plan), exacerbating burdens (incurring extra financial costs, intensifying caregiver responsibilities), and sustaining health through the delay (protecting eligibility, relying on social support, adapting to emerging modalities of care). During the suspension of kidney transplantation programs, patients felt medically vulnerable because of declining health, susceptibility to infection and reduced access to care. There is a need to address health vulnerabilities, disappointment, uncertainty and additional burdens arising from the suspension of kidney transplantation programs.","Guha, Tong, Baumgart, Scholes-Robertson, Isbel, Kanellis, Campbell, Coates, Chadban","https://doi.org/10.1111/tri.13697","20200708","COVID-19; Coronavirus; patient-centered care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2587,""
"Implementation of Home-Based Telemental Health in a Large Child Psychiatry Department During the COVID-19 Crisis","<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> Telemental health (TMH) is not well described for mental health service delivery during crises. Most child and adolescent psychiatry training programs have not integrated TMH into their curricula and are ill equipped to respond during crises to their patients' needs. In this study, we present the implementation of a home-based TMH (HB-TMH) service during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> We describe the technological, administrative, training, and clinical implementation components involved in transitioning a comprehensive outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry program to a HB-TMH virtual clinic. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> The transition was accomplished in 6 weeks. Most in-clinic services were rapidly moved off campus to the home. Owing to challenges encountered with each implementation component, phone sessions bridged the transition from in-clinic to reliable virtual appointments. Within 3 weeks (March 20, 2020) of planning for HB-TMH, 67% of all appointments were conducted at home, and within 4 weeks (March 27, 2020), 90% were conducted at home. By week 6 (April 3, 2020), reliable HB-TMH appointments were implemented. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> The COVID-19 pandemic crisis created the opportunity to innovate a solution to disrupted care for our established patients and to create a resource for youth who developed problems during the crisis. Our department was experienced in providing TMH services that facilitated the transition to HB-TMH, yet still had to overcome known and unanticipated challenges. Our experience provides a roadmap for establishing a HB-TMH service with focus on rapid implementation. It also demonstrates a role for TMH during (rather than after) future crises when usual community resources are not available.","Sharma, Sasser, Schoenfelder Gonzalez, Vander Stoep, Myers","https://doi.org/10.1089/cap.2020.0062","20200708","COVID-19 pandemic; crisis; home-based telemental health; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2588,""

"Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose","Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. <i>In-vitro</i> data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence of clinical efficacy. Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 umol/L (95% credible interval 10.1-17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarisation is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration &gt;150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality in chloroquine self-poisoning. Pharmacokinetic modelling predicts that most high dose regimens trialled in COVID-19 are unlikely to cause serious cardiovascular toxicity.","Watson, Tarning, Hoglund, Baud, Megarbane, Clemessy, White","https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58631","20200708","human; human biology; medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2590,""

In this retrospective case-control study, we used de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System between March 9th, 2020 and June 14th, 2020 to identify risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test positive), inpatient admission, and severe outcomes (treatment in an intensive care unit or intubation). Of the 26,602 individuals tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 992 were COVID-19 positive (3.7% of Tested), 220 were admitted in the hospital (22% of COVID-19 positive), and 77 had a severe outcome (35% of Inpatient). Consistent with previous studies, males and individuals older than 65 years old had increased risk of inpatient admission. Notably, individuals self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino constituted an increasing percentage of COVID-19 patients as disease severity escalated, comprising 24% of those testing positive, but 40% of those with a severe outcome, a disparity that remained after correcting for medical co-morbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal disease were premorbid risk factors present before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Less well-established risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility included pre-existing dementia (odds ratio (OR) 5.2 [3.2-8.3], p=2.6 x 10-10), mental health conditions (depression OR 2.1 [1.6-2.8], p=1.1 x 10-6) and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.8 [1.4-2.2], p=5.7 x 10-6). Renal diseases including end-stage renal disease and anemia due to chronic renal disease were the predominant premorbid risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission. Other less established risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission included previous renal transplant (OR 9.7 [2.8-39], p=3.2x10-4) and disorders of the immune system (OR 6.0 [2.3, 16], p=2.7x10-4). Prior use of oral steroid medications was associated with decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk (OR 0.61 [0.45, 0.81], p=4.3x10-4), but increased inpatient admission risk (OR 4.5 [2.3, 8.9], p=1.8x10-5). We did not observe that prior use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or having a severe outcome. This study involving direct EHR extraction identified known and less well-established demographics, and prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. Knowledge of these risk factors including marked ethnic disparities observed in disease severity should guide government policies, identify at-risk populations, inform clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research.","Chang, Ding, Freund, Johnson, Schwarz, Yabu, Hazlett, Chiang, Wulf, Geschwind, Butte, Pasaniuc","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145581","20200708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2594,""
"Medical Students and COVID-19: Challenges and Supportive Strategies","As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread across the world, it is also adversely affecting medical student education. In addition, COVID-19 poses several challenges to medical students' physical and mental health and their professional identity formation. Medical students are experiencing increasing anxiety due to the COVID-19 disruption. Medical students show higher rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and stigmatization around depression and are less likely to seek support. It is therefore important to safeguard their mental health and implement effective strategies to support their educational, physical, mental, and professional well-being.","Chandratre","https://doi.org/10.1177/2382120520935059","20200708","Medical student education; medical student mental health; medical student mental health supportive strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2595,""
"Lithium Toxicity in Two Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) isÃ‚Â a highly contagious disease, which is currently causing a devastating pandemic resulting in more than millions of infected cases worldwide. Emerging evidence reports the impact of several co-morbidities on the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19. However, the evidence regarding the association of mental health illnesses and psychiatric treatment on the prognoses of COVID-19 is still lacking. Lithium is a commonly prescribed psychiatric medication that is also well known for its highly lethal toxicity. Many factors can fluctuate the level of lithium, such as drug interaction, illness, and infection.Ã‚Â Prompt recognition and management of lithium intoxication is required to reduce patients' morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no report regarding COVID-19 and lithium toxicity. Herein, we are presenting two patients with COVID-19 who initially presented with signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity.Ã‚Â Our cases emphasize the need for special attention in taking care of patients who are taking lithium during the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, we recommendÃ‚Â obtaining lithium levels in all patients who have been taking lithium and have the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Suwanwongse, Shabarek","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8384","20200708","aki; case report; corona virus disease; covid; kidney failure; lithium; toxicity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2596,""

"The mental health of health care workers in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 disease is one of the most destructive events that humanity has witnessed in the 21st century. It has impacted all aspects of life and all segments of populations, including already vulnerable health care providers. This study sought to detect the prevalence of mental health issues in sample of physicians and nurses working in several health facilities in Oman. We gauged the mental health conditions of 509 physicians (38.1%) and nurses (61.9 %) using the Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and World Health Organization Well-Being Index. The study revealed a high prevalence of stress, anxiety and poor psychological well-being, especially among females, young health care workers and those who interacted with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. The outcomes of this study support the handful of studies published during this global health crisis that have found that the mental health of health care workers has been harshly affected and predicted that it will continue, to various degrees, to be affected in the foreseeable future. The results of this study highlight the urgency of providing administrative and psychological support as well as current and accurate information on COVID-19 to health care workers.","Badahdah, Khamis, Al Mahyijari, Al Balushi, Al Hatmi, Al Salmi, Albulushi, Al Noomani","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020939596","20200708","COVID-19; Stress; anxiety; health care workers; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2599,""

"Secondary Traumatization Outcomes and Associated Factors Among the Health Care Workers Exposed to the COVID-19","Secondary traumatization exposure and mental health conditions of health care workers gained importance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic period. In our study, we aim to research the secondary traumatization and associated factors among health care workers. This cross-sectional study was applied through an online questionnaire using the snowball sampling method. Two hundred fifty-one health care workers from different units/services and 312 non-medical worker adults attended to the research. Health care workers were divided into two groups based on working with COVID-19 patients at the frontline or not. The data were collected via Introductory Information Form, Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) between 22 May and 30 May 2020. Among the 563 participants, 251 (44.6%) were health care workers and 312 (55.4%) were non-medical workers. The anxiety, depression and secondary traumatization scores of the frontline health care workers for the COVID-19 were found to be significantly higher than those of the other health workers or non-medical workers (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Also, we found that being a woman, being in the first years of the work, living with a parent, having a chronic disease, having a trauma history and increased social media use are related to having higher scores from the secondary traumatization scale. The secondary traumatization exposure and the mental health conditions of the health care workers directly working with the COVID-19 patients should be taken into consideration. It is important to provide social support, examine and control riskier groups for mental health regularly during the pandemic.","Arpacioglu, Gurler, Cakiroglu","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020940742","20200708","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health care workers; risk factors; secondary traumatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2601,""
"Self-Control Moderates the Association Between Perceived Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Mental Health Problems Among the Chinese Public","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths in China. Prior research suggests that individuals' perceived severity of COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioral reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this idea. Participants were 4607 citizens from 31 regions in China (M<sub>age</sub> = 23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for a number of demographic variables, perceived severity of COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the &quot;perceived severity of COVID-19-mental health problems&quot; association, with this link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Practically, enhancing individuals' self-control ability might be a promising way to improve individuals' mental health during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Li, Yang, Dou, Cheung","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134820","20200708","COVID-19; cognitive appraisal; public health concerns; resilience; risk factor; self-control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2602,""
"Provision of Psychotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Czech, German and Slovak Psychotherapists","Psychotherapists around the world are facing an unprecedented situation with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To combat the rapid spread of the virus, direct contact with others has to be avoided when possible. Therefore, remote psychotherapy provides a valuable option to continue mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study investigated the fear of psychotherapists to become infected with COVID-19 during psychotherapy in personal contact and assessed how the provision of psychotherapy changed due to the COVID-19 situation and whether there were differences with regard to country and gender. Psychotherapists from three European countries: Czech Republic (CZ, <i>n</i> = 112), Germany (DE, <i>n</i> = 130) and Slovakia (SK, <i>n</i> = 96), with on average 77.8% female participants, completed an online survey. Participants rated the fear of COVID-19 infection during face-to-face psychotherapy and reported the number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via internet) during the COVID-19 situation as well as (retrospectively) in the months before. Fear of COVID-19 infection was highest in SK and lowest in DE (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and was higher in female compared to male psychotherapists (<i>p</i> = 0.021). In all countries, the number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and remote psychotherapies increased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with more patients being treated via internet than via telephone during the COVID-19 situation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, female psychotherapists treated less patients in personal contact (<i>p</i> = 0.036), while they treated more patients via telephone than their male colleagues (<i>p</i> = 0.015). Overall, the total number of patients treated did not differ during COVID-19 from the months before (<i>p</i> = 0.133) and psychotherapy in personal contact remained the most common treatment modality. Results imply that the supply of mental health care could be maintained during COVID-19 and that changes in the provision of psychotherapy vary among countries and gender.","Humer, Pieh, Kuska, Barke, Doering, Gossmann, Trnka, Meier, Kascakova, Tavel, Probst","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134811","20200708","COVID-19; fear of infection; psychotherapy; public health; remote psychotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2603,""
"The social psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical staff in China: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 outbreak required the significantly increased working time and intensity for health professionals in China, which may cause stress signs. From March 2-13 of 2020, 4,618 health professionals in China were included in an anonymous, self-rated online survey regarding their concerns on exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaires consisted of five parts: basic demographic information and epidemiological exposure; occupational and psychological impact; concerns during the episode; coping strategies; and the Huaxi Emotional-Distress Index (HEI). About 24.2% of respondents experienced high levels of anxiety or/and depressive symptoms since the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents who worried about their physical health and those who had COVID-19 infected friends or close relatives were more likely to have high HEI levels, than those without these characteristics. Further, family relationship was found to have an independent protective effect against high HEI levels. Their main concerns were that their families would not be cared for and that they would not be able to work properly. Compared to respondents with clear emotional problems, those with somewhat hidden emotional issues adopted more positive coping measures. About a quarter of medical staff experienced psychological problems during the pandemic of COVID-19. The psychological impact of stressful events was related to worrying about their physical health, having close COVID-19 infected acquaintances and family relationship issues. Therefore, the psychological supprot for medical staff fighting in the COVID-19 pandemic may be needed.","Dong, Ma, Hao, Shen, Liu, Gao, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.59","20200708","COVID-19; cross-sectional survey; medical staff; novel coronavirus; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2604,""
"SARS-CoV-2 strategically mimics proteolytic activation of human ENaC","Molecular mimicry is an evolutionary strategy adopted by viruses to exploit the host cellular machinery. We report that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a unique S1/S2 cleavage site, absent in any previous coronavirus sequenced, resulting in the striking mimicry of an identical FURIN-cleavable peptide on the human epithelial sodium channel ÃŽÂ±-subunit (ENaC-ÃŽÂ±). Genetic alteration of ENaC-ÃŽÂ± causes aldosterone dysregulation in patients, highlighting that the FURIN site is critical for activation of ENaC. Single cell RNA-seq from 66 studies shows significant overlap between expression of ENaC-ÃŽÂ± and the viral receptor ACE2 in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular characterization with cleavage signatures of 178 proteases highlights proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic may be driven in part by its targeted mimicry of ENaC-ÃŽÂ±, a protein critical for the homeostasis of airway surface liquid, whose misregulation is associated with respiratory conditions. Viruses hijack the cellular machinery of humans to infect their cells and multiply. The virus causing the global COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is no exception. Identifying which proteins in human cells the virus co-opts is crucial for developing new ways to diagnose, prevent and treat COVID-19 infections. SARS-CoV-2 is covered in spike-shaped proteins, which the virus uses to gain entry into cells. First, the spikes bind to a protein called ACE2, which is found on the cells that line the respiratory tract and lungs. SARS-CoV-2 then exploits enzymes called proteases to cut, or cleave, its spikes at a specific site which allows the virus to infiltrate the host cell. Proteases identify which proteins to target based on the sequence of amino acids Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the building blocks of proteins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at the cleavage site. However, it remained unclear which human proteases SARS-CoV-2 co-opts and whether its cut site is similar to human proteins. Now, Anand et al. show that the spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2 may have the same sequence of amino acids at its cut site as a human epithelial channel protein called ENaC-ÃŽÂ±. This channel is important for maintaining the balance of salt and water in many organs including the lungs. Further analyses showed that ENaC-ÃŽÂ± is often found in the same types of human lung and respiratory tract cells as ACE2. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may use the same proteases that cut ENaC-ÃŽÂ± to get inside human respiratory cells. It is possible that by hijacking the cutting mechanism for ENaC-ÃŽÂ±, SARS-CoV-2 interferes with the balance of salt and water in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. This may help explain why the virus causes severe respiratory symptoms. However, more studies are needed to confirm that the proteases that cut ENaC-ÃŽÂ± also cut the spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2, and how this affects the respiratory health of COVID-19 patients.","Anand, Puranik, Aravamudan, Venkatakrishnan, Soundararajan","https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58603","20200708","COVID-19; ENaC; SARS-CoV-2; acute respiratory distress syndrome; computational biology; coronavirus; human; human biology; medicine; molecular mimicry; mouse; systems biology; virus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2605,""
"Gender Differences in Telecommuting and Implications for Inequality at Home and Work","The global pandemic has led to an unprecedented shift to remote work that will likely persist to some degree into the future. Telecommutingâ€™s impact on flexibility and work family conflict is a critical question for researchers and policy-makers. Our study addresses this question with data collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis: the 2003-2018 American Time Use Survey (ATUS, N = 19,179) and the April and May 2020 COVID Impact Survey (N = 784). Comparing mothers and fathers who work exclusively at the workplace, exclusively from home, and part-day from home, we describe differences in time spent on housework, childcare, and leisure; the nature of time worked at home; and the subjective experiences of telecommuting. In addition to a broad descriptive portrait, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental design in the ATUS leave supplements to examine time working at home among those who report ever telecommuting, providing estimates of telecommutingâ€™s effect on other uses of time that better approximate causal relationships than prior studies. We find that gender gaps in housework are larger for telecommuters, and, among telecommuters, larger on telecommuting days. Conversely, telecommuting may shrink the gender gap in childcare, particularly among couples with two full time earners, although childcare more frequently impinges upon mothersâ€™ work time. Survey data collected following the March COVID19 stay-at-home orders show that telecommuting mothers more frequently report feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression than telecommuting fathers. Early estimates of responses to the COVID19 pandemic offer insights into future implications of telecommuting for gender equality at work.","Thomas Lyttelton et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-A87-AC7","20200709","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender; housework; care work; covid; inequality; telecommuting; wellbeing; time use; covid-19; work; gender; household labor; working from home","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-09","",2606,""
