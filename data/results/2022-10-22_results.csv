"Investigating SARS-CoV-2 infection and the health and psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Canadian CHILD Cohort study: methodology and cohort profile","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all Canadian families, with some impacted differently than others. Our study aims to: 1) determine the prevalence and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection among Canadian families, 2) identify predictors of infection susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 and 3) identify health and psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study builds upon the CHILD Cohort Study, an ongoing multi-ethnic general population prospective cohort consisting of 3454 Canadian families with children born in Vancouver, Edmonton, Manitoba, and Toronto between 2009-12. During the pandemic, 1462 CHILD households (5378 individuals) consented to participate in the CHILD COVID-19 Add-On Study involving: (1) brief biweekly surveys about COVID-19 symptoms and testing; (2) quarterly questionnaires assessing COVID-19 exposure, testing and vaccination status, physical and mental health, and pandemic-driven life changes; (3) in-home biological sampling kits to collect blood and stool. Mean ages were 9 years (range 0-17) for children and 43 years (range 18-85) for adults. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be estimated from survey data and confirmed through serology testing. We will combine these new data with a wealth of pre-pandemic CHILD data and use multivariate modelling and machine learning methods to identify risk and resilience factors for susceptibility and severity to the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic. Interpretation: Our short-term findings will inform key stakeholders and knowledge users to shape current and future pandemic responses. Additionally, this study provides a unique resource to study the long-term impacts of the pandemic as the CHILD Cohort Study continues.","Rilwan Azeez; Larisa Lotoski; AimÃ©e Dubeau; Natalie Rodriguez; Myrtha E.

"The COVID-19 burnout scale: Development and initial validation","We developed and validated a self-assessment instrument to measure COVID-19 pandemic-related burnout in the general population. We assessed the psychometric properties of the COVID-19 burnout scale (COVID-19-BS). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis identified three factors for the COVID-19-BS; emotional exhaustion, physical exhaustion, and exhaustion due to measures against the COVID-19. Cronbach alpha coefficients for the three factors and the COVID-19-BS ranged from 0.860 to 0.921. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was 0.945 and p-value for Bartlett test was <0.001 indicating highly acceptable values. Convergent validity results indicated a significant positive correlation between COVID-19-BS and anxiety and depression. Known-groups analysis identified the ability of COVID-19-BS to discriminate groups according to gender, chronic condition, and health status. Our findings indicate that the final 13-item model of COVID-19-BS is a brief, easy to administer, valid and reliable scale for assessing COVID-19-related burnout in the general public.","Petros A Galanis; Aglaia Katsiroumpa; Panayota Sourtzi; Olga Siskou; Olympia Konstantakopoulou; Daphne Kaitelidou","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.20.22281317","20221021","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39546,""
"Impact of COVID-19 related social isolation on behavioral outcomes in young adults","Social isolation strongly affects our emotions and behavior. Worldwide, individuals experienced prolonged periods of isolation during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when authorities imposed restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus. In this study, we investigated the effects of social isolation on emotional and behavioral outcomes in young adults from Lombardy, Italy, a global hotspot of COVID-19. We leverage baseline (pre-social isolation) and follow-up (mid-or post isolation) data collected from young adults enrolled in the ongoing, longitudinal PHIME study. At baseline, 167 participants completed the ASEBA questionnaires (ASR/YSR) by weblink or in person; 65 completed the ASR between 12-18 weeks after the onset of restrictions. Using the sign test and multiple linear regression models, we examined differences in ASR scores between baseline and follow-up adjusting for sex, age, pre-pandemic IQ (Kaufman Brief Intelligence Tests; K-BIT 2), and time with social restrictions (weeks). Further, we examined interactions between sex and time in social isolation. Participants completed the ASR after spending an average of 14 weeks in social isolation (range 12-18 weeks). Thought Problems increased between baseline and follow-up (median difference 1.0; 1st., 3rd quartile: -1.0, 4.0; p=0.049). Among males, a longer time with social isolation ([&ge;] 14 weeks) was associated with increased rule-breaking behaviors of 2.8 points. These results suggest the social isolation related to COVID-19 adversely impacted mental health. In particular, males seem to externalize their condition. These findings might help future interventions and treatment to minimize the consequences of social isolation experience in young adults.","Alessandra Patrono; Azzurra Invernizzi; Donatella Placidi; Giuseppa Cagna; Stefano Calza; Manuela Oppini; Elza Rechtman; Demetrios M Papazaharias; Abraham Reichenberg; Roberto G Lucchini; Maurizio Memo; Elisa Ongaro; Matteo Rota; Robert O Wright; Stefano Renzetti; Megan K Horton","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.20.22280791","20221021","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39547,""
"Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Forensic Cases in Children","Objective: Forensic cases have an important place in admissions to pediatric emergency units. Along with the pandemic period, there have been changes in the frequency and characteristic of emergency services. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of the pandemic on forensic cases in children. Materials and Methods: The files of the patients admitted to Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Medical Faculty Pediatric Emergency Unit between March 2019 and March 2021 and defined as forensic cases were analyzed retrospectively from the hospital record database. Results: 505 (48.4%) of the forensic cases were female and 538 (41.6%) were male. When the frequency of admission was evaluated according to the genders, no significant difference was found between the genders (p&gt;0.05). The median age of all cases was 3 (0.4-17.85) years. Of the patients, 569 (54.5%) were admitted before the pandemic, and 473 (45.5%) after the pandemic. The diagnosis of foreign body in the nose was more common in boys, and the diagnosis of suicide attempt was more common in girls. It was determined that the cases were hospitalized more frequently during the pandemic period, the cases of foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract were less, and the cases of abuse were higher. Conclusion: The social measurements experienced during the pandemic period, the closure of schools and workplaces have caused changes in the characteristics of forensic cases. More comprehensive studies are required to investigate the effect of the pandemic on forensic cases in children.

"Cognitive-emotional coping mechanisms accessed by students in the current pandemic context","Since the onset of 2019, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease (COVID-19) have had and continue to have a considerable negative impact worldwide on physical and mental health, but also on daily activities. Various precautionary measures have been put in place to prevent the spread of the virus, measures that have significantly affected various areas and activities, including social, professional, educational, family, sports. Therefore, both the negative experience experienced with the advent of the virus and its rapid spread, as well as the limits imposed by the authorities, have determined a series of negative emotions among the entire population. One of the crucial aspects of everyday life is the management of emotions. The concept of coping or emotional regulation involves a series of processes that organize emotions, processes that can change, shape or inhibit a certain emotional state. Improper management of emotions can cause significant discomfort that persists over time and can cause a variety of symptoms (Gross, 2014 apud Cuevas Lopez et al., 2021). In the current pandemic context, in which negative experiences have increased due to infection with the new virus, but also because of the restrictions that have prevented the normal functioning of the entire population, improper management of emotions is not a topic that must be neglected. This paper starts from the ideas illustrated above and focuses its attention on the students, who have experienced considerable changes during this pandemic period. The main purpose of this paper is to understand the coping strategies adopted by students in the current pandemic context. In order to achieve our goal, in a first stage we will present the main defining aspects of the studied variables, namely emotions and emotional regulation strategies. The study investigates the following 9 coping strategies - self-curing, acceptance, rumination, positive refocusing, positive reassessment, putting into perspective, catastrophizing and blaming others. Another objective that the present research proposes is to highlight the extent to which the coping strategies adopted during the pandemic period differ in the students employed from the unemployed students, respecting the students from the Faculty of Psychology compared to the students from the Faculty of Law. Also, the study aims to bring a novelty to the researches, thus presenting the coping strategies adopted by the students of the Romanian population during this delicate period.

"The relationship between mental health and perceived social support with the post traumatic growth model through the mediating role of coping strategies in COVID-19 recovered patients","Background and aims: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is viewed as a traumatic incident that impacts many aspects of a personâ€™s life. The present study aimed to investigate the association of perceived social support and mental health with the post-traumatic growth model through the mediating role of coping strategies in COVID-19 recovered patients. Methods: This study was conducted using a path analysis method from the correlation matrix. The study population included all COVID-19 recovered patients in Golestan province, Iran. Using the convenience sampling method, 300 patients who recovered from COVID-19 were selected. The study instruments included the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory, the General Health Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the Ways of Coping Questionnaire. The data were analyzed through structural equation modeling using SPSS and AMOS version 25. Results: The findings revealed that the suggested model fit the data. The relationship of post-traumatic growth, perceived social support, and mental health with problem-focused coping strategies was positive and significant (P&lt;0.01). Likewise, the relations of mental health and perceived social support with post-traumatic growth were positive and significant. Post-traumatic growth and perceived social support had a negative and significant relationship with emotion-focused strategies (P&lt;0.01). However, the relationship between mental health and emotion-focused strategies was not significant. Conclusion: Mental health, perceived social support, and problem-focused strategies played an essential role in COVID-19 patientsâ€™ posttraumatic growth. As a result, they might help minimize the psychological impact of COVID-19.

"Evaluation of the Relationship of Fatigue, Anxiety and Depression Levels in Individuals with the Precautions Taken in the COVID-19 Pandemic Process","Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 process and the measures taken on fatigue, anxiety and depression levels in individuals, and the factors that may cause this effect. Methods: The study is of cross-sectional type. A total of 281 participants who applied to the pandemic outpatient clinic were included in the study. Data collection form with 27 questions and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) with 14 questions were used in the study. Relationships between data were evaluated with t-test and chi-square test in independent groups. The importance levels of the factors affecting the anxiety and depression scores were determined by the Chaid Analysis. Statistically, cases with p&lt;.05 were considered significant. Results: A total of 281 participants, with a mean age of 40.09Â±12.35 years and 56.2% women, were included in the study. The mean depression score of the participants in HADS was 7.43Â±3.85. The mean anxiety score was 8.11Â±4.04. 61.6% of the participants had depression and 31.0% had anxiety. According to Chaidâ€™s analysis, the most effective factor on anxiety and depression scores was that the fear of contracting the COVID-19 infection exhausted the individual. Conclusion: As a result of the research, it was found that the frequency of depression and anxiety was high in patients who applied to the pandemic outpatient clinic. It was determined that more than half of the participants were afraid of catching an infection and this fear caused fatigue in them. Mental health should not be ignored during the pandemic period and both physical and mental health of people should be protected with holistic approaches.","K&Uuml;Ã‡&Uuml;Kkend&Iacute;Rc&Iacute;, Hasan, Y&Uuml;Cel, Mehtap, Durduran, Yasemin","https://doi.org/10.33808/clinexphealthsci.1011262","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical and Experimental Health Sciences; 12(3):665-671, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39552,""
"Evaluation of Forensic Medical Cases During COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: Investigating the effects of the coronavirus disease pandemic on forensic medical cases admitted to emergency department (ED). Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted between March and August 2019 (prepandemic period), and March and August 2020 (pandemic period). All the patients admitted to the ED that required a forensic medical examination were investigated. Results: A total of 4527 forensic cases were investigated (prepandemic period: 2937, pandemic period: 1590). There was a male predominance among the patients (prepandemic period: 62.1%, pandemic period: 67.7%). During both periods, the most common forensic complaints were the same, and assaults, motor vehicle accidents, and penetrating injuries were in the top three, respectively. During pandemic number of motor vehicle accidents decreased significantly (p &lt;0.001);on the other hand number of suicide attempts did not change (p= 0.83). Conclusion: When compared to the prepandemic period, the number of forensic cases decreased by half during the pandemic period. Number of motor vehicle accidents significantly decreased during the pandemic, which might have been a consequence of the stay-at-home orders. There was no increase in the in the number of suicide attempts;however, the psychological effects of the pandemic can be long-lasting and might lead to increases in rate of suicide attempts in the long-run.","ISIk, GÃ¼lsah Ã‡IkrikÃ‡I, Ã‡&Iacute;Npolat, Resul, KiriS, Ersin, Ã‡Ev&Iacute;K, Yunsur","https://doi.org/10.33808/clinexphealthsci.933782","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical and Experimental Health Sciences; 12(1):205-208, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39553,""

"The public health and health system implications of changes in the utilisation of acute hospital care in Ireland during the first wave of COVID-19: Lessons for recovery planning","Reduced and delayed presentations for non-COVID-19 illness during the COVID-19 pandemic have implications for population health and health systems. The aim of this study is to quantify and characterise changes in acute hospital healthcare utilisation in Ireland during the first wave of COVID-19 to inform healthcare system planning and recovery. A retrospective, population-based, interrupted time-trend study was conducted using two national datasets, Patient Experience Time (PET) and Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE). The study period was 6th January to 5th July 2020. Comparison between time periods pre- and post-onset of the COVID-19 pandemic within 2020 showed there were 81,712 fewer Emergency Department (ED) presentations (-18.8%), 19,692 fewer admissions from ED (-17.4%) and 210,357 fewer non-COVID-19 hospital admissions (-35.0%) than expected based on pre-COVID-19 activity. Reductions were greatest at the peak of population-level restrictions, at extremes of age and for elective admissions. In the period immediately following the first wave, acute hospital healthcare utilisation remained below pre-COVID-19 levels, however, there were increases in emergency alcohol-related admissions (Rate Ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.03, 1.43, p-value 0.016), admissions with self-harm (Rate Ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.01, 1.91, p-value 0.043) and mental health admissions (Rate Ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03, 1.60, p-value 0.028). While public health implications of delayed and lost care will only become fully apparent over time, recovery planning must begin immediately. In the short-term, backlogs in care need to be managed and population health impacts of COVID-19 and associated restrictions, particularly in relation to mental health and alcohol, need to be addressed through strong public health and health system responses. In the long-term, COVID-19 highlights health system weakness and is an opportunity to progress health system reform to deliver a universal, high-quality, sustainable and resilient health system, capable of meeting population health needs and responding to future pandemics.","Marron, Louise, Burke, Sara, Kavanagh, Paul","https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13307.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: HRB open research; 4:67, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39557,""
"Fibonacci Numbers as Hyperparameters for Image Dimension of a Convolutional Neural Network Image Prognosis Classification Model of COVID X-ray Images","In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved amazing success in a variety of image categorization tasks. However, the architecture of CNNs has a significant impact on their performance. The designs of the most cutting-edge CNNs are frequently hand-crafted by experts in both CNNs and the topics under investigation. As a result, it's tough for users who don't have a lot of experience with CNNs to come up with the best CNN architecture for their individual image categorization challenges. This work investigates the application of the Fibonacci numbers to efficiently solve picture classification challenges by utilizing the hyperparameter of image dimension of COVID and non-COVID x-ray images. The suggested algorithm's greatest strength is the development of a CNN model that can be utilized for COVID viral prognosis using x-ray images to supplement existing COVID pandemic testing techniques. The proposed approach is tested using the metrics of training time, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on commonly used benchmark image classification datasets. According to the experimental data, the CNN model with an image dimension of 55 x 55 surpasses the other CNN models in terms of training time, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Several issues were raised about how to choose the best CNN models for prognostic picture categorization.

"Physiciansâ€™ Awareness of Depression Among Their Patients in Saudi Arabia","BackgroundDepression is a global public health burden, and although it is multifactorial, its development is highly associated with chronic diseases. Thus, physiciansâ€™ knowledge and attitude toward depression are vital for the recognition and treatment of depression among patients with chronic illnesses. This study aims to examine physiciansâ€™ knowledge and attitude toward depression in Saudi Arabia and to determine factors that significantly influence them.MethodologyAn online survey using a 12-item questionnaire was completed by 50 physicians between January and June 2020. Knowledge (K) and attitude (A) scores were calculated and compared nonparametrically based on scores by gender and years of experience.ResultsParticipantsâ€™ years of clinical experience was found to significantly influence the participantsâ€™ K scores, with those with fewer than one year of experience having the highest K scores of all participants (p &lt; 0.05). Years of experience had a similar influence on the A scores. Furthermore, gender was an influencing factor as male participants had higher A scores than female participants. Years of experience and gender influenced the A scores independently. Male physicians more commonly referred patients to a mental health specialist than female physicians, and had significantly higher A scores and more years of experience. There was a direct correlation between the K and A score, indicating that participantsâ€™ knowledge of depression positively influenced their attitude toward depression.ConclusionsIn this study, participantsâ€™ gender and years of experience have been identified to have a significant impact on their knowledge and attitude toward comorbid depression when treating patients with chronic illnesses. This identifies an important gap and offers preliminary insight into the readiness and practice of holistic care for patients, particularly for those treated by physicians of differing gender and experience levels. Findings further demonstrate that it is most beneficial to patients with chronic illnesses that physicians utilize a holistic approach and consider depression when developing their treatment plans. This would involve being able to detect and manage depression among their patients properly, as well as referring patients to mental health specialists when needed. Clinical guidelines should be updated to emphasize the use of depression screening tools for patients with chronic diseases.","Sayed, Anwar A.; Lim Jennifer, N.

"Is there a normality bias in the spread of COVID-19? Influence of cognition on perception of COVID-19 and related behavior","The present study examined whether a normality bias occurs in the context of the spread of COVID-19, and whether perceptions of COVID-19 are associated with behavior that is not self-restrained, anger at people who are infected with COVID-19, stress, and depression. Adults (N = 710) in their twenties to sixties living in Tokyo were sampled using a questionnaire posted on the Internet. The results suggested that normality bias could be observed even in a long-term event such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of the results also suggested that aspects of the perception of COVID-19, including perceived infectiousness, perceived risk from the outside world, and perceived safety, affected different aspects of individuals' responses, based on aspects of a normality bias. In addition, the results suggested that awareness of methods of preventing infection with COVID-19 and self-restraint predicted behavior that was not self-restrained 2 months later. Future research should examine longer-term effects of normality bias and determinants of normality bias during the spread of COVID-19.

"Sedentary lifestyle may contribute to the risk of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Social exclusion usually contributes to an increased vulnerability to mental health problems and risky health behaviors. This study aims to identify the role of health behavior in the increased risk of depressive symptoms among adolescents during the coronavirus pandemic in Hungary. Methods: A total of 705 high school students participated in our study (M = 15.9 years;SD = 1.19). The self-administered questionnaire included items about sociodemographics, eating habits, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and substance use. Depressive symptoms were measured using the short version of the Child Depression Inventory. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze our results. Results: Daily fruit and vegetable consumption was reported by 21.7% and 22.4% of respondents, respectively. The proportion of the respondents reporting daily sweets consumption stood at 13.2%, daily soft drinks consumption was 12.3%, and daily energy drink consumption tallied to 4.5%. More than one-third of the sample (35.5%) reported having breakfast every school day, which rose to 68.1% of the sample reporting breakfast on both weekend days. The rate of students engaged in daily physical activity was 6.5%, while 86.1% of them reported more than four hours screen time in a day. In addition, despite the mandatory confinement, a notable percentage of adolescents engaged in substance use. Consistent with previous studies, girls had a higher risk of depression. Low levels of physical activity and high levels of screen time-as well as alcohol and drug use-were associated with a high risk of depression. Conclusions: We believe our study provided useful information on adolescent health behaviors that can lead to adolescents' depression, and that maintaining physical activity can prevent it even in these unusual circumstances.

"COVID-19 vaccination status and associated factors among lactating women during the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional study in southern China","Different countries and institutions around the world have debated whether lactating women should receive the COVID-19 vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic. In China, lactating is not a contraindication to vaccination, but many women are still hesitant to get vaccinated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the current status of COVID-19 vaccination among lactating women and the related factors affecting vaccination. An online cross-sectional survey involving 506 lactating women was conducted in southern China. We explored the related factors affecting COVID-19 vaccination of lactating women from three aspects: general information, knowledge-attitude-behaviour towards COVID-19 and its vaccine, and postpartum psychological state. A total of 432 lactating women completed the questionnaire, 198 of whom had received the COVID-19 vaccine. On the knowledge-attitude-behaviour questionnaire on COVID-19 and its vaccines, the vaccinated group scored higher than the unvaccinated group on both the three subdimensions of the questionnaire and the total score (p&lt;0.01). The results of binary logistics regression analysis showed that mixed feeding (OR=2.68, 95% CI: 1.82 to 3.96), longer breastfeeding duration (OR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.49), better physical condition (OR=5.28, 95% CI: 1.82 to 15.32), higher attitude score of COVID-19 and its vaccine (OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.27), and having a travel history in medium high-risk areas (OR=3.49, 95% CI: 1.46 to 8.37) were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccination in lactating women. Having a master's degree or above (OR=0.03, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.30), and having higher anxiety score (OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.81) and depression score (OR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.93) were inversely associated with COVID-19 vaccination in lactating women. 45.8% of lactating women were vaccinated against COVID-19. Education level, feeding methods, duration of breast feeding, travel history in medium high-risk areas, physical condition, attitude score of COVID-19 and its vaccine, anxiety symptom and depressive symptom score were associated with vaccination of lactating women. More interventions based on these factors were needed to reduce concerns for lactating women and increase their vaccination rates.","Wang, Tang, Huang, Yi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062447","20221021","COVID-19; health policy; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39563,""
"Motor Resonance During Action Observation and Its Relevance to Virtual Clinical Consultations: Observational Study Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Virtual clinical interactions have increased tremendously since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While they certainly have their advantages, there also exist potential limitations, for example, in establishing a therapeutic alliance, discussing complex clinical scenarios, etc. This may be due to possible disruptions in the accurate activation of the human mirror neuron system (MNS), a posited physiological template for effective social communication. This study aimed to compare motor resonance, a putative marker of MNS activity, estimated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) elicited while viewing virtual (video-based) and actual or real (enacted by a person) actions in healthy individuals. We hypothesized that motor resonance will be greater during real compared to virtual action observation. We compared motor resonance or motor-evoked potential (MEP) facilitation during the observation of virtual (presented via videos) and real (enacted in person) actions, relative to static image observation in healthy individuals using TMS. The MEP recordings were obtained by 2 single-pulse (neuronal membrane excitability-driven) TMS paradigms of different intensities and 2 paired-pulse (cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid-interneuron-driven) TMS paradigms. This study comprised 64 participants. Using the repeated measures ANOVA, we observed a significant time effect for MEP facilitation from static to virtual and real observation states when recorded using 3 of the 4 TMS paradigms. Post hoc pairwise comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction revealed significant MEP facilitation in both virtual and real observation states relative to static image observation; however, we also observed a significant time effect between the 2 action observation states (real &gt; virtual) with 2 of the 4 TMS paradigms. Our results indicate that visual cues expressed via both virtual (video) or real (in person) modes elicit physiological responses within the putative MNS, but this effect is more pronounced for actions presented in person. This has relevance to the appropriate implementation of digital health solutions, especially those pertaining to mental health.","Mehta, Basavaraju, Ramesh, Kesavan, Thirthalli","https://doi.org/10.2196/40652","20221021","digital psychiatry; mirror neuron activity; motor resonance; telepsychiatry; virtual interactions; virtual mental health interventions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39564,""
"Community Participation Among Individuals with Severe Mental Disorders During COVID-19 Pandemic","Utilizing a sample of 286 community-dwelling adults with severe mental disorders (SMDs) in Beijing, this study examined their social and community participation during COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptive results showed that adults with SMDs living in the pandemic Beijing mostly engaged in social activities, followed by productive and leisure/recreational activities. More than two-thirds of the participants indicated that their participation was not sufficient. The multivariate analyses revealed that higher social support and self-esteem predicted more participation days, higher social support and independent usage of Health Kit were linked to more participation items, while higher social support and stronger self-stigma were associated with lower perceived participation sufficiency. Thus, community mental health professionals need to provide more tailored interventions to people with SMDs to enhance their participation performance and perceived participation sufficiency during the pandemic era.","Li, Zhuo, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-022-01032-7","20221021","COVID-19; community participation; severe mental disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39565,""
"Prevalence of Depression, Anxiety, Stress, and Insomnia in Iranian Gay Men during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Internationally, gay men have been found to be at a higher risk of mental health problems than heterosexual men. However, there is little information about the mental health situation of Iranian gay men, a population facing serious legal repercussions. Additionally, there is limited international data on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of gay men. The aim of this study was to evaluate Iranian gay men's mental health during this pandemic. We assessed depression, anxiety, and stress with the DASS and insomnia with the ISI in <i>N</i>Ã‚Â = 176 Iranian gay men. We compared their DASS subscores with those of the general male population during the COVID-19 pandemic. 65.9% of Iranian gay men showed mild to extremely severe depression symptoms, 63.6% reported mild to extremely severe anxiety symptoms, 65.3% had mild to extremely severe stress symptoms, and 43.3% had mild to severe insomnia symptoms. Compared to the general Iranian male population, gay men reported significantly more depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Iranian gay men show a high number of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gay men reported significantly more mental health symptoms in the DASS subscores than the general population of Iranian men recruited during the pandemic. They showed descriptively more insomnia symptoms than Iranian adults before the pandemic. The mental health of Iranian gay men should be improved by abolishing punishments for same-sex sexual activities and establishing specialized mental health units for this population.","Kabir, Brinsworth","https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2022.2130022","20221021","COVID-19 pandemic; DASS; Iran; gay men; insomnia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39566,""
"Problematic Internet Use, Depressive Symptomatology and Suicidal Ideation in University Students During COVID-19 Confinement","The aim was to estimate the rate of PIU in Spanish university students during the lockdown, taking sex and age into account, and to analyze its relationship with depression and suicidal ideation. 921 university students (55% women) from 18 to 30 years old (M = 24.8 years; SD = 3) participated. The results showed that 21% of the participants presented PIU, 25.1% moderate depression, 2.1% severe depression, and 6.6% suicidal ideation. The 18 to 21-year-old age group presented the highest rate of PIU (37.8%). A positive correlation was observed between PIU and depression (r = .38; p &amp;lt; .001), with a significantly higher mean score on the PHQ-9 (t(241.813) = -8.21; p &amp;lt; .001; d = .78) in university students with PIU (M = 9.8; SD = 5.1) than those without it (M = 6.4; SD = 4.1).

"Mental health outcomes among osteopathic physicians during COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2 infection responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a significant burden on the mental health of health care providers. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the mental health symptoms among osteopathic physicians from a single academic institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a cross-sectional, survey-based study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic from January 2021 to March 2021. The survey was emailed to 4239 alumni physicians from the single medical school in California, USA. Burnout, anxiety, and depression were assessed by the single-item Mini-Z Burnout Assessment, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. A total of 104 survey responses were analyzed. Of them, 53 (51.0%) were attending physicians and 51 (49.0%) were residents or fellow physicians. Anxiety, burnout, and depression were reported in 29 (29.9%), 31 (32%), and 11 (11.3%), respectively. Females had increased anxiety (OR 1.66, CI 1.21-2.27; PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.002). Resident had higher burnout symptoms (OR 1.28, CI 1.06-1.53; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.009) and depression symptoms (OR 1.15, CI 1.01-1.30; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.032) compared to attending physicians. Physicians who encountered &gt;50 COVID-19 patients had higher depression symptoms (OR 1.17, CI 1.02-1.35; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.027). Our survey study demonstrated that osteopathic physicians graduated from a single academic institution experienced symptoms of anxiety, burnout, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the validated questionnaires. A higher prevalence was shown in the lesser experienced group of residents and fellow physicians compared to more experienced attending physicians. In addition, adjustments to the pandemic have caused a financial burden among osteopathic physicians. Future studies are warranted to assess the long-term effects of the pandemic on mental health among osteopathic physicians.","Lee, Lo, Zhu, Fernandez Sweeny, Fuchs","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2022.10.002","20221021","Anxiety; Burn out; COVID-19; Depression; Osteopathic physicians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39568,""

"Digital and physical factors influencing an individual's preventive behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan: A perspective based on the S-O-R model","COVID-19 has caused considerable stress to individuals and communities. Daily press briefings on public health during the COVID-19 pandemic have increased individuals' feelings of social pressure. Abrupt changes to a person's immediate environment, such as the changes caused by COVID-19, can substantially affect their mental health and cognitive adjustment. On the basis of the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework, we examined the effects of digital and physical stimuli related to COVID-19 in Taiwan on individuals' psychological states and preventive behavior, including social distancing and personal hygiene. The data obtained from 498 valid survey questionnaires indicated that digital and physical factors including informativeness, social pressure, and severity exerted direct effects on cognitive assimilation and anxiety, which in turn affected individuals' preventive behavior. Moreover, cognitive assimilation and anxiety had significant mediating effects on the relationships of informativeness, social pressure, and severity with individuals' preventive behavior. The results of this study indicate how digital and physical stimulus factors affect cognitive assimilation and anxiety, which influence preventive behavior during a pandemic.","Wu, Robinson, Tsemg, Hsu, Hsieh, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107525","20221021","COVID-19; Digital and physical stimuli; Personal hygiene; Social distancing; Social pressure; StimulusÃ¢â‚¬â€œorganismÃ¢â‚¬â€œresponse (SÃ¢â‚¬â€œOÃ¢â‚¬â€œR)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39570,""

"Older age and depressive state are risk factors for re-positivity with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant","The reinfection rate of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is high; thus, exploring the risk factors for reinfection is important for the effective control of the epidemic. This study aimed to explore the effects of psychological and sleep factors on re-positivity with Omicron. Through a prospective cohort study, 933 adult patients diagnosed with Omicron BA.2.2 infection and testing negative after treatment were included for screening and follow-up. We collected data on patients' demographic characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 Omicron vaccination status, anxiety, depression, and sleep status. Patients underwent nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 Omicron for 30 days. Regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to determine the risk factors for re-positivity of Omicron. Ultimately, 683 patients were included in the analysis. Logistic regression analysis showed that older age (<i>P</i> = 0.006) and depressive status (<i>P</i> = 0.006) were two independent risk factors for Omicron re-positivity. The odds ratios of re-positivity in patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years and with a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score Ã¢â€°Â¥5 was 1.82 (95% confidence interval:1.18-2.78) and 2.22 (1.27-3.85), respectively. In addition, the time from infection to recovery was significantly longer in patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years (17.2 Ã‚Â± 4.5 <i>vs</i>. 16.0 Ã‚Â± 4.4, <i>P</i> = 0.003) and in patients with PHQ-9Ã¢â€°Â¥5 (17.5 Ã‚Â± 4.2<i>vs</i>. 16.2 Ã‚Â± 4.5, <i>P</i> = 0.026). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that there was a significantly higher primary re-positivity rate in patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years (<i>P</i> = 0.004) and PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5 (<i>P</i> = 0.007). This study demonstrated that age of Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years and depressive status were two independent risk factors for re-positivity with Omicron and that these factors could prolong the time from infection to recovery. Thus, it is necessary to pay particular attention to older adults and patients in a depressive state.","Li, Peng, Duan, Wang, Yu, Zhang, Wu, Du, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1014470","20221021","COVID-19; Omicron; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; older adults; reinfection; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39572,""

In order to expand related research, this study aims to test the reliability and validity of the COVID-19 Phobia Scale in Chinese adolescents with depressive symptoms. The C19P-SC was translated into Chinese by the method of forward and back translation and tested in 1933 Chinese adolescents with depressive symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) were used to test and compare the four-factor model of the C19P-SC. Then we tested the measurement invariance of the C19P-SC across gender and time. Finally, the reliability was measured with the McDonald's omega coefficients. Consistent with previous studies, the C19P-SC showed a stable four-factor structure. The results showed that ESEM was better than CFA and more reasonable. In addition, the results of multi-group ESEM showed that the C19P-SC met the strict invariance at male and female and partial longitudinal strict invariance. The Mcdonald's omega coefficients of the C19P-SC total scale and each subscale reached the expected acceptable level. In short, the reliability and validity index of C19P-SC has reached an acceptable level, and the measurement invariance of different genders and different time points was established, but the cross-factor phenomenon of individual items was abnormal, and a further revision and testing are still needed.","Yang, Chen, Lu, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1026294","20221021","COVID-19 Phobia; depressive symptoms; exploratory structural equation modeling; longitudinal invariance; measurement invariance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39573,""
"COVID-19 preventive practice and associated factors in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis","COVID-19 is a global health concern due to its rapid spread and impact on morbidity and mortality. Implementing preventive measures plays an essential role in curbing the spread of COVID-19 infection. This study aimed to assess COVID-19 preventive practice and associated factors in Ethiopia. This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, EMBASE, African Journal Online (AJOL) and Science Direct search engines were used to identify relevant articles published up to early December 2021. The Joana Brigg's Institute (JBI) checklist was used for quality appraisal. A random-effect model was fitted to calculate the pooled estimates. Higgins I<sup>2</sup> statistics and Egger's test with funnel plots were analysed to check heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively. Due to significant heterogeneity, subgroup analysis by region, study population, study design and publication year, as well as sensitivity analysis, were done to assess the source of heterogeneity. The pooled level of poor preventive practice for COVID-19 in Ethiopia was 51.60% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.30-62.90). Poor COVID-19 preventive practice declined from 61% in studies published in 2020 to 45% in 2021. Lack of knowledge about COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.61 [95% CI: 2.49-10.73]), a negative attitude towards COVID-19 management (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.64 [95% CI: 1.82-3.82]), rural residence (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.95 [95% CI: 2.12-4.12]), a low educational level (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.93 [95% CI: 2.16-3.98]) and being female (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.75 [95% CI: 1.27-2.40]) were significantly associated with a poor level of COVID-19 preventive practice in Ethiopia. The level of poor COVID-19 preventive practice in Ethiopia was relatively high. Poor COVID-19 prevention practices were significantly correlated with inadequate COVID-19 knowledge, a negative attitude towards COVID-19 management, low educational attainment, living in a rural area and being female. Creating awareness and health education programmes targeting COVID-19 prevention should be strengthened, especially in the target populations identified in this study.","Tegegne, Melkam, Adane, Getawa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2022.100329","20221021","COVID-19; COVID-19, Coronavirus disease 19; Ethiopia; Poor practice; Preventive practice; SARS-COV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2; WHO, World Health Organization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39574,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Depressive Symptoms in China: A Longitudinal, Population-Based Study","<b>Objectives:</b> We aimed to examine how COVID-19 incidence is associated with depressive symptoms in China, whether the association is transient, and whether the association differs across groups. <b>Methods:</b> We used a longitudinal sample from 2018 to 2020 waves of the China Family Panel Study. We constructed COVID-19 incidence rates as the number of new cases per 100,000 population in respondents' resident provinces in the past 7, 14, and 28Ã‚Â days when a respondent was surveyed. We performed linear or logistic regressions to examine the associations, and performed stratified analyses to explore the heterogeneity of the associations. <b>Results:</b> Our sample included 13,655 adults. The 7-day incidence rate was positively associated with the CES-D score (coef. = 2.551, 95% CI: 1.959-3.142), and likelihood of being more depressed (adjusted odds ratio = 6.916, 95% CI: 4.715-10.144). The associations were larger among those with less education, pre-existing depression, or chronic conditions. We did not find any significant association between the 14- or 28-day local incidence rates and depressive symptoms. <b>Conclusion:</b> The impact of COVID-19 incidence on mental health in China's general population was statistically significant and moderate in magnitude and transient. Disadvantaged groups experienced higher increases in depressive symptoms.","Zhou, Cai, Xie","https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2022.1604919","20221021","COVID-19; China; chronic disease; depressive symptoms; education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39575,""
"SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Associated Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome A Case Report of Female Twin Adolescents","""Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome"", or PANS, is a rare syndrome characterized by an acute onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and/or severely restricted food intake accompanied by a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of twin adolescents with COVID-19-associated PANS. Dizygotic twin sisters in late teens, with abrupt and acute onset of severely restrictive food intake, weight loss, OCD, anxiety with intermittent auditory and visual hallucinations, depression, attention deficit, and sleep disturbances, simultaneously accompanied by milder neurologic symptoms such as hand tremor, tinnitus, dizziness, headache, and weakness of proximal muscles, were applied to child and adolescent psychiatry clinic. The only relevant agent underlying those neuropsychiatric and somatic complaints was COVID-19, and it was validated with laboratory testing, such as positive IgG titers of SARS-CoV-2 and negative biomarkers for other possible bacterial or viral agents. Generalized epileptic anomaly and a vermian/folial atrophy in the cerebellum were detected in further evaluations. Treatment options consisted of psychotropic agents, antibiotics, antiepileptic, and intravenous immunoglobulin transfusion finely treated the neuropsychiatric symptoms. Clinicians should consider SARS-CoV-2 as a potential agent, when a child presents with abrupt onset, dramatic neuropsychiatric symptoms also consisting of PANS, even in asymptomatic patients or with mild respiratory symptoms.","Efe","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycr.2022.100074","20221021","COVID-19; PANS; Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39576,""
"Anxiety and depression as predictors of life satisfaction during pre-professional health internships in COVID-19 times: the mediating role of psychological well-being","Due to the emotional impact of COVID-19 on university students, the goal was to explore the relationship between anxiety, depression, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction among pre-professional interns. The research was carried out using an explanatory cross-sectional design, with the participation of 1011 pre-professional interns of 13 health networks from the department of Puno (Peru). Data were collected using the Satisfaction with Life Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2, Patient Health Questionnaire 2, and the Psychological Wellbeing Scale. The main data analysis was carried out using the R statistical software, and implementing the confirmatory factor analysis technique, which evidenced that the explanatory model provides an acceptable value. Based on the above, a negative relationship between depression and life satisfaction, (ÃŽÂ² = -.60, p &lt; .001) and a positive relationship between anxiety and life satisfaction (ÃŽÂ² = .28, p &lt; .001) was shown, in addition to a mediating effect of the psychological wellbeing related to depression and life satisfaction (p &lt; .001). In conclusion, life satisfaction is explained concerning the degree of depression and anxiety, as well as the moderating effect of psychological well-being. Despite that, there is an urgent need to take preventive actions to strengthen the mental health of the pre-professional health interns, who have also been providing support during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mamani-Benito, Carranza Esteban, Castillo-Blanco, Caycho-Rodriguez, Tito-Betancur, FarfÃƒÂ¡n-SolÃƒÂ­s","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11025","20221021","Anxiety; Depression; Life satisfaction; Pre-professional practitioners; Psychological well-being; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39577,""
"The effects of loneliness and psychological flexibility on veterans' substance use and physical and mental health functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation was a common experience as people were trying to keep themselves and others safe from infection. Veterans with problematic substance use are at particular risk of the consequences of social isolation. This study evaluated the nature of social interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of loneliness and psychological flexibility on self-reported substance use and physical and mental health functioning among U.S. veterans who reported problematic substance use. Data from 409 veterans with self-reported substance use concerns were obtained via a cross-sectional online survey. Results showed that many veterans who engaged in problematic substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a number of social supports during this period and frequent communication with others, but still felt lonelier during the pandemic. In regression analyses, higher levels of loneliness were associated with more negative impacts of the pandemic, greater substance use, and poorer physical and mental health functioning. Psychological flexibility demonstrated significant unique variance in explaining mental health functioning during the pandemic after accounting for loneliness, but not for substance use or physical functioning. For veterans with high levels of loneliness, high levels of psychological flexibility were associated with a lower negative impact on quality of life due to the pandemic, but for veterans with low levels of loneliness, differing levels of psychological flexibility were not significantly associated with the negative impact of COVID-19. Overall, loneliness and psychological flexibility appear to be highly associated with the negative impact of COVID-19 on veterans with problematic substance use.","Kelly, DeBeer, Chamberlin, Claudio, Duarte, Harris, Kennedy, Shirk, Reilly","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2022.10.004","20221021","COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Substance use; veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39578,""
"Coping and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms among Chinese Youth in the Peak and Remission Periods of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed emergent vulnerability to adolescents' mental health. This longitudinal study investigated the association between coping at the peak of the COVID outbreak (T1) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms concurrently, and at the remission periods of COVID in China three months (T2) and six months (T3) later in a sample of 6<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup>-grade students (N=782). The results showed that forward-focus coping was negatively associated with PTSD symptoms across all three timepoints and predicted reduced risk for more PTSD symptoms at T2, and trauma-focus coping was positively associated with PTSD symptoms across all three timepoints and predicted higher risk of PTSD symptoms both at T2 and T3. There was an interaction effect of trauma-focus coping and T1 symptoms on later symptoms (T3) - trauma-focus coping was more detrimental for those who had more initial symptoms. The results showed the beneficial effects of future-oriented coping and harmful effects of trauma-focus coping for Chinese youth during the epidemic. Clinical implications of the results were discussed. The study examined how Chinese adolescents' trauma-focus and forward-focus coping impacted PTSD symptoms amidst the peak and remission periods of COVID-19. We found that forward-focus coping strategies were both preventative and protective for reducing risk of adverse mental health outcomes, whereas trauma-focus coping increased risk. The findings provided empirical support on fostering forward-focus coping skills, while minimizing trauma-oriented coping for Chinese youth in preventing negative outcomes under COVID-19.","Chen, Li, Chen, Wang, Zhu, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2022.106690","20221021","Adolescents; COVID-19; Coping; PTSD Symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39579,""
"Narrative resilience in the cross-regional support of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak: The Chinese experiences of cultural input","The healthcare staff who supported Wuhan's rescue work were the first batch of cross-regional supporters during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. To determine the cultural factors that affected their mental health and resilience, as well as the processes that organizations and individuals underwent to transform cultural resources into benefits. This study collected narrative materials in the form of national and individual statements and used Social Ecology of Resilience theory to analyse them. It identified and analysed the cultural factors of resilience in macrosystems, mesosystems, and microsystems according to four themes, namely: cognition, emotion, will, and behaviour. Altogether, it was found that the national voice adopted an optimistic narrative tone reminiscent of that used during the context of war and that the personal or public voice approved of it. The study revealed that the party and government's use of moral narration derived from its heritage culture and its belief in its continuity in new China's culture served as a mechanism of cultural resilience and mobilisation. The above is the experience of the operation of living culture (LC) and cultural heritage (CH) mentioned in Culture Based Development (CBD). In light of this, it was concluded that the predominant form of cultural input during China's national public health crisis has been storytelling with narrative resilience.","Guo, He","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103376","20221021","COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease Ã¢Ë†â€™19; Cultural input; Cultural resilience; Narrative resilience; Social ecology system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39580,""
"Prevalence and correlates of stocking up on drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic: Data from the C3PNO Consortium","Data from the COVID-19 pandemic describes increases in drug use and related harms, especially fatal overdose. However, evidence is needed to better understand the pathways from pandemic-related factors to substance use behaviours. Thus, we investigated stockpiling drugs among people who use drugs (PWUD) in five cities in the United States and Canada. We used data from two waves of interviews among participants in nine prospective cohorts to estimate the prevalence and correlates of stockpiling drugs in the previous month. Longitudinal correlates were identified using bivariate and multivariate generalized linear mixed-effects modeling analyses. From May 2020 to February 2021, we recruited 1873 individuals who completed 2242 interviews, of whom 217 (11.6%) reported stockpiling drugs in the last month at baseline. In the multivariate model, stockpiling drugs was significantly and positively associated with reporting being greatly impacted by COVID-19 (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]= 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.45), and at least daily use of methamphetamine (AOR = 4.67, 95% CI: 2.75-7.94) in the past month. We observed that approximately one-in-ten participants reported stocking up on drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic. This behaviour was associated with important drug-related risk factors including high-intensity methamphetamine use. While these correlations need further inquiry, it is possible that addressing the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable PWUD could help limit drug stockpiling, which may lower rates of high-intensity stimulant use.","King, Hayashi, Genberg, Choi, DeBeck, Kirk, Mehta, Kipke, Moore, Baum, Shoptaw, Gorbach, Mustanski, Javanbakht, Siminski, Milloy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109654","20221020","COVID-19; Overdose; Risky drug use; Stockpiling drugs; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","",39581,""
