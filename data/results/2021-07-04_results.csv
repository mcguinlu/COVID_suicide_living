"Neuropsychiatric disorders as risk factors and consequences of COVID-19: A Mendelian randomization study","Background More than 170 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide. It has been proposed that psychiatric disorders may be risk factors and/or consequences of COVID-19 infection. However, observational studies could be affected by confounding bias. Methods We performed bi-directional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate causal relationships between liability to COVID-19 (and severe/critical infection) and a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders or traits. We employed the latest GWAS summary statistics from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. A variety of MR methods including those accounting for horizontal pleiotropy were used. Results Overall we observed evidence that liability to COVID-19 or severe infection may be causally associated with higher risks of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder (BD) (especially BD II), schizophrenia (SCZ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and suicidal thought (ST) when compared to the general population. On the other hand, liability to a few psychiatric traits/disorders, for example ADHD, alcohol and opioid use disorders may be causally associated with higher risks of COVID-19 infection or severe disease. In genetic correlation analysis, cannabis use disorder, ADHD, and anxiety showed significant and positive genetic correlation with critical or hospitalized infection. All the above findings passed multiple testing correction at a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05. For pneumonia, in general we observed a different pattern of associations, with bi-directional positive associations with depression- and anxiety-related phenotypes. Conclusions In summary, this study provides evidence for tentative bi-directional causal associations between liability to COVID-19 (and severe infection) and a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further replications and prospective studies are required to verify the findings.","Yong XIANG; Jinghong QIU; Ruoyu ZHANG; Carlos Kwan-Long CHAU; Shitao RAO; Hon-Cheong SO","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.29.21259609","20210703","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-04","",15673,""
"100 Years apart: Psychiatric admissions during Spanish flu and COVID-19 pandemic","The last pandemic comparable to the current COVID-19 pandemic was the Spanish flu. Using the admission record books for the years 1917 and 1918 and electronic health records for the years 2019 and 2020, we extracted the relevant data and explored how they affected the numbers of emergency psychiatric admissions. The general trend in both pandemics was that they did not cause a rise in psychiatric admissions, findings which go along with reports around Europe. The causes for these similarities are complex but provide an interesting perspective as to why there is no concurrent rise in emergency psychiatric admissions.","VukojeviÃ„â€¡, Ã„Âuran, Ã…Â½aja, SuÃ…Â¡ac, Ã…Â ekerija, SaviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114071","20210703","COVID-19; Emergency admissions; Influenza; Mental health; Psychiatry; SARS-CoV-2; Spanish flu","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-04","",15674,""
"Mental health issues and health disparities amid COVID-19 outbreak in China: Comparison of residents inside and outside the epicenter","The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has exerted an impact on not only individuals who have contracted the virus but also the general public. This study compared the mental health condition of residents in the epicenter province of Hubei with that of other Chinese residents during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, and to examine emerging issues revolving around health disparities in disease prevention. A survey was administered in February 2020 to 433 Chinese adults spanning 28 regions across China. Participants residing in Hubei reported lower levels of affective and cognitive well-being than those in other regions. Perceived behavioral control and healthy lifestyle maintenance were associated with both dimensions of well-being and sleep quality for all participants. Income level was positively associated with facemask use and healthy lifestyle maintenance. These results indicate that Hubei residents reported poorer mental health than those of other regions, but perceived behavioral control and healthy lifestyle maintenance correlate with better mental health across regions. The likelihood of undertaking preventive measures for COVID-19 tends to be greater among residents with higher income, reflecting the need to address the oft-neglected concerns of health disparities in preventing this highly contagious novel disease.","Cheng, Wang, Chau","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114070","20210703","Coronavirus disease; Epidemic; Pandemic; Preventive measure; Psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-04","",15675,""
"The mark of mental health problems A field experiment on hiring discrimination before and during COVID-19","Mental health problems are associated with poor labour market outcomes. Based on data from a field experiment, this article investigates the extent to which hiring discrimination limits the job opportunities of young applicants who disclose a history of mental health problems. From September 2019 to December 2020, 1398 job applications were sent in pairs to 699 employers with job openings in a broad selection of occupations in the Norwegian labour market. The applicants were equally qualified except that, in each pair, one applicant informed about mental health problems as an explanation for a past employment break. The results show that applicants who disclose mental health problems are discriminated against in hiring processes. Applicants with mental health problems have about 27% lower probability of receiving an invitation to a job interview and about 22% lower probability of receiving any positive employer response. These results do not seem to have been driven by the COVID-19 crisis that unfolded during the course of the study. As such, the study provides suggestive evidence that uncertain economic times might not necessarily increase the level of discrimination against applicants with mental health problems.","BjÃƒÂ¸rnshagen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114181","20210703","COVID-19; Field experiment; Hiring discrimination; Mental health; Recession","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-04","",15676,""

"Profiling COVID-related experiences in the United States with the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory: Linkages to psychosocial functioning","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the lives of individuals, families, and communities around the world with constraints on multiple aspects of daily life. The purpose of the present study was to identify specific profiles of pandemic-related experiences and their relation to psychosocial functioning using the 92-item Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII). Data were collected as part of a cross-sectional, online survey of adults (18+) residing in the Northeast region of the United States (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 652) and recruited via online advertisements. Person-centered latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to 38 pandemic-related experiences that showed a significant bivariate correlation with perceived stress. Measures of psychosocial risk were also obtained. Results revealed five unique profiles of respondents based on patterns of pandemic-related experiences. Three profiles representing about 64% of the sample were characterized by moderate to high exposure to adverse experiences during the pandemic and were more likely to screen positive for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. These profiles were differentiated by sociodemographic differences, including age, caregiving, and employment status. Two profiles differentiated by age and caregiver status represented about 36% of the sample and were characterized by relatively low exposure to adverse experiences and lower risk for psychosocial impairment. Findings support the EPII as an instrument for measuring tangible and meaningful experiences in the context of an unprecedented pandemic disaster. This research may serve to identify high-risk subpopulations toward developing public health strategies for supporting families and communities in the context of public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Grasso, Briggs-Gowan, Carter, Goldstein, Ford","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2197","20210703","COVID-19; disaster; epidemic; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-04","",15678,""

"COVID-19 and eating disorder and mental health concerns in patients with eating disorders","The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic dramatically transformed daily life for adolescents and young adults, altering social and physical environments. Previous research has shown such shifts in daily life to be especially challenging for people living with eating disorders (ED). However, the extent of this environmental change on ED symptoms and mental health (MH) has been relatively unexplored in patients with EDs. This study examines how young people with EDs feel the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their living environments as well as their ED and MH symptoms and motivation for ED recovery. Participants were enrollees in the Registry of Eating Disorders and their Co-morbidities OVER time in Youth (RECOVERY) who responded to an additional survey (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°89) in July 2020 to assess their perceptions of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants reported on concerns of their ED worsening due to increased time living in a ""triggering environment"" due to the pandemic as well as perceived COVID-related changes in intrusive ED thoughts, depression, anxiety, isolation, and motivation to recover. Logistic regression models, adjusted for age and ED diagnosis, examined the association of triggering environment with ED and MH symptoms. The majority of respondents reported concern for worsening of their ED due to a ""triggering environment"" (63%). Most reported an increase in ED thoughts (74%), feelings of anxiety (77%), depression (73%), and isolation (80%) they perceived to be related to the pandemic. Nearly one-third reported decrease in motivation to recover (29%) they perceived to be related to the pandemic. After adjusting for age and ED diagnosis, participants who reported concern for worsening of their ED due to a triggering environment had nearly 18 times the odds of decreased motivation to recover (OR 18.1; 95% CI 3.37-97.4, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) and nearly 24 times the odds of increased ED thoughts (OR 23.8; 95% CI 4.31-131.6, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) compared to those who did not report concern for worsening of their ED due to a triggering environment. Our findings demonstrate the perceived negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the self-reported ED and MH symptoms in patients with EDs, particularly in those who report concern for a negative environmental change. These results underscore the need for heightened monitoring of patients with EDs during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home orders implemented across the world dramatically altered daily life for people of all ages. Previous research has detailed the profound impact the pandemic has had on mental health (MH), particularly among individuals with eating disorders (ED) [22]. This study explored how individuals with eating disorders perceive the COVID-19 pandemic to have impacted their ED symptoms and overall MH. Participants included adolescent/young adults (AYAs) with a diagnosed ED who were given a four-part survey on how they perceive the COVID-19 pandemic to have affected their ED symptoms and treatment and MH (89 participants). AYAs in the study reported feeling that their ED symptoms and MH concerns worsened due to the pandemic. Those who reported concern that their ED would worsen due to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“triggeringÃ¢â‚¬Â living environment were even more likely to report feeling that their ED and MH worsened due to the pandemic. A large percentage of participants also reported a decreased motivation to recover from their ED that they attributed to the pandemic. Overall, individuals with EDs may be at risk for worsening symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results underscore the need for increased monitoring of patients with EDs during the pandemic.","Vitagliano, Jhe, Milliren, Lin, Spigel, Freizinger, Woods, Forman, Richmond","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00437-1","20210703","Adolescents; COVID-19; Comorbidity; Eating disorders; Mental health; Mental health recovery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-04","",15680,""
"Risk assessment of paternal depression in relation to partner delivery during COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China","The COVID-19 pandemic and relevant prevention and control measures may affect the mental health and induce depressive symptoms in fathers with concurrent partner delivery exposure. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression in fathers with simultaneous exposure to COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of family functions on paternal perinatal depression (PPD) risk. A cross-sectional study was conducted among the perinatal fathers recruited in a large tertiary hospital in Wuhan across the whole pandemic period from 31 December 2019 to 11 April 2020. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and APGAR family function scale were used to evaluate PPD and family function, respectively. Chi-square test and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model were applied for data analysis. Among the 1187 participants, the prevalence of PPD was 13.82% throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with that in the time period before the announcement of human-to-human transmission on 19 January 2020, the depression risk was significantly lower during the traffic restriction (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.54, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.86) and public transportation reopening periods (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.29, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.59). Poor/fair family functions was associated with elevated depression risk (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.93, 95% CI: 1.90, 4.52). Individuals reporting a low family income and smoking had high depression risks. A declined risk of PPD was observed over the traffic restriction period of the COVID-19 pandemic. An improved family function may help alleviate the risk of PPD during the pandemic. Health authorities are recommended to formulate targeted prevention and control strategies to handle PPD.","Sun, Wang, Wang, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03325-9","20210703","COVID-19; Family function; Paternal perinatal depression; Risk factors; Traffic restriction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-04","",15681,""
"Cumulative effect of loneliness and social isolation on health outcomes among older adults","Loneliness and social isolation are described similarly yet are distinct constructs. Numerous studies have examined each construct separately; however, less effort has been dedicated to exploring the impacts in combination. This study sought to describe the cumulative effects on late-life health outcomes. Survey data collected in 2018-2019 of a randomly sampled population of US older adults, age 65+, were utilized (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6,994). Survey measures included loneliness and social isolation using the UCLA-3 Loneliness Scale and Social Network Index. Participants were grouped into four categories based on overlap. Groups were lonely only, socially isolated only, both lonely and socially isolated, or neither. Bivariate and adjusted associations were examined. Among participants (mean age = 76.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years), 9.8% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°684) were considered lonely only, 20.6% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,439) socially isolated only, 9.1% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°639) both lonely and socially isolated, and 60.5% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4,232) neither. Those considered both lonely and socially isolated were more likely to be older, female, less healthy, depressed, with lower quality of life and greater medical costs in bivariate analyses. In adjusted results, participants who were both lonely and socially isolated had significantly higher rates of ER visits and marginally higher medical costs. Results demonstrate cumulative effects of these constructs among older adults. Findings not only fill a gap in research exploring the impacts of loneliness and social isolation later in life, but also confirm the need for approaches targeting older adults who are both lonely and socially isolated. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, this priority will continue to be urgent for older adults.","Barnes, MacLeod, Tkatch, Ahuja, Albright, Schaeffer, Yeh","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1940096","20210703","Loneliness; health outcomes; healthcare costs; healthcare utilization; older adults; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-04","",15682,""
"Postâ€“COVID-19 Syndrome (Long Haul Syndrome): Description of a Multidisciplinary Clinic at Mayo Clinic and Characteristics of the Initial Patient Cohort","Objective To describe characteristics of a series of patients reporting prolonged symptoms after an infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients and Methods This study describes the multidisciplinary COVID-19 Activity Rehabilitation Program, established at Mayo Clinic to evaluate and treat patients with postâ€“COVID syndrome, and reports the clinical characteristics of the first 100 patients receiving evaluation and management during the timeframe of June 1, 2020, and December 31,Â 2020. Results The cohort consisted of 100 patients (mean age, 45.4Â±14.2 years; 68% women; mean body mass index, 30.2 kg/m2; presenting a mean of 93 days after infection). Common preexisting conditions were respiratory (23%) and mental health, including depression and/or anxiety (34%). Most (75%) had not been hospitalized for COVID-19. Common presenting symptoms ware fatigue (80%), respiratory complaints (59%), and neurological complaints (59%) followed by subjective cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, and mental health symptoms. More than one-third of patients (34%) reported difficulties in performing basic activities of daily living. Only 1 in 3 patients had returned to unrestricted work duty at the time of the analysis. For most patients, laboratory and imaging tests showed no abnormalities or were nondiagnostic despite debilitating symptoms. Most patients required physical therapy, occupational therapy, or brain rehabilitation. Face-to-face and virtual care delivery modalities were feasible. Conclusion Most of the patients did not have COVID-19â€“related symptoms that were severe enough to require hospitalization, were younger than 65 years, and were more likely to be female, and most had no preexisting comorbidities before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Symptoms including mood disorders, fatigue, and perceived cognitive impairment resulted in severe negative impacts on resumption of functional and occupational activities in patients experiencing prolonged effects.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2021.04.024","20210701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-04","",15683,""
