"Characterizing the COVID-19 illness experience to inform the study of post-acute sequalae and recovery: a qualitative study","We aimed to characterize the variability in the illness experience and recovery process from COVID-19. We conducted 24 in-depth individual interviews with participants enrolled in the Long-term Immunological Impact of Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) cohort study in San Francisco, California from June through October of 2020. Participants were adults who had a previously confirmed positive SARV-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test result, had recovered or were recovering from acute infection, and underwent serial evaluations at our clinical research center. We purposefully sampled 24 English- and Spanish-speaking adults with asymptomatic, mild and severe symptomatic infection, including those who were hospitalized, and those with HIV co-infection. Half of our sample (50.0%) identified as Latinx/Hispanic and most of the participants were men (62.5%). We used thematic analysis to characterize the illness experience, recovery process, and mental health impact of experiencing COVID-19 and present clinical data for each participant. Emergent themes were: (1) across symptom profiles and severity, experiencing COVID-19 was associated with psychological distress, (2) among participants with symptomatic infection, the illness experience was characterized by uncertainty in terms of managing symptoms and recovery, and (3) despite wide-ranging illness experiences, participants shared many common characteristics, including health information-seeking behavior facilitated by access to medical care, and uncertainty regarding the course of their illness and recovery. COVID-19 was associated with elevated levels of psychological distress, regardless of symptoms.","Edda I. Santiago-Rodriguez; Andres Maiorana; Michael J Peluso; Rebecca Hoh; Viva Tai; Emily A.

"University Studentsâ€™ Self-Rated Health in Relation to Perceived Acoustic Environment during the COVID-19 Home Quarantine","Background: Online education became mandatory for many students during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and blurred the distinction between settings where processes of stress and restoration used to take place  The lockdown also likely changed perceptions of the indoor acoustic environment (i e , soundscape) and raised its importance  In the present study, we seek to understand how indoor soundscape related to university studentsâ€™ self-rated health in Bulgaria around the time that the country was under a state of emergency declaration caused by the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods: Between 17 May and 10 June 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 323 students (median age 21 years;31% male) from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria  Self-rated health (SRH) was measured with a single-item  Participants were asked how frequently they heard different types of sounds while at home and how pleasant they considered each of those sounds to be  Restorative quality of the home (the â€œbeing awayâ€ dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale) was measured with a single-item  A priori confounders and effect modifiers included sociodemographics, house-related characteristics, general sensitivity to environmental influences, and mental health  Our analysis strategy involved sequential exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multivariate linear and ordinal regressions, effect modification tests, and structural equation modeling (SEM)  Results: EFA supported grouping perceived sounds into three distinct factorsâ€”mechanical, human, and nature sounds  Regression analyses revealed that greater exposure to mechanical sounds was consistently associated with worse SRH, whereas no significant associations were found for human and nature sounds  In SEM, exposure to mechanical sounds related to lower restorative quality of the home, and then to poorer SRH, whereas nature sounds correlated with higher restorative quality, and in turn with better SRH  Conclusions: These findings suggest a role of positive indoor soundscape and restorative quality for promoting self-rated health in times of social distancing","Dzhambov, Angel M.; Lercher, Peter, Stoyanov, Drozdstoy, Petrova, Nadezhda, Novakov, Stoyan, Dimitrova, Donka D.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052538","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;18(5):2538, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;18(5):2538, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11842,""

"Mental health status among Chinese healthcare-associated infection control professionals during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019: A national cross-sectional survey","ABSTRACT: Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has greatly threatened global public health. The responsibility of healthcare-associated infection control professionals (ICPs) is to prevent and control the nosocomial infections. The mental health status of ICPs deserves more attention, however, the correlational research is still lacking. This study aims to investigate the incidence and risk factors of mental health status among ICPs in China during the outbreak of COVID-19.A national cross-sectional survey was performed. The online questionnaire was completed by 9228 ICPs from 3776 hospitals throughout China. Data collection tools were used, including demographics data questionnaire, the Chinese version of the 12-item general health questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Chinese version of the psychological capital questionnaire (PCQ) for medical staff. Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted.The total score of mental health of Chinese ICPs was 3.45Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>Â±Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>2.57. 5608 (60.77%) ICPs might have mental health problems. The psychological capital was in the upper-middle level with an average score of 3.72Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>Â±Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>0.38. An increased mental health problem risk was associated with the greater self-efficacy and working in the public hospital; a significantly lower risk was obtained by working in the second-class hospital rather than in the third-class hospitals. Besides, mental health problem risk of ICPs working in hospitals of the western economic region or northeast economic region was more significant than that in hospitals of the central economic region. However, a lower risk was caused by the unmarried than married, and working years in department &#8804;1Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>year contributed to the lower risk than that >20Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>years. Moreover, fewer working hours per week, higher values of hope, and optimism each were contributed to a lower risk.Chinese healthcare-associated ICPs were under different levels of mental health problems in fighting against COVID-19. More importantly, we should actively deal with the mental health problem of ICPs and help them get rid of psychological disorders.","Zhang, Ying; Tian, Lingyun; Li, Wan; Wen, Ximao; Wu, Hongman; Gong, Ruie; Zeng, Lanman; Zhou, Feng; Liu, Zhenru; Tang, Ziyuan; Wu, Anhua; Huang, Xun","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000024503","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Medicine (Baltimore);100(5): e24503, 2021 Feb 05.; Publication details: Medicine (Baltimore);100(5): e24503, 2021 Feb 05.; Cross Infection; Infection Control Practitioners; Infection Control; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Stress; Adult; /prevention & control; China/epidemiology; Cross Infection/epidemiology; Cross Infection/prevention & control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Infection Control/methods; Infection Control/organization & administration; Infection Control Practitioners/psychology; Infection Control Practitioners/statistics & numerical data; Male; Mental Health/statistics & numerical data; Occupational Exposure/prevention & control; Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data; Occupational Stress/epidemiology; Occupational Stress/etiology; Occupational Stress/prevention & control; Risk Assessment; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11872,""
"Anxiety, depression, stress, fear and social support during COVID-19 pandemic among Jordanian healthcare workers","The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected health-care workers' psychological and mental health. Few studies have been conducted examining the psychological effect of COVID-19 on health-care worker psychological health in Jordan. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the respective levels of fear, anxiety, depression, stress, social support, and the associated factors, experienced by Jordanian health-care workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This study adopted a cross-sectional, correlational design to collect data from 365 health-care workers in Amman, Jordan, from August 16th to 23rd, 2020. Along with collecting sociodemographic characteristics, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support electronically administered to participants. The majority of the participants (69.3%) were registered nurses. The mean overall score for the Fear of COVID-19 scale was 23.64 (SD + 6.85) which again exceeded the mid-point for the total score range (21), indicating elevated level fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants had displayed extremely severe depression 40%, extremely severe anxiety 60%, and 35% severely distressed. Scores for depression (21.30 Ã‚Â± 10.86), anxiety (20.37 Ã‚Â± 10.80), stress (23.33 Ã‚Â± 10.87) were also high. Factors determined to be associated with psychological distress were being male, married, aged 40 years and older, and having more clinical experience. Assessment of social support indicated moderate-to-high levels of perceived support for all dimensions (significant other: 5.17 Ã‚Â± 1.28, family: 5.03 Ã‚Â± 1.30, friends: 5.05 Ã‚Â± 1.30). Weak significant correlations were found between social support and the other study variables (r &lt; 0.22), indicating a weak association with fear, depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Overall, Jordanian health-care workers sample reported fear, depression, anxiety, and stress. The associated factors were being male, married, aged 40 years and older, and having more clinical experience. Regarding social support, participants primarily relied on support from their families, followed by support from friends.","Alnazly, Khraisat, Al-Bashaireh, Bryant","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247679","20210312","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11873,""
"Droplet and Aerosol Generation With Mastoidectomy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Assessment of Baseline Risk and Mitigation Measures With a High-performance Cascade Impactor","Aerosols are generated during mastoidectomy and mitigation strategies may effectively reduce aerosol spread. An objective understanding of aerosol generation and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies can inform interventions to reduce aerosol risk from mastoidectomy and other open surgeries involving drilling. Cadaveric and fluorescent three-dimensional printed temporal bone models were drilled under variable conditions and mitigation methods. Aerosol production was measured with a cascade impactor set to detect particle sizes under 14.1Ã¢â‚¬Å ÃŽÂ¼m. Field contamination was determined with examination under UV light. Drilling of cadaveric bones and three-dimensional models resulted in strongly positive aerosol production, measuring positive in all eight impactor stages for the cadaver trials. This occurred regardless of using coarse or cutting burs, irrigation, a handheld suction, or an additional parked suction. The only mitigation factor that led to a completely negative aerosol result in all eight stages was placing an additional microscope drape to surround the field. Bone dust was scattered in all directions from the drill, including on the microscope, the surgeon, and visually suspended in the air for all but the drape trial. Aerosols are generated with drilling the mastoid. Using an additional microscope drape to cover the surgical field was an effective mitigation strategy to prevent fine aerosol dispersion while drilling.","Freiser, Dharmarajan, Sri Kavya Boorgu, Sim, Corcoran, Jabbour, Chi","https://doi.org/10.1097/MAO.0000000000002987","20210312","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11874,""
"Neurological and psychiatric presentations associated with COVID-19","The objective is to investigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated neurological and psychiatric effects and explore possible pathogenic mechanisms. This study included 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Neurological manifestations were evaluated by well-trained neurologists, psychologists, psychiatric presentations and biochemical changes were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and electronic medical records. Eighteen (23.4%) patients presented with neurological symptoms. Patients with neurological presentations had higher urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and lower basophil counts. Among them, patients with muscle involvement had higher urea nitrogen and cystatin C levels but lower basophil counts. In addition, patients with psychiatric presentations were older and had higher interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels and higher alkaline phosphatase, R-glutamate transferase, and urea nitrogen levels. Moreover, patients with anxiety had higher IL-6 and IL-10 levels than those without, and patients with moderate depression had higher CD8Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°TÃ‚Â cell counts and lower CD4Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°/CD8Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°ratios than other patients. This study indicates that the central nervous system may be influenced in patients with COVID-19, and the pathological mechanisms may be related to direct virus invasion of the central nervous system, infection-mediated overreaction of the immune system, and aberrant serum pro-inflammatory factors. In addition, basophils and cystatin C may also play important roles during these pathological processes. Our findings suggest that neurological and psychiatric presentations should be evaluated and managed in patients with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms.","He, Zhang, Zhang, Zheng, Zhang, Pan, Yu, Zhang, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-021-01244-0","20210312","COVID-19; Neurological presentations; Psychiatric presentations; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11875,""
"Increased risk of mental health disorders in patients with RA during the COVID-19 pandemic: a possible surge and solutions","Depression is a common co-morbidity among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, which may translate into difficulty performing activities of daily living. COVID-19 is an unprecedented disaster that has disrupted lives worldwide and led to a rise in the incidence of mental health disorders. Given the widespread economic devastation due to COVID-19, many RA patients, already susceptible to mental illness, maybe at an increased risk of inaccessibility to medical care, accentuated stress, and consequent worsening of existent mental health disorders, or the onset of new mental health disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or depression. The objective of this review is to assess if there is an increased risk of mental health disorders in patients with RA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine has bridged the transition to remote chronic care in the pandemic period, though certain accessibility and technological challenges are to be addressed. Decreased access to care amid lockdowns and a proposed triggering of disease activity in patients with autoimmune disorders may potentially herald a massive spike in incidence or flares of patients diagnosed with RA in the coming months. Such a deluge of cases may be potentially devastating to an overburdened healthcare system.

"COVID-19-related cancellation of elective orthopaedic surgery caused increased pain and psychosocial distress levels","Health care systems in most European countries were temporarily restructured to provide as much capacity as possible for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Subsequently, all elective surgeries had to be cancelled and postponed for months. The aim of the present study was to assess the pretreatment health status before and after COVID-19-related cancellation and the psychosocial distress caused by the cancellation. For this study, a questionnaire was developed collecting sociodemographic data and information on health status before and after the cancellation. To assess psychosocial distress, the validated depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), was implemented. PHQ-9-Scores of 10 and above were considered to indicate moderate or severe depressive symptoms. In total, 119 patients whose elective orthopaedic surgery was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic were surveyed once at least 8Ã‚Â weeks after the cancellation. Seventy-seven patients (65%; 34 female, 43 male) completed the questionnaire and were included. The predominant procedures were total knee arthroplasty (TKA), hip arthroscopy and foot and ankle surgery. The mean pain level significantly increased from 5.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.2 at the time of the initially scheduled surgery to 6.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.5 at the time of the survey (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). The pain level before cancellation of the surgery was significantly higher in female patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.029). An increased analgetic consumption was identified in 46% of all patients. A mean PHQ-9 score of 6.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.9 was found after cancellation. PHQ-9 scores of 10 or above were found in 14% of patients, and 8% exhibited scores of 15 points or above. Significantly higher PHQ-9 scores were seen in female patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.046). No significant differences in PHQ-9 scores were found among age groups, procedures or reasons for cancellation. Cancellation of elective orthopaedic surgery resulted in pain levels that were significantly higher than when the surgery was scheduled, leading to increased analgesic use. Additionally, significant psychosocial distress due to the cancellation was identified in some patients, particularly middle-aged women. Despite these results, confidence in the national health care system and in the treating orthopaedic surgeons was not affected.

"Translating science into policy: mental health challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic","Several stressors associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are expected to affect the mental health of global populations: the effects of physical distancing, quarantine, and social isolation; the emotional suffering of health and other frontline workers; neuropsychiatric sequelae in those affected by the virus; the impact to families of lives lost to the disease; differential effects for those with severe mental disorders; and the consequences of social and economic deterioration. In this context, we sought: to form a panel of Brazilian experts on child and adolescent health, neurodevelopment, health services, and adult and elderly mental health; and to compile evidence-based interventions to support suggested policy changes in Brazil to mitigate the expected increase in mental health disorders during the pandemic and its mental health consequences. The following actions are recommended: 1) invest in prevention programs for the safe return of students to schools; 2) adopt evidence-based psychosocial interventions to maintain an adequate environment for child and adolescent development; 3) target socially vulnerable populations and those experiencing discrimination; 4) train primary care teams to solve common mental health problems, provide needs-based assessments, and manage long-term, at-home care for older patients; 5) invest in technological advancements (e.g., telemedicine, e-Health, and web-based algorithms) to promote coordinated care; 6) increase access to and literacy in the use of computers and mobile phones, especially among older adults; 7) expand protocols for remote, brief psychotherapy interventions and psychoeducation to manage common mental health problems.","Mari, Gadelha, Kieling, Ferri, Kapczinski, Nardi, Almeida-Filho, Sanchez, Salum","https://doi.org/10.1590/1516-4446-2020-1577","20210312","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11879,""

"Investigation on the psychological status of college students during the coronavirus disease-2019 epidemic","This study is designed to investigate the mental health status of college students under the current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and explore potential influential factors. We surveyed 1128 people including 435 medical students and 693 nonmedical students by a self-designed questionnaire containing general demographic characteristics, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Chinese Perceived Stress Scale. SPSS 23.0 software was used for statistical analysis. The incidence of anxiety, depression, and perceived stress were 8.4, 22.7, and 42.9% among college students during the COVID-19, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis showed that sex, specialty, and Family conflict were all positively associated with SAS, SDS, and CPSS (<i>p&lt;</i>0.05). Stepwise linear retrospective analysis showed that family conflicts and specialty were the influencing factors of SAS, SDS, and CPSS.

"Lessons learned from keeping NSW's prisons COVID-free","New South Wales (NSW) correctional system houses 30% of prisoners in Australia and at this time has only had a single documented case of COVID-19 amongst its prisoner population. The coordinated response by Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network (The Network) undertaken with the support of NSW Ministry of Health, in partnership with Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW), Youth Justice and private jails has ensured that the NSW correctional system has remained otherwise COVID-free. A research study of how a range of partners which support the operations of NSW Correctional System developed an effective approach for the prevention a COVID-19 epidemic amongst its inmates. Establishment of effective partnerships, early coordination of representatives from all aspects of the NSW correctional system, limited access to the correctional environment, reduced prison population and strict isolation of all new receptions have all contributed to maintaining this COVID-free status despite other NSW settings with similar risk profiles, such as aged care facilities and cruise ship arrivals, experiencing serious outbreaks. Although Australia/New Zealand context of suppressed community infection rates for COVID-19 (which are approaching elimination in some jurisdictions) is in contrast to the situation in other parts of the world, the principles described in this paper will be useful to most other correctional systems. Modelling was used to underline our approach and reinforced the veracity of following this approach. The Network and CSNSW has been able to mount an effective, integrated response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been sustainable through the first peak of COVID-19 cases. This case study catalogues the process of developing this response and details each intervention implemented with inventive use of tables to demonstrate the impact of the range of interventions used.","Blogg, McGrath, Galouzis, Grant, Hoey","https://doi.org/10.1108/IJPH-09-2020-0073","20210312","Correctional health care; Health promotion; Infectious disease; Prisoners; Psychological health; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11882,""

"Experiences of lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic: descriptive findings from a survey of families in the Born in Bradford study","<b>Background</b>: Lockdown measures implemented to contain the Covid-19 virus may be increasing health inequalities, with families from deprived and ethnically diverse backgrounds most likely to be adversely affected. This paper presents findings of the experiences of the Covid-19 lockdown on families living in the multi-ethnic and deprived city of Bradford, England. <b>Methods</b>: Questionnaire surveys were sent during the Covid-19 UK lockdown (10th April to 30 <sup>th</sup> June 2020) to parents in two prospective birth cohort studies. Cross tabulations explored variation by ethnicity and employment status. Text from open questions were analysed using thematic analysis. <b>Results</b>: Of 7,652 families invited, 2,144 (28%) participated. Ethnicity of respondents was: 957 (47%) Pakistani heritage, 715 (35%) White British and 356 (18%) other. 971 (46%) live in the most deprived decile of material deprivation in England. 2,043 (95%) were mothers and 101 were partners. The results summarised below are based on the mothers' responses. Many families live in poor quality (N=574, 28%), and overcrowded (N=364, 19%) housing; this was more common in families of Pakistani heritage and other ethnicities. Financial (N=738 (37%), food (N=396, 20%), employment (N=728, 37%) and housing (N=204, 10%) insecurities were common, particularly in those who were furloughed, self-employed not working or unemployed. Clinically significant depression and anxiety symptoms were reported by 372 (19%) and 318 (16%) of the mothers and were more common in White British mothers and those with economic insecurity. Open text responses corroborated these findings and highlighted high levels of anxiety about becoming ill or dying from Covid-19. <b>Conclusions</b>: The experiences of the Covid-19 lockdown in this ethnically diverse and deprived population highlight a large number of families living in poor housing conditions, suffering from economic insecurity and poor mental health. There is a need for policy makers and commissioners to better support these families.","Dickerson, Kelly, Lockyer, Bridges, Cartwright, Willan, Shire, Crossley, Sheldon, Lawlor, Wright, McEachan, Pickett","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16317.1","20210312","Born in Bradford; Covid-19; cohorts; ethnicity; health inequalities; mental health; poverty; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11884,""

"Self-Perception of Changes in Routines in Adults and Older Adults Associated to Social Distancing Due to COVID-19-A Study in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil","COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness with higher mortality in older adults. This condition is spread person-to-person through close contact, and among policies employed to decrease transmission are the improvement of hygiene habits and physical distancing. Although social distancing has been recognized as the best way to prevent the transmission, there are concerns that it may promote increased depression symptoms risk and anxiety, mainly in older adults. This cross-sectional study aimed to verify self-concept of social distancing in adults compared to older adults. All participants, over 18 years and residents of SÃƒÂ£o Paulo state (Brazil), were invited to join this research study by a message application and answered an interdisciplinary questionnaire during the period from May 23 to June 23, 2020. The questions were divided into the following aspects: sociodemographic data, financial conditions, routine-related perception, perception of health, physical and emotional state, and eating habits. The younger adult group was composed of 139 participants, with a mean age of 43.15 years (Ã‚Â±10.92), and the older adult group was composed of 437 participants with a mean age of 67.59 years (Ã‚Â±6.13) of both sex. Changes in routine during the period of social distance were reported by 95% of adults and 96.8% of older adults, but adults indicated more significant alterations in routine. Although there was no difference between groups for several aspects, adults revealed greater alterations in sleep quality, evacuation frequency, and more difficulty to perform daily activities at home. Further studies are necessary to follow up the impacts of social distancing among adults and older adults in different socioeconomic contexts to better understand the long-term alterations and the necessity of interventions.","Machado-Lima, Alonso, Gozzo, Zanca, Brech, Montiel, Bastos, Longo, Mota-Ortiz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.607559","20210312","COVID-19; adults; aged; perception; social distance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11886,""
"It's Complicated-Adolescent Grief in the Time of Covid-19","Presently, there is a real possibility of a second pandemic occurring: a grief pandemic. There are estimated to be over 1 million children and young people experiencing bereavement because of Covid-19. Adolescent grief is unique due to bio-psycho-social factors such as increased risk-taking, identity-formation, and limited capacity for emotional regulation. In this article, we will argue that adolescents are at increased risk of developing complicated grief during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that it is vital that services are improved to recognize and address this need before secondary problems emerge, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. Complicated grief in adolescents is widely underrecognized and often misdiagnosed as a range of mental health problems, addictions, and offending behavior. For example, 25% of &lt;20 year olds who commit suicide have experienced childhood bereavement, whilst 41% of youth offenders have experienced childhood bereavement; this is in comparison with only 4% of the general population. Many of the broader risk factors for complicated grief were already increasing prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, including increased loneliness amongst young people, and the collapse of collective structures to help people manage grief. We propose that this pandemic could be a catalyst for mental health professionals to support and nurture the caring communities emerging in this time as an essential resource to prevent the onset of a grief pandemic.","Weinstock, Dunda, Harrington, Nelson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.638940","20210312","adolescent; community; complicated grief (CG); digital; disadvantage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11887,""
"An observational study of the impact of COVID-19 and the rapid implementation of telehealth on community mental health center providers","The COVID-19 pandemic has remarkably altered community mental health service delivery through the rapid implementation of telehealth. This study reports provider perspectives on the impact that COVID-19 and the transition to telehealth had on their work and their ability to deliver evidence-based practices (EBPs). Providers (n = 93) completed online surveys with quantitative measures and open-ended items exploring their reactions to COVID-19 and to the transition to providing services via telehealth. Perceptions of personal risk and rumination around COVID-19 were low, while telehealth was viewed positively by providers. Three major themes emerged regarding the major impacts of COVID-19 on work: (1) the altered nature of interactions between patient/client and provider due to telehealth implementation, (2) changes in provider expectations regarding productivity, and (3) challenges maintaining work-life balance. In regard to the major impacts of COVID-19 on EBP delivery, three themes emerged: (1) increased difficulty delivering certain therapies via telehealth, (2) potential limitations to session confidentiality, and (3) challenge of engaging children in telehealth. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, community mental health providers continued to engage with clients and deliver EBPs while navigating a number of changes related to the rapid transition to and implementation of telehealth. This study highlights the need for further work on what supports providers need to effectively engage with clients and deliver EBPs via telehealth, and has implications for how telehealth is sustained or de-implemented post-COVID-19.","Sklar, Reeder, Carandang, Ehrhart, Aarons","https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00123-y","20210312","COVID-19; Community mental health; Evidence-based practice; Provider perspectives; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11888,""
"Adolescent emotional disorder symptoms and transdiagnostic vulnerabilities as predictors of young adult substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: mediation by substance-related coping behaviors","The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique stressors (e.g. social isolation) that may increase substance use risk among young adults with a history of emotional disturbance. This study examined whether emotional disorder symptoms and transdiagnostic vulnerabilities during adolescence predicted young adult substance use during COVID-19, and whether using substances to cope with the pandemic's social conditions mediated these associations. Adolescents (<i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 2,120) completed baseline surveys assessing transdiagnostic emotional vulnerabilities (anhedonia, distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency) and symptoms (major depression[MD], generalized anxiety[GAD], panic disorder[PD], social phobia[SP], obsessive-compulsive disorder[OCD]) in adolescence (September-December 2016; M[<i>SD</i>] ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 17.45[0.38]). At follow-up (May-August 2020; M[<i>SD</i>] ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 21.16[0.39]), past 30-day substance use and using substances to cope with social isolation during the pandemic were reported. Adjusted models showed that baseline distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency, and MD symptoms each significantly predicted higher number of past-month single-substance using days and number of substances used at follow-up (ÃŽÂ²sÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04-0.06). In each case, associations were mediated by tendency to use substances to cope with the pandemic (ÃŽÂ²<sub>indirect</sub> range: 0.028-0.061).

"'It's the economy, stupid': Lessons of a longitudinal study of depression in Argentina","On March 20, 2020, the Argentine Ministry of Health imposed a mandatory quarantine, which still persists. The aim of this study is to determine the variation in the prevalence of depression since the beginning of the quarantine and the evolution of risk factors, with special emphasis on the population's concerns. A longitudinal study was carried out using a digital questionnaire disseminated in social networks. The first stage (T1) was carried out from March 29 to April 12 and the second stage (T2) from May 23 to June 12, 2020. The prevalence of depression was measured using the 9-item Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The prevalence of moderate/severe depression increased from 24.3% in T1 to 47.8% in T2 (p: 0.000). Risk factors increased significantly: age 18-27, female, primary and secondary school, smoking and having a poor sleep quality (p: 0.000). The concerns about 'a family member getting sick' (OR: 1.28; CI: 1.04-1.58; p: 0.016), 'changes at work' (OR: 2.24; CI: 1.79-2.81; p: 0.000), 'running out of money' (OR: 1.43; CI: 1.20-1.71; p: 0.000) and 'being unemployed' (OR: 2.99; CI: 2.55-3.52; p: 0.000) were risk factors for depression. On the other hand, the concern about 'getting the virus' (OR: 0.73; CI: 0.61-0.87; p: 0.001) was not a risk factor. The extended quarantine in Argentina is associated with an increase in the prevalence of depression; the high impact of economic and social concerns on mental health must be considered in order to avoid long-term effects.","Badellino, Gobbo, Torres, Aschieri, Biotti, Alvarez, Gigante, Cachiarelli","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764021999687","20210312","Argentina; COVID-19; concerns; depression; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-13","",11890,""
