"The Relationship Between Symptoms and Job Loss among Japanese Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Cohort Study","Objectives: The aim of this study was to clarify which workers' symptoms led to unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study using questionnaires about COVID-19 administered to Japanese workers. A baseline survey conducted in December 2020 was used to determine workers' health history. Unemployment since the baseline survey was ascertained with a follow-up survey in December 2021. The odds ratios (ORs) of unemployment were estimated using a multilevel logistic model with adjusted covariates nested in prefecture of residence. Results: Males (n = 8,682) accounted for 58.2% of the total sample (n = 14,910), and the mean age was 48.2 years. Multivariate analysis showed that workers with pain-related problems; limited physical movement and mobility; fatigue, loss of strength or appetite, fever, dizziness, and moodiness; mental health problems; or sleep had a greater probability of resigning for health reasons, resigning for all reasons other than retirement, and being unemployed. Those with skin, hair, and cosmetic concerns; or eye-related matters had a greater probability of becoming unemployed. Conclusions: We identified an association between workers' symptoms and resignation or unemployment, with different symptoms having different ORs. Furthermore, there were differences in the associations among the effects of symptoms, work dysfunction, resignation/unemployment, and attitudes of others. Preventive interventions to help workers resolve or improve their symptoms could prevent their becoming unemployed or resigning.","Shintaro Okahara; Yoshihisa Fujino; Tomohisa Nagata; Mami Kuwamura; Kosuke Mafune; Keiji Muramatsu; Seiichiro Tateishi; Akira Ogami; Koji Mori","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.06.22279656","20220909","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37354,""
"The effects of COVID-19 on child mental and social health: biannual assessments up to April 2022 in a clinical and two general population samples","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had an acute impact on child mental and social health, but long-term effects are still unclear. We examined how child mental health has developed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic up to two years into the pandemic (April 2022). Methods We included children (age 8-18) from two general population samples (N = 222-1,333 per measurement and N = 2,401-13,362 for pre-covid data) and one clinical sample receiving psychiatric care (N = 334-748). Behavioral questionnaire data were assessed five times from April 2020 till April 2022 and pre-pandemic data were available for both general population samples. We collected parent-reported data on internalizing and externalizing problems with the Brief Problem Monitor and self-reported data on Anxiety, Depressive symptoms, Sleep-related impairments, Anger, Global health, and Peer relations with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Results In all samples, parents reported overall increased internalizing problems, but no increases in externalizing problems, in their children. Children from the general population self-reported increased mental health problems from before to during the pandemic on all six PROMIS domains, with generally worst scores in April 2021, and scores improving towards April 2022 but not to pre-pandemic norms. Children from the clinical sample reported increased mental health problems throughout the pandemic, with generally worst scores in April 2021 or April 2022 and no improvement. We found evidence of minor age effects and no sex effects. Conclusions Child mental health in the general population has deteriorated during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, has improved since April 2021, but has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Children in psychiatric care show worsening of mental health problems during the pandemic, which has not improved since. Changes in child mental health should be monitored comprehensively to inform health care and policy.","Josjan Zijlmans; Jacintha M Tieskens; Hedy A van Oers; Hekmat Alrouh; Michiel AJ Luijten; Rowdy de Groot; Daniel van der Doelen; Helen Klip; Rikkert M van der Lans; Ronald de Meyer; Malindi van der Mheen; Hyun I Ruisch; Germie van den Berg; Hilgo Bruining; Jan Buitelaar; Rachel van der Rijken; Pieter J Hoekstra; Marloes Kleinjan; Ramon JL Lindauer; Kim J Oostrom; Wouter Staal; Robert Vermeiren; Ronald Cornet; Lotte Haverman; Arne Popma; Meike Bartels; Tinca Polderman","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.08.22279670","20220909","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37355,""
"What is the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the Health-Related Quality of Life of individuals with mild symptoms (or non-hospitalised): A rapid review","The COVID-19 morbidities model has been widely used since 2020 to support Test and Trace and assess the cost-effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination programme. The current iteration of the Long COVID model covers several morbidities associated with COVID-19, which are essential to plan for elective care in the future and identify which services to prioritise. However, there are uncertainties in the model around the long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impact of COVID-19, which is primarily based on data for severe COVID disease or hospitalised patients at present. The COVID-19 morbidities model requires updating to address gaps and reflect the latest HRQoL evidence. The aim of this rapid review was to provide updated HRQoL evidence for the COVID-19 morbidities model to better support decision-making in relation to COVID-19 policy. Thirteen primary studies were identified. People who had an initial mild COVID-19 illness or were not treated in hospital can have a decreased HRQoL post-COVID. However, the extent, severity, and duration of this is not consistent. The evidence on the long-term impact of a mild COVID-19 infection on HRQoL is uncertain. Implications for policy and practice include: 1. An initial mild COVID-19 illness can lead to a reduction in HRQoL and impaired mental health, but there is evidence indicating that patients can show significant recovery up to normal levels after one year. 2. Employers should be aware that employees may have prolonged experiences of impaired mental health, including anxiety, depression, and fatigue, following COVID-19 disease, even if their initial disease was mild (not hospitalised). 3. Public health agencies should make patients with mild COVID-19 disease aware of the potential for ongoing symptoms and ways to mitigate and manage them through raised awareness and education. 4. Health Boards should review their provision of long-COVID services in relation to the extent of impacts identified. 5. Better quality studies that report longitudinal follow-up data on HRQoL for a representative cohort of patients who have had mild COVID-19 are required.","Llinos Haf Spencer; Annie Hendry; Abraham Makanjuola; Jacob Davies; Kalpa Pisavadia; Dyfrig A Hughes; Deborah Fitzsimmons; Clare Wilkinson; Rhiannon Tudor Edwards; Ruth Lewis; Alison Cooper; Adrian G Edwards","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.09.22279642","20220909","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37356,""
"Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) study on COVID-19 among the general population of Nepal","The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the global health challenges in the current context. In Nepal, the first confirmed case was reported on 23 January 2020, and since then it has resulted in several negative impacts including economic disruption and deterioration of physical and mental health. In such a pandemic, it is indispensable to understand the knowledge and behavioral patterns of the general population regarding COVID-19. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice on COVID-19, among the general population and its relationship with socio-demographic conditions. The questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from eight districts of Nepal which included Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Morang, Sunsari, Rupandehi, Chitwan, and Kaski. Descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, and a logistic regression model were used for analysis. The study showed that 93.3% of respondents had knowledge of overall preventive practice whereas only 32% had knowledge of overall symptoms of COVID-19. Regarding attitude, only 14.3% believed that they will get rid of COVID-19 soon. The preventive practice was reduced after lockdown compared to that during lockdown. The respondents with white-collar occupations, high-income, and unmarried were good at KAP. Similarly, highly educated and those residing in urban areas had good knowledge and practice. The study findings will help in the development of targeted programs to improve the knowledge, attitude, practice of the general population on COVID-19, which is of paramount importance to deal with the existing pandemic and also such possible future waves of the pandemic.","Salina Shrestha; Rabin Malla; Sadhana Shrestha; Pallavi Singh; Jeevan Bahadur Sherchand","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.07.22279527","20220909","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37357,""
"A cross-sectional study of low birth satisfaction among Iranian postpartum women during COVID-19 epidemics fifth wave","Background : Birth dissatisfaction may increase the risk for postpartum depression and requests for an elective cesarean for the next birth. The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on the healthcare systems and their users in many aspects. We investigated predictors of birth satisfaction in a sample of Iranian postpartum women during the COVID-19 epidemics fifth wave.   Methods : This cross-sectional study was conducted on 601 postpartum women admitted to postpartum wards of Mobini maternity hospital using a convenience sampling method between 2 Aug and 18 September 2021. We collected data on socio-demographic, obstetric, labor and birth, and psychological variables. We used the general linear model and multiple linear regression analyses to determine predictors of birth satisfaction.   Results : The mean birth satisfaction score was 28.6{+/-}7.3. The percentages of mothers who gave birth by elective and emergency cesarean were 19.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Overall predictors of birth satisfaction were emergency cesarean [-7.463(-9.310, -5.616), instrumental birth [-3.571(-6.907, -0.235)], episiotomy [-2.227 ( -3.591, -0.862)], Entonox analgesia [-1.548(-2.726, -0.371)], Well-being score < 50 [-1.812(-3.146, -0.478)], fear of COVID -19 [-1.216(-2.288,, -0.144)], low satisfaction with pregnancy -2.539(-3.952, -1.127) and low satisfaction with spouses support [-2.419(-4.598, -0.240)].     Conclusions : During the pandemic, fear of COVID -19, low level of well-being, low satisfaction with pregnancy and low satisfaction with spouses support as well as women's experience of emergency cesarean, instrumental birth, episiotomy, and Entonox analgesia, are exerting negative influences on birth satisfaction. To improve birth satisfaction and thus maternal mental health interventions to lower fear of contracting COVID -19 and reduce rates of episiotomy, emergency cesarean, and instrumental birth are recommended.","Forough Mortazavi; Maryam Mehrabadi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.08.22279714","20220909","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37358,""

"The effect of group psychotherapy on quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or endocrine therapy during Covid-19 pandemic: One center experience","Background: The announcement of the pandemic by WHO had a great impact on global mental health. Mental disorders like stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger, and fear affected the population worldwide. Cognitive-behavioral techniques are effective in improving the control of symptoms, the affective state and coping with the disease. Methods: Female patients were offered to take part in the study by their oncologists. Inclusion criteria included female patients who were diagnosed with cancer during the last 5 years. Intervention included - Online group psychotherapy which was conducted for 3 consecutive months, three times per week, using the interactive ZOOM platform. The Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30 was used to assess QoL of participants. We asked patients to fill the ERTC questionnaire twice, before the first and after the last psychotherapy sessions. Results: Total of 25 patients aged 18-55 were included in the study, 72% were receiving hormonal therapy, and 28% were receiving chemotherapy. Majority of patients (18) were diagnosed with breast, 4 with cervical and 1 with uterine and 2 with ovarian cancer in last 5 years. All patients were white Caucasian females. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed no difference between groups on pre-RS score;But the study showed significant improvement in post RS (EORTC QLQ-C30) in patients with hormone therapy (Goodness of Fit-R square-0.4471, P-value- 0.0024, 95% Confidence Intervals-0.4200 to 1.626), compare to patients with chemotherapy (Goodness of Fit-R square-0.003372, P-value- 0.9016, 95% Confidence Intervals-1.743 to 1.929).All measures were presented as mean with standard deviation and the level of significance was defined as DELTA(D) = 0.05. Conclusions: According to our research, group psychotherapy had a positive effect on quality of life of cancer patients undergoing hormonal therapy and showed no significant impact on patients treated with chemotherapy.

"The COVID-19 in oncological settings: The buffering role of the physician's empathic communication protects from the impact of fear on hopelessness","Background: During the lockdown related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many oncological patients, in addition to the fear of the COVID-19, have also experienced a sense of hopelessness related to the difficult management of their medical and oncological care. However, several studies showed that the physician's empathic communication about medical care management may act as a buffer against this negative relationship. Thus, the study aimed to test a model in which the physician's empathic communication mediates the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and hopelessness related to aforementioned difficulties. Methods: A sample of 70 oncological outpatients [36 females (51.4%), aged from 40 to 81 years (mean = 65.94, SD = 11.13)] were recruited at the Department of Medical Oncology, Presidio Ospedaliero di Saronno, ASST Valle Olona. An ad hoc structured interview was developed to assess: (A) fear of COVID-19 (KR20: 0.86);(B) feelings of hopelessness related to the COVID- 19 (KR20: 0.80);and (C) the patient's perception of empathy shown by the physician in communicating care management during the pandemic (KR20: 0.71). The factor score of each dimension was used as the total score. A mediation analysis (10,000 bootstrap resampling) was performed. Results: The mediation model showed statistical significance: F = 31.852, p &lt; 0.001;R2 = 0.487. The relationship between 'fear of COVID-19' and 'hopelessness' was partially mediated by physician's empathic communication (path c': ÃŸ = 0.369, se = 0.096, 95%CI[0.177;0.561], p &lt; 0.001) - revealing its buffering role;path a: ÃŸ = -0.488, se = 0.073, 95%CI[-0.634;-0.342], p &lt; 0.001;path b: ÃŸ = -0.375, se = 0.124, 95%CI[-0.623;-0.128], p = 0.003. Conclusions: These results highlight the protective role (buffer) of the physician's empathic communication in the process that leads to hopelessness from the fear of COVID-19. Results suggest how physicians as well as psycho-oncologists should structure stronger interventions - based on the improvement of communication strategies - that may lead to an improvement of patients' quality of life.","Rossi, A.; Marconi, M.; Taccini, F.; Mannarini, S.; Verusio, C.","https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e24126","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Oncology; 40(16), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37361,""
"Randomized controlled trial (RCT) of symptom screening with targeted early palliative care (STEP) versus usual care in patients with advanced cancer","Background: To direct limited specialized palliative care resources to patients in greatest need, we developed STEP (Symptom screening with Targeted Early Palliative care). STEP entails symptom screening (ESAS-r) at each oncology clinic visit and triggered alerts (for moderate-high physical and psychological symptoms) to a nurse who calls the patient to offer a palliative care clinic (PCC) visit. We conducted a phase III RCT to assess the impact of STEP versus usual care on quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Methods: Adults with advanced cancer were recruited from medical oncology clinics at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada. Consenting patients with oncologist-assessed ECOG 0-2 and estimated survival of 6-36 months were enrolled and block randomized (stratified by tumour site and symptom severity) to STEP or usual care. Participants completed measures of quality of life (FACT-G7), depression (PHQ-9), symptom control (ESASr-CS), and satisfaction with care (FAMCARE-P16) at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 months. The primary outcome was FACT-G7 at 6 months, with a planned sample size of 261/arm. Results: From 8/2019 to 3/2020, 69 patients were enrolled: 33 randomized to STEP and 36 to usual care. The trial was then halted permanently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to substantial changes to elements of STEP (shift to virtual symptom screening and palliative care) and usual care (shift to virtual oncology care). Median age was 64 years (range 25-87) and 62% (43/69) were women;study arms were balanced at baseline except gender, with more women randomized to STEP. Within the STEP arm, 20 (61%) participants triggered a nurse's call to offer a PCC visit, of whom 13 attended the clinic at least once. All outcomes tended to be better in the STEP arm compared to usual care, particularly depression and satisfaction with care at 6 months;however, results were not statistically significant (Table). Conclusions: STEP holds promise for improving quality of life and other PROs in patients with advanced cancer and effectively directing early palliative care towards those who need it most.

"Melatonin supplementation for preventing cancer-related fatigue in patients receiving radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer: A double-blind placebo-controlled phase III trial","Background: Fatigue is common in patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). Melatonin, an inexpensive natural supplement, may improve symptoms and attenuate the side effects of RT. The effect of melatonin for prevention of fatigue and other symptoms was evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Methods: Early-stage or ductal carcinoma in-situ breast cancer patients = 18 years, female, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) &lt; 3, hemoglobin =9 g/dL. RT with curative intent, randomized 1:1 to melatonin 20 mg or oral placebo, starting night before RT initiation until 2 weeks post-RT. Sample size of 142 evaluable patients in each arm for 80% power and interim analysis at mid recruitment using the unified family method rho = 0.3. Randomization stratified to RT duration (&lt; 3 weeks, =3 weeks) and prior chemotherapy. Primary outcome : Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue subscale after completion of RT with additional scores measured at baseline, 2 and 8 weeks post-RT. Secondary outcomes : FACIT-F subscales, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue-Short Form 8a. Secondary analyses reported using an F-test at a 5% significance level. Results: For this interim analysis, 85 patients screened;80 randomized;39 received melatonin and 38 placebo. 72 included in the analysis as 5 patients had no post baseline FACIT score. Characteristics of age, race, and ECOG PS similar in both arms. Treatment X time for FACIT-Fatigue not significant for melatonin compared to placebo (p .83). FACIT physical, emotional, and functional wellbeing scores not significantly different (p .35, .62, and .71) but showing a trend for social well-being (p .06). PROMIS scores not changed over time (p .34). ESAS individual symptoms of anxiety, well-being, drowsiness, poor appetite, nausea, pain, shortness of breath, sleep and tiredness not significant, except for depression (p.04). However, a decrease of 0.01 unit in depression score is not considered clinically significant. No grade 3 or 4 adverse events. No participants died during study, 2 died after study completion from breast cancer recurrence. 16 withdrew prior to study completion because of adverse events, unrelated hospitalizations, RT discontinuation, and COVID-19 precautions. Trial was stopped based on statistical analysis demonstrating no difference for primary outcome and imminent expiry of available drug. Discontinuation was approved by Data Safety Monitoring Committee. Conclusions: Melatonin did not prevent fatigue in patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing RT. Melatonin also demonstrated no benefit for other symptoms, except depression. Analysis showed little evidence of an effect, and the trial was terminated early.","Khorasanchi, A.; Mukhopadhyay, N.; Pandey, S.; Nemani, S.; Parker, G.

"Efficacy and safety of atezolizumab concurrent with radiotherapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer: An interim analysis of the ATEZOBLADDERPRESERVE phase II trial (SOGUG-2017-A-IEC(VEJ)-4)","Background: Combined-modality treatments are bladder-preserving alternatives for patients (pts) who are not candidates for radical cystectomy by medical reasons, refusal, or patients choice. Immune therapies seem to potentiate tumor-specific immune response induced by radiotherapy (RT). Combination of RT with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy appears safe and there are signs of promising activity. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab (ATZ) concurrent with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with bladder preservation intent. Here we present an interim analysis. Methods: This is an open, multicenter, and phase II trial, sponsored by SOGUG, in pts with confirmed diagnosis of MIBC in clinical stages cT2-T4a N0 M0 who are not candidates for radical cystectomy. Treatment consists of 6 doses of ATZ 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks, starting on day 1 of EBRT, and 60 Gy of RT in 30 fractions over 6 weeks at 2 Gy/day. The primary endpoint of the study is pathological complete response (pCR) defined as a response of grade 5 according to Miller and Payne criteria, 1 to 2 months after the last dose of ATZ. A planned interim analysis has been performed (data cut-off date: November 2021) on the primary endpoint to avoid exposure to ineffective treatment according to the minimax two-stages Simon's design (stopping rule: 9 out of the first 13 evaluable pts should achieve pCR). Incidence of adverse events (AE) and serious AE (SAE) has been also secondarily assessed. Results: From September 2019 to November 2021, 39 pts were screened, of whom 13 were excluded due to non-compliance with eligibility criteria. Thus, the evaluable population consisted of 26 pts. The safety analysis was performed in 22 pts who had received at least one dose of ATZ. 14 pts were assessed pathologically and, thus, included in interim efficacy analysis (median age: 78.6 years;clinical stage: 71.4% T2a, 14.3% T2b, 7.1% T3a, 7.1% T3b). All 14 pts had achieved pCR at the cut-off date. 20/22 (91%) pts experienced at least one AE, with asthenia (11 pts), diarrhea (9 pts), and urinary tract infection (4 pts) being the most common. 9 SAEs were reported in 7 (32%) pts (bacteriemia, COVID-19 infection, depressed LVEF, unknown origin fever, hepatic toxicity, kidney failure, rectorrhagia, respiratory infection, and urinary sepsis). 6 (27%) pts suffered AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. No AEs leading to death occurred. 17 pts with available data on survival were alive at the cut-off date.

"Patient efficacy in telehealth is moderated by distress among patients with cancer: A cross-sectional survey study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of telehealth to reduce exposure, which was critical for patients with cancer. The extent to which patients with cancer view telehealth visits as meeting their medical needs was investigated using a cross-sectional survey. Methods: Patients currently receiving cancer treatment at a single cancer institute who had had at least one telehealth visit were emailed an online survey. Response rate was 5% (94/1944). The survey measured patients': 1) Emotional Thermometer (i.e. distress, anger, depression, anxiety, and need for help on a 0-10 scale);2) Telehealth usability questionnaire (TUQ;21-items with various subscales, like interaction quality;a=0.98).);and 3) Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions (PEPPI-5) scale (five items, e.g., â€œHow confident are you in your ability to make the most of your visits with your doctors?â€). Respondents completed the PEPPI-5 for in-person visits and for telehealth visits. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all measures. A generalized linear model was estimated predicting PEPPI-5 for telehealth visits from emotional thermometer and TUQ scores. The interaction between emotional thermometer and TUQ scores was estimated to test the hypothesis that emotional distress moderated the relationship between TUQ and efficacy in patient-provider interactions during telehealth visits. Results: Across all five thermometers, 30.8% (28/91) reported a high score on at least one metric. The most frequently reported high score was for anxiety, 23.3% (21/90) and least frequently reported high score was for anger, 12.2% (11/90). The mean TUQ score was 5.5 (SD=1.5) and mean PEPPI-5 score for telehealth visits was 8.1 (SD=2.4). As shown in Table, emotional thermometer scores did moderate the relation between TUQ and patient self-efficacy during telehealth visits. For high emotional thermometer scores, self-efficacy decreased as TUQ scores decreased. Conclusions: For patients experiencing high emotional distress, low comfort and ability with telehealth usability resulted in low patient self-efficacy in communicating with providers and getting medical needs met. Telehealth is a convenient and effective modality;however, in times of emotional distress for patients who are not familiar with telehealth, in-person clinic visits may result in greater patient self-efficacy.

"Prevalence of depression and anxiety among school-going adolescents in Indian Kashmir valley during COVID-19 pandemic","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to severe disruption in routine activities, significant mortality and morbidity. Adolescents are particularly prone to mental health issues. The present study aims to estimate prevalence of depression and anxiety and its determinants among school-going adolescents in Kashmir valley of India. Results The Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents and Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire were used to screen for depression and anxiety among school-going adolescents aged between 15 and 19 years during January and February 2021. Out of the 439 adolescents who had responded, 426 (97.03%) were included in final analysis. The adolescents had a mean age of 17.5 + 1.26 years and comprised of 57% males. The overall prevalence of depression was 16% and was associated with a past history of COVID-19 infection. Anxiety was present in 20% of adolescents. The prevalence was 14% for boys and 27.5% for girls. On logistic regression, anxiety was associated with female gender, past history of personal COVID-19 infection, history of COVID-19 diagnosis in family and hospital admission due to COVID-19 in family. Conclusions Anxiety and depression are major public health problems among adolescents. The high burden estimated in our study highlights the need for immediate action to support adolescents particularly those with a self/family history of COVID-19.","Jeelani, A.; Dkhar, S.

"Anxiety and depression among vaccinated anesthesia and intensive care doctors during COVID-19 pandemic in United Arab Emirates: a cross-sectional study","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had an impact on frontline healthcare workers' (HCW) mental health as they experienced depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. There is a need to investigate the impact on anesthesia and intensive care doctors (ICU), especially after the rise of vaccination. Anesthesia and ICU doctors are among the frontline HCW dealing with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Their job puts them at risk of developing psychological disorders because of the daily stress. The aim of the current study was to assess factors affecting anxiety and depression among vaccinated anesthesia and ICU doctors working in United Arab Emirates (UAE). A cross-sectional study targeting vaccinated anesthesia and ICU doctors in UAE was conducted during March 2021. Data were collected using an online questionnaire uploaded to Google Forms including two sections;the first section included question assessing personal data, professional background data, previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and type of vaccine received. The second section of the questionnaire included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of different factors with anxiety and depression. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results Significantly higher anxiety (46%) and depression (53.6%) were associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The lowest anxiety (23.9%) and depression (21.6%) scores were related to the Sinopharm vaccine. Anxiety was significantly higher for participants previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (AOR = 2.55), and depression was lower for those who deal with COVID-19-positive patients (AOR = 0.28). Anesthesiologists had significantly lower anxiety and depression than those specialized in both anesthesia and ICU (AOR = 0.32 and 0.51) Conclusions Previous diagnosis with COVID-19, female gender, and medical comorbidities were associated with high rates of symptoms of anxiety and depression among anesthesia and ICU doctors. Regular monitoring of the mental health impact of COVID-19, especially after the availability of different vaccines, is recommended.","Rizk, D. N.; Ghanima, M.

"Respect for service users' human rights, job satisfaction, and wellbeing are higher in mental health workers than in other health workers: A study in Italy at time of the Covid pandemic","Background: This study aimed to evaluate the respect for users' rights, job satisfaction, and well-being between mental health workers (MHWs) compared to non-mental health care workers (nMHWs) from the same Italian region. Methods: The sample was recruited from community mental health and non-mental health outpatient centers in Sardinia. Participants fulfilled the WellBeing at work and respect for human-rights questionnaire (WWRR). The sample included 240 MHWs and 154 nMHWs. Results: MHWs were more satisfied with their work and workplace compared to nMHWs. MHWs had stronger beliefs that users were satisfied with the care received, and both workers and users' human rights were respected in their workplace. MHWs reported to need more rehabilitation therapists and psychologists in their services, while nMHWs needed more nurses and professionals for users' personal care. Italian MHWs are more satisfied with their work and workplace, and more convinced that users are satisfied with the care received and that users' and staff human rights are respected in their workplaces, compared to nMHWs. Conclusions: The historic link between the community mental health network and other support networks in Italy and the consequent perception of proximity to the citizens of the care network may be the reason for this optimal situation of Italian MHWs.","Carta, M.

"Tensions between infection control regulations and the home care working environment: An interview study with health care providers early during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Therefore, the objective of this study was to elucidate caregivers' experiences of ordinary homes as a working environment in home care and home health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, hospital care was in focus and the care of older adults was criticized around the world. Design and methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in two municipalities in Sweden between March 2020 and May 2021. One large municipality (population 155,000) with experience of care recipients with COVID-19, and a smaller municipality (population 32,000) were included;both had a focus on preventing the spread of the infection. A total of 27 participants working in home care were interviewed;these were occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, and assistant nurses. The interview material was analyzed using content analysis. Results: The interviews provided a comprehensive insight into the complex work environment in municipal home care during the pandemic. The staff had to deal with constantly changing information and new guidelines. They were also given new tasks and work routines that demanded more planning and were time-consuming. The staff experienced higher workload and pressure during the pandemic and did not have enough time to recover. Conclusions: During a pandemic situation, the information must be comprehensive and gathered in one place, and the managers must ensure sufficient staffing levels, time for reflection, and support for prioritization. The managers must also ensure the mental health of staff and meet their needs for recovery, both at and outside work.","Tavemark, S.; Wijk, H.; Pettersson, C.","https://doi.org/10.1177/22799036221104154","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Public Health Research; 11(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37369,""
"Digital environment: An evolutionary component in environmental health","The COVID-19 pandemic has hastened the progress of digitalization where the public is forced to embrace paradigm shifts on how we function in a digital society. The way we work, learn, live, and play daily has drastically changed with the revolution of digital systems from their analog predecessor. This transformation warrants the digital environment as a social determinant of health. It comprises the whole continuum from the tangible aspects of the computing devices, their programing and information system, the network technologies connecting them, and the product of interactivity between people to people and people to the digital interface. Despite permeating the everyday life of each level of society, the digital environment has yet to be scrutinized comprehensively in terms of health. A review of the literature produces fragmented results where different specialties within and beyond the medical field lay claim to the various aspects of digitalization. We proposed five domains within the digital environment namely digital transformation, digital health, digital technology, digital identity, and digital media that exerts diversified pressure on the digital environment through human activities. Their subjacent linkage to human health and environmental impact is further discussed by using the DPSEEA framework. Challenges that crossed all domains were discussed including the widening gap of inequalities secondary to the limited availability of, and accessibility to digitalization. Considering the rapid speed at which we propel to a fully immersive virtual world, a timely transformation of environmental health to include the digital environment as part of its main components is inevitable.","Masrani, A.

"Integrating Mindfulness and Acceptance Into Traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of an Adult Man With Generalized Anxiety Disorder","Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) can be chronic and impairing, highlighting the need for effective treatments. Although Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for GAD, a number of patients continue to report GAD symptoms treatment. Integrating evidenced-based treatment components into CBT treatments, such as mindfulness- and acceptance-based treatment components found in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), may help improve the efficacy of treatment. Emerging interventions and research suggest that the cognitive restructuring aspect of CBT and acceptance stance of ACT (e.g., cognitive defusion) can be implemented into treatment concurrently from a stance of increasing a patient's coping skills repertoire and psychological flexibility. This systemic case analysis examined the efficacy and clinical utility of integrating ACT into a manualized CBT treatment for GAD. Furthermore, this study examined treatment efficacy and therapeutic alliance as the treatment rapidly and unexpectedly transitioned from in-person to telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre- to post-treatment and time-series analyses showed significant decreases in anxiety symptoms, worry, depressive symptoms, and emotion dysregulation. Although there was an initial increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms, worry, and emotion dysregulation following the switch from in-person to telehealth services, these quickly subsided and resumed a downward trend. The therapeutic relationship did not deteriorate during the transition to telehealth. This case study provides evidence of feasibility and efficacy of an integrated CBT/ACT approach in treating GAD. It also suggests that despite some temporary increase in symptoms, therapeutic alliance and treatment efficacy were not impacted by the switch to telehealth.","Garner, A. R.; Stuart, G.

"Online Yoga and Ayurveda Intervention as Tertiary Prevention of Psychological Comorbidities in COVID-19 Survivors: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Background and Purpose: About 56% of symptomatic COVID-19 survivors have been found with neuropsychological comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD), and impaired quality of life (QoL). Alongside, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, regenerative, immunomodulatory, cardio-pulmonary health promotive, and psychological benefits of yogic and Ayurvedic intervention are well documented. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effect of online Yoga (OYI) and Yoga cum Ayurveda intervention (OYAI) on COVID-19-induced depression, anxiety, PTSD, and poor QoL. Method: Seventy-two participants (males/females: 33/26) with at least a 3-month back history of symptomatic COVID-19 infection and age (mean Â± SD: 32.33 Â± 9.9 and 33.04 Â± 12.9 for males and females, respectively) were recruited from Patanjali Ayurveda Hospital, Haridwar, India, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India, before random allocation into an equal-sized control group (CG), Yoga group (YG) and Yoga cum concoction (YCG) group. Split-plot analysis of variance and Kruskalâ€“Wallis tests with Bonferroni adjusted post hoc comparisons were computed for normal and nonnormal data using IBM SPSS (25th Version, SPSS South Asia Private Limited, Bangalore, India). Results: Both the treatmentsâ€”the 30-day OYI and OYAI, significantly improved depression (P &lt;.002, ES: -0.99 and P &lt;.001, ES: -2.11), anxiety (P &lt;.001, ES: -1.32 and -1.89), PTSD (P &lt;.001, ES: -1.8 and -1.83) and QoL related constructs (P &lt;.001, ES: 0.63 and 0.76;0.71 and 0.93 for each OYI and OYAI versus general health and physical health;P &lt;.001, ES: 0.65 for OYAI versus psychological health;and P &lt;.003, ES: 0.54 for OYI versus environment) of the participants compared to the controls.

"Development and Validation of a New COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (NCAS)","The study aimed to develop and validate a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) anxiety scale. Three independent studies were done to achieve the stated aim of the research. Study I explored the factor structure of the scale. Study 2 aimed at confirming the factor structure and establishing test-retest reliability of NCAS. Study 3 aimed to test the incremental validity of the new scale over two most widely used scale (FCV-19S & CAS). EFA resulted in a three-dimensional factor structure with 4, 3, 5 items in 'anxiety pertaining to threat posed by COVID-19', 'Anxiety pertained to public policies' and 'Anxiety pertaining to societal consequences' respectively. CFA confirmed the findings of EFA and a higher order of 'COVID-19 anxiety' was also established. The test-retest reliability was found to be 0.91. NCAS shared 48% variance with FCV-19S (fear of COVID-19 scale) and 27% with CAS (Coronavirus anxiety scale). NCAS has significant incremental validity over FCV-19S and CAS in predicting self-reported mental health and life satisfaction. The scale would help in identifying people's specific anxiety related to COVID-19, which would further help in their intervention/treatment.","Rehman, U.; Shahnawaz, M. G.; Gupta, K.; Khan, N.

"In silico Analysis of ACE2 Receptor to Find Potential Herbal Drugs in COVID-19 Associated Neurological Dysfunctions","COVID-19 mainly causes the collapse of the pulmonary system thereby causing a dearth of oxygen in the human body. Patients infected with this viral disease have been reported to experience various signs and symptoms associated with brain dysfunction, from the feeling of vagueness to loss of smell and taste to severe strokes. These neurological problems have been reported by younger COVID-19 infected patients mainly in their thirties and forties. Various researchers from around the globe have discerned numerous other brain dysfunctions, such as headache, dizziness, numbness, major depressive disorder, anosmia, encephalitis, febrile seizures, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. The involvement of the CNS by this viral infection has been predicted to be for a longer period of time, even if the patient recovers from COVID-19. The neuronal cell damage caused by COVID-19 is a potent factor responsible for cognitive, behavioral, and psychological problems among its sufferers. The hypoxic conditions can also trigger the formation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau-tangles and thus the virus can even induce Alzheimer's in patients in the near future. The virus affects the brain directly, thereby causing encephalitis. This pandemic has also been shown to have a negative psychological toll on people. This research aims to highlight the brain dysfunction associated with the ACE2 receptor that is known to be a crucial player in the COVID-19 pandemic using genetic networking approaches. Furthermore, we have identified herbal drug candidates that bind to the ACE2 receptor in order to identify potential treatments for the neurological manifestations of COVID-19.","Hou, J.; Bhat, A.

"One Health and Pathogen Sharing: Filling the Gap in the International Health Regulations to Strengthen Global Pandemic Preparedness and Response","The c Owl)-19 pandemic and other major public health emergencies of international concern occurred in the last zo years remind us of the close interconnections between human, animal, and environmental health and the need for collaborative and multisectoral approaches to address complex health threats. These outbreaks also serve to highlight the importance of timely sharing of pathogens, which are used to characterise the causative agent of an outbreak, understand its spread, and develop diagnostics, antiviral treatments, and vaccines. Despite their relevance to preparedness and response, neither One Health nor pathogen sharing are grounded within the International Health Regulations (IHR). This paper analyses the existing institutional and normative gaps within the IHR, including examining how other regimes within the international legal landscape have sought to 'fill the gaps'. We explore possible solutions and make proposals to strengthen interinstitutional cooperation and coordination through mechanisms alternative to IHR reform or a global pandemic treaty.","Negri, S.; Eccleston-Turner, M.","https://doi.org/10.1163/15723747-19010006","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Organizations Law Review; 19(1):188-214, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37375,""
"ANALYSIS OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES (PROMS) IN THE COVID ERA - THE FIRST 6 MONTHS","Background This project analysed the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS) in a 20-bedded in-patient unit during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The scores were taken at admission, at change in Phase of Illness and at point of discharge or death. These scores were used to monitor symptom progression and effectiveness of management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The Electronic patient record (EPR) identified 110 hospice inpatients, from a total 141 admissions between 1st October 2020 - 31st March 2021) who had at least one IPOS recorded. Initial and subsequent IPOS scores were inputted and analysed in Microsoft Excel and baseline symptom prevalence and outcome measures reported (bar charts and radar plots). Results Over the 6-month period analysed 93% of patients admitted had a primary cancer diagnosis and 7% non-cancer related conditions. The worst rated physical symptoms on admission included;weakness (2.67), poor mobility (2.59) and poor appetite (2.27). Family worry was the top score of all the domains with an average initial admission score of 3.13, this is not unsurprising, and likely that the visiting restrictions in place will be contributing to this domain All physical symptoms were successfully reduced from start to end of admission except for impact of drowsiness. The greatest reductions in average scores of the physical domains were seen for constipation (28.6%), Nausea (23.9%) and Weakness (17.2%). However, average scores for anxiety, depression and sharing feelings rose by 2.3%, 10.5% and 5.7% during the admission. Conclusions This work confirms that an in-patient unit can collect and analyse patient outcomes data, even during a pandemic. The results demonstrate the positive impact that admission to a hospice can have on the symptoms of terminally ill patients, especially physical symptoms. For us it has highlighted areas of improvement especially psychological and spiritual care.","Ross, M.; Seaman, S.","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2022-SCPSC.55","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care; 12:A21, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37376,""
"PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE OF AFRICAN AND CARIBBEAN DESCENT (PEACE) DURING COVID-19","Background and Aims People of African and Caribbean descent experienced the highest mortality rates during the pandemic, yet often have the poorest access to palliative care. This study aims to identify how palliative care services can better meet the needs of people of African and Caribbean descent, by exploring patients' (by proxy), families' and health, social care and community workers' experiences of end-of-life-care during the pandemic. Methods Bereaved relatives, and professionals were recruited using social media, community networks and direct advertising to over 100 organisations. Semi-structured interviews explored experiences of end-of-life-care using a topic guide, developed with patient and public involvement partners. Participants' suggestions for care improvement were foregrounded throughout. The theoretical framework combined Critical Race Theory and Saurman's model of access. Thematic analysis was used. Results Over 40 participants were recruited. Results indicate that people of African and Caribbean descent are poorly served by current services. Interviewees identified distinct differences between the culture of care, and that of the patent. Participants reported institutional racism. Processes were insensitive to diversity in family and community support structures in different cultures. Themes describing end of life care services included: Unavailable: spiritual support, paid carers, specialist care, visitation and choice Inadequate: advertisement of services, cultural diversity and the appreciation of the importance of extended families Unacceptable: communication surrounding death and bereavement (upstream/proactive early discussions would improve engagement) and mental health and bereavement support. Conclusions People of African and Caribbean descent are often termed a 'hard to reach' group. Yet our study suggests that current configuration mean it is services that are hard to reach. Prioritisation of person-centred, culturally competent spiritual, psychological and social interventions remains an aspiration for palliative care. A focus on cultural sensitivity and communication may be a good start to enhance palliative and end of life care for all.","Dewhurst, F.; Poole, M.; McLellan, E.; Tomkow, L.; Kunonga, P.; Andah, E.; Todd, C.; Hanratty, B.","https://doi.org/10.1136/spcare-2022-SCPSC.20","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care; 12:A8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37377,""
"ASKING TEENAGERS AND YOUNG ADULTS WITH IBD;'WHAT MATTERS TO YOU'?","Introduction Good paediatric to adult transition of IBD care is important to prevent disengagement and poor disease outcomes. 1 The aim of this study was to qualitatively measure what is important to patients before they attended a new transitional service. There may be a dichotomy between the treating healthcare workers' priorities and teenagers' priorities that form a barrier to effective communication. Unprepared services can result in negative consequences for those involved2 and a greater understanding of what matters to teenagers and young adults may improve the clinicians' ability to facilitate the transition process Methods We asked 75 teenagers and young adults, aged between 14 and 21, who attended a new transitional service at a tertiary IBD unit in the North of England, to complete a survey prior to their clinic review. This 'what matters to you' survey included 12 suggestions they could circle, with no limitations on how many they selected, but a suggestion to choose up to 3 topics. The survey was conducted during the COVID- 19 pandemic and UK national lockdown, between September 2020 and September 2021 Conclusion Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition with potentially a high morbidity from physical symptoms, and it is important not to forget this as a focus of a consultation. Medical therapies and their effects on the patient were important to 48% of responders, and the transition process should include further education on treatment options with discussions of compliance. The impact on education and schooling feature as a significant topic and should be discussed during transition. Minimising the impact on education and employment should be considered when developing transitional services.

"Care, repair, and the future social relevance of museums","This intervention reflects on examples of UK museum and gallery outreach and engagement activity that took place during the COVID-19 lockdown. This included creative packs sent to people who were shielding, online sessions for mental health service users, and phone services for isolated older adults, part of a range of efforts to continue connections while buildings were closed. Though seemingly limited in scale or impact, I argue that it is in these small acts of care that we might find the renewed relevance of the museum. Drawing on theoretical work on repair (notably Steven J. Jackson), the essay outlines a future social role of museums founded on ""care thinking"" and oriented towards the communal work of repair.","Morse, N.","https://doi.org/10.1080/15596893.2022.2104815","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Museums & Social Issues-a Journal of Reflective Discourse;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37379,""
"Who Is Treating the Children? Training Child and Family Psychoanalytic Psychotherapists in China","This article traces the development and evolution of The Psychodynamic Couple and Family Therapy Continuous Training Program in Beijing, China since its founding in 2009 as a two-year series of four immersion experiences in couple therapy training. The program's learning components include a live clinical demonstration, didactic lectures, and small process learning groups. In the past 10 years, program faculty opted to include a child and family focus to address the relative absence of child psychodynamic psychotherapy training in China and the increasing mental health needs of Chinese children. Research on the training's effectiveness is presented, highlighting the importance of the live clinical demonstration to the group's learning, and supporting the importance of showing clinical theory and technique in action. Required adaptations from an in-person to an online training format owing to COVID are discussed. Examples drawn from the clinical demonstration, small process learning groups, and later emerging consultation groups are offered to show applications of the training model, challenges in learning, and cultural differences. The author contends that this training program and its extensions rely on the strong working alliance of its founders and illustrate the value of cross-cultural collaboration in training and treatment efforts.","Wanlass, J.","https://doi.org/10.1080/00797308.2022.2107375","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychoanalytic Study of the Child;: 1-10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37380,""

"Relationship Between Challenges With the Use of Telehealth and Psychologists' Response During the Coronavirus Pandemic","Public Significance Statement This study is among the first in examining the relationship between challenges with the use of telehealth and psychologists' response during the coronavirus pandemic, highlighting the need to address both provider and patient barriers to telehealth that influence provider well-being. Allowing flexibility in policies, regulations, and format of service delivery and making telehealth training opportunities and resources available are key to ensure a healthy behavioral workforce and the continued delivery of health care services. The coronavirus pandemic drastically altered the landscape of mental health care delivery as psychologists pivoted to telehealth and grappled with increasing population mental health care needs. Despite the rapid shift to telehealth, many challenges on both the provider and patient sides remain. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between challenges with the use of telehealth and psychologists' response during the pandemic. The study used survey data from 1,679 doctoral-level licensed psychologists who provided services via telehealth during September-October 2020. Results from ordered logistic and ordinary least squares regressions suggest that the degree of telehealth challenge psychologists experienced was not statistically associated with workload, patient load, or ability to meet patient demand during the pandemic. However, the degree of telehealth challenge patients experienced was significantly associated with these outcomes. The fewer patients who experienced telehealth challenges, the more psychologists were able to maintain or increase their workload and patient load and meet patient demand. Telehealth challenges experienced by both psychologists and their patients were associated with psychologists' mental health. Psychologists experiencing fewer telehealth challenges, and having fewer patients experiencing telehealth challenges, were more likely to report lower stress levels, be able to practice self-care and maintain positive work-life balance, and less likely to experience burnout. Findings of this study have clear policy implications to encourage continued telehealth after the public health emergency ends and address barriers to effectively utilize telehealth. These measures are critical to supporting the health service psychologist workforce and maintaining the continuity of mental health care.","Lin, L. N.; Stamm, K. E.; Ferenz, K.; Wright, C.

"Financial Uncertainty and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic The Mediating Role of Future Orientation","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic involved many uncertainties, including financial uncertainty due to the global financial crisis. Previous research indicates that financial uncertainty is negatively related to mental health and wellbeing. Aims: We tested a model suggesting that the negative impact of financial uncertainty is explained by a restriction of individuals' view of their future possibilities. Specifically, this longitudinal study explored the relationship of financial uncertainty and anxiety, considering the mediating role of future orientation. Method: Data were collected with questionnaires administered to Israeli citizens in April, June and August 2020. Data analysis comprised 379 respondents who participated in all three times. Results: Future orientation mediated the relationship of financial uncertainty and anxiety over time. Tests of changes across time show that changes in financial uncertainty were related to changes in anxiety levels over time. Limitations: Our sample was biased toward younger ages and the measurement of future orientation referred to a general view of the future rather than specific areas. Conclusion: The results suggest that the stressor of financial uncertainty is generalized to a negative view of future possibilities, thereby increasing anxiety.","Yagil, D.; Cohen, M.","https://doi.org/10.1027/2512-8442/a000119","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Health Psychology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37383,""
"How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact the wellbeing of family care-givers? A longitudinal study of older adults in Germany","Previous research was not able to identify an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on family care-givers' wellbeing due to cross-sectional data structures, care-giver-specific samples or non-probability sampling designs. In this article, by drawing on longitudinal data from a random and representative sample of the German population aged 40 and older, we overcome methodological limitations of previous research. We examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wellbeing (life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, loneliness) of different groups of family care-givers (new care-givers, continuous care-givers, past care-givers) and non-care-givers in Germany. We derived a balanced sample of n = 3,875 individuals aged 43-97 (mean = 66.5 years, standard deviation = 10.2 years) from the German Ageing Survey (DEAS) to explore changes in wellbeing between 2017 (pre-pandemic) and June/July 2020 (pandemic). Using a first-difference approach, we found that the pandemic has a negative impact on both non-care-givers' and family care-givers' wellbeing, with increased levels of depressive symptoms and loneliness compared to pre-pandemic times. Changes in depressive symptoms of family care-givers did not significantly deviate from non-care-givers. However, continuous care-givers showed more pronounced increases in loneliness compared to non-care-givers. Our results suggest that family care-givers' wellbeing merits particular attention when considering the long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' wellbeing.","Ehrlich, U.; Kelle, N.; Klaus, D.; Mohring, K.","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0144686X22000873","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ageing & Society;: 1-18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37384,""
"The incidence and characteristics of chronic pain and fatigue after 12 months later admitting with COVID-19;The PostCOVID 19 syndrome","Background: This study aimed to evaluate chronic pain and fatigue in COVID-19 patients after 12 months of hospitalization. Methods: We studied the COVID-19 patients discharged from Hospital, between March 10 to April 20, 2020. Results: A total of 157 patients were included in this study. Forty-three patients (27.4%) complained of chronic fatigue and muscle weakness in the last six months. The visual analog fatigue scale (VAFS) score of 3.84 Â± 1.48 was obtained. Forty patients (25.5%) were suspected of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Twenty-four patients (15.3%) had severe chronic pain or exacerbation of previous chronic pain, most of which were reported in the lower back (70.8%) and lower extremities (66.7%). Pain intensity had a mean score of 2.33 Â± 0.87 and was mainly described as muscle cramps, persistent dull pain, and boring and numbing. In women, chronic pain and fatigue, extended hospital stays, ICU admission, and depressed mood were common than in men. For these pain and fatigue, 37% used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 16.3% used antidepressants.

"Evaluating the Implementation of a Multi-Technology Delivery of a Mental Health and Wellbeing System of Care Within a Youth Sports Development Program During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges to the provision of community programs and access to mental health services for young people. We examined the feasibility, reach, and acceptability of multi-technology delivery of an integrated system that assesses and provides feedback on youth mental health and wellbeing and connects them to care within the context of a youth sports development program. The system was delivered via computer, telephone, and teleconference with 66 adolescent boys participating in a rugby league development program in three communities in Australia. Young people completed online wellbeing and mental health measures (Assess step), parents were provided with telephone feedback on results, support, and referral options (Reflect step), and youth received teleconferenced workshops and online resources (Connect step). The multi-technology delivery was feasible to implement, and reach was high, with barriers experienced at the Assess step but minimally experienced at the Reflect and Connect steps. Delivering the system via multiple forms of technology was rated as highly beneficial and enjoyable by young people. Players improved in self-reported prosocial behaviour, gratitude, and anxiety symptoms from pre- to post-program. Strong collaboration between researchers, organisational personnel, and community members is important for achieving these outcomes.","Waters, A. M.; Sluis, R. A.; Ryan, K. M.; Usher, W.; Farrell, L.

"A case of refractory ventricular fibrillation after caffeine poisoning successfully treated by supportive care","Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxantine), a structural analog of adenosine, is widely used as a central nervous system stimulant in beverages and drugs. Caffeine overdose induces hypokalemia, fatal ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest, resulting in death. We describe a case of caffeine overdose that presented with refractory ventricular fibrillation that was treated with supportive care because invasive care for severely ill patients was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A 20-year-old woman with no underlying medical history ingested 90 200-mg caffeine tablets (total dose 18g) in a suicide attempt. She was transported to the emergency department 45minutes after ingestion with dizziness, palpitations, nausea, and vomiting. She developed cardiac arrest 80minutes after ingesting the caffeine, with refractory ventricular tachycardia that recurred for about 2.5hours. Advanced life support including defibrillation was started immediately and we gave intravenous Intralipid emulsion, potassium chloride, amiodarone, and esmolol, without hemodialysis or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The ventricular fibrillation was stopped 4hours after ingestion. As supportive care, mechanical ventilation, sedatives, and neuromuscular blockade were continued until 12hours after ingestion. Although she suffered from prolonged, refractory ventricular tachycardia, she recovered without complications. This case report describes the clinical course of severe caffeine intoxication without an active elimination method, such as hemodialysis or ECMO and explores the treatment of caffeine intoxication with a literature review.","Han, Kichan, You, Kyoung Min, Jung, Jin Hee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.07.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Toxicology Reports;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37387,""
"India's policy and programmatic response to mental health of young people: A narrative review","India's response to meet the mental health needs of 252 million young people between 15 and 24 years is guided by the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 (MHCA), which advocates a rights-based approach to receiving mental healthcare, the National Mental Health Policy 2014, and the National Mental Health Program operational since 1982. We undertook a comprehensive narrative review of policies, programs, and legislations across five ministries of the Government of Indiaâ€”Health and Family Welfare, Education, Women and Child Development, Youth Affairs and Sports, and Social Justice and Empowermentâ€”over the last ten years to map their approach and identify enablers and barriers for promoting youth mental health in India. Our work builds on the previous reviews on children and adolescentsâ€™ mental health in India and captures the rapidly advancing policy landscape amidst the new challenges and opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the increasing acceptability of digital health interventions including tele-consultations. We note that all the five ministries recognized mental health as an important aspect of overall development and well-being of young people. However, their approach is fragmented and a comprehensive approach to youth mental health is missing in the Indian context. Having said that, many enablers for integration of preventive, promotive, and curative mental health interventions exist especially as mental health is increasingly being recognized as an integral part of the comprehensive primary healthcare. However, much needs to be done in terms of strategic planning for screening, early detection and treatment, and developing strong referral systems between community, schools and mental healthcare services. Effective implementation of MHCA, sustainable intersectoral integration of mental health across youth-oriented services, empowerment of young people, and judicious use of digital technology hold the key to reimagining the approach to advance young people's mental health in India.","Girase, Bhushan, Parikh, Rachana, Vashisht, Samica, Mullick, Anushka, Ambhore, Vaibhao, Maknikar, Sudhir","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100145","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100145, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37388,""

Exacerbation of mental health distress and disordered eating could have significant negative effects on long-term weight management and quality of life for these patients if untreated. Objective: To determine the efficacy of a telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy (Tele-CBT) intervention in improving depressive, anxiety and disordered eating symptoms during COVID-19. Methods: Participants were recruited as part of a larger randomized controlled trial study (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03315247) between March 2020 and March 2021 and randomized 1:1 to receive Tele-CBT or standard bariatric care. Outcomes of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Emotional Eating Scale (EES), and Binge Eating Scale (BES) were measured at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3-months post-intervention. Linear mixed models were used to test the effect of intervention group, time, and group-by-time interaction for each outcome. Results: Eighty-one patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Mean (SD) age of participants was 47.68 (9.36) years and 80.2% were female. There were significant group-by-time interactions for all outcomes and significant differences between groups across time. There were significant decreases in mean GAD-7 (p=0.001), PHQ-9 (p&lt;0.001), EES-Total (p=0.001), EES-Anger (p=0.003), EES-Anxiety (p&lt;0.001), EES-Depression (p&lt;0.001) and BES (p=0.002) scores for the Tele-CBT group at post-intervention and follow-up when compared to baseline and the control group.

"Healthcare workersâ€™ mental health in pandemic times: the predict role of psychosocial risks","Background Healthcare workers perform an emotionally exhausting daily work activity, making them prone to occupational hazards, namely psychosocial ones. This study aims to assess the impact of psychosocial risk factors on healthcare workersâ€™ mental health. Methods A cross-sectional study was developed between May and June of 2021 with 479 healthcare workers from Portuguese hospitals. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale was used to assess mental health, and psychosocial risks were assessed through the Health and Work Survey â€“ INSAT. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the psychosocial risk factors related to anxiety, depression and stress. Subsequently, a multiple linear regression was performed to identify the models that better explained psychosocial risk factorsâ€™ relationship with anxiety, depression, and stress. Results Data showed a strong exposure to psychosocial risks. Work pace and intensity, work relationships and emotional demands stood out with higher global average percentages for yes answers to â€œexposure and discomfortâ€. The analysis of the ÃŸ values and p-values from the multiple linear regression shows that some cross-sectional psychosocial risks are predictors of anxiety and stress dimensions, and other psychosocial risks differ in the two mental health dimensions. However, it is important to highlight that healthcare workers still showed great joy and pleasure in performing their work activities. Conclusion Support network development in the work environment is needed to prevent healthcare workersâ€™ emotional stress and promote their psychological well-being. Therefore, new research is essential to understand the psychosocial risks that affect healthcare workers and assess the less visible effects of work-health relationships.","Barros, Carla, Baylina, Pilar, Fernandes, RÃºben, Ramalho, Susana, Arezes, Pedro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2022.08.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37391,""

Objetivo: El objetivo es descubrir si la variable resiliencia es predictora del impacto negativo que estÃ¡ generando el COVID-19, entendido en las variables de depresiÃ³n, ansiedad y estrÃ©s;y analizar, a su vez, quÃ© factores resilientes contribuyen a explicar las varianzas de dichas variables y quÃ© variables control son tambiÃ©n predictoras. MÃ©todo: Se ha llevado a cabo una investigaciÃ³n cuantitativa, concretamente un diseÃ±o ex post facto no experimental de grupo Ãºnico. La muestra seleccionada fueron 268 mÃ©dicos de AtenciÃ³n Primaria, colectivo muy afectado por la pandemia, a quienes se les administrÃ³ un cuestionario sociodemogrÃ¡fico, la Escala de Resiliencia SV-RES, en su versiÃ³n reducida de 36 Ã­tems, y la Escala de DepresiÃ³n, Ansiedad y EstrÃ©s DAS-21. Resultados: Los resultados de las regresiones lineales mostraron cÃ³mo la resiliencia, con una relaciÃ³n negativa, predice la depresiÃ³n (un 22.2%), la ansiedad (un 8.3%) y el estrÃ©s (un 12.3%), siendo los factores metas e identidad quienes contribuyen significativamente a explicar las distintas varianzas. A su vez, dentro de las variables control, la toma de psicofÃ¡rmacos, el sexo (excepto para la variable depresiÃ³n) y la decisiÃ³n de acudir al psicÃ³logo fueron predictoras de las diversas variables. Conclusiones: Los hallazgos de esta investigaciÃ³n avivan la necesidad de promover la resiliencia entre los mÃ©dicos de AtenciÃ³n Primaria, con la intenciÃ³n de reducir sus niveles de depresiÃ³n, ansiedad y estrÃ©s. Background: The current health situation is causing a detriment to mental health, where Primary Care physicians is a very affected group. Objective: The objective is to discover whether the resilience variable is a predictor of the negative impact generated by COVID-19, understood in the variables of depression, anxiety and stress;and analyze, in turn, which resilient factors help to explain the variances of the variables and which control variables are also predictors. Method: A quantitative research has been carried out, specifically a single group non-experimental ex post facto design. The selected sample consisted of 268 primary care physicians, a group highly affected by the pandemic, who were administered a sociodemographic questionnaire, the SV-RES Resilience Scale, in its reduced version of 36 items, and the Depression, Anxiety and Depression Scale, DAS-21 stress. Results: The results of the linear regressions showed how resilience, with a negative relationship, predicts depression (22.2%), anxiety (8.3%) and stress (12.3%), being the goals and identity factors that contribute significantly to explain the different variances. In turn, within the control variables, taking drugs, gender (except for the depression variable) and the decision to go to the psychologist were predictors of the various variables. Conclusions: The findings of this research intensify the necessity of promoting resilience among primary care physicians, with the intention of reducing their levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.","Maestre Maroto, MarÃ­a de la Almudena","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semerg.2022.101813","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina de Familia.

"Trajectories of loneliness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria","Objective There is considerable heterogeneity within populations regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. This study aimed at identifying latent groups of individuals within the older Austrian population that differ in their mental health trajectories across three phases of the pandemic. Study design Data were gathered from a longitudinal survey study among a sample of older adults in Austria. The survey was carried out in May 2020 (N1 = 556), March 2021 (N2 = 462), and December 2021 (N3 = 370), using either computer-assisted web or telephone interviewing. Methods Latent class growth analysis was conducted to explore different homogenous groups in terms of nonlinear trajectories of loneliness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms as well as potential correlates thereof. Results We identified four latent classes. The vast majority of individuals belong to two classes that are either resilient (71%) or that have recovered relatively quickly from an initial COVID-19 shock (10.2%). Deterioration in mental health after the first phase of the pandemic (13.4%) or a generally high mental health burden (5.4%) characterize the other two classes. Conclusions About 19% of individuals showed increasing or elevated levels in loneliness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms across the COVID-19 pandemic. The feeling of being socially supported and in control over oneâ€™s own life emerged as potentially protective factors.","Mayerl, Hannes, Stolz, Erwin, Freidl, Wolfgang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2022.08.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Public Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37393,""
"Improvements in Quality of Life at 1 Year in Patients Treated with Cladribine Tablets for Highly Active Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis: An Interim Analysis of Clarify-MS","Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disabling disease associated with negative effects on quality of life (QoL), including physical and mental health. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the change in QoL for patients with highly active relapsing MS at 1 year after initiating treatment with cladribine tablets (CladT), by assessing changes in the physical and mental health composite scores of Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54). Material(s) and Method(s): In CLARIFY-MS (NCT03369665), patients with highly active relapsing MS were assigned to receive CladT 3.5 mg/kg cumulative dose over 2 years. Patients were recruited as per the EU label. Results in this interim analysis, conducted prior to the second year of treatment, were assessed using a mixed-effects linear model. Analyses were also conducted for cohorts separated by treatment naÃ¯ve/prior disease-modifying therapy (DMT), and MSQoL reporting performed before/after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as defined as the first reported fatality within each country. Result(s): Of the 482 patients treated with CladT, 70.1% were female and the mean age was 37.4 years. Of the 426 patients who provided MSQoL-54 data, statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001) improvements from Baseline to Month 12 were observed for physical and mental health composite scores with estimated changes of 4.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.24â€“5.77) and 4.53 (95% CI 3.00â€“6.05), respectively. Similar trends were apparent for treatment naÃ¯ve (n=121) and prior DMT (n=305) cohorts. There was no indication that the start of the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on MSQoL-54 reporting. Regarding safety, 322 patients (66.8%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, most commonly headache (16%), nasopharyngitis (9%), and lymphopenia (9%). The majority of observed post-baseline lymphopenia events were grade 1â€“2;fewer patients reported grade 3 lymphopenia, no grade 4 lymphopenia was observed. Conclusion(s): With only half a therapeutic dose of CladT, this interim analysis demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in the physical and mental health composite scores of MSQoL-54 at 1 year. No new safety concerns were found in this 1-year interim analysis, with no new severe or opportunistic infections that could have an impact on the established benefit:risk profile of CladT in MS.","Solari, A.; Montalban, X.; Lechner-Scott, J.; Piehl, F.; Brochet, B.; Langdon, D.; Hupperts, R.; Selmaj, K.; Havrdova, E.

"The Psychological Effect of COVID19 Pandemic on Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Patients and Their Attitude Change After a Year of the Pandemic in Isfahan, Iran","Background: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID19) is a new coronavirus which has created a pandemic since early 2020. Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) patients are more affected by psychological effects of COVID19 pandemic such as anxiety and fear because they may be worried about being infected by COVID19 (due to the nature of disease and treatment by immunosuppressant drugs) and also they are concerned about their treatment protocol and disease relapses during the pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): The aim of study was to evaluate the anxiety due to COVID19 infection, 3 and 12 months after beginning of epidemic in Iran.The study was performed in patients of NMOSD Cohort Clinic of Kashani hospital, Isfahan. We first asked individuals if they were anxious or afraid of the pandemic subjectively. To investigate the objective level of anxiety, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) questionnaire was filled. Moreover, we asked them about respecting general cautions and sanitary protocols to prevent COVID19 infection. Result(s): Study included 120 patients (96 female) with mean age of 36.37Â±9.69 and mean duration of disease about 8.49Â±5.35 years. A total of 96 cases (80%) experienced anxiety during the first 3 months of pandemic. The point is that their level of anxiety decreased significantly with the prolongation of pandemic after 9 months and just 66 patients (55%) showed anxiety subjectively on the second survey. Based on HADS-A score, 92 patients (76.66%) were anxious on the third month while after one year of epidemic 70 cases (58.33%) showed anxiety. Respecting preventive measures increased in the same period. Conclusion(s): Along with the COVID19 pandemic prolongation, the level of anxiety had decreased gradually while the level of alertness and attention was almost high. It should be considered that this awareness must be preserved till the end of pandemic.","Dastjerdi, R.

"Where have all the workers gone? Recalls, retirements, and reallocation in the COVID recovery","At the onset of the COVID pandemic, the U.S. economy suddenly and swiftly lost 20 million jobs. Over the next two years, the economy has been on the recovery path. We assess the labor market two years into the COVID crisis. We show that early employment dynamics were almost entirely driven by temporary layoffs and later recalls. Taking these into account, we show that the labor market remained surprisingly tight throughout the crisis, despite the dramatic job losses. By spring, 2022, the labor market had largely recovered and was characterized by extremely tight markets and a slightly depressed employment-to-population ratio driven largely by retirements. Finally, we see surprisingly little evidence of excess reallocation, despite predictions that COVID would dramatically and permanently change the way we live and work. We do see that employment has reallocated somewhat away from low-skilled service jobs, and, in light of the job vacancy patterns, conclude that worker preferences or changes in job amenities are driving this shift. In addition, the retirements paved the way for movements up the job ladder, making low-skilled customer-facing jobs even less desirable.","Forsythe, Eliza, Kahn, Lisa B.; Lange, Fabian, Wiczer, David","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2022.102251","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Labour Economics;: 102251, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37396,""

"Examining Children and Adolescent Mental Health Trajectories during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a year of the Co-SPACE Study","A major concern throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has been the impact on young peopleâ€™s mental health. The objective of this study was to map children and adolescentsâ€™ mental health trajectories over thirteen months of the pandemic and examine whether family, peer, and individual-level factors were associated with different trajectories. The current study focuses on a convenience sub-sample from the Co-SPACE study of 3,322 children and adolescents (aged 4-16 years) for whom parents completed a baseline survey and at least one follow-up survey between March 2020 and May 2021. We used growth mixture models to examine distinct trajectories in emotional, conduct, and hyperactivity/inattention difficulties using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and multinomial logistic regression models to estimate factors associated with individual trajectory membership. The general trend in participating young peopleâ€™s mental health appeared to follow changes in national guidelines. For distinct trends, a 5-trajectory model best explained the changes in emotional problems whilst 4-trajectory models best explained variation in hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems. While most young people followed low stable (62%-85%) or moderate stable (28%) symptom trajectories, 14-31% experienced very high, high stable or increasing mental health difficulties. Young people following high stable trajectories were more likely to have special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental disorders, parents who reported higher levels of stress and parent-child conflict and were less likely to have at least one close friend. Most participating young people experienced low stable symptoms but nearly one third experienced high stable or increasing mental health difficulties. Young people with complex needs and parents with higher psychological distress were particularly vulnerable to high stable mental health difficulties while those with positive peer relationships were less vulnerable. This study offers insight into potential factors that can be addressed using targeted interventions to improve the wellbeing of parents and young people in the event of future lockdowns and school closures.","Carolina Guzman Holst et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01C2-596-F87","20220909","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-10","",37399,""
