"The mortality and psychological burden caused by response to COVID-19 outbreak","The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in this country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5Â years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.","Yusuf, Erlangga; Tisler, Anna","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Med Hypotheses;143: 110069, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication details: Med Hypotheses;143: 110069, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3328,""
"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: A Multi-institutional Study from New York City","OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). STUDY DESIGN: Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10Â years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; and 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 63% of patients with median ejection fraction of 46.6% (IQR, 39.5-52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%). The left ventricular ejection fraction normalized in 95% of those with a depressed ejection fraction. All patients were discharged home with median duration of pediatric intensive care unit stay of 4.7Â days (IQR, 4-8Â days) and a hospital stay of 7.8Â days (IQR, 6.0-10.1Â days). One patient (3%) died after withdrawal of care secondary to stroke while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill children with coronavirus disease-2019-associated MIS-C have a spectrum of severity broader than described previously but still require careful supportive intensive care. Rapid, complete clinical and myocardial recovery was almost universal.","Kaushik, Shubhi; Aydin, Scott I; Derespina, Kim R; Bansal, Prerna B; Kowalsky, Shanna; Trachtman, Rebecca; Gillen, Jennifer K; Perez, Michelle M; Soshnick, Sara H; Conway, Edward E; Bercow, Asher; Seiden, Howard S; Pass, Robert H; Ushay, Henry M; Ofori-Amanfo, George; Medar, Shivanand S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.06.045","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Pediatr;2020 Jun 14.; Publication details: J Pediatr;2020 Jun 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3329,""

"Special ambulatory gynecologic considerations in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implications for future practice","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has altered medical practice in unprecedented ways. Although much of the emphasis in obstetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recommendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contraceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and laboratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.","Cohen, Megan A; Powell, Anna M; Coleman, Jenell S; Keller, Jean M; Livingston, Alison; Anderson, Jean R","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Obstet Gynecol;2020 Jun 06.; Publication details: Am J Obstet Gynecol;2020 Jun 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3331,""

This is the first study to investigate mental health, i. e. adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In April 2020, N=100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital. A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI). Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed. RESULTS: Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15%, respectively. Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression; predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs. 35%). Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself. Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems. Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID-19 did not differ from those with no direct contact. DISCUSSION: Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed. China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020. This might be relevant for Switzerland, too. Specific psychotherapeutic interventions, targeting at cognitive restructuring and sensitizing regarding dealing with alcohol and cigarettes, may be needed in order to protect this vulnerable group of person during and after the Corona pandemic.","Krammer, Sandy; Augstburger, Roland; Haeck, Martina; Maercker, Andreas","https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1192-6608","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol;70(7): 272-282, 2020 Jul.; Publication details: Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol;70(7): 272-282, 2020 Jul.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3332,""
"The relationship between resilience, anxiety, and depression among patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study","To explore the role of resilience in anxiety and depression and to clarify their relationships among patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. The outbreak of COVID-19 has negatively affected some individuals but resilience plays a decisive role in the response of individuals under pressure and can help them deal with pressure more effectively. The cross-sectional descriptive correlational survey was reported in line with the STROBE guidelines. In total, 296 patients from FangCang Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei, China with mild symptoms of COVID-19 were recruited. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling. The data collected included their demographic information, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A small number of the patients in this study had above threshold anxiety (subthreshold anxiety and major anxiety) and depression (subthreshold depression and major depression). The mean total resilience score of the participants was slightly below the normal level of ordinary Chinese adults. Resilience was inversely associated with and was a protective factor for both anxiety and depression in our samples. Risk factors for anxiety include being female and having colleagues with COVID-19, while a risk factor for depression was having family members with COVID-19. This study shows that after taking the general demographics into consideration, higher levels of resilience was associated with lower anxiety and depression among mild COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Health professionals, especially clinical nurses, need to be aware of the psychological status of COVID-19 patients and promote resilience in order to improve their mental health.","Zhang, Yang, Wang, Li, Dong, Wang, Li, Wei, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15425","20200723","Anxiety; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Depression; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3333,""
"Students under lockdown: Comparisons of students' social networks and mental health before and during the COVID-19 crisis in Switzerland","This study investigates students' social networks and mental health before and at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, using longitudinal data collected since 2018. We analyze change on multiple dimensions of social networks (interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) within two cohorts of Swiss undergraduate students experiencing the crisis (N = 212), and make additional comparisons to an earlier cohort which did not experience the crisis (N = 54). In within-person comparisons we find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, students' levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse, compared to measures before the crisis. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories. Female students appeared to have worse mental health trajectories when controlling for different levels of social integration and COVID-19 related stressors. As universities and researchers discuss future strategies on how to combine on-site teaching with online courses, our results indicate the importance of considering social contacts in students' mental health and offer starting points to identify and support students at higher risk of social isolation and negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Elmer, Mepham, Stadtfeld","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236337","20200723","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3334,""

"COVID-19 lockdown impact on lifestyle habits of Italian adults","In March 2020, when the Government imposed nation-wide lockdown measures to contrast the COVID-19 outbreak, the life of Italians suddenly changed. In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on lifestyle habits and behavioral risk factors of the general adult population in Italy, we set up the Lost in Italy (LOckdown and lifeSTyles IN ITALY) project. Within this project, the online panel of Doxa was used to conduct a web-based cross-sectional study during the first phase of the lockdown, on a large representative sample of adults aged 18-74 years (N=6003). The self-administered questionnaire included information on lifestyle habits and perceived physical and mental health, through the use of validated scales. As we are working within the Lost in Italy project, we got two additional grants to further research on the medium-term impact of lockdown, a topic of great interest and with anticipated large socio-economic and public health implications. In details: we obtained by the AXA Research Fund support to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on physical, mental, and social wellbeing of elderly and fragile populations in the Lombardy region, the area most heavily hit by the pandemic in the country. Moreover, as a fruitful integration, we obtained support by the Directorate General for Welfare of the region to assess health services delivery and access to healthcare in the same study population, combining an analysis of administrative databases with an economic analysis. We are confident that the solid background of our partners, the multi-disciplinary competencies they bring, together with appropriate funding and access to rich data sources will allow us to fulfill our research objectives.","Odone, Lugo, Amerio, Borroni, Bosetti, Carreras, Cavalieri d'Oro, Colombo, Fanucchi, Ghislandi, Gorini, Iacoviello, Pacifici, Santucci, Serafini, Signorelli, Stival, Stuckler, Tersalvi, Gallus","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i9-S.10122","20200723","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3336,""
"Post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic: depicting chronicity of a new disease","The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak is posing considerable challenges to healthcare systems and societies worldwide. While the knowledge on the acute phase of the disease has rapidly expanded, little is known on the consequences of COVID-19 following clinical remission. We set up a multidisciplinary COVID-19 follow-up outpatient clinic to identify and address the clinical needs of COVID-19 survivors. Here we describe the features of our follow-up programme. The multidisciplinary assessment comprises a complete physical examination, respiratory evaluation (peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, dyspnoea assessment, lung ultrasound and pulmonary function), cardiovascular assessment (electrocardiography, echocardiography), nutritional assessment (anthropometrics, mini Nutritional Assessment screening tool), neurological examination including cognitive tests, and mental health assessment. All data are prospectively collected, and blood is sampled for biobanking. Since 7 April to 5 June, 2020, 453 out of the 1388 COVID-19 survivors managed at our University Hospital have been evaluated at the Outpatient COVID-19 Follow-up Clinic. The characteristics of the follow-up cohort are similar to those of the whole cohort of COVID-19 in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and COVID-19 severity upon ED presentation, indicating that the follow-up cohort is representative of the whole cohort.

"What Media Helps, What Media Hurts: A Mixed Methods Survey Study of Coping with COVID-19 Using the Media Repertoire Framework and the Appraisal Theory of Stress","Social and physical distancing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has made screen-mediated information and communication technologies (media) indispensable. Whether increase in screen usage is a source of or a relief for stress is to be seen. In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdowns we investigated the relation between subjective stress and changes in the pattern of media usage. Based on Lazarus's transactional model of appraisal and coping, and building on an earlier similar survey, we hypothesized that individual differences in the appraisal of media predicted variations in approach or avoidance of media for coping with COVID-19 stress. Between March 20 - April 20, 2020, a brief snow-ball survey entitled: &quot;What media helps, what media hurts: coping with COVID19 through screens.&quot; was distributed via Concordia University's mailing lists and social media (PERFORM Centre, EngAGE Centre, and Media Health Lab). Using a media-repertoires method, we asked questions about preferences, changes in usage, and personal appraisal of media experiences (approach, avoid, ignore) as a result of the COVID10 pandemic and investigated interindividual differences in media usage, by factors such as subjective stress, age, gender and self-reported mental health. More than 90% of the survey respondents were in Canada and the east coast of the US. From N=685 completed responses, 169 respondents were 'very stressed', and 452 were 'slightly worried' about COVID-19. COVID-19 stress led to increased use of Facebook (Ãâ€¡2df=3. = 11.76, P=.008), Television (Ãâ€¡2df=3. = 12.40, P=.006), YouTube (Ãâ€¡ 2df=3. = 8.577, P=.035) and Netflix (Ãâ€¡2df=3. = 10.71, P=.013). Respondents who considered their mental health &quot;not good&quot; were twice more likely to prefer streaming services as a coping tool for self-isolation. Women and none-binary respondents were twice more likely that men, to pick Social Media. Individuals &lt;35 years of age were 3 times more likely to pick Computer Games, and individuals older than 55 were more likely to pick Network Television/Print media. Gender affected the appraisal of media (Men &lt;others) in terms of Avoid (F(1,637)=5.84, P=.016) and Approach scores(F(1,637)=14.31, P&lt;.001). Subjective Mental Health affected Ignore score (Good &lt; Others) (F(1, 637) = 13.88, P&lt;.001). Appraisal score and usage increase explained variations in worrying about physical and mental health stress due to increased screen-time. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed that media (especially social networks) was important for coping, if they provided support and connection through dissemination of factual and positive information, while avoiding the overflow of sensational and false news. The relationship between appraisal of media's positive and negative facets vary with demographic differences in mental health resiliency. Media-repertoires approach is an important tool in studies that focus on assessing the benefits and harms of screen overuse in different populations, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pahayahay, Khalili-Mahani","https://doi.org/10.2196/20186","20200723","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3338,""

"Puppy love in the time of Corona: Dog ownership protects against loneliness for those living alone during the COVID-19 lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many countries enforcing a 'lockdown', whereby people are instructed to stay at home. The aim of this study was to capture the experience of such a lockdown in Australians living alone, with and without a dog or a cat. Three hundred and eighty-four participants completed an online survey evaluating their levels of loneliness, mindfulness and mood. For participants who owned a dog or a cat, a measure of dog/cat interactions was also administered as well as two open-ended questions about how being a pet owner affected their experience of COVID-19 and how COVID-19 affected their pet. Contrary to expectations, cat owners were found to be less mindful than non-owners and pet interactions did not account for levels of loneliness or levels of mindfulness. In line with our expectations, however, stress and depression positively predicted loneliness, while mindfulness and being a dog owner were protective against it. Insights from qualitative responses suggest that this might be due to the fact that dogs encourage a routine which involves getting out of the house and walking, which itself offers opportunities to socialise with other people doing the same thing. These findings add to the emerging literature on mental well-being during a lockdown and the unique role that pets play in their owners' experiences.","Oliva, Johnston","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020944195","20200723","COVID-19; cat; dog; loneliness; mindfulness; pet","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3340,""
"Individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted many people's lives. This study examined changes in subjective wellbeing between December 2019 and May 2020 and how stress appraisals and coping strategies relate to individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. Data were collected at 4 time points from 979 individuals in Germany. Results showed that, on average, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect did not change significantly between December 2019 and March 2020 but decreased between March and May 2020. Across the latter timespan, individual differences in life satisfaction were positively related to controllability appraisals, active coping, and positive reframing, and negatively related to threat and centrality appraisals and planning. Positive affect was positively related to challenge and controllable-by-self appraisals, active coping, using emotional support, and religion, and negatively related to threat appraisal and humor. Negative affect was positively related to threat and centrality appraisals, denial, substance use, and self-blame, and negatively related to controllability appraisals and emotional support. Contrary to expectations, the effects of stress appraisals and coping strategies on changes in subjective wellbeing were small and mostly nonsignificant. These findings imply that the COVID-19 pandemic represents not only a major medical and economic crisis, but also has a psychological dimension, as it can be associated with declines in key facets of people's subjective wellbeing. Psychological practitioners should address potential declines in subjective wellbeing with their clients and attempt to enhance clients' general capability to use functional stress appraisals and effective coping strategies.

"Applying relationship science to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact couples' relationships","The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly altered people's daily lives and created multiple societal challenges. One important challenge of this unique stressor is maintaining well-functioning intimate relationships, which are inextricably tied to emotional and physical health. Yet research on romantic relationships shows that external stressors such as economic hardship, demanding jobs, and disasters can threaten the quality and stability of couples' relationships. Research within relationship science investigating how external stressors and existing vulnerabilities shape couple functioning can inform predictions about how the current pandemic will impact couples' relationships and which couples in which contexts may be most at risk for adverse relationship consequences. Drawing on theory and research from relationship science, the presented conceptual framework, adapted from the vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney &amp; Bradbury, 1995), suggests that facing COVID-19-related external stress is likely to increase harmful dyadic processes (e.g., hostility, withdrawal, less responsive support), which will undermine couples' relationship quality. These harmful effects are likely to be exacerbated by the broader preexisting context in which couples' relationships are situated (e.g., social class, minority status, age), and their individual vulnerabilities (e.g., attachment insecurity, depression). The framework presented identifies the essential factors that need to be addressed in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the current crisis on relationships, and offers key directions for future research.

However, there has been no substantive discussion of potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on patient health or their financial and policy implications. After recovery, patients remain at risk for lung disease, heart disease, frailty, and mental health disorders. There may also be long-term sequelae of adverse events that develop in the course of COVID-19 and its treatment. These complications are likely to place additional medical, psychological, and economic burdens on all patients, with lower-income individuals, the uninsured and underinsured, and individuals experiencing homelessness being most vulnerable.

"Debunking Cannabidiol as a Treatment for COVID-19: Time for the FDA to Adopt a Focused Deterrence Model?","Many cannabidiol (CBD) retailers make unsupported medical claims about their product. In recent years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has sent warning letters to CBD retailers who promoted CBD to treat Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes, and other serious conditions for which there is no evidence of its efficacy as a treatment or preventive. Compliance with these warning letters has been low. During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the FDA has begun sending more strongly worded warning letters that appear to have better compliance in that most of these companies have removed COVID-19-related claims. However, many continue to present other unsupported medical claims on other serious medical conditions like cancer, depression, addiction, and bone fractures, among many others. We argue that adopting a strategy of focused deterrence where the FDA prioritizes enforcement related to COVID-19 claims - but when COVID-19-related claims are found, pursues all other violations by that company - would present an opportunity to efficiently cut down on harmful claims overstating CBD's benefits.","Shover, Humphreys","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8671","20200723","cannabidiol; cannabis; covid-19; food and drug administration; health policy; regulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3345,""
"Going digital: how technology use may influence human brains and behaviorÃ¢â‚¬Â©","The digital revolution has changed, and continues to change, our world and our lives. Currently, major aspects of our lives have moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic, and social distancing has necessitated virtual togetherness. In a synopsis of 10 articles we present ample evidence that the use of digital technology may influence human brains and behavior in both negative and positive ways. For instance, brain imaging techniques show concrete morphological alterations in early childhood and during adolescence that are associated with intensive digital media use. Technology use apparently affects brain functions, for example visual perception, language, and cognition. Extensive studies could not confirm common concerns that excessive screen time is linked to mental health problems, or the deterioration of well-being. Nevertheless, it is important to use digital technology consciously, creatively, and sensibly to improve personal and professional relationships. Digital technology has great potential for mental health assessment and treatment, and the improvement of personal mental performance.Ã¢â‚¬Â©.

Actualmente, los principales aspectos de nuestras vidas han migrado hacia el funcionamiento Ã¢â‚¬Å“onlineÃ¢â‚¬Â debido a la pandemia del coronavirus, y el distanciamiento social ha requerido de cercanÃƒÂ­as virtuales. En una sinopsis de 10 artÃƒÂ­culos, se presenta una amplia evidencia de que el empleo de la tecnologÃƒÂ­a digital puede influir en el cerebro y en el comportamiento humano de manera negativa y positiva. Por ejemplo, las tÃƒÂ©cnicas de imÃƒÂ¡genes cerebrales muestran alteraciones morfolÃƒÂ³gicas concretas en la primera infancia y durante la adolescencia, las cuales estÃƒÂ¡n asociadas con el empleo intenso de medios digitales. En apariencia, la utilizaciÃƒÂ³n de la tecnologÃƒÂ­a afecta las funciones cerebrales, como la percepciÃƒÂ³n visual, el lenguaje y la cogniciÃƒÂ³n. Numerosos estudios no pudieron confirmar las preocupaciones comunes en cuanto a que el tiempo excesivo de pantalla estÃƒÂ© relacionado con problemas de salud mental o el deterioro del bienestar. Sin embargo, es importante emplear la tecnologÃƒÂ­a digital de manera consciente, creativa y sensata para mejorar las relaciones personales y profesionales. La tecnologÃƒÂ­a digital tiene un gran potencial para la evaluaciÃƒÂ³n y el tratamiento de la salud mental, y el aumento del rendimiento mental personal. La rÃƒÂ©volution numÃƒÂ©rique a modifiÃƒÂ© et continue Ãƒ modifier notre monde et nos vies. La pandÃƒÂ©mie actuelle due au coronavirus a fait basculer en ligne de nombreux pans de notre existence et la distanciation sociale a imposÃƒÂ© la virtualitÃƒÂ© des rassemblements. Les donnÃƒÂ©es des dix articles prÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ©s ici attestent de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢influence de la technologie numÃƒÂ©rique sur les cerveaux et les comportements, de maniÃƒÂ¨re positive et nÃƒÂ©gative. Par exemple,lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢imagerie cÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©brale montre des altÃƒÂ©rations morphologiques concrÃƒÂ¨tes apparaissant tÃƒÂ´t dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢enfance et pendant lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢adolescence lors dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une pratique intensive des media numÃƒÂ©riques. Cela concernerait certaines fonctions cÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©brales comme la perception visuelle, le langage et la cognition.

Il est nÃƒÂ©anmoins important de privilÃƒÂ©gier une utilisation consciente, crÃƒÂ©ative et raisonnable des technologies numÃƒÂ©riques afin dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢amÃƒÂ©liorer les relations personnelles et professionnelles. Ces technologies ont un grand potentiel dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©valuation et le traitement de la santÃƒÂ© mentale ainsi que dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢amÃƒÂ©lioration des performances mentales personnelles.","Hoehe, Thibaut","https://doi.org/10.31887/DCNS.2020.22.2/mhoehe","20200723","brain change; brain function; brain imaging; developmental change; digital media; digital revolution; mental health, well-being, mental health assessment, diagnostics, virtual therapy; screen time; web-based intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3346,""
"[Impact of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) on the mental health of healthcare professionals: a systematic review]","In times of this global pandemic situation, population's mental health is compromised, especially in those groups that are at the forefront of defence against the virus such as healthcare professionals. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on healthcare professionals' mental health. A systematic review was carried out following the PRISMA format in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ScienceDirect electronic databases between January and May 2020. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for non-randomized studies. A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Professionals' mental health and mental functions were compromised, being especially affected those professionals on the front line of battle against the virus. However, these stats were below the general population data. Although there is wide variability of results, medium-high levels of anxiety (26,5%-44,6%), depression (8,1%-25%), concern and insomnia are detected (23,6%-38%). Paradoxically, stress levels were below expectations (3,8%-68,3%). The mental well-being of health professionals working on the front line is compromised in times of pandemic by presenting medium-high levels of anxiety, depression, nervousness and insomnia, and, to a lesser extent, stress.

"No clear association emerges between intergenerational relationships and COVID-19 fatality rates from macro-level analyses","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 originated in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and rapidly spread in more than 100 countries. Researchers in different fields have been working on finding explanations for the unequal impact of the virus and deaths from the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across geographical areas. Demographers and other social scientists have hinted at the importance of demographic factors, such as age structure and intergenerational relationships. Our aim is to reflect on the possible link between intergenerational relationships and spread and lethality of COVID-19 in a critical way. We show that with available aggregate data it is not possible to draw robust evidence to support these links. In fact, despite a higher prevalence of intergenerational coresidence and contacts that is broadly positively associated with COVID-19 case fatality rates at the country level, the opposite is generally true at the subnational level. While this inconsistent evidence demonstrates neither the existence nor the absence of a causal link between intergenerational relationships and the severity of COVID-19, we warn against simplistic interpretations of the available data, which suffer from many shortcomings. We conclude by arguing that intergenerational relationships are not only about physical contacts between family members. Theoretically, different forms of intergenerational relationships may have causal effects of opposite sign on the diffusion of COVID-19. Policies should also take into account that intergenerational ties are a source of instrumental and emotional support, which may favor compliance to the lockdown and &quot;phase-2&quot; restrictions and may buffer their negative consequences on mental health.","Arpino, Bordone, Pasqualini","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008581117","20200723","COVID-19; coresidence; coronavirus; intergenerational contacts; intergenerational relationships","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3348,""

"Predictors of response to augmentation treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression: A systematic review","Treatment-resistant depression is an important contributor to the global burden of depression. Antidepressant augmentation is a recommended treatment strategy for treatment-resistant patients, but outcomes remain poor. Identifying factors that are predictive of response to augmentation treatments may improve outcomes. This review aimed to synthesise the existing literature examining predictors of response to augmentation treatments in patients who had insufficiently responded to initial treatment. A systematic search was conducted identifying 2241 unique manuscripts. 24 examining predictors of outcome to pharmacological or psychological augmentation treatment were included in this review. Atypical antipsychotics were the most frequently assessed treatment class (nine studies), closely followed by mood stabilisers (eight studies). Only one eligible psychological augmentation study was identified. Early response to treatment (week 2) was the best-supported predictor of subsequent treatment outcome, reported by six studies. Many predictor variables were only assessed by one report and others such as pre-treatment severity yielded contradictory results, both within and across treatment classes. This review highlights the importance of early response as a predictor of pharmacological augmentation outcome, with implications for both the monitoring and treatment of resistant unipolar patients. Further replication is needed across specific interventions to fully assess the generalisability of this finding. However, the clear lack of consistent evidence for other predictive factors both within and across treatments, and the scarce examination of psychological augmentation, demonstrates the need for much more research of a high quality if response prediction is to improve outcomes for patients with treatment-resistant depression.","Taylor, Marwood, Greer, Strawbridge, Cleare","https://doi.org/10.1177/0269881119872194","20200723","Depression; drug augmentation; prognostic factors; review; Antidepressive Agents; Antimanic Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Coronavirus Infections; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3350,""

"Localization of Cell Receptor-Related Genes of SARS-CoV-2 in the Kidney through Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis","BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has been responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, uses the cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming. Meanwhile, the presence of B0AT1 (SLC6A19) may prevent TMPRSS2 from accessing the cutting position on ACE2. Identifying the expression of these cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in various tissues, especially in the kidney. METHODS: The single-cell transcription datasets of the human cell landscape (HCL) and other relevant single-cell transcription databases were used to analyze the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and SLC6A19 in various organs and tissues, but mainly in the kidney. RESULTS: ACE2 was significantly expressed in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of proximal tubule (PT) cells. TMPRSS2 was widely expressed in several renal tubule populations extending from the PT cells to the collection system cell type, of which intercalated cells and the distal convoluted tubule cells showed more significant expression than PT cells. Unexpectedly, although expressed on various renal tubule populations, SLC6A19 was mainly enriched in PT cells, in line with ACE2 expression. Although alveolar-type (AT) 2 cells of the lung and intestinal epithelial cells expressed ACE2 as well as PT cells, AT 2 cells significantly expressed TMPRSS2 but not SLC6A19, while all 3 genes were significantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 was widely expressed in specific cell subgroups of various human tissues, especially in intestinal epithelial cells, kidney PT cells, and also AT 2 cells of the lung. These 3 types of cells demonstrated significant differences in the distribution of the cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2, which may indicate the diversity of cell surface structures and differences in the affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and cells.","Chen, Qi-Lin; Li, Jia-Qi; Xiang, Zhi-Dan; Lang, Yue; Guo, Guo-Ji; Liu, Zhi-Hong","https://doi.org/10.1159/000508162","20200519","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3352,""

"Police Stress, Mental Health, and Resiliency during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic created social upheaval and altered norms for all members of society, but its effects on first responders have been particularly profound. Law enforcement officers have been expected to coordinate local shutdowns, encourage social distancing, and enforce stay-at-home mandates all while completing the responsibilities for which they are already understaffed and underfunded. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on officer stress, mental health, resiliency, and misconduct is explored drawing insight from reactions to the HIV epidemic over two decades earlier and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. COVID-19 policing is hypothesized to serve as a significant stressor for officers and compound the general and organizational stress associated with the occupation. Avenues for providing officer support are discussed and recommendations for research into the phenomenon presented.","Stogner, John; Miller, Bryan Lee; McLean, Kyle","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09548-y","20200626","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3354,""
"Depressive Symptoms, Body Mass Index, and Physical Activity Self-Efficacy in African American Children","In recent decades, the prevalence of childhood depression and obesity has increased worldwide. African American (AA) children are more obese than White peers and experience many factors that can influence the onset of depressive symptoms. While depression and obesity have been examined in adolescents, there is a paucity of research in AA children. This study examined the relationships among depressive symptoms, obesity, and physical activity self-efficacy in AA children. A community sample of 65 AA children completed questionnaires for depressive symptoms and physical activity self-efficacy and also had body mass index (BMI) and BMI Z-scores calculated. Correlational statistics were used to examine associations between variables. Clinically significant total depression scores were present in 22% of children, while 48% were overweight or obese. Overall, children reported high physical activity self-efficacy. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with higher BMI Z-scores. Results also indicated significant correlations between the childrenâ€™s physical activity self-efficacy and depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that the associations between depressive symptoms, BMI, and physical activity self-efficacy in AA children merit additional examination. Early identification of depression in children may inform future approaches to treatment of psychological and physiological problems within the clinical setting. Screening for childhood depressive symptoms in primary care settings, especially those that specifically treat childhood obesity, can be instrumental in early identification of children with depression. Healthcare providers should be knowledgeable of the clinical presentation of depression and engaged in depression screening.","Williams, Yâ€™Esha V.; Cowan, Patricia A.; Graff, Joyce C.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-020-01761-x","20200627","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3355,""

"On Weakening Strategies for PB Solvers","Current pseudo-Boolean solvers implement different variants of the cutting planes proof system to infer new constraints during conflict analysis. One of these variants is generalized resolution, which allows to infer strong constraints, but suffers from the growth of coefficients it generates while combining pseudo-Boolean constraints. Another variant consists in using weakening and division, which is more efficient in practice but may infer weaker constraints. In both cases, weakening is mandatory to derive conflicting constraints. However, its impact on the performance of pseudo-Boolean solvers has not been assessed so far. In this paper, new application strategies for this rule are studied, aiming to infer strong constraints with small coefficients. We implemented them in Sat4j and observed that each of them improves the runtime of the solver. While none of them performs better than the others on all benchmarks, applying weakening on the conflict side has surprising good performance, whereas applying partial weakening and division on both the conflict and the reason sides provides the best results overall.","Le Berre, Daniel; Marquis, Pierre; Wallon, Romain","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51825-7_23","20200626","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3359,""
"Cefepime is Associated with Acute Encephalopathy in Critically Ill Patients: A Retrospective Caseâ€“Control Study","BACKGROUND: Acute encephalopathy (AE) is a common complication of critical illness and is associated with increased short and long-term mortality. In this study, we evaluated the role of cefepime in causing AE. METHODS: Retrospective caseâ€“control study involving consecutive patients enrolled in the intensive care units (ICUs) of Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2015. AE was defined by the presence of delirium or depressed level of consciousness in the absence of deep sedation. Controls were identified as patients not developing AE and were matched by propensity score for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, 24-h Apache III score and invasive ventilation use. RESULTS: The total number of eligible ICU admissions during our study period was 152,999. AE was present in 57,726 (37.7%) with a median AE duration of 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 4.0â€“51.8) hours. We matched 14,645 cases with AE with the same number of controls. Cefepime was used in 1241 (4.2%) patients and its use was associated with greater incidence of AE [713 (4.9%) vs 528 (3.6%), p < 0.001] and duration [unit estimate 0.73; (95% CI 0.542â€“0.918)]. On multivariate analysis, cefepime was associated with an increased likelihood of AE after controlling for shock, midazolam infusion and acute kidney injury [OR 1.24 (95% CI 1.10â€“1.27)]. These associations were also present after controlling for prior chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: The use of cefepime is associated with increased likelihood and duration of AE. These associations are stronger among patients with impaired renal function, but can also occur in patients without renal impairment.

"The effects of emergency medical service work on the psychological, physical, and social well-being of ambulance personnel: a systematic review of qualitative research","BACKGROUND: High rates of mental distress, mental illness, and the associated physical effects of psychological injury experienced by ambulance personnel has been widely reported in quantitative research. However, there is limited understanding of how the nature of ambulance work contributes to this problem, the significant large toll that emergency medical response takes on the individual, and particularly about late and cumulative development of work-related distress among this first responder workforce. METHODS: This study examined peer-reviewed qualitative research published from 2000 to 2018 to outline the effect of emergency medical response work on the psychological, psychosocial, and physical health of paramedics, ambulance officers, ambulance volunteers, and call-takers. Databases searched included: Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Ovid EMcare, PsychInfo and Scopus. The systematic review was organised around five key areas: impact of the work on psychological wellbeing; impact of psychological stress on physical wellbeing; how work-related well-being needs were articulated; effects of workflow and the nature of the work on well-being; and, effects of organisational structures on psychological and physical well-being. RESULTS: Thirty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Several factors present in the day-to-day work of ambulance personnel, and in how organisational management acknowledge and respond, were identified as being significant and contributing to mental health and well-being, or increasing the risk for developing conditions such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Ambulance personnel articulated their well-being needs across four key areas: organisational support; informal support; use of humour; and individual mechanisms to cope such as detachment and external supports. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between critical incidents and workplace culture and demands have an overwhelming impact on the psychological, physical and social well-being of ambulance personnel. These include day-to-day managerial actions and responses, the impact of shift work, poorly-managed rosters, and long hours of work with little time between for recovery. Mental health issues result from exposure to traumatic events, and the way managers and peers respond to worker distress. Ambulance personnel suffering from work-related stress feel abandoned by peers, management, and the service, during illness, in return-to-work, and post-retirement. Policy, programmes and interventions, and education need to occur at an individual, peer, organisational, and government level.","Lawn, Sharon; Roberts, Louise; Willis, Eileen; Couzner, Leah; Mohammadi, Leila; Goble, Elizabeth","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02752-4","20200703","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3361,""
"Introduction: The Paradoxes and Worries in Contemporary Times","In this introduction, I attempt to map out what I have previously called â€˜designer capitalism.â€™ The way media and technologies in a digitalized world structure existence in what Gilles Deleuze called â€˜control societiesâ€™ and theorists like Bernard Stiegler continue to develop through an expansive theory of technics, more specifically through his two-volume work on Symbolic Misery. In many respects, this introduction is consonant with Gregory Ulmerâ€™s theorization of â€˜electracy,â€™ which crops up now and again throughout the chapters that follow. Ulmer develops his own â€˜electorate transversal,â€™ a remarkable combination of Spinoza with Nietzsche where pain and pleasure (or sadness and joy) as experiences are theorized within this changed contemporary digitalized world. My emphasis, however, rests with Deleuze and Guattari who play a dominant position throughout this book. In this introduction, I review several important developments to grasp â€˜designer capitalism,â€™ the most prominent being â€˜the stackâ€™ by Benjamin Bratton and â€˜surveillance capitalismâ€™ by Shoshana Zuboff. Both help us grasp the power of platform capitalism and the place of Big Data in it. This forms a backdrop to my own involvement with South Korean culture and my concerns with (art) pedagogy, technology, and visual media in the chapters that follow. The last part of this introduction offers a hint of what becomes more and more apparent as the book progresses: the questions that surround the Anthropocene, which is explored in the third part of this book, stated sensationally as â€˜the end of the worldâ€™ as we know it.","jagodzinski, jan","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48618-1_1","20200704","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3362,""
"Parental knowledge and practice on antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infections in children, in Aksum town health institutions, Northern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study","INTRODUCTION: worldwide, antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed and abused drugs for upper respiratory tract infections. Acute upper respiratory infections are common in children who attend childcare and preventing transmission of disease in health setting depends on actions by parents and staff. Therefore the objective of this study is to assess the parental knowledge and practice on antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infections in children, in Aksum town health institutions, northern Ethiopia, 2018. METHODS: a facility-based cross-sectional study design was adopted involving 384 parents of children visited governmental health facilities in Aksum town from February to March, 2018. Respondents were selected based on the proportion of nurses in the health facilities. SPSS version 22 was applied for data entry and analysis. RESULTS: the total number of questionnaires was 384 resulting in a 100% response rate. Almost half of the parents had poor knowledge of the use of antibiotics in children for URTIs 183(47.7%), followed by 156(40.6%) moderate knowledge and 45(11.7%) good knowledge. Practices regarding antibiotic use in children with URTI varied. Only 12.8% of the parents did not always follow the doctorsÂ´ advice regarding antibiotic use. In this study has reported many areas in which parental awareness on antibiotic use for acute URTI is considered inadequate, consequently inappropriate knowledge and practices. CONCLUSION: nearly half of the parents attending the physicians for their children with URTI expected to get antibiotics.","Zeru, Teklay; Berihu, Hagos; Buruh, Gerezgiher; Gebrehiwot, Haftom; Zeru, Mebrahtom","https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.35.142.17848","20200429","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3363,""

"Designing dynamic reverse logistics network for post-sale service","The paper addresses the problem of designing a multi-country productionâ€“distribution network that also provides services such as repairs and remanufacturing. The proposed work concentrates primarily on post-sale service provided by the firm under warranty returns. The proposed model assumes that existing warehouses can also serve as collection centres or repair centres for reverse logistics. In addition, the model also explores the possibility of establishing a new facility. Hybrid facilities are considered because of their huge cost-cutting potential due to equipment sharing and space sharing. The capacity of hybrid facilities can be expanded to a predefined limit to process returned products without hampering forward logistics operations. However, if a product cannot be repaired at the warehouse, it is transported to the plant for remanufacturing. The model optimizes the overall configuration and operation cost of the productionâ€“distribution network. The productionâ€“distribution model developed in the paper is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that is later transformed to a mixed-integer linear program to reduce the solution time. The usefulness of the model is illustrated using a randomly generated dataset.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a randomised double-blind controlled trial with 1:1 allocation to either 20 sessions of (1) cgiTBS or (2) neuronavigated rTMS not using connectivity guidance. A total of 368 eligible participants with a diagnosis of current unipolar major depressive disorder that is both treatment resistant (defined as scoring 2 or more on the Massachusetts General Hospital Staging Score) and moderate to severe (scoring >16 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17)), will be recruited from primary and secondary care settings at four treatment centres in the UK. The primary outcome is depression response at 16 weeks (50% or greater reduction in HDRS-17 score from baseline). Secondary outcomes include assessments of self-rated depression, anxiety, psychosocial functioning, cognition and quality of life at 8, 16 and 26 weeks postrandomisation. Cost-effectiveness, patient acceptability, safety, mechanism of action and predictors of response will also be examined. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by East Midlands Leicester Central Research Ethics Committee (ref: 18/EM/0232) on 30 August 2018. The results of the study will be published in relevant peer-reviewed journals, and then through professional and public conferences and media. Further publications will explore patient experience, moderators and mediators of outcome and mechanism of action.

"Sedation with ketamine and fentanyl combination improves patient outcomes in intensive care units","Psychological manifestations such as depression and suicidal ideation are commonly caused by poorly controlled pain, anxiety, and sleep deprivation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. We are concerned that previous analgesic and sedative techniques administered as single-medication approaches are outdated and inadequate. It is imperative that ICU practitioners are knowledgeable in multimodal approaches to pain and sedation in high acuity settings. We have shown that appropriate combinations of ketamine and fentanyl are effective, and if further supplementation is needed, we utilize additional pharmacological agents in low doses and regional techniques that ultimately lower the overall opioid consumption. We acknowledge that a variety of medication supplementations tailored to the patientâ€™s clinical needs and nature of surgery improves a patientâ€™s outcome in ICU and overall quality of life.","Vitug, Sarah; Ravi, Vikas; Thangathurai, Duraiyah","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00275-3","20200710","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3367,""

"A Performance Class-Based Particle Swarm Optimizer","One of the main concerns with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is to increase or maintain diversity during search in order to avoid premature convergence. In this study, a Performance Class-Based learning PSO (PCB-PSO) algorithm is proposed, that not only increases and maintains swarm diversity but also improves exploration and exploitation while speeding up convergence simultaneously. In the PCB-PSO algorithm, each particle belongs to a class based on its fitness value and particles might change classes at evolutionary stages or search step based on their updated position. The particles are divided into an upper, middle and lower. In the upper class are particles with top fitness values, the middle are those with average while particles in the bottom class are the worst performing in the swarm. The number of particles in each group is predetermined. Each class has a unique learning strategy designed specifically for a given task. The upper class is designed to converge towards the best solution found, Middle class particles exploit the search space while lower class particles explore. The algorithmâ€™s strength is its flexibility and robustness as the population of each class allows us to prioritize a desired swarm behavior. The Algorithm is tested on a set of 8 benchmark functions which have generally proven to be difficult to optimize. The algorithm is able to be on par with some cutting edge PSO variants and outperforms other swarm and evolutionary algorithms on a number of functions. On complex multimodal functions, it is able to outperform other PSO variants showing its ability to escape local optima solutions.","Tungom, Chia Emmanuel; Gulan, Maja; Niu, Ben","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-53956-6_16","20200622","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3369,""
"Eleven-year multimorbidity burden among 637 255 people with and without type 2 diabetes: a population-based study using primary care and linked hospitalisation data","OBJECTIVES: To compare the patterns of 18 physical and mental health comorbidities between people with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) and people without diabetes and how these change by age, gender and deprivation over time between 2004 and 2014. Also, to develop a metric to identify most prevalent comorbidities in people with T2D. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Primary and secondary care, England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 108 588 people with T2D and 528 667 comparators registered in 391 English general practices. Each patient with T2D aged =16 years between January 2004 and December 2014 registered in Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD practices was matched to up to five comparators without diabetes on age, gender and general practice. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of 18 physical and mental health comorbidities in people with T2D and comparators categorised by age, gender and deprivation. Odds for association between T2D diagnosis and comorbidities versus comparators. A metric for comorbidities with prevalence of =5% and/or odds =2 in patients with T2D. RESULTS: Overall, 77% of patients with T2D had =1 comorbidity and all comorbidities were more prevalent in patients with T2D than in comparators. Across both groups, prevalence rates were higher in older people, women and those most socially deprived. Conditional logistic regression models fitted to estimate (OR, 95% CI) for association between T2D diagnosis and comorbidities showed that T2D diagnosis was significantly associated with higher odds for all conditions including myocardial infarction (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.46); heart failure (OR 2.12, 1.84 to 2.43); depression (OR 1.75, 1.62 to 1.89), but non-significant for cancer (OR 1.12, 0.98 to 1.28). In addition to cardiovascular disease, the metric identified osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, anxiety, schizophrenia and respiratory conditions as highly prevalent comorbidities in people with T2D. CONCLUSIONS: T2D diagnosis is associated with higher likelihood of experiencing other physical and mental illnesses. People with T2D are twice as likely to have cardiovascular disease as the general population. The findings highlight highly prevalent and under-reported comorbidities in people with T2D. These findings can inform future research and clinical guidelines and can have important implications on healthcare resource allocation and highlight the need for more holistic clinical care for people with recently diagnosed T2D.","Zghebi, Salwa S; Steinke, Douglas T; Rutter, Martin K; Ashcroft, Darren M","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033866","20200701","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3370,""

"Salud mental y salud ambiental Una visiÃ³n prospectiva Informe SESPAS 2020","Resumen El ambiente ha sido, desde los albores de la psiquiatrÃ­a, un factor fundamental en el estudio y la comprensiÃ³n de las enfermedades mentales. La relaciÃ³n entre genoma y ambiente ha constituido tradicionalmente un tema central en la investigaciÃ³n de la etiopatogenia de los problemas de salud mental y en la concepciÃ³n misma de esta. En su aplicaciÃ³n a la psicopatologÃ­a y a la salud mental, la ambiÃ³mica psiquiÃ¡trica se ha definido como Â«el estudio de las condiciones y procesos ambientales que promueven la salud mental o incrementan los riesgos de trastornos mentalesÂ». Sin embargo, la salud ambiental, al menos en EspaÃ±a y en relaciÃ³n con sus competencias dentro del sistema de salud general, ha centrado su atenciÃ³n en los aspectos relativos a los riesgos ligados a la contaminaciÃ³n fÃ­sica, quÃ­mica o biolÃ³gica del aire, el agua o la tierra, asÃ­ como a su correlato alimenticio. Aunque los riesgos ambientales, como la calidad del aire, las temperaturas extremas, el ruido, el cambio climÃ¡tico y distintos tÃ³xicos ambientales, pueden desempeÃ±ar un papel muy importante, difÃ­cilmente pueden ser identificados como elementos etiopatogÃ©nicos Ãºnicos. Este trabajo revisa la literatura reciente sobre la investigaciÃ³n ambiental y los problemas de morbimortalidad psiquiÃ¡trica. Si bien los resultados son poco concluyentes, las futuras lÃ­neas de investigaciÃ³n deberÃ­an considerar una colaboraciÃ³n interdisciplinaria mÃ¡s Ã¡gil, que permita, por un lado, entender mejor la enfermedad mental, y por otro, avanzar desde la salud ambiental Â«tradicionalÂ» a una que contemple los factores ambientales de tipo social abordando el concepto aÃºn poco estudiado de Â«contaminaciÃ³n socialÂ». Abstract Since the dawn of psychiatry, the environment has been an essential factor in the study and understanding of mental illness. Traditionally, the interrelationship between genome and environment has been a central theme in research on the etiopathogenesis of mental health problems and in the very conception of mental health. In its application to psychopathology and mental health, psychiatric enviromics was defined as Â«the study of environmental conditions and processes that promote mental health or increase the risk of developing mental disordersÂ». However, environmental health â€”at least in Spain and in connection with its powers within the Spanish General Health Systemâ€” has paid attention to aspects pertaining to risks associated with the physical, chemical and biological pollution of the air, the water and the ground, as well as to its correlation with food pollution. Although environmental risks such as air quality, extreme temperatures, noise, climate change and various environmental toxicants can play a particularly important role, they can hardly be identified as single etiopathogenic elements. This work reviews the recent literature on environmental research and problems of psychiatric morbidity and mortality. Although the results are inconclusive, future lines of research should consider a more agile interdisciplinary collaboration, allowing, on the one hand, a better understanding of mental illness and, on the other hand, to be able to shift from â€œtraditionalâ€ environmental health to an environmental health that takes social environmental factors into account and seriously addresses the still little studied concept of â€œsocial pollutionâ€.","OrdÃ³Ã±ez-Iriarte, JosÃ© MarÃ­a","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.05.007","20200718","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3375,""
"Optimizing Resident Wellness During a Pandemic: University of British Columbia's General Surgery Program's COVID-19 Experience","Abstract Objective The University of British Columbia's General Surgery Program delineates a unique and systematic approach to wellness for surgical residents during a pandemic. Summary Background Data During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are suffering from increased rates of mental health disturbances. Residentsâ€™ duty obligations put them at increased physical and mental health risk. It is only by prioritizing their well-being that we can better serve the patients and prepare for a surge. Therefore, it is imperative that measures are put in place to protect them. Methods Resident wellness was optimized by targeting three domains: efficiency of practice, culture of wellness and personal resilience. Results Efficiency in delivering information and patient care minimizes additional stress to residents that is caused by the pandemic. By having a reserve team, prioritizing the safety of residents and taking burnout seriously, the culture of wellness and sense of community in our program are emphasized. All of the residentsâ€™ personal resilience was further optimized by the regular and mandatory measures put in place by the program. Conclusions The new challenges brought on by a pandemic puts increased pressure on residents. Measures must be put in place to protect resident from the increased physical and mental health stress in order to best serve patients during this difficult time.","Lie, Jessica J.; Huynh, Caroline; Scott, Tracy M.; Karimuddin, Ahmer A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.07.017","20200719","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3376,""
"Paid Family Leave and Children Health Outcomes in OECD Countries","Abstract During the past four decades, most OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries have adopted or expanded paid family leave, which offers leave to workers following the birth or adoption of a child as well as care for ill family members. While the effects of paid maternity leave on child health have been the subject of a large body of research, little is known about fathersâ€™ leave-taking and the effects of paid paternity leave. This is a limitation, since most of the recent expansion in paid family leave in OECD countries has been to expand leave benefits to fathers. Mothersâ€™ and fathersâ€™ leave-taking may improve child health by decreasing postpartum depression among mothers, improving maternal mental health, increasing the time spent with a child, and increasing the likelihood of child medical checkup. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of paid family leave on the wellbeing of children, extending what we know about the effects of maternity leave and establishing new evidence on paternity leave. The paper examines the effects of paid family leave expansions on country-level neonatal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, under-five mortality rates, and the measles immunization rates in 35 OECD countries, during the time period of 1990 to 2016. Using an event study design, an approximately 1.9 to 5.2 percent decrease in the infant, neonatal, and under-five mortality rates has been found following the adoption of paid maternity leave. However, the beneficial impact is not as visible for extension of paid leave to fathers. The implications and potential reasons behind the larger protective effects of maternity leave over paternity leave on child health outcomes are discussed.","Khan, Mariam S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105259","20200718","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3377,""
"Prevalence of Stress, Anxiety and Depression due to Examination in Bangladeshi Youths: A Pilot Study","Abstract An estimated 25% people suffer from mental health disorders worldwide. Almost 7 million suffer from anxiety and depression in Bangladesh. There are several factors that can cause stress among youths, both academic and non-academic, ranging from socioeconomic, environmental, cultural and psychological attributes. However, these are not widely researched in Bangladesh. This study identified the factors that affect the mental health of students due to examinations in Bangladesh, particularly the socio-demographic, lifestyle and psychological factors. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted on May 2020 with a sample size of 210 tertiary level students in Dhaka. A modified DASS-21 was used to measure stress, anxiety and depression scores related to examination. Binary logistic model showed that those who lived with family, spent time with parents, had regular sufficient (self-assessed) sleeps and consumed balanced (self-assessed) diets had significantly lower stress, anxiety, and depression. Balanced lifestyle with greater social bonding might help to better equip youths to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression during examination, which could be an avenue for future intervention studies.","Rayhan Arusha, Anowara; Kishore Biswas, Raaj","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105254","20200718","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3378,""
"Comparison of three low-cost techniques to control fogging of sealed eyewear in a simulated operating room environment: A preliminary analysis","Abstract Purpose In the current COVID pandemic, hermetically sealed eyewear is recommended for safe surgical practices to prevent eye contact with contaminated airborne particles or aerosols. These sealed eyewears definitely reduce the risk of contamination of eyes. However, there is a constant issue of fogging up of the inner surface that prevents good surgical visibility which can impair surgeonsâ€™ performance and their ability to perform fine tasks, especially in operating rooms with temperature and humidity controlled as per the COVID guidelines. We investigated the effectiveness of surface-modified anti-fog polyethylene terephthalate(PET) films and the application of a detergent-based surfactant liquid, applied to the inner aspect of viewing frame, and addition of filtered vents in the prevention of fogging up of the protective eyewears in a simulated operating room environment. Methods Ten volunteer orthopedic surgeons tested three modifications of a poly-hydrocarbon based hermetically sealed eyewear as a) application of a surface-modified anti-fog PET film on the inner aspect of eyewear, b) application of a detergent-based surfactant coating on the inner aspect of the protective eyewear, and c) addition of two filtered vents/holes on each side of the protective eyewear, covered with an N95 mask cutting. The testing was performed while completing a synthetic bone-based surgical task in a simulated operating room environment of 24â€“26Â° temperature and humidity between 40 and 70%, for a maximum of 2 h. The duration to the loss of clear visibility (ability to read a newspaper) and workable visibility (ability to perform the surgical task) was recorded for each volunteer. Results The detergent-based surfactant provided the longest duration of clear visibility (69.3 Â± 8.16 min) and the workable visibility was maintained for more than 2 h. The second best durations of clear visibility (31.9 Â± 3.75 min) and workable visibility (41.6 Â± 5.39 min) were provided by the surface-modified anti-fog PET film. The addition of the filtered vents provided only a marginal improvement in the visibility. Conclusion A detergent-based surfactant coating of the viewing surface provides a simple, inexpensive and effective solution to the problem of fogging of the protective eyewears. Besides this, the workable vision is maintained for a prolonged duration.","Kumar, Arvind; Qureshi, Owais Ahmed; Arora, Rajesh; Kumar, Sandeep; Jameel, Javed; Khan, Rizwan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.07.009","20200717","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3379,""
"Malay Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Validity and Reliability","The newly developed Persian Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is a seven-item uni-dimensional scale that assesses the severity of fear of COVID-19. A translation and validation of the FCV-19S in the Malay language was expedited due to the severe psychological sequelae of COVID-19 in Malaysia. Formal WHO forward and backward translation sequences were employed in translating the English version into Malay. Malaysian university participants were recruited via convenience sampling online using snowball methods. The reliability and validity properties of the Malay FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilising both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables and response to the depression, anxiety and stress subscales of the Malay validation of the DASS-21. The sample comprised 228 Malaysian participants. The Cronbach a value for the Malay FCV-19S was 0.893 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV19S fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S-M was significantly correlated with anxiety (r = 0.481, p < 0.001) and stress (r = 0.389, p < 0.001) subscales of DASS-21. The FCV-19S-Mâ€™s properties tested using Rasch analysis were also satisfactory. Hence, the Malay FCV-19S is valid and reliable, with robust psychometric properties from classical and modern psychometric methods. It therefore is a highly crucial and timely addition to the psychological toolkit both in operational and research settings in identifying, managing and responding to the psychological distress engendered by COVID-19.","Pang, Nicholas Tze Ping; Kamu, Assis; Hambali, Nurfarah Lydia Binti; Mun, Ho Chong; Kassim, Mohd Amiruddin; Mohamed, Noor Hassline; Ayu, Friska; Rahim, Syed Sharizman Syed Abdul; Omar, Azizan; Jeffree, Mohd Saffree","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00355-4","20200703","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3380,""

"Implementing an intensive care unit (ICU) diary program at a Large Academic Medical Center: Results from a randomized control trial evaluating psychological morbidity associated with critical illness","BACKGROUND: Psychological morbidity in both patients and family members related to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience is an often overlooked, and potentially persistent, healthcare problem recognized by the Society of Critical Care Medicine as Post-intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). ICU diaries are an intervention increasingly under study with potential to mitigate ICU-related psychological morbidity, including ICU-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. As we encounter a growing number of ICU survivors, in particular in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, clinicians must be equipped to understand the severity and prevalence of significant psychiatric complications of critical illness. METHODS: We compared the efficacy of the ICU diary, prospectively written by third parties during the patient's intensive care course, versus education alone in reducing acute PTSD symptoms after discharge. Patients with an ICU stay greater than 72 h, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated over 24 h, were recruited and randomized to either receive a diary at bedside with psychoeducation or psychoeducation alone. Intervention patients received their ICU diary within the first week of admission into the intensive care unit. Psychometric testing with IES-R, PHQ-8, HADS and GAD-7 was conducted at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after ICU discharge. Change from baseline in these scores, obtained within one week of ICU admission, was assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. RESULTS: From September 26, 2017 to September 25, 2018, our team screened 265 patients from the surgical and medical ICUs at a single large academic urban hospital. 60 patients were enrolled and randomized, of which 35 patients completed post-discharge follow-up (n = 18) in the diary intervention group and (n = 17) in the education-only control group. The control group had a significantly greater decrease in PTSD, hyperarousal, and depression symptoms at week 4 compared to the intervention group. There were no significant differences in other measures, or at other follow-up intervals. Both study groups exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms at all timepoints after ICU discharge. Follow-up phone interviews with patients revealed that while many were interested in getting follow-up for their symptoms, there were many barriers to accessing appropriate therapy and clinical attention. CONCLUSIONS: Results from psychometric testing demonstrate no benefit of ICU diaries versus bedside education-alone in reducing PTSD symptoms related to the intensive care stay. However, our study finds an important gap in care â€“ patients at high risk for PICS are infrequently connected to appropriate follow-up care. Perhaps ICU diaries would prove beneficial if utilized to support the work within a program providing wrap-around services and close psychiatric follow up for PICS patients. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ICU-related PTSD in our cohort of survivors, the high barrier to accessing care for appropriate treatment of PICS, and the consequence of that barrierâ€”prolonged psychological morbidity.

The present study aims to adapt and validate a Japanese-version Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) with a sample of adolescent students from Japan. To this end, the Japanese-version FCV-19S, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A), and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (PVDS) were administered to a sample of Japanese adolescents in schools. The results of statistical analyses revealed that the Japanese-version FCV-19S has a bi-factor model consisting of the emotional response factor and the physiological response factor, with high reliability (emotional: a = .71; physiological: a = .82). Constructive validity was shown by the significant positive correlation between the GAD-7 and emotional (r = .11) and physiological response (r = .25), between PHQ-A and physiological response (r = .19), and between both factors and the PVDS subscale (rs > .16). Taken together, these results indicate that the Japanese-version FCV-19S has a high internal consistency and a moderately good construct validity.","Masuyama, Akihiro; Shinkawa, Hiroki; Kubo, Takahiro","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00368-z","20200713","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3384,""
"Cutting Cubes Out of Fog: The Whole View of Design","Abstract In this article we argue that the field of design evolved to include helping organizations address complex problems in the face of uncertainty, but it has yet to build knowledge in a way that formalizes the various activities embraced by the field. We use our relationship with the school of public health at Harvard to illustrate the advantages of formalizing design knowledge more explicitly. We introduce the Whole View model to provide the field of design with a tentative structure for its knowledge that could make it easier for design and other fields to work together. We situate the model in the context of different types of design education, and show examples of how the Whole View provides a structure for teaching, research, and practice. We conclude by introducing a new agenda for design centered on the well-being of people, organizations, and the natural environment, with health, happiness, and prosperity as the levers driving change.","Whitney, Patrick; Nogueira, AndrÃ©","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sheji.2020.04.001","20200831","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3385,""
"Gambling harm is everybody's business: A public health approach and call to action","There is a growing consensus that gambling is a public health issue and that preventing gambling related harms requires a broad response. Although many policy decisions regarding gambling are made at a national level in the UK, there are clear opportunities to take action at local and regional levels to prevent the negative impacts on individuals, families and local communities. This response goes beyond the statutory roles of licencing authorities to include amongst others the National Health Service (NHS), the third sector, mental health services, homelessness and housing services, financial inclusion support. As evidence continues to emerge to strengthen the link between gambling and a wide range of risk factors and negative consequences, there is also a strong correlation with health inequalities. Because the North of England experiences increasing health inequalities, it offers an opportunity as a specific case study to share learning on reducing gambling-related harms within a geographic area. This article describes an approach to gambling as a public health issue identifying it as needing a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach to be taken at local and regional levels. Challenges at national and local levels require policy makers to adopt a â€˜health in all policyâ€™ approach and use the best evidence in their future decisions to prevent harm. A whole systems approach which aims to reduce poverty and health inequalities needs to incorporate gambling harm within place-based planning and draws on the innovative opportunities that exist to engage local stakeholders, builds local leadership and takes a collaborative approach to tackling gambling-related harms. This whole systems approach includes the following: (1) understanding the prevalence of gambling related harms with insights into the consequences and how individuals, their family and friends and wider community are affected; (2) ensuring tackling gambling harms is a key public health commitment at all levels by including it in strategic plans, with meaningful outcome measures, and communicating this to partners; (3) understanding the assets and resources available in the public, private and voluntary sectors and identifying what actions are underway; (4) raising awareness and sharing data, developing a compelling narrative and involving people who have been harmed and are willing to share their experience; (5) ensuring all regulatory authorities help tackle gambling-related harms under a â€˜whole councilâ€™ approach.","Johnstone, P.; Regan, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.010","20200717","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3386,""
"The digital clinic: Implementing technology and augmenting care for mental health","Increasing both access to and quality of mental healthcare is a global priority. One solution is to integrate technologies such as smartphone apps and sensors directly into care. Acknowledging many prior attempts and barriers, we introduce the Digital Clinic which is an already functioning clinic using smartphone apps to augment and extend care today at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, Massachusetts. In this piece, we outline the theoretical foundation of the Digital Clinic and its emphasis on the therapeutic alliance, measurement-based care, and shared decision making. We explore both workflow and engagement challenges as well as solutions including a new care team member, the Digital Navigator, and the customization of technology. Acknowledging that the Digital Clinic is an evolving program, we offer details on our implementation in order to allow others to replicate, expand on, and improve these initial efforts.","Rodriguez-Villa, Elena; Rauseo-Ricupero, Natali; Camacho, Erica; Wisniewski, Hannah; Keshavan, Matcheri; Torous, John","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.009","20200630","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3387,""
"Effect of state regulatory environments on advanced psychiatric nursing practice()","The first key message in the landmark Future of Nursing report is that â€œNurses should practice to the full extent of their education and trainingâ€ (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Although there has been significant progress across states to remove or diminish barriers to the exercise of full scope of practice by advanced practice registered nurses (APRN), state regulations continue to unnecessarily restrict APRN practice in most of the United States. This article integrates data from studies that examine how state and local regulation affects psychiatric mental health APRN practice with the literature on how state scope of practice regulation affects the size and distribution of the broader APRN workforce, access to care, health care costs and prices, and innovation in health care service delivery. Common themes include confusion about regulatory requirements and mixed experiences of mandated physician supervision.","Phoenix, Bethany J.; Chapman, Susan A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2020.07.001","20200709","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3388,""
"Circulating endocannabinoid concentrations in grieving adults","Bereavement is one of the most intense, distressing, and traumatic events an elderly person will experience. The symptom responses to bereavement vary, particularly during the first year. However, the neurobiology underlying the symptom variance in grief is poorly understood. The endocannabinoid signaling (ECS) system is stress-responsive; mounting evidence implicates abnormalities in the central ECS system could contribute to psychopathology. The current study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the ECS is abnormal in grief, using circulating eCB concentrations as a biomarker of central ECS. A predominantly older sample of grief participants, within 13 months following the death of a loved one, and healthy comparison (HC) participants were studied. Associations of circulating eCBs with symptom variance in grievers were also examined. A total of 61 (grief: n = 44; HC: n = 17) adults completed cross-sectional clinical assessments and a fasting blood draw. Assessments included the Inventory of Complicated Grief scale; the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; and the Hamilton Anxiety scale. Serum eCB concentrations (i.e., N-arachidonoylethanolamine [AEA] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) were quantified using isotope dilution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Relative to HC participants, grievers had significantly elevated serum AEA but similar 2-AG concentrations. In grievers, serum AEA concentrations were positively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, but only in those with low grief symptoms. These novel findings indicate that elevated circulating eCB concentrations are found following bereavement. The eCB signaling response varies based on the degree of grief severity. Circulating eCB measures may have the potential to serve as biomarkers of prolonged grief disorder.","Harfmann, Elisabeth J.; McAuliffe, Timothy L.; Larson, Eric R.; Claesges, Stacy A.; Sauber, Garrett; Hillard, Cecilia J.; Goveas, Joseph S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104801","20200710","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3389,""
"Mental Health Crises in Rural and Remote Australia: An Assessment of Direct Medical Costs of Air Medical Retrievals and the Implications for the Societal Burden","OBJECTIVE: Adequate mental health service provision in rural and remote Australian communities is problematic because of the tyranny of distance. The Royal Flying Doctor Service provides air medical retrieval for people in rural and remote areas. The economic impact on both the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the public hospital system for mental healthâ€“related air medical retrievals is unknown. We aimed to estimate the direct medical costs associated with air medical retrievals and subsequent hospitalizations for mental and behavioral disorders for the 2017 calendar year. METHODS: All patients with a primary working diagnosis of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Version, Australian Modification F00 to F99 (mental and behavioral disorders) who underwent an air medical retrieval were included in this cost analysis. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Edition, Australian Modification codes were mapped to Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Group codes, with hospital costs applied from the National Hospital Cost Data Collection (2016/2017). All costs are reported in 2017 Australian dollars (AUDs). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two primary evacuations and 926 interhospital transfers occurred with an in-flight diagnosis of F00 to F99, most commonly psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and schizotypal disorders. The total direct medical costs were estimated to be AUD $20,070,527. Costs for primary evacuations accounted for 13% (AUD $2,611,260), with the majority of this associated with the subsequent hospital admission (AUD $1,770,139). Similarly, the majority of the costs associated with interhospital transfers (total costs = AUD $17,459,267) were also related to hospital costs (AUD $13,569,187). CONCLUSION: Direct medical costs associated with air medical retrievals for people experiencing a mental health crisis are substantial. The majority of costs are associated with hospital admission and treatment; however, the indirect (loss of productivity) and intangible (quality of life) costs are likely to be far greater.","Gardiner, Fergus W.; de Graaff, Barbara; Bishop, Lara; Campbell, Julie A; Mealing, Susan; Coleman, Mathew","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amj.2020.06.010","20200715","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3390,""
"El impacto de la Gran RecesiÃ³n en la salud mental en EspaÃ±a","The objective of this article is to identify the effects of the Great Recession on the mental health of people residing in Spain. After presenting a conceptual framework on the mechanisms through which economic crises affect mental health, we describe the main results of 45 papers identified in our search. Studies indicate a worsening of mental health in Spain in the years of economic crisis, especially in men. Working conditions (unemployment, low wages, instability, precariousness) emerge as one of the main channels through which mental health is put at risk or deteriorates. This deterioration occurs with intensity in particularly vulnerable groups, such as immigrant population and families with economic burdens. In the case of suicides, the results were inconclusive. Regarding the use of health care services, an increase in the consumption of certain drugs seems to be identified, although the conclusions of all the studies are not coincidental. Social inequalities in mental health do not seem to have remitted. We conclude that Spain needs to improve information systems to a better understanding of the health effects of economic crises. In terms of public policies, together with the reinforcement of health services aimed at addressing mental health problems, an income guarantee network for people in vulnerable situations should be promoted, as well as the development of policies aimed at the labour market.","Oliva, Juan; LÃ³pez-VarcÃ¡rcel, Beatriz GonzÃ¡lez; PÃ©rez, Patricia Barber; PeÃ±a-Longobardo, Luz MarÃ­a; Garrido, Rosa M.

"Unexpected finding of myocardial depression in 2 healthy young patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: possible support for COVID-19-related myocarditis","COVID-19 is proving to be a devastating pandemic with both tragic economic and health consequences worldwide. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) of the lungs has been thrust into the forefront of resources that could be used in the management of COVID-19 acute care patients. However, relatively little attention has been paid to POCUS utility in assessing the heart in COVID-19 patients. Anecdotal reports suggest encounters of likely COVID-19 induced pericardial effusions and myocardial electrical dysfunction. This article presents 2 cases of generally healthy patients who were noted to have classic COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia findings on lung ultrasound and incidentally discovered to have unsuspected left ventricular dysfunction likely resulting from myocarditis. POCUS videos are presented as illustrations of this potentially overlooked complication.","Blaivas, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12098","20200613","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3392,""
"A reformulated contextual model of psychotherapy for treating anxiety and depression","This paper describes a reformulated contextual model that uses cognitive theory (dual process theory), motivation theory (personality) and behavioral adaptation (self-correcting control systems) to show how anxiety and depression are caused, treated and prevented by an interaction between people and contexts. Depression and anxiety are the result of implicit beliefs (not cognitions) that all experience is unrewarding and threatening, these being components of the implicit belief that life is bad. Implicit beliefs are formed automatically from contextual cues and in healthy individuals are consistent with rational appraisal. They become more negative than reality through a process of adaptation when behaviors, directed by rational thinking, repeatedly create cues that signify lack of reward or threat. Such behaviors occur when social or other obligations lead people to choose behaviors that fail to satisfy their own unique goals in life and approach threatening situations, contrary to their automatic reactions. Therapeutic interventions and lifestyle change reverse these adaptive processes by positive experiences that create positive implicit beliefs, a change effected in different ways by contextual and specific mechanisms both of which correct the same fault of negative implicit beliefs. Effective therapeutic relationships and interventions are achieved by detecting and responding to a patient's unique needs and goals and their associated implicit beliefs. Mental health requires not only that people experience life as good as defined by their own goals and beliefs but also the avoidance of contexts where social and other pressures induce people to behave in ways inconsistent with their automatically generated feelings.","Hyland, Michael E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2020.101890","20200711","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3393,""
"Evaluation of botanical powders and extracts from Nigerian plants as protectants of maize grains against maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky) [oleoptera: Curculionidae]","Toxicities of leaf powders and extracts of Acanthus montanus, Acanthospermum hispidum, Alchornea laxiflora and Argyreia nervosa against maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) were evaluated. Powders were tested at dose 3.0g/20g while extracts were tested at concentration 3%/20g of maize grains. Mortality, oviposition, and adult emergence rates as well as weight loss, seeds damage and weevil perforation index (WPI) were evaluated. Phytochemical constituents of the experimental plants were also carried out. The results showed that Acanthus montanus powder was the most potent with 65% adult mortality after 24 h of treatment. This is followed by Argyreia nervosa powder that evoked 52.5% weevil mortality. The least toxic to S. zeamais was Acanthospermum hispidum powder with 32.5% adult mortality. Extracts were more toxic than the powders of the tested plants. Acanthus montanus extract was the most toxic since it promoted 80% adult mortality after 24 h of treatment. Acanthus montanus, Alchornea laxiflora and Argyreia nervosa leaf powders and extracts completely prevented oviposition by adult insect, adult emergence, weight loss and seeds damaged. The phytochemicals present in Acanthus montanus were alkaloids (3.67 mg/g), saponin (3.33 mg/g), tannin (3.00 mg/g) and flavonoid (2.67 mg/g) contents. Acanthospermum hispidum had the least alkaloid (2.67 mg/g), saponin (1.67 mg/g), tannin (1.33 mg/g) and flavonoid (1.00 mg/g) contents. Acanthus montanus, Argyreia nervosa, Alchornea laxiflora and Acanthospermum hispidum were efficacious against S. zeamais instead of synthetic chemical insecticides that have environmental health hazards and they can be used in integrated pest management by farmers and foods merchants.","Ileke, Kayode David; Idoko, Joy Ejemin; Ojo, Durojaye Olanrewaju; Adesina, Bukola Christianah","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.101702","20200709","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3394,""
"Psychometric Testing of Three COVID-19-Related Scales Among People with Mental Illness","Fear of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may result in psychological health problems among different populations. Moreover, believing COVID-19 information and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors are relevant constructs associated with fear of COVID-19. Therefore, the present study validated three instruments assessing fear, beliefs, and preventive behaviors related to COVID-19 among individuals with mental illness. Moreover, relationships between the three constructs were examined. Individuals with mental illness (N = 400; 178 females; mean age = 46.91 years) completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Believing COVID-19 Information Scale (BCIS), Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale (PCIBS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The FCV-19S, BCIS, and PCIBS demonstrated a single-factor structure with satisfactory fit indices. Moreover, believing COVID-19 information positively and significantly associated with fear of COVID-19, and fear of COVID-19 negatively and significantly associated with preventive behaviors and positively and significantly associated with psychological distress. The FCV-19S, BCIS, and PCIBS may assist healthcare providers in assessing COVID-19-related information among individuals with mental illness. Consequently, relevant programs may be designed to help individuals with mental illness going through the period of crisis.","Chang, Kun-Chia; Hou, Wen-Li; Pakpour, Amir H.; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00361-6","20200711","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-24","",3395,""
