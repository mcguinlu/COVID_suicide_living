"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the poor: insights from the Hrishipara diaries","In this paper, we examine the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of the poor. We use an unusually rich data set from a 'financial diaries' study known as the Hrishipara Daily Diaries Project. The data set tracks the economic and financial transactions of 60 individuals and their families in a semi-rural setting in Bangladesh on a real-time basis from October 2019 to September 2020. We document individual diarists' behavioural responses to COVID-19, which reveal the varied experiences of the poor during the pandemic. We find that the pandemic and associated government lockdowns had significant negative effects on the livelihoods of the poor in our study, with financial inflows and outflows, incomes, and household expenditures below pre-pandemic levels during the pandemic period. To cope with the pandemic, households drew down on their cash reserves at home, as well as cutting down on non-food expenditures to protect their spending on food.","Ronkko, R.; Rutherford, S.; Kunal, Sen","https://doi.org/10.35188/UNU-WIDER/2021/984-6","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: WIDER Working Papers 2021.

"Avoid Zoom Fatigue, Be Present and Learn","This paper explores plausible reasons why some students report having more difficulty learning online, predominantly in Zoom synchronous classes, and suggests strategies that students can do to optimize their learning. During anonymous classroom observations, approximately 80% of 350 college students polled indicated it was harder to focus their attention and stay present while taking classes online. They also reported experiencing more isolation, anxiety, and depression compared to face-to-face classes, although much of this may be due to COVID-19 social isolation. Students often appear nonresponsive when attending online synchronous Zoom classes that negatively impacts the nonverbal dynamics of studentâ€“instructor interactions. Communication issues includes internet challenges, lack of facial expressions, body appearance, and movement. Students also report that it is more challenging to maintain attention, especially when they are multitasking. Suggested strategies are to optimize learning that includes arranging the camera so that you are visible, using active facial and body responses as if you are communicating to just one person face-to-face, configuring your body and environment (sitting upright and creating unique cues for each specific task), reducing multitasking and notifications, and optimizing arousal and vision regeneration.","Peper, Erik, Wilson, Vietta, Martin, Marc, Rosegard, Erik, Harvey, Richard","https://doi.org/10.15540/nr.8.1.47","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: NeuroRegulation; 8(1):47, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35938,""
"From Isolation to Connection: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Older Adultsâ€™ Social Participation Using the COV19-QoL Scale","Background: Social isolation during COVID-19 has the capacity to impact older adultsâ€™ physical health, mental health, and quality of life. Using an occupational therapy perspective of social participation as an occupation, the current study explores (a) the extent to which social participation (habits/routines) has changed following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, (b) differences in perceptions of social participation in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, and (c) differences in scores on the COVID-19 Quality of Life (COV19-QoL) scale by demographics, access to health care, and lifestyle routine. Method: Community-dwelling adults (N = 230) 65 years of age or older completed an online survey providing demographic data to identify changes in social participation habits, routines, and perceptions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and the COV19-QoL scale. Results: Analyses revealed significant differences in reported routines, perceptions, and COV19-QoL scores across various demographic groups. Conclusion: This study identified a significant shift in social participation and a need for increased consideration of performance skills, education, and improved quality of social opportunities. Limited representation in the sample and the use of novel instruments indicate a need for further study.","Melei, Kathleen, Linder, Jill","https://doi.org/10.15453/2168-6408.1929","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Open Journal of Occupational Therapy; 10(3):1-17, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35939,""
"Occupational Therapists and COVID-19 Pandemic: An Observational Survey in Europe","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a health care emergency in Europe since the first wave in 2020. Several challenges have arisen for occupational therapists, as well as all the health care professionals. The aim of this study was to determine what occupational therapists have changed to adapt their therapeutic processes for this catastrophic situation. Method: An online survey was developed and sent in conjunction with the Council of Occupational Therapy for European Countries (COTEC) to European national associations of occupational therapists. Results: The study was based on a sample of 65 occupational therapists who worked with people with COVID-19. More than half of the occupational therapists (54.8%) had changed departments. The main needs patients expressed (n = 136) during hospitalization were to have social contacts (30.9%), and the main clinical complaints (n = 144) were motor impairment and fatigue (35.4%) and depression (25.7%). The most frequently reported goal (n = 141) was recovery of physical performance and fatigue management (32.6%). Among the emotions mentioned by occupational therapists, negative emotions (76%) were the most common. Conclusion: European occupational therapists demonstrated flexibility and resilience to deal with clinical and organizational challenges during the COVID-19 emergency.","Pozzi, Christian, Lanzoni, Alessandro, Battain, Pier Carlo, Alvarez, Evelyn, Tobar, Eduardo, Hersche, Ruth, Cavalli, Stefano, MonsÃ², Anna, Llarch, Eva, Bellelli, Giuseppe, Morandi, Alessandro, Graff, Maud","https://doi.org/10.15453/2168-6408.1923","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Open Journal of Occupational Therapy; 10(3):1-12, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35940,""
"Scientific Production on Social Networks during the COVID 19 Pandemic","This research seeks to characterize the global scientific production on social networks during the Covid-19 pandemic between the months of January 2020 to September 2021. A bibliometric study was carried out in five databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Academic, Microsoft Academic and Crossref). Bibliometric indicators were analyzed in a universe of 7889 articles obtained through Publish or Perish v. 7.19 and the same analytical software of the chosen databases. The results indicate that the article with the most citations is ""Students under lockdown: Comparisons of students' social networks and mental health before and during the COVID-19 crisis in Switzerland"". The author with the most scientific production on the subject of social networks is J. Wu. Regarding the journal with the largest number of articles on the subject, IEE Access stands out, a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. While the United States stands as the country with the highest production of articles on social networks. It is concluded that scientific production was mainly directed to the study of the behavior of social networks during the pandemic. This increase generates an attractive phenomenon for researchers, who wish to evaluate and document totally new events for society.

"Studentsâ€™ Experiences of E-learning Practices During COVID-19: A Qualitative Study","COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted schooling globally. Affecting millions of students, the conventional face-to-face (F2F) education system has been replaced by e-learning overnight. As the advantages, disadvantages, and technical challenges of this abrupt transformation were already well-documented, this study aimed to intensely scrutinize university students' experiences of e-learning practices in this new normal situation. Methods: Adopting the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), a smaller sample of respondents (N=25) was observed to gain deeper insights using semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed and interpreted through thematic analysis. Findings revealed that most of the students have had unfavorable experiences with e-learning. The majority of students feel that e-learning has ruined their social relationships by isolating them from their peers and instructors. A significant number of students were observed to be anxious about their future due to unstable financial status, poor learning outcomes, and unfair evaluation processes. Moreover, poor self-esteem, anxiety, and depressive symptoms have been observed among a significant portion of the students. The overall findings of this study are meant to assist stakeholders in taking the necessary steps to address the aforementioned issues and ensure an improved learning experience, particularly in an e-learning environment.","Md Fouad Hossain, Sarker, Maruf Ahmed, Tamal, Niaz Ahmed, Khan, Islam, Md Kabirul, Akber, Mohammad Faisal, Khan, Samiha","https://doi.org/10.3991/ijet.v17i14.30393","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (Online); 17(14):157-171, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35943,""

Resultados: A pesquisa foi aplicada a 645 cirurgiÃµes. A maioria dos entrevistados relatou restriÃ§Ãµes operacionais Ã  realizaÃ§Ã£o de procedimentos e reduÃ§Ã£o da renda, sobretudo nas regiÃµes severamente afetadas pela pandemia. CirurgiÃµes plÃ¡sticos com mais de 10 anos de formaÃ§Ã£o foram os mais prejudicados. Elevada taxa de contaminaÃ§Ã£o, sobrecarga mental, diminuiÃ§Ã£o na prÃ¡tica de atividades fÃ­sicas e uso de medicaÃ§Ãµes psiquiÃ¡tricas tambÃ©m foram relatados. ConclusÃ£o: A pandemia da COVID-19 trouxe mudanÃ§as no cenÃ¡rio pessoal e profissional do cirurgiÃ£o plÃ¡stico brasileiro.

Methods: Effects of the pandemic within the clinical practice of Brazilian plastic surgeons were investigated through an online questionnaire addressed to members of the Sociedade Brasileira de Cirurgia PlÃ¡stica. Results: A survey was applied to 645 surgeons. Most respondents reported operation restrictions on procedures and income reduction, especially in regions severely affected by the pandemic. Plastic surgeons with more than 10 years of experience were the most affected. High contamination rates, mental overload, decreased physical activity, and psychiatric medications have also been reported. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic brought changes to the personal and professional life of the Brazilian plastic surgeon. Due to the significant reduction in the workload, there were financial impacts on specialists from all country regions, besides physical and mental health issues. Adaptations were mandatory to maintain services and explore new areas of activity to supply the low demand for cosmetic surgery during the crisis.","Ribeiro, Renan Diego AmÃ©rico; Carneiro, Igor Castro; Clivatti, Gustavo Moreira; Abbas, Laielly; Monteiro, Gustavo Gomes Ribeiro; Goldenberg, Dov; Gemperli, Rolf","http://www.rbcp.org.br/details/3121/pt-BR/impacto-socioeconomico-da-pandemia-da-covid-19-entre-cirurgioes-plasticos-do-brasil; http://www.rbcp.org.br/details/3121/en-US/socioeconomic-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-among-plastic-surgeons-in-brazil; https://fi-admin.bvsalud.org/document/view/nrypc; https://fi-admin.bvsalud.org/document/view/b8qyg","","Database: COVIDWHO; LILACS; Publication type: article; Publication details: Rev. bras. cir. plÃ¡st;37(2): 143-153, abr.jun.2022. ilus; Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35945,""

"Health Information Technology Use among Chronic Disease Patients: An Analysis of the United States Health Information National Trends Survey","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Chronic disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Health information technology (HIT) tools show promise for improving disease management. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’This study aims to understand the following: (1) how self-perceptions of health compare between those with and without disease; (2) how HIT usage varies between chronic disease profiles (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, depression, cancer, and comorbidities); (3) how HIT trends have changed in the past 6 years; and (4) the likelihood that a given chronic disease patient uses specific HIT tools. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) inclusive of 2014 to 2020 served as the primary data source with statistical analysis completed using Stata. Bivariate analyses and two-tailed <i>t</i>-tests were conducted to compare self-perceived health and HIT usage to chronic disease. Logistic regression models were created to examine the odds of a specific patient using various forms of HIT, controlling for demographics and comorbidities. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Logistic regression models controlling for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities showed that pulmonary disease, depression, and cancer patients had an increased likelihood of using HIT tools, for example, depression patients had an 81.1% increased likelihood of looking up health information (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). In contrast, diabetic, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease patients appeared to use HIT tools at similar rates to patients without chronic disease. Overall HIT usage has increased during the timeframe examined. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’This study demonstrates that certain chronic disease cohorts appear to have greater HIT usage than others. Further analysis should be done to understand what factors influence patients to utilize HIT which may provide additional insights into improving design and user experience for other populations with the goal of improving management of disease. Such analyses could also establish a new baseline to account for differences in HIT usage as a direct consequence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Rajamani, Lindemann, Evans, Pillai, Badlani, Melton","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-1751305","20220811","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35947,""
"Predictive factors for enhanced community mental health vulnerability in this COVID-19 pandemic era","Explore the mental health status and its influencing factors of local community residents under the post-epidemic era of COVID-19 in China. The basic information scale, self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) were used to carry out an online questionnaire survey among community residents in Jiangsu Province, China, and the influencing factors of depression and anxiety were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. A total of 993 residents completed the mental health survey. It was found that the incidence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 37.06% and 22.86%.

"Determinants of adolescents' Health-Related Quality of Life and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","We examined the determinants of adolescents' Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and psychological distress (self-reported and parent-reported) during the COVID-19 pandemic, using a random sample of the population of Geneva, Switzerland. Data was drawn from participants aged 14-17 years, who participated with their families to a serosurvey conducted in November and December 2020. Adolescents' HRQoL was evaluated using the validated adolescent-reported KIDSCREEN-10 and parent-reported KINDLÃ‚Â® scales. Psychological distress was assessed with self-reported sadness and loneliness, and using the KINDLÃ‚Â® emotional well-being scale. Using generalized estimating equations, we examined the role of socio-demographic, family and behavioural characteristics in influencing adolescents' mental health status and wellbeing. Among 240 adolescents, 11% had a low HRQoL, 35% reported sadness and 23% reported loneliness. Based on parents' perception, 12% of the adolescents had a low HRQoL and 16% a low emotional well-being. Being a girl (aOR = 3.20; 95%CI: 1.67-6.16), increased time on social media (aOR = 2.07; 95%CI: 1.08-3.97), parents' average to poor mood (aOR = 2.62; 95%CI: 1.10-6.23) and average to poor household financial situation (aOR = 2.31; IC95%: 1.01-6.10) were associated with an increased risk of sadness. Mismatches between adolescents' and their parents' perception of HRQoL were more likely for girls (aOR = 2.88; 95%CI: 1.54-5.41) and in households with lower family well-being (aOR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.86-0.96). A meaningful proportion of adolescents experienced low well-being during the second wave of COVID-19, and average well-being was lower than pre-pandemic estimates. Adolescents living in underprivileged or distressed families seemed particularly affected. Monitoring is necessary to evaluate the long-term effects of the pandemic on adolescents.","Dumont, Richard, Baysson, Lorthe, Piumatti, Schrempft, Wisniak, Barbe, Posfay-Barbe, Guessous, Stringhini","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272925","20220811","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35949,""
"Telehealth use and COVID-19: Assessing older veterans' perspectives","Video telehealth (VT) technology has increased mental health treatment access for veterans. Although veterans report high levels of satisfaction with VT, age disparities remain. Older adults in the general population face several barriers to using new technology, reflecting a ""digital divide"" between age cohorts. This trend continued during the COVID-19 pandemic, as older veterans were less likely to use VT-and more likely to use the telephone-for mental health visits than younger veterans. Although VT use has grown considerably during the pandemic, few studies have investigated older veterans' VT use relative to telephone services. Older veterans (aged 65 +) who completed at least one telephone or VT visit in an outpatient geriatric mental health clinic during the first 6 months of COVID-19 received a telehealth satisfaction questionnaire via U.S. mail. While respondents (<i>N</i> = 66) reported moderate levels of satisfaction with VT and telephone appointments, there was less interest in using telehealth exclusively postpandemic. Fewer telephone users reported having access to email and internet and greater barriers to using VT. Veteran rurality was not associated with access to internet or email and did not affect telehealth ratings. Analyses of treatment engagement showed that the rate of missed appointments did not change during COVID-19. Post hoc qualitative analysis of open-ended comments revealed themes of barriers and needs, as well as positive and negative telehealth experiences that were consistent with quantitative findings. Despite experiencing barriers to using VT, older veterans identified potential benefits and solutions to enhance participation across the older adult population.

"Childhood adversity and emotion regulation strategies as predictors of psychological stress and mental health in American Indian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Life events, such as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, elicit increases in psychological stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression. In turn, these outcomes have negative implications for mental health. Emotion regulation strategies and prior adversity may moderate the degree to which life events affect outcomes that are linked to mental health. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether childhood adversity and emotion regulation strategy use interactively informed changes in outcomes linked to mental health following the onset of the pandemic in American Indian (AI) adults. AI adults (<i>N</i> = 210) reported levels of childhood adversity, emotion regulation strategy use, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and psychological stress 1 month prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. One month following the declaration of the pandemic, they reported on their stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression once again. The interaction between expressive suppression and childhood adversity predicted changes in psychological stress and symptoms of depression (<i>B</i> = .26, <i>t</i>(198) = 4.43 <i>p</i> &lt; .001, <i>R</i>Ã‚Â² change = .06) and (<i>B</i> = .23 <i>t</i>(199) = 4.14, <i>p</i> &lt; .001, <i>R</i>Ã‚Â² change = .05) respectively. The findings indicate that expressive suppression may be a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy for AI adults who experienced high levels of childhood adversity. This work represents a first step in understanding the role of emotion regulation strategy use in predicting mental health-relevant outcomes in the context of a life event, in a community that is disproportionately affected by chronic mental health conditions.

"A potent virucidal activity of functionalized TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles adsorbed with flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2","The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic withÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°550 millions of cases andÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°6 millions of deaths worldwide. Medical management of COVID-19 relies on supportive care as no specific targeted therapies are available yet. Given its devastating effects on the economy and mental health, it is imperative to develop novel antivirals. An ideal candidate will be an agent that blocks the early events of viral attachment and cell entry, thereby preventing viral infection and spread. This work reports functionalized titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>)-based nanoparticles adsorbed with flavonoids that block SARS-CoV-2 entry and fusion. Using molecular docking analysis, two flavonoids were chosen for their specific binding to critical regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein that interacts with the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. These flavonoids were adsorbed onto TiO<sub>2</sub> functionalized nanoparticles (FTNP). This new nanoparticulate compound was assayed in vitro against two different coronaviruses; HCoV 229E and SARS-CoV-2, in both cases a clear antiviral effect was observed. Furthermore, using a reporter-based cell culture model, a potent antiviral activity is demonstrated. The adsorption of flavonoids to functionalized TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles induces aÃ¢â‚¬â€°~Ã¢â‚¬â€°threefold increase of that activity. These studies also indicate that FTNP interferes with the SARS-CoV-2 spike, impairing the cell fusion mechanism. KEY POINTS/HIGHLIGHTS: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Unique TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles displaying flavonoid showed potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The nanoparticles precisely targeting SARS-CoV-2 were quantitatively verified by cell infectivity in vitro. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Flavonoids on nanoparticles impair the interactions between the spike glycoprotein and ACE-2 receptor.","LeÃƒÂ³n-GutiÃƒÂ©rrez, Elste, Cabello-GutiÃƒÂ©rrez, MillÃƒÂ¡n-Pacheco, MartÃƒÂ­nez-GÃƒÂ³mez, MejÃƒÂ­a-Alvarez, Tiwari, MejÃƒÂ­a","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-022-12112-9","20220811","Flavanone-7-O-glucoside; Hesperetin-7-rutinoside; Nanoparticulate compound; SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35952,""
"Predictors of COVID-related changes in mental health in a South African sample of adolescents and young adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected the lives of young people living in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), leading to poorer short-term mental health outcomes. However, longitudinal data investigating changes in mental health from pre-COVID levels and their predictors are lacking. Our longitudinal sample comprised <i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 233 young people (mean age: 17.8Ã‚Â years at baseline, 55.6% female) living in a deprived neighbourhood near Cape Town, South Africa. Symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and alcohol use (AUDIT) were assessed during two waves of data collection, pre-pandemic (2018/19) and via phone interviews in June to October 2020, during South Africa's first COVID wave and subsequent case decline. Latent change score models were used to investigate predictors of changes in mental health. Controlling for baseline levels, we found increases in depression and anxiety but not alcohol use symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher baseline symptoms were associated with smaller increases on all measures. Socio-economic deprivation (lack of household income, food insecurity) before and during COVID were associated with higher anxiety and depression symptom increases. Having had more positive experiences during COVID was associated with lower post-COVID onset anxiety and depression increases, and marginally with less alcohol use, while negative experiences (household arguments, worries) were linked to stronger symptom increases. Overall, in a sample of young people from an adverse environment in South Africa, we found increased mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic, though higher baseline symptoms did not necessarily predict stronger increases. Several factors pre- and post-COVID onset were identified that could be relevant for determining risk and resilience. In the long term, it will be key to address these structural drivers of well-being and to ensure mental health needs of young people are being met to support SSA countries in building back successfully from COVID-19 and preparing for future shock events.","Haag, Du Toit, Skeen, Steventon Roberts, Chideya, Notholi, Sambudla, Gordon, Sherr, Tomlinson","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2108087","20220811","COVID; Mental health; alcohol use; anxiety; depression; longitudinal; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35953,""
"The prevalence of psychological disorders among cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic A meta-analysis","We aimed to assess the prevalence rate (PR) of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insomnia, distress, and fear of cancer progression/recurrence among patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies that reported the PR of six psychological disorders among cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases, from January 2020 up to 31 January 2022. Meta-analysis results were merged using PR and 95% confidence intervals (CI), and heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using I<sup>2</sup> and Cochran's Q test. Publication bias was examined using funnel plots and Egger's tests. All data analyses were performed using Stata14.0 software. Forty studies with 27,590 participants were included. Pooled results showed that the PR of clinically significant depression, anxiety, PTSD, distress, insomnia, and fear of cancer progression/recurrence among cancer patients were 32.5%, 31.3%, 28.2%, 53.9%, 23.2%, and 67.4%, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with head and neck cancer had the highest PR of clinically significant depression (74.6%) and anxiety (92.3%) symptoms. Stratified analysis revealed that patients with higher education levels had higher levels of clinically significant depression (37.2%). A higher level of clinically significant PTSD was observed in employed patients (47.4%) or female with cancer (27.9%). This meta-analysis evaluated the psychological disorders of cancer patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, it is necessary to develop psychological interventions to improve the mental health of cancer patients during the pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

"Food insecurity during COVID-19: An Australian university experience","The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence, severity, coping strategies and precipitating factors of food insecurity in university students in a large multi-campus Australian university during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, in context of providing information to inform institutional support. This was a cross-sectional analysis which was part of a larger university-led research project, the Thrive@Home study conducted at Monash University during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main outcome measures included: Sociodemographic characteristics, PROMIS anxiety, PROMIS depression and the six-item US Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey Module. All variables were reported according to the four levels of food security status (high (H), marginal (M), low (L) and very low (VL)). Chi-squared tests were used to compare all categorical variables including demographic, mental health and food security status. A multivariable regression was conducted between food security status and mental health variables. Overall, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1315 students were included in the analysis. Of which, 5% were classified as having VL food security, 13% L, 14% M and 68% H. As food security worsened the likelihood of being unemployed looking for work, living alone and deteriorating physical health, diet quality and mental health increased. As food security status deteriorated the prevalence of needing to ask family or friends for food, shopping at multiple outlets for discounts, accessing emergency food relief, subsidised meals and financial assistance from organisations increased (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). In regression models adjusting for covariates, depression (b (95%CI): VLÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.2(4.1-10.3), LÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.7(1.7-5.7), MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.0(0.1-3.8)) and anxiety (VLÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.4(4.5-10.4), LÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.5(1.5-5.4) and MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.0(0.3-3.8)) were positively associated with worsening food security.

"Impact of the restrictions on community activities policy during the COVID-19 on psychological health in Indonesia's urban and rural residents: A cross-sectional study","Although extensive research has been conducted on the psychological impact after exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic, very few studies simultaneously investigated the negative and positive impacts on urban and rural residents. This study aims to compare the extent of psychological impact on Indonesian living in urban and rural areas a year after the first case of COVID-19 was reported. We employed a cross-sectional study design. A total of 428 participants completed a set of web-based questionnaires from February to March 2021, consisting of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Perceived Social-Support (PSS), the mental health-related lifestyle (MHLS), and 6-item negative impacts, and the Jenkins' Sleep Scale (JSS). Over 40% of the participants reported moderate to severe trauma-related distress; 30%-40% increased stress at work, home, and financial stress, and 50% more social support gained from their family and friends. Although 62.1% of participants paid more attention to their mental health, only 30% engaged in a healthier lifestyle, and 36.7% had sleep problems. No significant differences were found between urban and rural residents on psychological impact, changes in mental health and related lifestyles, and sleep quality. Urban residents perceived more negative impacts, in parallel with increased social support, compared to rural residents. We also found a significant correlation between psychological impact, sleep disturbance, and increased social support. However, there was no significant association between mental health-related lifestyles and other scales. This is among the first studies that examine the urban-rural disparity on the positive and negative impact of the COVID-19 in the later stage of the pandemic. Our findings offer insights to provide equal effort to mitigate the negative impacts of the COVID-19 crisis as well as promote healthy lifestyle behaviors in both urban and rural residencies.","Desdiani, Sutarto","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.725","20220811","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; Indonesia; mental health; psychological impact; rural; urban","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35956,""
"Thyroid Function During and After COVID-19 Infection: A Review","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to multiorgan dysfunction through pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Infection also affects the thyroid gland directly via cytopathological effects of the virus or indirectly through cytokines, complement systems and coagulation mechanisms. The thyroid gland regulates innate and adaptive immune systems by genomic and nongenomic pathways. During or after SARS-CoV-2 infection, Graves' disease and subacute thyroiditis might be triggered resulting in hyperthyroidism; alternatively, the effect of the virus on the hypophyseal.hypothalamic axis might cause central hypothyroidism. Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with hypoxia, which requires the use of dexamethasone. This can depress basal serum concentrations of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine. Thyroid function should be monitored when using dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19.

"Predictors of professional burnout and fulfilment in a longitudinal analysis on nurses and healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic","(1) To investigate the vulnerability of nurses to experiencing professional burnout and low fulfilment across 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) To identify modifiable variables in hospital leadership and individual vulnerabilities that may mitigate these effects. Nurses were at increased risk for burnout and low fulfilment prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospital leadership factors such as organisational structure and open communication and consideration of employee opinions are known to have positive impacts on work attitudes. Personal risk factors for burnout include symptoms of depression and anxiety. Healthcare workers (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 406 at baseline, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 234 longitudinal), including doctors (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 102), nurses (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 94), technicians (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 90) and non-clinical administrative staff (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 120), completed 5 online questionnaires, once per month, for 5Ã‚Â months. Participants completed self-report questionnaires on professional fulfilment and burnout, perceptions of healthcare leadership, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Participants were recruited from various healthcare settings in the southeastern United States. The STROBE checklist was used to report the present study. Both at baseline and across the 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic reported increased burnout and decreased fulfilment relative to doctors. For all participants, burnout remained largely steady and fulfilment decreased slightly. The strongest predictors of both burnout and fulfilment were organisational structure and depressive symptoms. Leadership consideration and anxiety symptoms had smaller, yet significant, relationships to burnout and fulfilment in longitudinal analyses. Burnout and reduced fulfilment remain a problem for healthcare workers, especially nurses. Leadership styles and employee symptoms of depression and anxiety are appropriate targets for intervention. Leadership wishing to reduce burnout and increase fulfilment among employees should increase levels of organisational support and consideration and expand supports to employees seeking treatment for depression and anxiety.","Guastello, Brunson, Sambuco, Dale, Tracy, Allen, Mathews","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16463","20220811","anxiety; burnout; depression; health personnel; hospital administration; leadership; nurses; patient health questionnaire; psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35958,""
"Mental health in Italy after two years of COVID-19 from the perspective of 1281 Italian physicians: looking back to plan forward","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated an unprecedented global crisis that is profoundly affecting mental health and mental health care. The aim of this study was to survey a relatively large group of Italian physicians about their perceived impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the Italian population and about their suggestions on the best strategies to address the current and future challenges. One thousand two hundred eighty-one (1,281) physicians were surveyed between November 2021 and February 2022. Eighty-one percent of respondents reported an increase in the number of people with mental illness presenting to their practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty-four percent reported a 26-50% increase in the number of people with mental illness in their community; approximately 33% reported a 1-25% increase; and 26.9% reported a 51-75% increase. The most commonly reported mental issues that increased because of COVID-19 were agitation, mood and anxiety disorders. Regarding the suggested strategies to address future challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, 34.6% of respondents recommended providing psychoeducation to the general population for early detection of mental illness and developing strategies to reduce the impact of COVID-19-related stress. In addition, 12.6% of respondents suggested improving telehealth services, while 12.3% suggested the need for increased funding for community-based care. When asked about physicians' opinion on the possibility of an increased prevalence of mental illness in the next 12Ã‚Â months, more than 30%Ã‚Â of them predicted an increase in stress-related illnesses, while 25.2% were more concerned about a worsening of the ongoing clinical conditions of patients with previous psychiatric disorders. However, 21% of respondents believed that people's ability to cope with the pandemic would increase in the next 12Ã‚Â months. This study confirmed a strong and negative impact on the mental health of the past 2Ã‚Â years of COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian population. Providing psychoeducation to the general population and improving the availability of telemedicine services could reduce the impact of future challenges related to the pandemic.","Cuomo, Amore, Arezzo, De Filippis, De Rose, La Pia, Pirani, Torta, Fagiolini","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-022-00410-5","20220810","Agitation; Anxiety; COVID-19; Mental health; Physician","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35959,""
"The positive impact of a care-physical activity initiative for people with a low socioeconomic status on health, quality of life and societal participation: a mixed-methods study","Overweight and obesity rates are increasing worldwide, particularly among people with a low socioeconomic status (SES). Care-physical activity (care-PA) initiatives may improve participants' lifestyles and thereby lower overweight and obesity rates. A two-year care-PA initiative specifically developed for citizens with a low SES, X-Fittt 2.0, was offered free of charge to participants, and included 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of intensive guidance and sports sessions, and 21Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of aftercare. Here, we study the impact of X-Fittt 2.0 on health, quality of life (QoL) and societal participation using a mixed-methods design. Questionnaires and body measurements were taken from 208 participants at the start of X-Fittt 2.0 (t<sub>0</sub>) and after 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks (t<sub>1</sub>), one year (t<sub>2</sub>) and two to three years (t<sub>3</sub>). We also held 17 group discussions (t<sub>1</sub>, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°71) and 68 semi-structured interviews (t<sub>2</sub> and t<sub>3</sub>). Continuous variables were analysed using a linear mixed-model analysis (corrected for gender, age at t<sub>0</sub>, height, education level and employment status at the different time points), while we used descriptive statistics for the categorical variables. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic analysis. Body weight was significantly lower at all three post-initiative time points compared with the baseline, with a maximum of 3.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°kg difference at t<sub>2</sub>. Body Mass Index, waist circumference, blood pressure and self-perceived health only significantly improved during the first 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. A positive trend regarding paid work was observed, while social visits decreased. The latter might be explained by the COVID-19 pandemic, as lockdowns limited social life. Furthermore, participants reported increased PA (including sports) and a few stopped smoking or drinking alcohol. Participants mentioned feeling healthier, fitter and more energetic. Additionally, participants' self-esteem and stress levels improved, stimulating them to become more socially active. However, the participants also mentioned barriers to being physically active, such as a lack of money or time, or physical or mental health problems.

"Adverse childhood experiences are associated with a higher risk for increased depressive symptoms during Covid-19 pandemic - a cross-sectional study in Germany","Covid-19 pandemic has been profoundly affecting people around the world. While contact restrictions, school closures and economic shutdown were effective to reduce infection rates, these measures go along with high stress for many individuals. Persons who have experienced adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have an increased risk for mental health problems already under normal conditions. As ACEs can be associated with a higher vulnerability to stress we aimed to assess the role of ACEs on depressive symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic. In a cross-sectional online survey, 1399 participants above the age of 18Ã‚Â years were included during the first lockdown in Germany. Via two-way repeated measures ANOVA, differences in depressive symptoms before (retrospectively assessed) and during the pandemic were analyzed. Linear regression analyses were performed in order to identify predictors for increase of depressive symptoms. Compared to prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, depressive symptoms increased among all participants. Participants with ACEs and income loss reported about a stronger increase of depressive symptoms. Other predictors for increased depressive symptoms were young age and a lack of social support. Based on these results, ACEs are a significant predictor for an increase in depressive symptoms during the pandemic, indicating that personss with ACEs may be a risk group for mental health problems during the current and potential later pandemics. These findings underline the relevance of support for persons who have experienced ACEs and may help to provide more targeted support in possible scenarios due to the current or possible other pandemics. Besides, economic stability seems to be of prior importance for mental health.","Clemens, KÃƒÂ¶hler-Dauner, Keller, Ziegenhain, Fegert","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04177-7","20220810","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs); CoVid-19; Depression; Pandemic; Public mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35961,""
"Psychological Distress and Coping among Pregnant Women during the COVID 19 Pandemic","Mental health of pregnant individuals has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective coping strategies are found to be associated with better psychological wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of the present study is to assess psychological distress and coping among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted from May 2020 to July 2020 among 115 pregnant women attending obstetric unit of a tertiary care centre using convenience sampling technique. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee of the Institute. Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index and Brief COPE inventory was used to collect the data. Data entry was done in Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and analysed in SPSS version 16. Psychological distress was found in 2.6% of the participants. Psychological distress was significantly associated with occupation, fear of ANC visit, fear of visit to hospital for other health problems and fear of being alone or without help around delivery. Emotion focused coping was the most commonly used coping strategies among the pregnant women with the mean score of 21.37Ã‚Â±3.130. Psychological distress and over all coping strategies had a positive correlation (&lt;0.001). Psychological distress was found to be low among the pregnant women in this study. Fear of being without help and fear of contacting the virus during the visit to the hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic were the likely reasons of the psychological distress in the pregnant women.","Rimal, Thapa, Shrestha","https://doi.org/10.33314/jnhrc.v20i01.4063","20220811","Coping; pregnancy;Psychological distress.; Adaptation, Psychological; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Nepal; Pandemics; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Psychological Distress; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35962,""

Lockdown"" is adopted in many countries of the world. It has also been seen that COVID-19 has led not only to an increase of infection and death but also vast change in the lifestyles of every individual especially in young adults causing various mental health issues. However, in Nepal, there are limited studies to address this issue. The main objective of this study is to generate evidence on the prevalence of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression among young adults and the factors contributing to these outcomes in Nepal. Cross-sectional methods were employed using an online structured questionnaire in January 2021, among 1229 participants. Three logistic regression models were performed to examine the significant COVID-19 factors. The prevalence of Depression, Anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder related symptoms in this study were 255(20.4%), 240(19.2%)and 162(13.2%) respectively relate.COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-related stress and exposure was significantly related to depression. Similarly, COVID-19 diagnosis, change in income during COVID-19, being exposed to 4 or more exposure factors had high chances of getting anxiety. Also, income change during COVID-19 and stressors during COVID-19 were related to post-traumatic stress disorder. This research shows that various COVID-19 related factors have contributed to the high prevalence of these outcomes.","Sharma, Qian, Acharya, Kunwar","https://doi.org/10.33314/jnhrc.v20i01.3922","20220811","Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; Nepal; post-traumatic stress disorder.; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Nepal; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-12","",35963,""
