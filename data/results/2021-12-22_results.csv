"Orthostatic intolerance in adults with long COVID was not associated with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome","In this observational cross-sectional study, we investigated predictors of orthostatic intolerance (OI) in adults with long COVID. Participants underwent a 3-minute active stand (AS) with Finapres NOVA, followed by a 10-minute unmedicated 70-degree head-up tilt test. 85 participants were included (mean age 46 years, range 25-78; 74% women), of which 56 (66%) reported OI during AS (OIAS). OIAS seemed associated with female sex, more fatigue and depressive symptoms, and greater inability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), as well as a higher heart rate (HR) at the lowest systolic blood pressure (SBP) point before the 1st minute post-stand (mean HRnadir: 88 vs 75 bpm, P=0.004). In a regression model also including age, sex, fatigue, depression, ADL inability, and peak HR after the nadir SBP, HRnadir was the only OIAS predictor (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18, P=0.027). 22 participants had initial (iOH) and 5 classical (cOH) orthostatic hypotension, but neither correlated with OIAS. 71 participants proceeded to tilt, of which 28 had OI during tilt (OItilt). Of the 53 who had a 10-minute tilt, 7 (13%) fulfilled hemodynamic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) criteria, but 6 did not report OItilt. OIAS was associated with a higher initial HR on AS, which after 1 minute equalized with the non-OIAS group. Despite these initial orthostatic HR differences, POTS was infrequent and largely asymptomatic.

"The Place of Fluvoxamine in the Treatment of Non-critically ill Patients with COVID-19: A Living Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Background: Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that is known to be used as antidepressant. Repurposing of Fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19 is theorized to help in the prevention of the clinical deterioration of SARS CoV-2 patients. In our systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug under study in terms of its effect on the mortality and the risk of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: We performed a systematic search of seven electronic databases. The search results were screened based on the previously determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We determined the data related to our objectives. The mortality rates, rates of hospitalization, risk of mechanical ventilation and serious side effects were extracted from the studies that successfully met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, the extracted data from the included studies was included in the meta-analysis. Results: Three studies, two randomized clinical trials and one observational cohort study, with 1762 patients, were the final outcome of our search and screening processes. Among all participants, 886 patients received Fluvoxamine while 876 were controls. Follow up periods ranged from 7 days to 28 days. There was no significant difference in the intention-to-treat mortality rates between the two groups (RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.36 - 1.21, p-value = 0.18; I2 = 0%). However, Fluvoxamine decreased the per-protocol mortality compared to both placebo alone or placebo/standard care (RR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01 - 0.64, p-value = 0.02; I2 = 0% and RR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01 - 0.72, respectively). As compared to placebo or standard care, the all-cause hospitalization was significantly reduced in the fluvoxamine group (RR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54 - 0.93, p-value = 0.01; I2 = 61%). This risk reduction was not significant when compared to placebo alone (RR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.57 - 1.00; p-value = 0.051; I2 = 48%). Furthermore, the risk of mechanical ventilation was not improved in the fluvoxamine group as compared to placebo (RR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.16, p-value = 0.17; I2 = 0%). The serious adverse effects were almost the same in the treatment group and the control (13% and 12% respectively). Conclusion: Fluvoxamine does not significantly reduce the mortality rates or the risk of mechanical ventilation in SARS CoV-2 patients. Nonetheless, it was found to have a good impact on reducing all cause hospitalization among patients with COVID-19 disease. Therefore, further clinical studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of the drug and its mechanisms of action.","Salah Eddine Oussama Kacimi; Elona Greca; Mohamed Amine Haireche; Ahmed Sallam ElHawary; Mounir Ould Setti; Rebecca Caruana; Sahar Rizwan; Hidayet Benyettou; Mohammad Yasir Essar; Jaffer Shah; Sherief Ghozy","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.19.21268044","20211221","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24166,""
"Mindfulness predicts less depression, anxiety, and social impairment in emergency care personnel: A longitudinal study","Medical personnel working in emergency rooms (ER) are at increased risk of mental health problems and suicidality. There is increasing evidence that mindfulness-based interventions can improve burnout and other mental health outcomes in health care providers. In contrast, few longitudinal prospective studies have examined protective functions of dispositional mindfulness in this population. The objective of this study was to examine whether mindfulness prospectively predicts anxiety, depression, and social impairment in a sample of emergency care professionals. The authors administered online surveys to ER personnel prior to work in ER, and at 3 and 6 months follow up. Participants were 190 ER personnel (73% residents, 16% medical students, 11% nurses). Linear mixed effects regression was used to model longitudinal 3-month and 6-month follow up of depression, anxiety, and social impairment. Predictors included time-varying contemporaneous work stressors, perceived social support at work and life events, and baseline dispositional mindfulness, demographics, and workplace characteristics. Mindfulness indexed when starting ER work predicted less depression, anxiety, and social impairment 6 months later. Mindfulness remained a strong predictor of mental health outcomes after controlling for time-varying stressful events in emergency care, negative life events, and social support at work. Mindfulness moderated the adverse impact of poor social support at work on depression. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to show that mindfulness prospectively and robustly predicts anxiety, depression, and social impairment. Results support the role of mindfulness as a potential resilience factor in at-risk health care providers.","Westphal, Maren, Wall, Melanie, Corbeil, Thomas, Keller, Dagmar I.; Brodmann-Maeder, Monika, Ehlert, Ulrike, Exadaktylos, Aristomenis, Bingisser, Roland, Kleim, Birgit","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260208","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: PLoS One; 16(12), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24167,""

"The Children's Mental Health Crisis and Pediatric Mental Health Care Programs: An option for expanded treatment options","Over the past 18 months, children's mental health professionals have warned of the building level of crisis among our nations' youth. Recently, The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), and Children's Hospital Association (CHA) declared a national emergency in children's mental health, citing the serious toll of the COVID-19 pandemic and the struggle for racial justice (AAP news, 2021). In the first half of this year, children's hospitals reported a 45% spike in reported cases of self-injury and suicide among children 5â€“17 years compared to 2019, per the CHA. An estimated 140,000 children lost a caregiver to the virus as of this summer, per the National Institutes of Health, which translates to one in 500 children. During a recent grand rounds held in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University, the speaker noted that the crisis is not limited to the United States, global estimates are that pediatric anxiety and depression have doubled during the past year (Dwyer, 2021). These estimates are not likely to be a surprise to those working with children and adolescents during this particularly challenging time. We have watched with dismay as the level of need has steadily increased to crisis proportions, after months of concern about the effect of isolation, loss, and stress on a nation of children.

"Neglected psychological interventions among patients with COVID-19","This article aims to determine which group of patients with COVID-19 needs more psychological interventions. Participants were patients diagnosed with COVID-19 that were referred to Ziaeian Hospital in Tehran, Iran. The mental status of these patients were assessed using assessment and evaluation tools based on DSM-5 model and DASS21 questionnaire. A total of 61 COVID-19 patients participated, where 23 were admitted to the hospital while 38 were in home quarantine according to specialists' order. Evidence showed that patients in quarantine had acute and morbid stress at a rate of 7.7%, while no acute stress was observed in hospitalized patients. Severe anxiety scores were reported to be 8.2% among home quarantine patients, but the rate of anxiety in hospitalized patients was 0%. It should be noted that hospitalized patients were nervous to both the anxiety and stress scales, but both factors were reported at a mild level. In the depression factor, 1 quarantine patient was reported to have severe depression, while none of the hospitalized patients had severe depression. Results showed that the home-quarantined patients reported more stress, acute anxiety, and severe depression than hospitalized patients due to lack of access to treatment staff and lack of continuous treatment interventions. These factors can lead to panic attacks in patients.","Sotoudeh, H. G.; Alavi, S.

"A literature review looking at the barriers to accessing child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS);a professionals perspective","BackgroundMental health problems are prevalent in children and young people (CYP). Children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD have co-morbid mental health difficulties which add to the challenges they face. COVID-19 has likely contributed to the mental health and wellbeing of CYP but many children with mental health disorders do not have access to any mental health-related services. Due to adverse effects that ill-timed treatments bring, it is important to identify barriers exist in accessing services and implement appropriate strategies. To date, there has been little focus on professionalâ€™s viewpoint as to why these barriers exist and they are in a position to comment upon potential system flaws.AimsThis narrative review aims to review the current literature looking at the global barriers and facilitators in accessing Child and Adolescent Mental health services (CAMHS) in professionalsâ€™ perspective,MethodA narrative review was conducted to synthesize published studies and official documents from various sources in accordance to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Guidelines. This review selected 16 studies from two databases, PsycINFO, Medline. Additional documents were hand-searched from reference lists and organisations websites.ResultsTwo themes were identified: (1) barriers experienced by service users in professionalsâ€™ perspectives including waiting times, eligibility criteria, limited resources & stigma. (2) facilitators and strategies to improve access were identified. This review identified gaps in the current UK mental health system.Discussion and ConclusionThis review provided an overview of professional viewpoint on the barriers and facilitators in accessing CAMHS. There were limited studies looking at the potential additional barriers faced by children with neurodevelopmental disorders when accessing mental health services from a professionalâ€™s perspective. This paucity of data will be a platform for future research including service evaluation within Specialist Neurodevelopmental assessment services at Great Ormond Street Hospital.","Shing, Eunice, Garcia-Rodriguez, Ruth, Ramani, Pooja, Clark, Elaine, Aylett, Sarah","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-gosh.65","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 3):A24, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24172,""

"A longitudinal study of the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on studentsâ€™ health behavior, mental health and emotional well-being","Background COVID-related restrictions impacted the lives of students on and off campus during Academic Year 2020/2021. Methods Our study collected data on student health behavior and habits as well as their mental and emotional health using anonymous surveys. We compared these data with data collected prior to COVID in the longitudinal part of our study (n = 721) and analyzed them for the cross-sectional part of the study (n = 506). Results The longitudinal data show a significant difference for some student behaviors and habits, such as sleeping habits, physical activity, breakfast consumption, time spent online or playing video games, vaping, and marijuana use, during the COVID pandemic compared with pre-COVID data. Respondents also reported a significant increase in difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions, as well as being impacted by feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Yet, there was no increase in the proportion of respondents considering, planning or attempting suicide during COVID. The cross-sectional data illuminate the negative effect of the overall situation and the restrictions on studentsâ€™ mental and emotional well-being. Three-quarters of respondents reported having craved human interaction during the past six months, more than half felt that their mental/emotional health had been impacted by the lack of social events or the switch to virtual (online) teaching. Two-thirds or more of respondents also expressed that they felt less connected to their peers and less motivated in their studies than in previous semesters. Fifty percent or more of respondents selected anxious, stressed, overwhelmed, disconnected, tired, and fatigued as words that best described their emotional state during the pandemic. Conclusions The impact of COVID-related restrictions on studentsâ€™ behaviors and habits as well as their mental and emotional health was less severe than one would have expected based on studies during the early stage of the pandemic. While some behaviors and habits changed during the COVID pandemic compared with the pre-COVID period, the changes were not substantial overall. Our study did not find an increase in the proportion of respondents considering, planning or attempting suicide during COVID, although the cross-sectional data from our survey make the negative effect of the overall situation and the restrictions on studentsâ€™ mental and emotional well-being evident. The impact of the pandemic will unquestionably be long-lasting and will necessitate further and future investigations.","Reuter, Peter R.; Forster, Bridget L.; Kruger, Bethany J.","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12528","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: PeerJ;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24174,""

"Clinical outcomes following major trauma for patients with a diagnosis of depression: a large UK database analysis","BackgroundMore than a quarter of the UK population are affected by depression during their lifetime. For major trauma patients, postinjury depression can result in poorer long-term outcomes, but there is limited evidence regarding outcomes for patients with pre-existing depression. This study investigated the relationship between a diagnosis of depression prior to hospital admission and clinical outcomes after major trauma.MethodsTrauma patients at a UK major trauma center were identified during a 6.5-year period using the Trauma Audit and Research Network database. Patients with Injury Severity Score &gt;15 who did not die in the emergency department (ED) were included. Logistic regression models were used to compare in-hospital mortality (excluding ED), requirement for surgery, and length of stay (LOS) between those with depression and those without.ResultsThere were 4602 patients included in the study and 6.45% had a diagnosis of depression. Depression was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.91;p=0.026). However, patients with depression were more likely to have longer LOS (OR 124, 95% CI 8.5 to 1831;p&lt;0.001) and intensive care unit LOS (OR 9.69, 95% CI 3.14 to 29.9;p&lt;0.001). Patients with depression were also more likely to undergo surgery (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.75;p=0.016).DiscussionA pre-existing diagnosis of depression has complex association with clinical outcomes after major trauma, with reduced mortality but longer LOS and higher likelihood of surgical intervention. Further prospective investigations are warranted to inform optimal management strategies for major trauma patients with pre-existing depression.Level of evidenceIII.","Large, Jamie, Naumann, David N.; Fellows, Jodie, Connor, Clare, Zubair, Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.1136/tsaco-2021-000819","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open; 6(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24181,""

"Psychology students' perceptions on their quality of life during COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many lives and has a considerable social and economic impact. In response to this crisis, governments have implemented a series of protection measures: lockdown, social distancing, wearing a mask etc. Studies and statistics on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic indicate low levels of mental and physical well-being, depression, fear of uncertainty, increasing inequality due to job loss, increased stress due to financial matters, social isolation etc. The current study has two main objectives: to explore Psychology students' perceptions on changes in their quality of life, by comparing two periods of time: before and during COVID-19 pandemic and to identify differences in students' perceptions on changes in their quality of life, according to their COVID-19 disease status. We designed a questionnaire including different aspects of quality of life, based on WHO Quality of Life -Bref (WHOQOL-BREF) (2004). Results have indicated that the main changes are related to opportunities for leisure activities, ability to concentrate, ability to perform daily living activities, mobility, capacity for work, feeling safe, and having enough money.","Ionescu, M.

"Affections and coping strategies in time of Coronavirus: a qualitative study","This study aimed to raise coping strategies to deal with social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of the Covid-19 virus has turned into a pandemic as it spread throughout the world, leading to mobility restrictions for billions of people who have faced varying degrees of confinement. This situation has led to extreme emotions of fear, sadness, and feelings of anxiety, with impacts on people's psychological health. Research has shown that the ability to adequately regulate one's own emotions is important for mental physical, and social health and it is relevant to study how people deal with their emotions in stressful situations, such as the current context of isolation in the pandemic. A questionnaire was applied electronically to 463 participants from all over Brazil over the age of 18 years. Data analysis was qualitative, based on responses to an open item that asked about coping strategies to deal with social isolation. The results showed the use of varied strategies to minimize stress and increase well-being. Cognitive reassessment, the search for social support, and distraction were highlighted.","Hirschle, A. L.

"Development of NLP-Integrated Intelligent Web System for E-Mental Health","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the need for a better health care facility is highlighted more than ever. Besides physical health, mental health conditions have become a significant concern. Unfortunately, there are few opportunities for people to receive mental health care. There are inadequate facilities for seeking mental health support even in big cities, let alone remote areas. This paper presents the structure and implementation procedures for a mental health support system combining technology and professionals. The system is a web platform where mental health seekers can register and use functionalities like NLP-based chatbot for personality assessment, chatting with like-minded people, and one-to-one video conferencing with a mental health professional. The video calling feature of the system has emotion detection capabilities using computer vision. The system also includes downloadable prescription facilities and a payment gateway for secure transactions. From a technological aspect, the conversational NLP-based chatbot and computer vision-powered video calling are the system's most important features. The system has a documentation facility to analyze the mental health condition over time. The web platform is built using React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. MongoDB is used as the database of the platform. The NLP chatbot is built on a three-layered deep neural network model that is programmed in the Python language and uses the NLTK, TensorFlow, and Keras sequential API. Video conference is one of the most important features of the platform. To create the video calling feature, Express.js, Socket.io, and Socket.io-client have been used. The emotion detection feature is implemented on video conferences using computer vision, Haar Cascade, and TensorFlow. All the implemented features are tested and work fine. The targeted users for the platform are teenagers, youth, and the middle-aged population. Mental health-seeking is still considered taboo in some societies today. Apart from basic established facilities, this social dilemma of undergoing treatment for mental health is causing severe damage to individuals. A solution to this problem can be a remote platform for mental health support. With this goal in mind, this system is designed to provide mental health support to people remotely from anywhere worldwide.

"Health and wellbeing under COVID-19: the greencovid survey","Given the impact of COVID-19 on populations, especially under lockdown conditions, there has been more attention than ever focused on the role of nature, including green and blue spaces, to act as a form of health-enabler across societies. Access to green space, with its potential for physical activity and mental health support has been specifically identified within the literature as an important asset for neighbourhood and citizen health and wellbeing. The established positive relationships between access to and benefits from green and blue space are variable over space, both in terms of the kinds of built environments in which people live, but also the availability nearby of natural assets like parks, coasts, rivers, etc.;as well as ease of access to those spaces for all citizens. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries have developed as part of their public health strategies, a series of lockdown measures in which citizens have either been confined to home, or at best, a small catchment area immediately surrounding their homes. As part of a flurry of recent research on such relationships, the GreenCOVID study was carried out by a group of researchers in Spain, the UK and Ireland, all broadly operating to a similar framework and collecting information from the general adult population in each of the three countries. This short commentary introduces the survey alongside preliminary Irish results specifically focused on household characteristics, access to nearby green space as well as a measure of psychological wellbeing.","Guzman, V.; Garrido-Cumbrera, M.; Brace, O.; Hewlett, D.; Foley, R.","https://doi.org/10.2014/igj.v53i2.1420","","Database: GIM; Publication details: Irish Geography; 53(2):157-162, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24186,""
"PIMS-TS: the psychological needs of families admitted to intensive care","BackgroundPaediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS-TS) is a rare inflammatory condition affecting children and young people (CYP) weeks after infection with the COVID-19 virus. The aim of this study was to understand the potential psychological needs of these families.MethodsPIMS-TS patients and their parents admitted to the hospital between April 2020 and May 2021 were reviewed by a psychologist 6â€“8 weeks post discharge, as part of their clinical care. Young people over the age of 7 were asked to complete 2 measures for psychological distress and PTSD symptoms (CRIES-13 and PIED) and their parent/carer completed a measure of PTSD symptoms (IES-R). Ethical approval was not required for this study.Results118 CYP and parents/carers who were admitted to GOSH were screened 6â€“8 weeks post discharge. 85 of the 118 CYP were aged 8 or over.76.8% (n=91) of parents/carers completed the IES-R, 78% (n=66) of CYPs completed the PIED, and CRIES.15% (n=10) of CYPs scores on the PIED suggested they were at risk of anxiety and depression. 24% (n=16) of CYPs reported clinically significant difficulties for PTSD on the CRIES-13, placing them in high probability of for a diagnosis of PTSD.35% of parents/carers met the threshold for clinical concern on IES-R, with 23% (n=21) scoring in the range for a likely diagnosis of PTSD.DiscussionThe findings of both the self-report screening questionnaires, indicate that significant number for CYP and their parent/carers are at risk of developing symptoms of psychological distress and trauma in 6â€“8 week period post discharge after PIMS-TS admission.ConclusionThe result of this study clearly show identification of high levels of trauma and emotional distress for the CYP and their parents and carers, and a potential need for ongoing psychological support to be provided as part of on-going care.","Freeman, Anita, Ovin, Felicia, Bird, Annie, Galloway, Anna, Sweet, Rebecca, Robertson, Anna, Clisby, Holly, Gardner, Jennifer, Perscott, Natasha, Ramsay, Devaraj, Calissano, Frederica, Berger, Zoe","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-gosh.91","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 3):A34, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24187,""

"Connecting healthcare with income maximisation services, and their financial, health and well-being impacts for families with young children: a systematic review protocol","IntroductionPoverty has far-reaching and detrimental effects on childrenâ€™s physical and mental health, across all geographies. Financial advice and income-maximisation services can provide a promising opportunity for shifting the physical and mental health burdens that commonly occur with financial hardship, yet awareness of these services is limited, and referrals are not systematically integrated into existing healthcare service platforms. We aim to map and synthesise evidence on the impact of healthcare-income maximisation models of care for families of children aged 0â€“5 years in high-income countries on family finances, parent/caregiver(s) or childrenâ€™s health and well-being.Methods and analysisTo be included in the review, studies must be families (expectant mothers or parents/caregivers) of children who are aged between 0 and 5 years, accessing a healthcare service, include a referral from healthcare to an income-maximisation service (ie, financial counselling), and examine impacts on child and family health and well-being. A comprehensive electronic search strategy will be used to identify studies written in English, published from inception to January 2021, and indexed in MEDLINE, EMBase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Proquest, Family & Society Studies Worldwide, Cochrane Library, and Informit Online. Search strategies will include terms for: families, financial hardship and healthcare, in various combinations. Bibliographies of primary studies and review articles meeting the inclusion criteria will be searched manually to identify further eligible studies, and grey literature will also be searched. Data on objective and self-reported outcomes and study quality will be independently extracted by two review authors;any disagreements will be resolved through a third reviewer.

"Mental Health and Resilience among Nurses in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Study","Objective: Nurses exposed to COVID-19 could be psychologically stressed. The present study investigated the mental health and the resilience level in the nurses' population. Method: This cross-sectional study was performed on 432 nurses in 27 hospitals working in Guilan province, north of Iran, between April 29, to May 14, 2020. Mental health and resilience were measured using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). Hierarchical multiple linear regression model was used to identify factors associated with mental health. Results: The mean GHQ-12 and CD-RISC-10 scores were 15.72 (SD, 5.67) and 25.97 (SD, 6.88), respectively. Probable psychological distress (GHQ-12 score = 15) was present in 57.2% of nurses. Among demographic and COVID-19-related variables, only educational level was significantly and negatively correlated with mental health. After controlling the variables, hierarchical regression analyses results showed that lower resilience was associated with poor mental health (ÃŸ = -0.49;P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Regarding the nurses' mental health, appropriate psychological/psychiatric intervention is necessary, and resilience can play a role as a mental health promoter.

"COVID-19 Fear Association with Depression, Anxiety, and Insomnia: A National Web-Based Survey on the General Population","Objective: COVID-19 pandemic has influenced almost every country worldwide. Being in a pandemic situation can cause psychological distress to people, which can lead to sleep disorders. The present study aimed to assess prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among Iranian people and their relations with COVID-19 fear in the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional and population-based online study was designed. We created an online form and used Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2 scale (GAD-2), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), to assess fear of COVID-19, anxiety, depression, and insomnia, respectively. We sent the link to the online survey to Iranians interested in participating in the study via social media, and 1223 Iranian completed the form. Results: A total of 1223 individuals with a mean age of 39.82 Â± 10.75 years participated in the study. Prevalence of insomnia, depression and anxiety among our participants were 55.2%, 61.5%, and 50.9%, respectively. The mean FCV- 19 score among the participants was 19.70 Â± 5.08. Insomnia was more common among those who were 50 years or older. Fear of COVID-19 was related to a more risk of progression toward depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Conclusion: Fear of COVID-19 has a considerable association with depression, anxiety, and insomnia in the pandemic, and strategies to reasonably decrease people's fears can help to reduce incidence of psychological issues during the pandemic.

"Environmental health compromised by a new epidemic The case of Uruguay, COVID-19; La salud ambiental comprometida por una nueva epidemia El caso de Uruguay, COVID-19","Abstract Uruguay is in South America. It has 3,286,314 inhabitants, 1.6% of which lacks comprehensive health insurance. Detected cases of COVID-19 represent 0.022% of the population, 2.6% of which has resulted in death. Mortality from COVID-19 is 0.6% per 100,000 inhabitants, and health workers represent 14% of detected cases. The country is slowly coming out of intensified social distancing. This article reports on accumulated, recovered, and active cases. The authors also frame the causes of this zoonosis in terms of an environmental health problem, and thus a global health problem, requiring a ""one health"" approach. Human activity has changed natural habitats as a result of extraction activities, increased urbanization, growing populations, different cultural practices, and socioeconomic conditions. This contributes to the emergence of zoonoses, particularly RNA viruses. If the cause of this phenomenon is not addressed, we will continue facing increasing challenges.; Resumen Uruguay se ubica en SudamÃ©rica con una poblaciÃ³n de 3.286.314 habitantes. El 1,6% no tiene seguro integral de salud. Los casos detectados de COVID 19 representan el 0,022 % de la poblaciÃ³n. Las muertes con relaciÃ³n a los casos detectados representan el 2,6%.

"Elements to understand acts of aggression and discrimination towards the healthcare personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic; Elementos para comprender la discriminaciÃ³n y agresiones en contra de personal sanitario durante la pandemia de COVID-19","Resumen A raÃ­z de la pandemia de COVID-19 provocada por el SARS-CoV 2, en tan solo seis meses de su existencia se han adoptado distintas medidas de protecciÃ³n y atenciÃ³n a la poblaciÃ³n mundial. Los trabajadores de la salud han realizado grandes esfuerzos para combatir la enfermedad a nivel hospitalario. De forma paradÃ³jica, se han identificado actos de discriminaciÃ³n y agresiÃ³n en contra del personal sanitario, que incluyen la negaciÃ³n de servicios, amenazas, daÃ±o fÃ­sico y patrimonial, principalmente. El propÃ³sito de este trabajo es describir algunos elementos que permitan comprender el comportamiento social de discriminaciÃ³n que sufren los trabajadores sanitarios. Se describe el estado de la salud mental en la poblaciÃ³n general y del personal intrahospitalario durante la pandemia, asÃ­ como los antecedentes de agresiones al personal de salud previos a esta condiciÃ³n, que permiten tener un panorama general desde distintas perspectivas, con el fin de establecer lineamientos generales Ãºtiles para su prevenciÃ³n.; Abstract Within six months only of its existence as result of the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the SARSCoV2, various safety measures have been applied in order to offer both protection and attention to the worldwide population. Healthcare professionals have been making great efforts to fight the disease on a hospital care level but paradoxically, acts of aggressive discrimination have been presented towards the health personnel, which mainly include: denying services, threats, and physical damage as well as patrimonial. This paper's purpose is to describe some of the elements that help understand the mass social discriminative behaviour showing up towards healthcare workers. Healthcare personnel and general population's mental health states during this pandemic are both described, as well as background checks of aggression towards healthcare workers predating the present pandemic, allowing a bigger picture to be examined, with the intention of establishing new general guidelines to prevent future acts of discrimination.","DÃ­az-Victoria, Ana-Ruth","http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0121-08072020000300319","","Country: CO; COLÃ”MBIA; COLOMBIA; COLOMBIA; Database: LILACS; Publication details: Rev.

"A Study on the Health and Wellness of Undergraduate Students (SABES-Grad): Methodological aspects of a nationwide multicenter and multilevel study overlapped with the Covid-19 pandemic","The academic environment can negatively impact the mental health of undergraduate students, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. This study aimed to describe the methodological and operational aspects of a study on the health and well-being of undergraduate students: The SABES-Grad project. This was a nationwide cross-sectional study divided into two data collection strategies: a unicentric on-site collection carried out in 2019 at the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG) and a multicenter, multilevel, online data collection carried out in 2020/2021 at the FURG, Fluminense Federal University (UFF), Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT), Amazonas State University (UEA) and the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco (UFRPE). The main outcomes of interest were depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, and suicide risk. A total of 996 students participated in the data collection in 2019 (63.8% females; median age of 22 years; response rate of 85.2%) and 5,720 students participated in the 2020/2021 collection (66.7% females; median age of 22 years; response rate of 84.3%). Significant variations in the socioeconomic and demographic structure were observed between the universities. Approximately one-third of the sample had been tested for Covid-19 in 2020/2021, of which 7.8% tested positive. The SABES-Grad project was the result of collaborative work between several actors from public universities in Brazil. Several aspects of the preparation and conduction of this research were discussed in terms of its originality and relevance. Barriers, limitations and strategies adopted to overcome them were also presented.","Demenech, Neiva-Silva, Brignol, Lemos, Tassitano, Dumith","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2021-0367","20211221","Covid-19; mental health; pandemic; students; universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24202,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on experiences of pregnancy and/or early parenting in Chile","The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has impacted families' mental health around the globe. In June 2020, 1163 parents of high (43%), middle (47%), and low socioeconomic status (SES) (10%) participated in an online survey developed to explore how daily life changes and restrictions that came with COVID-19 affected the experiences of pregnancy and/or parenting children under the age of 5 in Chile. The survey's design had an exploratory and descriptive scope, with a mix of qualitative and quantitative questions. With the aim of exploring differences before and after COVID-19, two time periods were established, and the 47-item questionnaire covered participants' sociodemographic information, support networks, health concerns, mood changes, self-regulation, adult and children's perceived well-being, parental competencies and parents' perceptions of the unborn baby and/or their children's needs. The results relative to retrospective reporting of pre-pandemic levels, showed an increase in children's crying and tantrums as well as in parental irritability and sadness. Additionally, decreases in the ability to calm down and sleep quality in both parents and children were identified. Finally, at a qualitative level, COVID-19 stands out both as an opportunity to get to know their children better and as a stressor related to parental burn-out and discomfort.","Olhaberry, Sieverson, Franco, Romero, Tagle, Iribarren, Honorato, Muzard","https://doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21955","20211221","COVID-19; early parenting; lockdown; mental health; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24203,""
"Adapting psychophysiological data collection for COVID-19: The ""Virtual Assessment"" model","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted research activities globally. Researchers need safe and creative procedures to resume data collection, particularly for projects evaluating infant mental health interventions. Remote research is uniquely challenging for psychophysiological data collection, which typically requires close contact between researchers and participants as well as technical equipment frequently located in laboratory settings. In accordance with public health guidance, we adapted procedures and developed novel protocols for a ""virtual assessment"" in which women and infants provided behavioral and psychophysiological data from their own homes while researchers coordinated remotely. Data collected at virtual visits included video-recorded parent-child interactions and autonomic nervous system data. Adaptations were designed to optimize safety and data quality while minimizing participant burden. In the current paper, we describe these adaptations and present data evaluating their success across two sites in the United States (University of Delaware and University of Utah), focusing specifically on autonomic nervous system data collected during the well-validated Still-Face Paradigm (SFP). We also discuss advantages and challenges of translating traditional lab procedures into the virtual assessment model. Ultimately, we hope that disseminating these procedures will help other researchers resume safe data collection related to infant mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Tabachnick, Sellers, Margolis, Labella, Neff, Crowell, Raby, Saenz, Conradt, Dozier","https://doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21954","20211221","autonomic nervous system; methodology; psychophysiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24204,""
"Prevalence and factors associated with the intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Peru","To estimate the prevalence and factors associated with the intention to be vaccinated (ITV) against COVID-19 in Peru. Analytical cross-sectional study using the survey conducted by the University of Maryland, USA, on Facebook. The dependent variable is the ITV. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated, with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using generalized linear models of the Poisson family, in order to evaluate the association of sociodemographic variables, compliance with community mitigation strategies, symptoms of COVID-19, mental health and acceptance of vaccination before the recommendation (AVR) by various actors and health authorities, with the ITV. Data from 17,162 adults were analyzed. The overall prevalence of the ITV was 74.9%. A lower prevalence of the ITV was associated with the female sex (PR=0.95; 95% CI: 0.94-0.97), living in a town (PR=0.95; 95% CI: 0.91-0.99) or village or other rural area (PR=0.90; 95% CI: 0.86-0.93) and the AVR of politicians (PR=0.89; 95% CI: 0.87-0.92).

"Patient preferences for patient portal-based telepsychiatry in a safety-net hospital setting during COVID-19: A cross-sectional study","Patient portals are a safe and secure way for patients to connect with providers for video-based telepsychiatry and help to overcome the financial and logistical barriers associated with face-to-face mental health care. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telepsychiatry has become increasingly important to obtaining mental health care. However, financial, and technological barriers, termed the ""digital divide,"" prevent some patients from accessing the technology needed to utilize telepsychiatry services. As an extension to a clinic's outreach project during COVID-19 to improve patient engagement with video-based visits through the hospital's patient portal among adult behavioral health patients at an urban safety net hospital, we aimed to assess patient preference for patient portal-based video visits or telephone-only visits, and to identify the demographic variables associated with their preference. Patients in an outpatient psychiatry clinic were contacted by phone and preference for telepsychiatry by phone or video through a patient portal, as well as device preference for video-based visits, were documented. Patient demographic characteristics were collected from the electronic medical record. One hundred and twenty-eight patients were reached by phone. Seventy-nine patients (61.7%) chose video-based visits and 69.6% of these patients preferred to access the patient portal through a smartphone. Older patients were significantly less likely to agree to video-based visits. Among behavioral health patients at a safety-net hospital, there was a relatively low engagement with video-based visits through the hospital's patient portal, particularly among older adults.","Yue, Mail, DiSalvo, Borba, Piechniczek-Buczek, Yule","https://doi.org/10.2196/33697","20211221","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24206,""
"The Language of the Times: Using the COVID-19 Pandemic to Assess the Influence of News Affect on Online Mental Health-Related Search Behavior across the United States","The digital era has ushered in an unprecedented volume of readily accessible information, including news coverage of current events. Research has shown that the sentiment of news articles can evoke emotional responses from readers on a daily basis with specific evidence for increased anxiety and depression in response to coverage of the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Given the primacy and relevance of such information exposure, its daily impact on the mental health of the general population within this modality warrants further nuanced investigation. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a subject-specific example, this work aimed to profile and examine associations between the dynamics of semantic affect in online local news headlines and same-day online mental health term search behavior over time across the United States. Using COVID-related news headlines from a database of online news stories in conjunction with mental health-related online search data from Google Trends, this paper first explored the statistical and qualitative affective properties of state-specific COVID news coverage across the United States from January 23, 2020 to October 22, 2020. The resultant operationalizations and findings from the joint application of dictionary-based sentiment analysis and the circumplex theory of affect informed the construction of subsequent hypothesis-driven mixed-effects models. Daily state-specific counts of mental health search queries were regressed on circumplex-derived features of semantic affect, time, and state (as a random effect) to model the associations between the dynamics of news affect and search behavior throughout the pandemic. Search terms were also grouped into depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and non-specific depression and anxiety symptoms to model the broad impact of news coverage on mental health. Exploratory efforts revealed patterns in day-to-day news headline affect variation across the first nine months of the pandemic. In addition, circumplex mapping of the most frequently used words in state-specific headlines uncovered time-agnostic similarities and differences across the United States, including the ubiquitous use of negatively valenced and strongly arousing language. Subsequent mixed-effects modeling implicated increased consistency in affective tone (SpinVA ÃŽÂ²=-0.207; p&lt;.001) as predictive of increased depression-related search term activity, with emotional language patterns indicative of affective uncontrollability (FluxA ÃŽÂ²=0.221; p&lt;.001) contributing generally to an increase in online mental health search term frequency. The present study demonstrated promise in applying the circumplex model of affect to written content and provided a practical example for how circumplex theory can be integrated with sentiment analysis techniques to interrogate mental health-related associations. The findings from pandemic-specific news headlines highlighted arousal, flux, and spin as potentially significant affect-based foci for further study. Future efforts may also benefit from more expansive sentiment analysis approaches to more broadly test the practical application and theoretical capabilities of the circumplex model of affect on text-based data.","Lekkas, Gyorda, Price, Wortzman, Jacobson","https://doi.org/10.2196/32731","20211221","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24207,""
"COVID-19 and mental health among at-risk university students: A prospective study into risk and protective factors","The COVID-19 pandemic has confronted young adults with an unprecedented mental health challenge. Yet, prospective studies examining protective factors are limited. In the present study, we focused on changes in mental health in a large sample (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 685) of at-risk university students, which were measured before and during the pandemic. Network modeling was applied to 20 measured variables to explore intercorrelations between mental health factors, and to identify risk and protective factors. Latent change score modeling was used on a subset of variables. The main findings indicate that (1) mental health problems increased at group level, especially depression-anxiety and loneliness; (2) emotional support during the COVID pandemic was associated with smaller increases in loneliness and depression-anxiety; (3) COVID-related stress predicted increases in depression-anxiety; (4) loneliness acted as a bridge construct between emotional support and changes in mental health. To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young adults, is it recommended to focus on interventions that strengthen internal resources (stress-regulating abilities) and reduce loneliness.","Koelen, Mansueto, Finnemann, de Koning, van der Heijde, Vonk, Wolters, Klein, Epskamp, Wiers","https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1901","20211221","COVID-19 pandemic; at-risk university students; coping; loneliness; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24208,""
"Stress and mental health of COVID-19 survivors and their families after hospital discharge: relationship with perceived healthcare staff empathy","Several studies attest to the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on survivors' mental illness, especially in terms of high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 1-3Ã‚Â months after hospitalization. Aims of the present study were (1) to jointly evaluate PTSD and positive mental health among COVID-19 survivors and family members after hospital discharge, and (2) to investigate the relationship between perceived healthcare staff's relational empathy during hospitalization and survivors' post-traumatic stress levels. In this cross-sectional study, 60 survivors (M<sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 60.45; 63.3% men) and 40 family members (M<sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 52.33; 60% women) participated in an online survey 3-7Ã‚Â months after hospital discharge. In addition to providing socio-demographic data, they completed PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and Mental Health Continuum Short Form. Survivors also completed the Consultation and Relational Empathy measure. Percentages of participants meeting a provisional PTSD and mental health diagnosis (flourishing, moderate, languishing) were calculated. A hierarchical regression analysis was performed on survivors' data, with perceived staff's empathy as predictor and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) as outcome. One-fifth of the participants received a provisional PTSD diagnosis, about half were diagnosed with flourishing or moderate mental health, and only 5% were languishing, with no significant between-group differences. Among survivors, a negative association was detected between perceived healthcare staff's empathy and PTSS, explaining 10.5% of the model variance over and above demographic and clinical variables. Findings highlighted the coexistence of PTSD and positive mental health among survivors and family members, suggesting the usefulness of assessing both negative and positive dimensions of mental health, in order to promote psycho-social adaptation once returning to everyday life. In addition, the role of compassionate care in clinical practice emerged as a potential means to mitigate severe traumatic reactions among survivors.","Bassi, Carissoli, Tonelli, Trombetta, Magenta, Delle Fave, Cogliati","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.2019811","20211221","COVID-19; COVID-19 survivors; patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ families; positive mental health; post-traumatic stress disorder; relational empathy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24209,""
"Characterizing Worry Content and Impact in Pregnant and Postpartum Women with Anxiety Disorders During COVID-19","The novel COVID pandemic has had a substantial impact on global mental health, including those populations that are inherently vulnerable such as pregnant and postpartum (perinatal) women. Anxiety disorders (ADs) are the most common mental health disorders during the perinatal period, affecting up to 1 in 5 women. However, since the onset of the pandemic, up to 60% of perinatal women are experiencing moderate to severe levels of anxiety. Given the substantial increase in perinatal anxiety during COVID, we sought to better understand its phenomenology by characterizing the collective worry content and impact of COVID using a content analysis. Eighty-four treatment-seeking pregnant (n = 35) and postpartum (n = 49) women with a principal AD, participated in this study between April and October 2020. In addition to completing questionnaire measures and a semi-structured diagnostic interview, participants were asked to 1) describe their top excessive and uncontrollable worries; 2) describe additional COVID and non-COVID worries; and 3) describe how the pandemic had affected their lives. All responses were given verbally and transcribed verbatim by assessors. A content analysis led to the emergence of various COVID and non-COVID worry and impact themes. One third of participant's principal worries were specific to COVID, and 40% of COVID worries were specific to the perinatal context. Understanding the worry content and impact of COVID may improve symptom detection and inform the development of targeted treatment strategies to support the mental health needs of perinatal women with ADs throughout the pandemic and thereafter. Understanding pandemic-specific worries is important for perinatal symptom screening and may allow for the development of targeted treatment strategies to address COVID-specific worries and impact.","Green, Furtado, Inness, Frey, McCabe","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2703","20211221","Anxiety Disorders; COVID-19 Pandemic; Impact; Postpartum; Pregnant; Worry Content","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24210,""
"Characteristics and Risk Factors of Persistent Neuropathic Pain in Recovered COVID-19 Patients","To assess risk factors for persistent neuropathic pain in subjects recovered from COVID-19 and to study the serum level of neurofilament light chain (NFL) in those patients. Case-control study. Persistent post COVID-19 pain. 45 patients with post COVID-19 pain and another 45 age and sex-matched healthcare workers who recovered from COVID-19 without pain. The included participants were subjected to medical history taking, screening for depressive disorders, comprehensive neurological examination, and pain evaluation using the Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions (DN4). All patients who had a score at least 4/10 on DN4 were included. The serum NFL level was measured for both groups at the time of patients' enrollment. The frequency of depression, moderate and severe COVID-19 cases, disease duration and serum ferritin were significantly higher in the cases with post COVID-19 pain than controls. Binary logistic regression revealed that depression, azithromycin use, moderate and severe COVID-19 increased the odds of post COVID-19 pain by 4.462, 5.444, 4.901, &amp; 6.276 times, respectively. Cases with post COVID-19 pain had significantly higher NFL (11.34Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.7, 95%CI: 8.42 - 14.25) than control group (7.64Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.40, 95%CI: 6.02-9.27), (P-value= 0.029). Patients with allodynia had significantly higher NFL (14.96Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.41, 95%CI: 8.58-21.35) compared to those without (9.14Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.99, 95%CI: 6.43-11.85) (P-value= 0.05). Depression, azithromycin, moderate and severe COVID-19 are independent predictors of persistent post COVID-19 pain.

"A Comparative Study of Children with MIS-C between Admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and Pediatric Ward: A One-Year Retrospective Study","This descriptive study aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory features of the children with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), admission with the MIS-C patients who did not require PICU admission. This study was conducted between March 2020 and February 2021 at the University of Health Sciences Dr. BehÃƒÂ§et Uz Children's Hospital, a referral center for pediatric infectious diseases in the Aegean Region of Turkey. All hospitalized patients aged 18 years old or less with MIS-C according to the definition of the universal guidelines were included in the study. Data of the patients with the diagnosis of MIS-C were recorded and collected from the electronic medical records of the hospital. The data included demographic characteristics, presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory findings and clinical data. A total of 58 patients with MIS-C were included in this study. Thirty-eight (65.5%) patients were male. The median age was 6 years (2 months-16 years). The patients admitted to PICU were 15 (25.9%). The rate of pulmonary involvement was 81.3% (n = 13) in the PICU group. The median procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, D-Dimer and ferritin values were significantly higher in the PICU group compared to non-PICU group (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.02, p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.006 and p = 0.031).

"TMS-Evoked Prefrontal Perturbation as a Toy Model of Brain Resilience to Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Psychosocial hardships associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led many individuals to suffer adverse mental health consequences, however, others show no negative effects. We hypothesized that the electroencephalographic (EEG) response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could serve as a toy-model of an individual's capacity to resist psychological stress, in this case linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data from 74 participants who underwent mental health monitoring and concurrent electroencephalography with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) and left inferior parietal lobule (L-IPL). Within the following 19 months, mental health was reassessed at three time points during lock-down confinement and different phases of de-escalation in Spain. Compared with participants who remained stable, those who experienced increased mental distress showed, months earlier, significantly larger late EEG responses locally after L-DLPFC stimulation (but not globally nor after L-IPL stimulation). This response, together with years of formal education, was significantly predictive of mental health status during the pandemic. These findings reveal that the effect of TMS perturbation offers a predictive toy model of psychosocial stress resilience, as exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, and point to the L-DLPFC as a promising target for resilience promotion.","PerellÃƒÂ³n-Alfonso, Redondo-CamÃƒÂ³s, Abellaneda-PÃƒÂ©rez, Cattaneo, Delgado-GallÃƒÂ©n, EspaÃƒÂ±a-Irla, SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Tormos, Pascual-Leone, BartrÃƒÂ©s-Faz","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1139350/v1","20211221","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24214,""
"Psychological states of Bangladeshi people and associated factors during the outbreak of COVID-19: A cross-sectional survey","COVID-19 is imposing an extremely serious challenge to individuals' physical and mental health. The enforcement of lockdown, restriction on public gathering, social distancing strategy, and unprecedented quarantine measures has affected many aspects of peoples' lives in Bangladesh with potential consequences on their mental and physical health. This study aimed to assess the psychological states and their related factors among general people in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 outbreak. An e-questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 565 Bangladeshi general people between April and May, 2020. Measures included socio-demographics, chronic disease-related variables, the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Descriptive analysis and bivariate linear regression with ""depression"" and ""anxiety"" as the dependent variables were carried out to identify the factors associated with these. Results showed that 30.1% and 32.6% of participants had mild to extremely severe levels of anxiety and depression, respectively.

"Use of telehealth services among Nepali living overseas during Covid-19 pandemic: The opportunities, limitations, lessons learned and recommendations","There are estimated over 8 million Nepali migrants spread across various countries around the globe. Though the majority of them enjoy good health in general, a large proportion of them suffer from non-communicable diseases, mental health issues and communicable diseases. Telemedicine services, which are organized by Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA), have been proven to be effective in addressing some of the medical needs of the migrant Nepali workers. The purpose of this study is to assess the use of tele-health services among Nepali migrant population and examine the limitations. During the pandemic period from March 2020 through August 2021, Nepali in different countries utilized telehealth services. Mental health issues, chronic diseases, skin diseases were the most common ailments people sought telehealth services for. Digital gap, lack of cross-border regulations and unwillingness to utilize telemedicine were the challenges the service faced in the optimal use of such services. Training and education, use of easy Apps and subsidies from the government would help in the long-term use and sustainability of telehealth services amongst the Nepali migrants.","Sapkota, Adhikari, Sah, Bhattarai, Shrestha, Poudel, Sharma, Maleku, Simkhada","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobcr.2021.12.001","20211221","Abroad; Migrants; Nepali; Tele Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24216,""
"ACTing towards better living during COVID-19: The effects of Acceptance and Commitment therapy for individuals affected by COVID-19","The widespread effects of COVID-19 have dramatically increased the prevalence of mental health difficulties, meaning it is vital to explore psychotherapy options. Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT) helps individuals engage in meaningful activities despite difficult and unchangeable circumstances. Recent literature suggests that psychological flexibility, the underlying process of ACT, may moderate COVID-related distress - making ACT a promising psychotherapy candidate. This study therefore aimed to explore the effects of an ACT-based, guided self-help intervention on wellbeing, psychological flexibility, COVID-related distress, and general psychological distress within the general population. 48 participants (recruited via social media) engaged in a three-week, non-concurrent baseline phase, then received six, weekly, digital modules and weekly webinars to address module queries. 20 participants completed all modules and provided post-intervention feedback via an online qualitative survey. Multilevel modelling analysis found significant improvements in: wellbeing; overall psychological flexibility (including subscales behavioural awareness and valued action); and general psychological distress (including depression, anxiety and stress). No significant changes were found for COVID-related distress. Findings were sustained at one- and two-months follow-up - suggesting lasting change. Qualitative findings provide further insights about the experience of the intervention: participants reported improved wellbeing, still experiencing COVID-related distress, but felt more able to cope with general psychological distress (such as anxiety). No change in COVID-related distress scores may be due to methodological and measurement issues. This study is one of the first to explore ACT as a psychotherapeutic intervention for COVID-related distress and adds to the growing body of literature highlighting psychological flexibility as a key process for mitigating COVID-related distress.","Shepherd, Golijani-Moghaddam, Dawson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2021.12.003","20211221","Acceptance and commitment therapy; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Online therapy; Psychological flexibility; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24217,""
"Suicide Contagion","Suicide is a serious healthcare concern worldwide. In the USA, suicide was the tenth leading cause of death prior to 2020 when it was displaced as a result of the death toll from COVID-19. Suicide behavior is the result of the interaction between the individual's predisposing factors and precipitating factors. A recognized precipitating factor is the knowledge of the suicidal act of another, termed suicide contagion. Another precipitating factor is the physiological impact of an acute inflammatory response to disease, for example that seen in patients with COVID-19. Risk identification of persons at increased risk for suicidal actions is an essential goal in medical care so that protective measures can be employed to prevent suicide.","Walling","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40719-021-00219-9","20211221","Kabuki effect; Mass cluster; Point cluster; Suicide contagion; Werther effect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24218,""
"The interaction between social factors and adversities on self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic: longitudinal analysis of 49 227 UK adults","Little is known about which factors exacerbate and buffer the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related adversities on changes in thinking about and engaging in self-harm over time. To examine how changes in four social factors contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours over time and how these factors in turn interact with adversities and worries about adversities to increase risk for these outcomes. Data from 49 227 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed across the first 59 weeks of the pandemic. Fixed-effects logistic regressions examined time-varying associations between social support quality, loneliness, number of days of face-to-face contact for &gt;15 min and number of days phoning/video calling for Ã¢â€°Â¥15 min with self-harm thoughts and behaviours. We then examined how these four factors in turn interacted with the total number of adversities and worries about adversity and how this affected outcomes. Increases in the quality of social support were associated with decreases in the likelihood of both outcomes, whereas greater loneliness was associated with an increase in their likelihood. Associations were less clear for telephone/video contact and face-to-face contact with outcomes. Social support buffered and loneliness exacerbated the impact of adversity experiences on self-harm behaviours. These findings suggest the importance of the quality of one's social support network, rather than the mere presence of contact, for reducing the likelihood of self-harm behaviours in the context of COVID-19 pandemic-related adversity and worry.","Paul, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1071","20211221","COVID-19; Self-harm behaviours; adversity; longitudinal studies; self-harm thoughts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24219,""
"Psychological symptoms, mental fatigue and behavioural adherence after 72 continuous days of strict lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina","An early and prolonged lockdown was adopted in Argentina during the first wave of COVID-19. Early reports evidenced elevated psychological symptoms. To explore if the prolonged lockdown was associated with elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms; if mental fatigue was associated with lockdown adherence (a phenomenon called 'behavioural fatigue'); and if financial concerns were associated with lockdown adherence and emotional symptoms. The survey included standardised questionnaires to assess depressive (PHQ-9) and anxious (GAD-7) symptoms, mental fatigue, risk perception, lockdown adherence, financial concerns, daily stress, loneliness, intolerance to uncertainty, negative repetitive thinking and cognitive problems. LASSO regression analyses were carried out to predict depression, anxiety and lockdown adherence. The survey reached 3617 adults (85.2% female) from all provinces of Argentina after 72 days of lockdown. Data were collected between 21 May 2020 and 4 June 2020. In that period, Argentina had an Oxford stringency index of 85/100. Of those surveyed, 45.6% and 27% met the cut-offs for depression and anxiety, respectively. Mental fatigue, cognitive failures and financial concerns were correlated with psychological symptoms, but not with adherence to lockdown. In regression models, mental fatigue, cognitive failures and loneliness were the most important variables to predict depression, intolerance to uncertainty and lockdown difficulty were the most important for anxiety, and perceived threat was the most important for predicting lockdown adherence. During the extended lockdown, psychological symptoms increased, being enhanced by mental fatigue, cognitive difficulties and financial concerns. We found no evidence of behavioural fatigue. Thus, feeling mentally fatigued is not the same as being behaviourally fatigued.","Torrente, Yoris, Low, Lopez, Bekinschtein, VÃƒÂ¡zquez, Manes, Cetkovich","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1065","20211221","Fatigue Assessment Scale; Low- and middle-income countries; behavioural fatigue; community mental health; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24220,""
"Clinical condition, Resuscitation and Medical-Psychological Care of Severe COVID-19 patients (part 1)","This interview covers the clinical and psychological condition of patients afflicted with severe COVID-19 and their pulmonary rehabilitation process. For these patients, symptoms are medically urgent and life-threatening. The sequelae of this viral attack and immune response to it are significant, and often persist for months after discharge from intensive care. To understand the medical and psychological state of these patients, a description is given of the organs affected, the oxygen cycle in the body and the medical care procedures that are used to help patients with dysfunctional respiratory systems. The link between physical and psychological progress is described. Physical weakness results from pulmonary sequelae and deconditioning, and is often experienced by patients as mental fatigue similar to psychological depression. This may draw the patient into a downward spiral, with multiple health aspects deteriorating, independently of the resolution of initial problems. Conversely, a positive physical or psychological evolution may lead to the evolution of the other. Thus, reversing the negative trend for just one system component can delay, completely arrest the spiralling down, or transform it into an upward spiral, improving the patient's condition. In addition, for people undergoing severe COVID-19, the return to normal life could be destabilizing and memories that arise from their crisis state may trigger Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Health and psychosocial professionals hold an important role both in post-hospital care and in secondary prevention, i.e. prevention of relapse and re-hospitalization. Physical rehabilitation work must take these psychological factors into account, in the same way that any psychological follow-up is supposed to consider physiological factors. Cet entretien porte sur l'ÃƒÂ©tat clinique mÃƒÂ©dico-psychologique des patients atteints de COVID-19 sÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ¨re et sur leur rÃƒÂ©adaptation respiratoire. Pour ces patients, les sÃƒÂ©quelles de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢attaque virale et de la rÃƒÂ©action immunitaire sont importantes et apparentes dans les tests fonctionnels et les imageries mÃƒÂ©dicales. Elles persistent souvent quelques mois aprÃƒÂ¨s la sortie des soins intensifs.Le virus SARS COV-2 provoque des atteintes des muqueuses bronchiques et alvÃƒÂ©olaires. Le circuit de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢oxygÃƒÂ¨ne dans le corps peut ÃƒÂªtre dÃƒÂ©coupÃƒÂ© en trois maillons imbriquÃƒÂ©s : lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ensemble de l'appareil respiratoire, le systÃƒÂ¨me cardio-vasculaire, les muscles et le mÃƒÂ©tabolisme ÃƒÂ©nergÃƒÂ©tique. Ces systÃƒÂ¨mes fonctionnent en interdÃƒÂ©pendance. LorsquÃ¢â‚¬â„¢il y a une dÃƒÂ©faillance de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un des ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©ments, les autres sont touchÃƒÂ©s, pouvant amener lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ensemble Ãƒ une dÃƒÂ©compensation. La dÃƒÂ©compensation respiratoire dÃƒÂ©signe la dÃƒÂ©faillance ou lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢incapacitÃƒÂ© du systÃƒÂ¨me Ãƒ fonctionner.

La sensation vÃƒÂ©cue par ces personnes est celle dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une fatigue physique et mentaleÃ¢â‚¬â€°; autrement dit l'incapacitÃƒÂ© de trouver des ressources suffisantes pour effectuer des activitÃƒÂ©s simples. Cette fatigue est vÃƒÂ©cue comme une dÃƒÂ©pression, une sensation qui elle seule risque dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢aspirer le patient dans une spirale descendanteÃ¢â‚¬â€°: soit dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une fatigue en une absence de motivation, puis de sÃƒÂ©dentaritÃƒÂ© en dÃƒÂ©conditionnement musculaire.Ainsi, il y a un lien ÃƒÂ©troit qui existe entre progrÃƒÂ¨s physique et renforcement psychologique, les deux sont interdÃƒÂ©pendants, un dÃƒÂ©clin dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un risque d'entraÃƒÂ®ner lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢autre, mais, Ãƒ l'inverse, une ÃƒÂ©volution positive dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un fait ÃƒÂ©voluer lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢autre. Se rendre compte de l'amÃƒÂ©lioration de l'ÃƒÂ©tat physique permet de nourrir sa motivation et de trouver de l'ÃƒÂ©nergie permettant de continuer Ãƒ ÃƒÂªtre physiquement actif. Le travail de rÃƒÂ©adaptation physique doit tenir compte de ces facteurs psychologiques, de la mÃƒÂªme maniÃƒÂ¨re que tout suivi psychologique doit tenir compte des facteurs physiologiques.Pour les personnes subissant un COVID-19 sÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ¨re, le retour Ãƒ la vie normale peut ÃƒÂªtre dÃƒÂ©stabilisant et les souvenirs de leur ÃƒÂ©tat de crise peuvent dÃƒÂ©clencher un syndrome de stress post-traumatique (SSPT).

"Remote Home-Based Exercise Program to Improve the Mental State, Balance, and Physical Function and Prevent Falls in Adults Aged 65 Years and Older During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Seoul, Korea","BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic can affect the elderly population's general health. This study aimed to compare the effects of a remote home-based exercise program to improve the mental state, balance, and physical function and to prevent falls in adults aged 65 years and older during the COVID-19 pandemic in Seoul, Korea. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group of 35 participants who underwent a remote home-based fall prevention exercise program and a control group of 35 participants. The experimental group performed an exercise program twice weekly for 8 weeks from June 2 to July 21, 2021. The Geriatric Depression Scale, 5 times sit to stand test, grip strength, 10-m walk test, gait analysis, Timed Up and Go test, and static balance test were assessed before and after the 8-week program. RESULTS The group-by-time interaction effect was statistically significant for the Geriatric Depression Scale, five times sit to stand test, grip strength, 10-meter walk, gait speed, step length, stride length, Timed Up and Go test, and static balance test (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the control group, the experimental group showed a significant effect in all dependent variables except dynamic balance (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS In this population, the remote home-based fall prevention exercise program resulted in a significant improvement in physical function, psychological factors, and balance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings may have implications for community public health measures to protect the vulnerable during future epidemics and pandemics of infectious disease.","Yi, Yim","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.935496","20211221","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24222,""
"Gender perspective of psychological discomfort during COVID-19 confinement among Spanish adult population: a cross-sectional study","COVID-19 disease has affected more than a hundred countries worldwide and has exposed the population to an increase in mental health problems. The objective of this study was to assess the emotional impact of the pandemic from a gender perspective, as well as to study the modulating variables of that impact. A descriptive and cross-sectional study through the General Health Questionnaire scale and the Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale is developed. General population of Spain was the target of this study PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 3801 adult subjects living in Spain, without diagnosis for Sars-Cov-2 virus infection during confinement. Data collection was carried out using an online questionnaire, from 26 March 2020 to 26 April 2020. A sample profile description was obtained, regarding to the study variables. Later, a regression model was implemented in order to test the relationship between these variables, and to achieve a predictive model of psychological discomfort controlling the gender variable. The results showed that women, as compared with men, had increased psychological discomfort during confinement (t=-12.877; p&lt;0.001; d=0.470). In contrast, significantly higher scores were observed on the SOC scale (t=6.336; p&lt;0.001; d=0.231) in men, as compared with those obtained by women. Women have higher levels of psychological discomfort, increased concern about getting infected with COVID-19 and infecting others, as well as a lower level of SOC and perceived health. In addition, low levels of SOC predict greater concern about contagion and increased psychological discomfort.","GÃƒÂ³mez-Salgado, DomÃƒÂ­nguez-Salas, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-DomÃƒÂ­nguez, Allande-CussÃƒÂ³, Romero-MartÃƒÂ­n, Ruiz-Frutos","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051572","20211221","COVID-19; mental health; public health; sexual and gender disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24223,""
"Implementation of treatment escalation plans in an old age psychiatry inpatient hospital","A treatment escalation plan (TEP) enables timely and appropriate decision making in the management of deteriorating patients. The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the widespread use of TEPs in acute care settings throughout the National Health Service (NHS) to facilitate safe and effective decision making. TEP proformas have not been developed for the inpatient psychiatric setting. This is particularly concerning in old age psychiatry inpatient wards where patients often have multiple compounding comorbidities and complex decisions regarding capacity are often made. Our aim for this quality improvement project was to pilot a novel TEP proforma within a UK old age psychiatry inpatient hospital. We first adapted a TEP proforma used in our partner acute tertiary hospital and implemented it on our old age psychiatry wards. We then further refined the form and gathered data about uptake, length of time to complete a TEP and the ceiling of care documented in the TEP. We also explored staff, patient and family views on the usefulness of TEP proformas using questionaries. TEP decisions were documented in 54% of patient records at baseline. Following revision and implementation of a TEP proforma this increased to 100% on our two wards. The mean time taken to complete a TEP was reduced from 7.1 days to 3.2 days following inclusion of the TEP proforma in admission packs. Feedback from staff showed improvements in understanding about TEP and improved knowledge of where these decisions were documented. We advocate the use of TEP proformas on all old age psychiatry inpatient wards to offer clear guidance to relatives and treating clinicians about the ceilings of care for patients. There are potentially wider benefits to healthcare systems by reducing inappropriate transfers between psychiatry and acute NHS hospitals.","Chua, Ghanchi, Makh, Grayston, Woolford, Wijayaweera, Osman-Hicks, Patel, Amin","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001640","20211221","dementia; geriatrics; healthcare quality improvement; mental health; resuscitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24224,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health: Effects on screening, care delivery, and people with cystic fibrosis","Depression and anxiety are two to four times more prevalent in people with CF (pwCF) than the general population. COVID-19 may exacerbate mental health challenges, increasing demand for psychological services, while decreasing their availability. We assessed the impact of the pandemic on depression and anxiety in pwCF, including how COVID-19 affected the frequency of mental health screening and the types of services provided. A 38-item internet survey, completed in June 2020, assessed how COVID-19 affected: 1) the mental health clinician's role and screening processes; 2) barriers to screening and resource needs; 3) impact of COVID-19 on depression and anxiety, and 4) positive outcomes and confidence in sustaining mental health screening and treatment, including telehealth services, after the pandemic. Responses were obtained from 131 of the 289 US CF programs. Overall, 60% of programs (n=79) continued mental health screening and treatment, although less frequently; 50% provided individual tele-mental health interventions, and 9% provided telehealth group therapy. Clinically elevated depression symptoms (PHQ-9Ã¢â€°Â¥10; moderate to severe), were found in 12% of 785 pwCF, with 3.1% endorsing suicidal ideation. Similarly, elevated anxiety (moderate to severe; GAD-7Ã¢â€°Â¥10) was found in 13% of pwCF (n=779). The COVID-19 pandemic created an opportunity to implement innovative solutions to disruptions in mental health screening and treatment in CF programs. We found that pwCF had increased access to psychological interventions during the pandemic via telehealth, supporting the continued integration of tele-mental health screening and treatment into CF care.","Smith, Georgiopoulos, Mueller, Abbott, Lomas, Aliaj, Quittner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2021.08.027","20211221","Anxiety; COVID-19; Cystic fibrosis; Depression; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24226,""

"Long-acting injectable antipsychotic (LAI) prescribing trends during COVID-19 restrictions in Canada: a retrospective observational study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on how mental health services are delivered to patients throughout Canada. The reduction of in-person healthcare services have created unique challenges for individuals with psychotic disorders that require regular clinic visits to administer and monitor long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications. To better understand how LAI usage was impacted, national and provincial patient-level longitudinal prescribing data from Canadian retail pharmacies were used to examine LAI prescribing practices during the pandemic. Prescribing data on new starts of medication, discontinuations of medications, switches between medications, antipsychotic name, concomitant medications, payer plan, gender and age were collected from January 2019 to December 2020 for individuals Ã¢â€°Â¥18-years of age, and examined by month, as well as by distinct pandemic related epochs characterized by varying degrees of public awareness, incidence of COVID-19 infections and public health restrictions. National, and provincial level data revealed that rates of LAI prescribing including new starts, discontinuations and switches between LAI products remained highly stable (i.e., no statistically significant differences) throughout the study period. Equal numbers of LAI new starts and discontinuations prior to and during the pandemic suggests prescribing of LAI antipsychotics, for those already in care, continued unchanged throughout the pandemic. The observed consistency of LAI prescribing contrasts with other areas of healthcare, such as cardiovascular and diabetes care, which experienced decreases in medication prescribing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","McKee, Crocker, Tibbo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03646-9","20211221","COVID-19; Long-acting injectable antipsychotics; Prescribing data; Psychotic disorders; Schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24228,""
"Acute respiratory infection symptoms and COVID-19 testing behaviour: results based on South Australian health surveys","Effective syndromic surveillance alongside COVID-19 testing behaviours in the population including in higher risk and hard to reach subgroups is vital to detect re-emergence of COVID-19 transmission in the community. The aim of this paper was to identify the prevalence of acute respiratory infection symptoms and coronavirus testing behaviour among South Australians using data from a population based survey. We used cross-sectional data from the 2020 state-wide population level health survey on 6857 respondents aged 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and above. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the risk factors and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the factors associated with the acute respiratory infection symptoms and coronavirus testing behaviour after adjusting for gender, age, household size, household income, Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander status, SEIFA, Country of birth, number of chronic diseases, wellbeing, psychological distress, and mental health. We found that 19.3% of respondents reported having symptoms of acute respiratory infection and the most commonly reported symptoms were a runny nose (11.2%), coughing (9.9%) and sore throat (6.2%). Fever and cough were reported by 0.8% of participants. Of the symptomatic respondents, 32.6% reported seeking health advice from a nurse, doctor or healthcare provider. Around 18% (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°130) of symptomatic respondents had sought testing and a further 4.3% (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°31) reported they intended to get tested. The regression results suggest that older age, larger household size, a higher number of chronic disease, mental health condition, poor wellbeing, and psychological distress were associated with higher odds of ARI symptoms. Higher household income was associated with lower odds of being tested or intending to be tested for coronavirus after adjusting for other explanatory variables. There were relatively high rates of self-reported acute respiratory infection during a period of very low COVID-19 prevalence and low rate of coronavirus testing among symptomatic respondents. Ongoing monitoring of testing uptake, including in higher-risk groups, and possible interventions to improve testing uptake is key to early detection of disease.","Joshi, D'Onise, Nolan, Davis, Glass, Lokuge","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12359-3","20211221","ARI; COVID-19; Coronavirus testing; Population survey; Syndromic surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24229,""
"Parent and child mental health trajectories April 2020 to May 2021: Strict lockdown versus no lockdown in Australia","To control a second-wave COVID-19 outbreak, the state of Victoria in Australia experienced one of the world's first long and strict lockdowns over July-October 2020, while the rest of Australia experienced 'COVID-normal' with minimal restrictions. We (1) investigate trajectories of parent/child mental health outcomes in Victoria vs non-Victoria and (2) identify baseline demographic, individual and COVID-19-related factors associated with mental health trajectories. Online community sample of 2004 Australian parents with rapid repeated assessment over 14 time-points over April 2020 to May 2021. Measures assessed parent mental health (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21), child depression symptoms (13-item Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire) and child anxiety symptoms (four items from Brief Spence Children's Anxiety Scale). Mental health trajectories shadowed COVID-19 infection rates. Victorians reported a peak in mental health symptoms at the time of the second-wave lockdown compared to other states. Key baseline predictors, including parent and child loneliness (standardized regression coefficient [ÃŽÂ²] = 0.09-0.46), parent/child diagnoses (ÃŽÂ² = 0.07-0.21), couple conflict (ÃŽÂ² = 0.07-0.18) and COVID-19 stressors, such as worry/concern about COVID-19, illness and loss of job (ÃŽÂ² = 0.12-0.15), predicted elevated trajectories. Effects of predictors on parent and child mental health trajectories are illustrated in an online interactive app for readers (https://lingtax.shinyapps.io/CPAS_trend/). Our findings provide evidence of worse trajectories of parent and child mental health symptoms at a time coinciding with a second COVID-19 outbreak involving strict lockdown in Victoria, compared to non-locked states in Australia. We identified several baseline factors that may be useful in detecting high-risk families who are likely to require additional support early on in future lockdowns.","Westrupp, Greenwood, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, Olsson, Sciberras, Mikocka-Walus, Melvin, Evans, Stokes, Wood, Karantzas, Macdonald, Toumbourou, Teague, Fernando, Berkowitz, Ling, Youssef","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211065365","20211221","COVID-19 pandemic; child mental health; couple conflict; mental health; parenting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-22","",24230,""
