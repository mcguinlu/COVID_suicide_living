"The COvid-19 Pandemic and Exercise (COPE) Trial: A multi-group randomized controlled trial comparing effects of an app-based, at-home exercise program to waitlist control on depressive symptoms","Background: The number of adults across the globe with significant depressive symptoms has grown substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The extant literature supports exercise as a potent behavior that can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in clinical and non-clinical populations. Objective: Using a suite of mobile applications, at-home exercise, including high intensity interval training (HIIT) and/or yoga, was completed to reduce depressive symptoms in the general population in the early months of the pandemic. Methods: A 6-week, parallel, multi-arm, randomized controlled trial was completed with 4 groups: [1] HIIT, [2] Yoga, [3] HIIT+Yoga, and [4] waitlist control (WLC). Low active, English-speaking, non-retired Canadians aged 18-64 years were included. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and weekly following randomization. Results: A total of 334 participants were randomized to one of four groups. No differences in depressive symptoms were evident at baseline. The results of latent growth modeling showed significant treatment effects for each active group compared to the WLC, with small effect sizes in the community-based sample of participants. Treatment groups were not significantly different from each other. Effect sizes were very large when restricting analyses only to participants with high depressive symptoms at baseline. Conclusions: At-home exercise is a potent behavior to improve mental health in adults during the pandemic, especially in those with increased levels of depressive symptoms. Promotion of at-home exercise may be a global public health target with important personal, social, and economic implications as the world emerges scathed by the pandemic.","Eli Puterman; Benjamin Hives; Nicole Mazara; Nikol Grishin; Joshua Webster; Stacey Hutton; Michael Koehle; Yan Liu; Mark Beauchamp","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.14.21255519","20210420","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13007,""
"Coronavirus awareness, confinement stress, and mental health: Evidence from Honduras, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico and Spain","The purpose of the current study was to analyze the influence of coronavirus awareness, psychological stress responses, and sociodemographic variables on mental health indicators (somatization, depression, and anxiety) in residents of Honduras, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Spain. The study used a quantitative, cross-sectional approach. Data was collected online using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18); the Coronavirus Awareness Scale-6 (CAS-6) and a questionnaire that included psychological and sociodemographic questions. The total sample size consisted of 1559 respondents from Honduras (34%), Chile (29%), Costa Rica (17%), Mexico (11%), and Spain (9%). The most common stress domains correspond to family (22.97%), financial (22.53%), academic (16.47%), leisure time constraints (14.23%), health (12.48%), peer group (7.63%), and religious concerns (3.69%). These domains are significantly associated with the respondent's country, sex, employment status, and being or not a health worker. Respondents who reported confinement stress also reported higher scores in anxiety, depression, and somatization. The Global Severity Index was significantly predicted by confinement stress, health, academic, and leisure time-related stress, sex, age, being a health worker, COVID-19 Personal Concern, and Perceived Seriousness. Non-significant predictors were employment status, the number of people at home, presence of older adults and children at home, financial, peer group, family, and religious concerns; the regression model had an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.26. Similar analyses were conducted for somatization, depression, and anxiety subscales. The COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on the mental health of the general population, particularly regarding anxiety, depression, and somatization. Specific populations, such as women and healthcare workers, are at particular risk of suffering a deterioration in mental wellbeing. The implications of the study for public policy are discussed.","Landa-Blanco, MejÃƒÂ­a, Landa-Blanco, MartÃƒÂ­nez-MartÃƒÂ­nez, VÃƒÂ¡squez, VÃƒÂ¡squez, Moraga-Vargas, Echenique, Del Cid, Montoya","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113933","20210419","Confinement; Coronavirus; Health psychology; Mental health; Pandemics; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13008,""
"OCD during COVID-19: Understanding clinical and non-clinical anxiety in the community","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a great deal of anxiety for many individuals. Several papers have noted that individuals with OCD may be particularly negatively impacted by COVID-19, and that the threat of COVID-19 may impact treatment (Banerjee, 2020; Jassi etÃ‚Â al., 2020; Sheu etÃ‚Â al., 2020). The study presented herein examined OCD-related and COVID-related intrusions in a non-patient sample. Individuals with elevated OCD symptoms reported having both OCD and COVID intrusions at a similar frequency. Further, OCD symptom severity was significantly correlated with the frequency of COVID related intrusions and the amount of distress they caused. However, distress from COVID related intrusions was not significantly correlated with OCD symptom severity. These results shed light on the similarities between reactions to objectively elevated threat and the perceptions of elevated threat experienced in OCD.","Acenowr, Coles","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113910","20210419","CBT; COVID-19; Coping; Fear; Mental health; OCD; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13009,""
"Pediatric Trainees as Parents: Perspectives from a Pandemic","Resident parents are at the intersection of converging challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and their perspective has yet to be explored. This qualitative study aimed to identify themes related to the experience of pediatric resident parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed semi-structured interviews with pediatric residents who were also parents. Using thematic analysis, transcripts were analyzed iteratively until theoretical sufficiency was achieved. 12 residents were interviewed from 9 pediatric residency programs. Five major themes, representing conflicts or tensions experienced by participants, were defined by the data: (1) Duty as a doctor versus duty as a parent; (2) Balance of work obligations versus childcare challenges; (3) Appreciation of added support versus worry about peers' perceptions of accommodations; (4) Gratitude for the recognition of challenges faced by resident parents versus fear of reversion to the norm; and (5) Protective impact of parenthood versus challenges to mental health. Both parents and healthcare workers faced innumerable challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this exploration of the experiences of pediatric resident parents provides a unique lens for examining the tensions that this group faced. Our results may allow residency programs to better support their pediatric resident parents during this crisis.","Wilder, Hark, Marcus, Rabinowitz, Michelson, Winn, Pingree","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2021.04.006","20210419","COVID-19 pandemic; parenthood; residency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13010,""
"COVID-SCORE Spain: Public perceptions of key government COVID-19 control measures","Spain was initially one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, the COVID-SCORE-10 study reported that the Spanish public's perception of their government's response to the pandemic was low. This study examines these perceptions in greater detail. We employed an ordered logistic regression analysis using COVID-SCORE-10 data to examine the Spanish public's perception of ten key aspects of their government's COVID-19 control measures. These included support for daily needs, mental and general health services, communication, information and coordination, which were examined by gender, age, education level, having been affected by COVID-19, and trust in governmentÃ‚Â´s success in addressing unexpected health threats. Ã‚Â´Trust in the governmentÃ‚Â´ showed the greatest odds of positive perception for the ten measures studied. Odds of positive perception of communication significantly varied by gender, education level, and having been affected by COVID-19, whereas for information and coordination of disease control, odds significantly varied by gender and having been affected by COVID-19. Odds of positive perception for access to mental health services significantly varied by gender and education level. Age was not significant. Public perception of the government's pandemic response in Spain varied by socio-demographic and individual variables, particularly by reported trust in the government. Fostering public trust during health threats may improve perception of response efforts. Future efforts should tailor interventions that consider gender, education level, and whether people have been affected by COVID-19.","White, Cash-Gibson, Martin-Moreno, Matesanz, Crespo, Alfonso-Sanchez, Villapol, El-Mohandes, Lazarus","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab066","20210419","COVID-19; Spain; pandemic control; public health policy; public perception; trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13011,""
"A Resilience-Building App to Support the Mental Health of Health Care Workers in the COVID-19 Era: Design Process, Distribution, and Evaluation","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased strain on health care systems and negative psychological effects on health care workers. This is anticipated to result in long term negative mental health effects on the population, with health care workers (HCWs) representing a particularly vulnerable group. The scope of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development of a scalable mental health platform to provide services to large numbers of at risk or affected individuals. The Mount Sinai Health System in New York City was at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. To address the current and anticipated psychological impact the pandemic has had on the HCWs in the health system, a Center for Stress, Resilience, and Personal Growth (CSRPG) was created. The mission of the Center is to support the resilience and mental health of employees through educational offerings, outreach and clinical care. Our aim was to build a mobile application to support the newly founded Center in its mission. We built the app as a standalone digital platform that hosts a suite of tools which users can interact with on a daily basis. With consideration for the Center's aims, we determined the overall vision, initiatives, and goals for the Wellness Hub app, followed by specific milestone tasks and deliverables for development. We defined the app's primary features based on the mental health assessment and needs of HCWs. Feature definition was informed by the results of a resilience survey widely distributed to Mount Sinai HCWs, and by the resources offered at CSRPG, including workshop content. We launched our app over the course of two phases, the first phase being a &quot;soft&quot; launch and the second being a broader launch to all of Mount Sinai. Of the 231 health care workers who downloaded the app, 173 completed our baseline assessment of all mental health screeners in the app. Results from the baseline assessment show that more than half of users demonstrate a need for support in at least one psychological area. As of three months after the phase 2 launch, approximately 55% of users re-entered the app after their first opening to explore additional features, with an average of 4 app openings per person. To address the mental health needs of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Wellness Hub app was built and deployed throughout the Mount Sinai Health System. To our knowledge, this is the first resilience app of its kind. The Wellness Hub app is a promising proof of concept, with room to grow, for those who wish to build a secure mobile health app to support their employees, communities, or others in managing and improving mental and physical well-being. It is a novel tool offering mental health support broadly.","Golden, Zweig, Danieletto, Landell, Nadkarni, Bottinger, Katz, Somarriba, Sharma, Katz, Marin, DePierro, Charney","https://doi.org/10.2196/26590","20210419","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13012,""
"Conducting internet-based visits for onboarding populations with limited digital literacy onto an mHealth intervention: Development of a Patient-Centered Approach","COVID-19 pandemic has propelled patient-facing research to shift to digital and telehealth strategies. If strategies are not adapted for minority patients of lower SES, health inequality will further increase. Patient-centered models of care can successfully improve access and experience for minority patients. To present the development process and preliminary acceptability of altering in-person to internet-based remote onboarding procedures for a mobile health intervention, among a population with limited digital literacy. We actively recruited safety-net patients (English and Spanish speaking adults with diabetes and depression receiving care at a public healthcare delivery system in San Francisco) into a randomized trial of text messaging support for physical activity. Because of the COVID pandemic, we converted in-person recruitment/onboarding procedures into internet-based remote processes with human support during the COVID pandemic, and conducted a preliminary examination of how the composition of recruited patients might have changed from pre-COVID to COVID enrollment periods. First, we analyzed the digital profiles of patients (n=32) who had participated in previous in-person onboarding sessions prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, we documented all changes made to our onboarding processes to account for remote recruitment, especially the changes needed for patients who were not as familiar with downloading apps onto their phone on their own. Finally, we utilized the new study procedures to recruit patients (n=11) during COVID-19's social distancing period. Patients recruited during the COVID-19 were also asked about their experience enrolling into a fully digitized mobile health intervention. Patient recruitment across both pre-COVID and COVID time periods (N=43) demonstrated relatively high rates of smartphone ownership but lower self-reported digital literacy. 32.6% (14 out of 43 participants) overall reported needing help with their smartphone and apps. Significant changes made to onboarding procedures included: a) the facilitation of app download via Zoom and/or a standard phone calls and b) implementation of brief, one-on-one staff-patient interactions to provide technical assistance personalized to each patient's digital literacy skills. Comparing recruitment pre-COVID (i.e. in-person) to COVID (i.e., remote), the proportion of patients with digital literacy barriers went from 34.4% (11 out of 32 participants pre-COVID) to 27.3% (3 out of 11 participants COVID). Differences in digital literacy scores for pre-COVID and COVID cohorts were not significant (P=.485). Patients of lower SES have high interest in using digital platforms to manage their health, but may require additional upfront human support to gain access. Overall, one-on-one staff-patient partnerships allowed us to provide unique technical assistance personalized to each patient's digital literacy, with simple strategies to troubleshoot patient barriers upfront. These additional remote onboarding strategies can mitigate but not eliminate digital barriers for patients without extensive technology experience.

"Mobile Sensing Apps and Self-management of Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: an Online Survey","In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, people had to adapt their daily life routines to the public health measures in place, which is likely to have resulted in a lack of social contacts in person, physical activity or sleep. Such changes can have a significant impact on mental health. Mobile sensing apps can passively record the daily life routines of people making them aware of maladaptive behavioral adjustments to the pandemic. This study aimed to explore the views of people on mobile sensing apps passively recording behaviors and their potential to increase awareness and helpfulness for self-managing mental health during the pandemic. We conducted an anonymous online survey including people with and without mental disorders asking them to rate the helpfulness of mobile sensing apps for the self-management of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey took place in May, 2020. The majority of participants particularly those with a mental disorder (72%) perceived mobile sensing apps as very or extremely helpful for managing their mental health by becoming aware of maladaptive behaviors. The perceived helpfulness of mobile sensing apps was also higher among people experiencing a stronger impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.24; 95% CI, 0.16-0.33; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), having a better understanding of technology (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.17; 95% CI, 0.08-0.25; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and a higher education (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.1; 95% CI, 0.02-0.19; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02).

"Anxiety and COVID-19: A study of online content readability","The uncertain and unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic is anxiety-provoking and some people are seeking information about this anxiety online. The purpose of this study was to assess the readability levels of online articles related to anxiety and COVID-19. The first 50 English language URLs to appear in a Google search in July 2020 were assessed for readability using Readable.io. A five-measure panel consisting of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Gunning Fog Index, Coleman-Liau Index (CLI), the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) Grade Level, and Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease (FRE) was used, and grade level scores were recoded as easy, average, and difficult readability. Websites were grouped as commercial <i>vs.</i> noncommercial sources bases on the URL. Of the 50 articles evaluated, the majority were found to be written at a difficult (&gt;10th grade) reading level with four of the five measures employed which is well above the 7-8th grade reading level abilities of most Americans. Given the importance of access to mental health information during the pandemic, it is crucial that the resources available to the general public are written at a reading level that is comprehensible to ensure they are understood.","Seidel, Hillyer, Basch","https://doi.org/10.1080/10852352.2021.1908874","20210419","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; health information; mental health; readability; seeking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13015,""

"Opioid-related Emergency Department Visits During COVID-19 in a Large Health System","Multiple states have reported increases in opioid overdose deaths during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, however little is known about opioid-related presentations to the emergency department (ED). This was a time series analysis of visits to 7 EDs in greater Chicago, Illinois from October 20, 2019 to July 25, 2020. We compared the number of ED visits for opioid-related diagnoses in the time period preceding the World Health Organization pandemic declaration (prepandemic period, October 20, 2019-July 3, 2020) to the time period following the World Health Organization declaration (pandemic period, March 8, 2020 to July 25, 2020) using a single-group interrupted time series analysis with Newey-West standard errors. We also present data on alcohol-related ED visits for comparison. We evaluated a total of 177,405 visits across the 7 EDs during the study period. The mean number of weekly ED visits in the prepandemic and pandemic periods was 4841 and 4029 weekly visits, respectively. In the interrupted time series analysis, there was no significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on opioid-related ED visits (-0.44 visits per 1000 ED visits, 95% CI -2.47 to 1.58, PÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.66), however, there was a significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on alcohol-related ED visits (-4.1, 95% CI: -8.25 to -0.01, PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). Despite reductions in overall ED visit volumes and alcohol-related visits during COVID-19, the number of opioid-related visits was not significantly reduced during the early pandemic.

"Youth and the COVID-19 crisis: Lessons learned from a human rights-based prevention programme for youths in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil","Youths living in crowded impoverished urban areas face higher risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2. This article presents lessons learned from a preventive intervention project intersected by the COVID-19 crisis that moved from a mix-methods study design to online ethnography. The 'home-officed' research team e-witnessed high-school students' daily lives and collaborated in youths' and community-based organisations' responses in the territories where they study and live. Psychosocial distress increased, also driven by the disastrous governmental response to the health and economic crises. There was growing anxiety about meeting friends and dating, with structural limits for sustaining the recommended social distancing, which added to gender/sexuality-based violence. Simultaneously, we observed students becoming relevant actors through co-producing preventive practices, surpassing risk-group notions and combining SARS-CoV-2 prevention with sexuality, gender, racism and mental-health issues. They managed internet-mediated applications to promote critical thinking and collective actions aimed at health promotion among their peers, from their homes. Freire's concept of 'untested-feasibility' fostered researchers', students' and community leaders' imaginations in the face of this unprecedented crisis, thereby enhancing social responses to the epidemic to become rights-based comprehensive dialogical preventive activities. This ongoing intervention-research stresses how prevention sciences can go beyond reduction of this pandemic to a viral event.","Paiva, Garcia, FranÃƒÂ§a-Jr, da Silva, GaleÃƒÂ£o-Silva, SimÃƒÂµes, Ayres","https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1916055","20210419","Brazil; COVID-19; adolescents; prevention; school","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13022,""
"Substance use and mental health in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic","<b>Objectives</b>: We examined the prevalence of substance use as a coping mechanism and identified relationships between maternal mental health over time and use of substances to cope during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among pregnant women in the U.S.A.<b>Methods</b>: Self-reported repeated measures from 83 pregnant women were collected online in April 2020 and May 2020. Women retrospectively reported their mental/emotional health before the pandemic, as well as depression, stress, and substance use as a result of the pandemic at both time points. Linear regression measured cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between mental health and substance use.<b>Results</b>: Pre-COVID-19 reports of poorer mental/emotional health (<i>b</i> =Ã‚Â 0.46) were significantly (<i>p &lt;Ã‚Â </i>.05) associated with number of substances used to cope with the pandemic. Elevated stress (<i>b</i> =Ã‚Â 0.35) and depressive symptoms (<i>b</i> =Ã‚Â 0.27) and poorer mental/emotional health (<i>b</i> =Ã‚Â 0.14) in April were also significantly related to higher numbers of substances used in May (<i>p &lt;Ã‚Â </i>.05).<b>Conclusion</b>: Pregnant women's psychological well-being may be a readily measured indicator substance use risk during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Ischemic Stroke in the Young","The purpose of this article is to address several challenging questions in the management of young patients (those age 60 and under) who present with ischemic stroke. Do genetic thrombophilic states, strongly associated with venous thrombosis, independently cause arterial events in adults? Should cases of patent foramen ovale be closed with mechanical devices in patients with cryptogenic stroke? What are the optimal treatments for cerebral vein thrombosis, carotid artery dissection, and antiphospholipid syndrome and are DOACs acceptable treatment for these indications? What is the mechanism underlying large vessel stroke in patients with COVID-19? This is a narrative review. We searched PubMed and Embase and American College of physicians Journal club database for English language articles since 2000 looking mainly at randomized clinical trials, Meta analyses, Cochran reviews as well as some research articles viewed to be cutting edge regarding anticoagulation and cerebrovascular disease.

"Custodial Grandparent's Job Loss During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Relationship With Parenting Stress and Mental Health","Involuntary job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic adds challenges, especially for custodial grandparents that are taking care of grandchildren. Grandparents are relatively vulnerable, and they need more attention and support when facing the negative impacts of COVID-19. This study analyzed cross-sectional survey data collected from 234 custodial grandparents via Qualtrics Panels in June 2020 in the United States. After using the propensity score weighting adjustment, results from logistic and ordinary least squares regression showed that compared with grandparents that did not lose their job during the pandemic, grandparents that did had more parenting stress and worse mental health. Moderation analysis also showed that social support was a significant moderator of the relationship between job loss and mental health, but not the relationship between job loss and parenting stress. The findings and implications are discussed.","Wu, Xu, Jedwab","https://doi.org/10.1177/07334648211006222","20210419","COVID-19; grandparents; mental health; parenting stress; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13025,""
"Social isolation and loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study of US Adults over 50","The potential impact of social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic on social isolation and loneliness is of increasing global concern. Although many studies focus primarily on loneliness, patterns of social isolation-particularly physical and digital isolation-are understudied. We examined changes in social isolation, physical isolation, digital isolation, and loneliness in US adults over 50 before and during the lockdown. Two waves of the Health and Retirement Study, a national panel sample of US adults over 50 years old, were used. Fixed-effects regression models were fitted to identify within-person change from 2016 to 2020 to examine the impact of social distancing policies during the pandemic. There was an increase in physical isolation and social isolation among respondents during the COVID-19 social distancing policies. However, respondents experienced no change in digital isolation or loneliness. The increase in physical isolation was only present for people with high COVID-19 concern whereas people with low concern experienced no change in physical isolation. Despite an increase in physical isolation due to the social distancing policies, US adults aged over 50 stayed connected through digital contact and were resilient in protecting themselves from loneliness.","Peng, Roth","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab068","20210419","Digital isolation; Mental health; Social relationships; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13026,""
"Mental health services in primary care: Evidence for the feasibility of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic",": This study examined the transition to telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of attendance rates, the provision of evidence-based interventions, and clinical outcomes. : The feasibility of in-person versus telehealth visits for integrated primary care sessions was compared using chart review data. Data on patient characteristics, attendance, symptom severity and improvement, and evidence-based intervention use were collected for patients (N =173) from an integrated primary clinic that primarily serves a low-income, diverse sample of adults and children whose primary presenting problems are depression and anxiety. : Attendance significantly improved after the transition to telehealth, as indicated by fewer cancellations and more appointments attended. Patients showed significant improvement and decreases in symptoms. The quality of care was maintained, as indicated by consistent evidence-based intervention use over time. : This study was limited by the fact that it took place in an academicallyaffiliated primary care clinic, which may not be representative of all community settings.

"The identification of needs and development of best practice guidance for the psychological support of frontline healthcare workers during and after COVID-19: A protocol for the FLoWS project","Recent estimates suggest that up to 34% of frontline workers in healthcare (FLWs) at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic response are reporting elevated symptoms of psychological distress due to resource constraints, ineffective treatments, and concerns about self-contamination. However, little systematic research has been carried out to assess the mental health needs of FLWs in Europe, or the extent of psychological suffering in FLWs within different European countries of varying outbreak severity. Accordingly, this project will employ a mixed-methods approach over three work packages to develop best-practice guidelines for alleviating psychological distress in FLWs during the different phases of the pandemic. Work package 1 will identify the point and long-term prevalence of psychological distress symptoms in a sample of Irish and Italian FLWs, and the predictors of these symptoms. Work package 2 will perform a qualitative needs assessment on a sample of Irish and Italian FLWs to identify sources of stress and resilience, barriers to psychological care, and optimal strategies for alleviating psychological distress in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Work package 3 will synthesise the findings from the preceding work packages to draft best practice guidelines, which will be co-created by a multidisciplinary panel of experts using the Delphi method. The guidelines will provide clinicians with a framework for alleviating psychological distress in FLWs, with particular relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, but may also have relevance for future pandemics and other public health emergencies.","Flynn, O'Connor, Hanlon, Bellani, Contreras, Doherty, Durand, Fallon, Gormley, Laffey, Molloy, Sarma, Strepparava, Russo, Walsh, McGuire","https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13117.1","20210419","Best practice guidelines; COVID; Frontline workers; Pandemic; Psychological distress; Support needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13028,""

Four major dimensions are identified: I) outbreaks, II) viral structure and function, III) vaccine and therapeutic development, and IV) coronaviruses found in a range of animals. The &quot;outbreaks&quot; dimension is by far the most prominent, dominated by reports on the three recent major outbreaks: COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The focus of research on major outbreaks is on public health and clinical research, with focus on disease characterization, diagnosis, transmission, and clinical course. Notably, certain clinically important areas, such as mental health during outbreaks and viral surveillance, among others, did not stand out as identifiable specialties or topics in the coronavirus research landscape.

"Encouraging a Little Help from Our Friends: Resident Physician Burnout &amp; Peer Communication Curriculum","Resident physician burnout and depression rates are increasing faster than in the non-physician workforce. To foster a supportive community where such concerns may be addressed, residents can be educated in identification and first-line support of burnout in fellow residents. The literature has not described peer roleplaying applied toward aiding fellow residents with burnout. This pilot study evaluated an educational component aimed at fostering a strong emotional and informational social support system. The curriculum used peer roleplaying to develop self-awareness and social support, improve communication skills, and teach about existing mental health resources, thereby encouraging intervention. Residents listed behavioral manifestations of burnout and dysphoria that we developed into real-life scenarios. During experiential workshops, residents roleplayed &quot;distressed&quot; and &quot;helper&quot; residents and practiced communicating empathy. To tackle mental health stigma, all were required to practice expressing distress and seeking help. Residents completed a pre-roleplaying questionnaire, curriculum satisfaction questionnaire, and reflection essay. All 42 Internal Medicine and Transitional Year residents (69% male, 93% international medical graduates) participated. Resident-reported comfort, competence, confidence, and knowledge increased, as did positive appraisals of the clinical teaching environment representing a safe atmosphere. Six themes were cited in &gt;25% of essays: knowledge of communication techniques, knowledge of approach tactics or strategies, knowledge of hospital resources, commitment to helping colleagues, importance of burnout, and belief this training produced a better understanding of oneself. As first-witnesses of resident physician distress, peers occupy an underutilized, yet crucial preventive and supportive role in burnout and mental health intervention, especially during times of shared crises such as the coronavirus pandemic. Creating roleplays from personal experiences facilitated meaningful discussion of burnout and dysphoric emotions. Roleplaying offered a low-cost, effective method to destigmatize and encourage discussion of burnout, educate on signs and symptoms, and learn available resources to offer an afflicted colleague in osteopathic and allopathic residency programs.","Lovegrove Lepisto","https://doi.org/10.51894/001c.22044","20210419","burnout; curriculum; mental health stigma; residents; roleplaying","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13030,""
"Primary Disease Prevention for Southwest American Indian Families During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Camp in a Box","The goal of the American Indian Youth Wellness Camp in a Box was to engage, educate and empower families to improve their health and overall well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Camp in a Box was a 9-week program, inclusive of a 1-week intensive camp component followed by an 8-week booster component with content focused on nutrition, mental health and physical activity education. The Camp in a Box is a Tribal/Urban Indian-University partnership, and materials were developed to replace an existing weeklong residential camp and to comply with social distancing guidelines. Fourteen American Indian families from Tribal/Urban Indian communities in the southwestern United States participated (36 children aged 2-18 years; 32 adults). The intensive camp week included daily materials for families to complete together, Monday through Friday. Materials were provided for approximately 4Ã‚Â h of activities per day. The booster sessions began after camp week and included approximately 4Ã‚Â h of supplementary activities designed to be completed at any time most convenient for the family over the course of the week. Activities were designed to encourage interaction among family members with materials and supplies for parents and youth to participate. Self-reported outcomes suggested that families changed their eating habits to include more vegetables, less sweets and junk food. Parents reported an increase in family physical activity and that the activities brought the family closer together. Our Camp in a Box program was feasible and well-received until school began. During camp week, 100% of recruited families participated; at Booster Week 8, ten families (71%) remained enrolled and active.

"Development and Dissemination of a Strengths-Based Indigenous Children's Storybook: &quot;Our Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine: Overcoming COVID-19&quot;","The traditions, strengths, and resilience of communities have carried Indigenous peoples for generations. However, collective traumatic memories of past infectious diseases and the current impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in many Indigenous communities point to the need for Indigenous strengths-based public health resources. Further, recent data suggest that COVID-19 is escalating mental health and psychosocial health inequities for Indigenous communities. To align with the intergenerational strengths of Indigenous communities in the face of the pandemic, we developed a strengths- and culturally-based public health education and mental health coping resource for Indigenous children and families. Using a community-engaged process, the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health collaborated with 14 Indigenous and allied child development, mental health, health communications experts and public health professionals, as well as a Native American youth artist. Indigenous collaborators and Indigenous Johns Hopkins project team members collectively represented 12 tribes, and reservation-based, off-reservation, and urban geographies. This group shared responsibility for culturally adapting the children's book &quot;My Hero is You: How Kids Can Fight COVID-19!&quot; developed by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings and developing ancillary materials. Through an iterative process, we produced the storybook titled &quot;Our Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine: Overcoming COVID-19&quot; with content and illustrations representing Indigenous values, experiences with COVID-19, and strengths to persevere. In addition, parent resource materials, children's activities, and corresponding coloring pages were created. The book has been disseminated online for free, and 42,364 printed copies were distributed to early childhood home visiting and tribal head start programs, Indian Health Service units, tribal health departments, intertribal, and urban Indigenous health organizations, Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health project sites in partnering communities, schools, and libraries.

"Fibrinolytic Serine Proteases, Therapeutic Serpins and Inflammation: Fire Dancers and Firestorms","The making and breaking of clots orchestrated by the thrombotic and thrombolytic serine protease cascades are critical determinants of morbidity and mortality during infection and with vascular or tissue injury. Both the clot forming (thrombotic) and the clot dissolving (thrombolytic or fibrinolytic) cascades are composed of a highly sensitive and complex relationship of sequentially activated serine proteases and their regulatory inhibitors in the circulating blood. The proteases and inhibitors interact continuously throughout all branches of the cardiovascular system in the human body, representing one of the most abundant groups of proteins in the blood. There is an intricate interaction of the coagulation cascades with endothelial cell surface receptors lining the vascular tree, circulating immune cells, platelets and connective tissue encasing the arterial layers. Beyond their role in control of bleeding and clotting, the thrombotic and thrombolytic cascades initiate immune cell responses, representing a front line, &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; system for inducing inflammatory responses. These hemostatic pathways are one of the first response systems after injury with the fibrinolytic cascade being one of the earliest to evolve in primordial immune responses. An equally important contributor and parallel ancient component of these thrombotic and thrombolytic serine protease cascades are the <i>ser</i>ine <i>p</i>rotease <i>in</i>hibitors, termed <i>serpins</i>. Serpins are metastable suicide inhibitors with ubiquitous roles in coagulation and fibrinolysis as well as multiple central regulatory pathways throughout the body. Serpins are now known to also modulate the immune response, either via control of thrombotic and thrombolytic cascades or via direct effects on cellular phenotypes, among many other functions. Here we review the co-evolution of the thrombolytic cascade and the immune response in disease and in treatment. We will focus on the relevance of these recent advances in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a &quot;respiratory&quot; coronavirus that causes extensive cardiovascular pathogenesis, with microthrombi throughout the vascular tree, resulting in severe and potentially fatal coagulopathies.","Yaron, Zhang, Guo, Haydel, Lucas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.648947","20210419","coagulation; fibrinolysis; infection; inflammation; serine protease; serpin; thrombolysis; virus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13033,""

"T Cells Plead for Rejuvenation and Amplification; With the Brain's Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides We Can Make It Happen","T cells are essential for eradicating microorganisms and cancer and for tissue repair, have a pro-cognitive role in the brain, and limit Central Nervous System (CNS) inflammation and damage upon injury and infection. However, in aging, chronic infections, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, cancer, chronic stress, depression and major injury/trauma, T cells are often scarce, exhausted, senescent, impaired/biased and dysfunctional. People with impaired/dysfunctional T cells are at high risk of infections, cancer, other diseases, and eventually mortality, and become multi-level burden on other people, organizations and societies. It is suggested that &quot;Nerve-Driven Immunity&quot; and &quot;Personalized Adoptive Neuro-Immunotherapy&quot; may overcome this problem. Natural Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides: Glutamate, Dopamine, GnRH-II, CGRP, Neuropeptide Y, Somatostatin and others, bind their well-characterized receptors expressed on the cell surface of naÃƒÂ¯ve/resting T cells and induce multiple direct, beneficial, and therapeutically relevant effects. These Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides can induce/increase: gene expression, cytokine secretion, integrin-mediated adhesion, chemotactic migration, extravasation, proliferation, and killing of cancer. Moreover, we recently found that some of these Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides also induce rapid and profound decrease of PD-1 in human T cells. By inducing these beneficial effects in naÃƒÂ¯ve/resting T cells at different times after binding their receptors (<i>i.e</i>. NOT by single effect/mechanism/pathway), these Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides by themselves can activate, rejuvenate, and improve T cells. &quot;Personalized Adaptive Neuro-Immunotherapy&quot; is a novel method for rejuvenating and improving T cells safely and potently by Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides, consisting of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. The patient's scarce and/or dysfunctional T cells are activated <i>ex vivo</i> once by pre-selected Neurotransmitters and/or Neuropeptides, tested, and re-inoculated to the patient's body. Neuro-Immunotherapy can be actionable and repeated whenever needed, and allows other treatments. This adoptive Neuro-Immunotherapy calls for testing its safety and efficacy in clinical trials.","Levite","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.617658","20210419","Adoptive Cell Therapy; Dopamine; Glutamate; Immunotherapy; Nerve-Driven Immunity; Neuropeptides; Neurotransmitters; T cells","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13035,""
"COVID-19: Are School Counseling Services Ready? Students' Psychological Symptoms, School Counselors' Views, and Solutions","The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on high school students' psychological symptoms and to understand how ready counselors and school counseling services are based on the data we have. Therefore, this research is designed under two different studies: (A) Study 1: Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on students' psychological symptoms and (B) Study 2: Views and expectations of students and school counselors about school counseling services. The first study was a quantitative study and included 549 high school students (398 female, 151 male). A structural equation model (SEM) was created to examine the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on participants' psychological symptoms. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores showed that 107 (19.50%) individuals had a score of 50 and above pointing out that individuals in this group had severe impact of event/trauma symptomologies. The SEM analysis indicated that IES-R scores had a total effect of 0.79 on anxiety, 0.75 on depression, 0.74 on negative self-concept, 0.68 on somatization, and 0.66 on hostility scores. Furthermore, female students had significantly higher scores on anxiety, depression, negative self-concept, somatization, hostility, and impact of events variables than male students. Study 2 was a qualitative design and consisted of five school counselors and five students from different schools. The results indicated that students' difficulties during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak were educational, cognitive, emotional, physiological, relational, technological, and related to routines. Academic, social, emotional, and behavioral issues came to the fore among the difficulties that can be experienced if students start face-to-face education. On the other hand, the school counselors listed that family relations, personal-social, emotional, and academic themes were the difficulties experienced by the students at the beginning of the COVID-19. In addition, when COVID-19 started, the services offered by school counselors were discussed under (1) services for the student, (2) services for the family, and (3) services for the teacher. Finally, according to the opinions of the school counselors, if students start face-to-face education, they may experience emotional, academic, and relational difficulties. In summary, it is vital that student personality services be prepared and implemented by school counseling services for schools based on the results.","Karaman, EÃ…Å¸ici, Tomar, Aliyev","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647740","20210419","COVID-19; counseling services; high school students; psychological symptoms; school counselors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13036,""
"Do Social Connections and Digital Technologies Act as Social Cure During COVID-19?","Although COVID-19 pandemic has re-orientated humans to be more physically healthy and hygienic, it has also persuaded humans to create affiliations and experience a sense of belongingness through social networks and digital technologies. However, amidst these changes, experiences of COVID-19 patients and their perception of the outside world's attitudes toward them appears to be less attended in literature which formed the basis for the current study's objectives. Using qualitative methodology, the present study explored the experiences, perceptions and attitudes of patients and their care-givers' toward COVID-19. The thematic analysis emerged with four major themes. Psychological Experiences of People was generated prominently with sub-themes indicating the perceived experiences like fear of spreading diseases to others, and the need for psychological counseling. Attitude of others toward patients and caregivers revealed that family members and relatives played a major positive role on the patient's mental health, however, the neighbor's stigmatized attitude led to several undesired behaviors. Social Connectedness was another major theme derived from the study. Altruistic volunteers, a sub-theme of Social connectedness have indicated that amidst these negative factors, one can spread social harmony by motivating and supporting the victims with basic needs, financial support, hope and social empathy. Opinions of participants for digital technology through technological aids and preventive measures emphasized an overall positive attitude as it helped the society, in general to maintain social connections as well to curb the rate of COVID-19 cases.","Pandey, Astha, Mishra, Greeshma, Lakshmana, Jeyavel, Rajkumar, Prabhu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.634621","20210419","altruistic volunteers; belongingness; social empathy; social support; undesired behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13037,""
"An Exploratory Study of Police Officers' Perceptions of Health Risk, Work Stress, and Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Outbreak in China","How do the police officers perceive health risk, psychological distress, and work stress during the COVID-19 outbreak in China? This study explores the health risk perception, work stress, and psychological distress of police officers who worked at the front line to implement lockdown measures. We conducted a large-scale field survey (<i>N</i> = 5,611) with police officers sample in the northwestern part of China from February 29 to March 7, 2020. Independent-sample <i>T</i>-test and ANOVA were used to analyze whether there are differences in health risk perception, work stress, and psychological distress between different groups. The regression analysis was employed to figure out the factors that influence police officers' psychological distress. Results showed a gender difference in perceiving work stress among police officers. Also, police officers with chronic disease perceived higher health risks, more psychological distress, and higher work stress. Additionally, police officers above 45 years old significantly perceived higher health risks than young officers did. It also revealed that working hours contribute to police officers' health risk perception, psychological distress, and work stress. Finally, our results highlight that age, working hours, chronic disease, health risk perception, and work stress significantly contribute to police officers' psychological distress. Our research verifies that there is a gender difference in perceiving work stress among police officers. Police officers with ongoing medical issues and above 45 years old suffer more during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Our research suggests that the government should pay more attention to their physical health and mental health. The heavy workload containing the COVID-19 extends police officers' working hours, causing higher health risks, work stress, and psychological distress. This study contributes to the psychological distress literature and provides a way forward to other countries struggling to contain the COVID-19.","Huang, Bodla, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.632970","20210419","COVID-19; health risk perception; police officers; psychological distress; work stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13038,""
"Psychological Health, Sleep Quality, Behavior, and Internet Use Among People During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the risk of suicide, uncertainty, mental stress, terror, annoyance, weariness, financial issues, and frustration. We aim to determine the prevalence of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and their associated factors among Libyan populations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the civil war. <b>Methods:</b> An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among the Libyan population between July 18 and August 23, 2020. The data collected included basic demographic characteristics, level of education, employment status, COVID-19-related questions, and questions about abuse and domestic violence. This study assessed the psychological status of participants who were screened for anxiety symptoms using the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Depressive symptoms were also screened for using the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Binomial logistic regression was used to predict the probability of insomnia, anxiety and depressive symptoms. <b>Results:</b> A total of 10,296 responses were recorded. Among the participants, 4,756 (46.2%) obtained a cut-off score of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 which indicated depressive symptoms. For anxiety, 1,952 participants (19%) obtained a cut-off score of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 15, which indicated anxiety symptoms. For the ISI, the mean (SD) was 11.4 (6.1) for the following categories: no clinical insomnia (0-7) 3,132 (30.4%), sub-threshold insomnia (1-7) 3,747 (36.4%), moderate severity clinical insomnia (8-14) 2,929 (28.4%), and severe clinical insomnia (15-21) 488 (4.7%). Logistic regression analysis showed that depressive symptoms were statistically associated with age, marital status, education level, occupational category, financial problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, health status, having a COVID-19 infection, current health status, suicide ideation, abuse or domestic violence, and lockdown compliance (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The regression analysis revealed a statistically significant association between anxiety symptoms and age, education level, occupational status, financial problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, having a COVID-19 infection, health status, suicide ideation, abuse or domestic violence, and lockdown compliance (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The regression analysis revealed a statistically significant association between insomnia and all study variables with the exception of age, educational level, and occupational status (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Confronted with the COVID-19 outbreak, the Libyan population exhibited high levels of psychological stress manifested in the form of depressive and anxiety symptoms, while one-third of the Libyan population suffered from clinical insomnia.

"Spiritual Well-Being and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy","During the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, people and families experienced a new and sudden situation that forced them to stay in their homes for a long period (February 25- May 26). In this context, many people found themselves in great difficulty, not only because of the fear of contagion or the economic problems deriving from the closure of production activities but also because the virus profoundly changed the way of life in society. The &quot;Social distancing&quot; concept became central in all personal relationships, including close family relationships. In this situation, our paper seeks to understand the role of spirituality and religiosity in reacting to this difficult situation and in particular on the physical and psychological health of the people involved. The data we present here are part of a multidisciplinary research with a quantitative theoretical framework. As the data was collected during the first Italian lockdown, a total of 1,250 adults from all over Italy participated in the on-line questionnaire. Among the main results it emerged that the participants perceived lower levels of spiritual well-being and mental health than the pre-pandemic situation with a significant gender difference; in fact, women perceived lower mental health than men. At the same time, it is evident that spirituality and religious practices are a protective factor connected not only with psychological and mental but also physical health. Finally, it appears evident that the family is a protective factor with respect to mental health, even in a period so full of stress factors, those who did not live alone and especially those who had to take care of small children reported higher perceived mental health and a greater ability to activate coping resources.","Coppola, Rania, Parisi, Lagomarsino","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.626944","20210419","COVID-19; Italy; mental health; mourning process; religious ritual; spiritual well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13040,""
"Prevalence of Mental Health Problems and Its Associated Factors Among Recovered COVID-19 Patients During the Pandemic: A Single-Center Study","<b>Introduction:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is profoundly affecting the mental health status. Although the burden of mental health problems has been reported in the general population and health care workers, little is known about the prevalence of mental health disorders among recovered COVID-19 patients and their associated factors. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional telephonic-study of recovered COVID-19 patients with and without a history of hospitalization was conducted from April 20 to June 20, 2020, in Tehran, Iran. We assessed the anxiety symptoms, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among participants, using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) and PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the risk factors associated with mental health problems. <b>Results:</b> A total of 602 individuals with a mean age of 53.2 years (SD: 14.7), completed the study. The rates of mental health symptoms among the respondents were 5.8% (95% CI: 4.2-7.8%) for anxiety, 5.0% (95% CI: 3.5-7.0%) for depression, and 3.8% (95% CI: 2.3-5.3%) for PTSD disorders. Moreover, being younger than 50 years and female gender was significantly associated with a higher probability of reporting anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for being younger than 50 years, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.02 for female gender). <b>Conclusions:</b> The current study indicated that patients with COVID-19 presented features of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. These results may help implement appropriate mental health intervention policies for those at risk and minimize the mental health consequences of the COVID-19.","Khademi, Vaziri-Harami, Shams","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.602244","20210419","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13041,""
"Assessment of global asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and management practices from China","With ongoing research, it was found that asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was widespread in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) populations. Studies have confirmed asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 have potential infectivity, and most of the transmission occurred before symptoms appear. Asymptomatic infection rates varied widely in different countries and regions. Identifying the asymptomatic infected persons and cutting off the infection source is an effective way to prevent the spread of this disease. However, asymptomatic patients have hidden clinical symptoms, and screening based only on the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 can easily lead to a missed diagnosis. Therefore, determining asymptomatic infection patients by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is the gold standard. A series of prevention and control measures adopted by the Chinese government, especially the &quot;Four Early&quot; policy, have achieved outstanding achievements, which are worth learning from by other countries.","Chen, Wang, Mao, Ye","https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.59374","20210419","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; asymptomatic infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13042,""
"Frequency and perceived effectiveness of mental health providers' coping strategies during COVID-19","There has been an emphasis on understanding the detrimental effects of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on individuals' wellbeing. Healthcare workers, including mental health providers, may experience increased emotional and behavioral health concerns to a greater degree than the general public. The objective of the present study was to examine the frequency and the perceived effectiveness of various coping strategies implemented by mental health practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as differences across career stages (i.e., trainees versus licensed practitioners [LPs]). Survey data were collected from mental health practitioners (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°888) assessing the strategies they used to manage COVID-19-associated anxiety/distress and the perceived effectiveness of these strategies. Bonferroni-adjusted chi-square tests and <i>t</i>-tests were conducted to assess differences by career stage. Overall, respondents used various coping strategies, most commonly behavioral strategies such as distraction/engaging in an enjoyable activity (88.63%), spending time with loved ones (77.82%), and exercise (72.64%). Over one-quarter reported using alcohol to cope (28.27%). Respondents generally perceived their coping strategies as <i>somewhat</i> to <i>very effective</i>; no strategies were generally perceived as ineffective. Compared to LPs, trainees were significantly more likely to manage COVID-19-related anxiety/distress using supervision (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and substances other than alcohol or tobacco (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). There were no significant differences in how effective trainees and LPs perceived each strategy. U.S. mental health practitioners' use of predominantly behavioral coping strategies, which were generally perceived as effective, during the first months of COVID-19 offers implications for interventions as the pandemic progresses.","Reilly, Soulliard, McCuddy, Mahoney","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01683-x","20210419","COVID-19; Coping strategies; Mental health; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13043,""
"How are OCD patients and their families coping with the COVID-19 pandemic? A qualitative study","Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are likely to be affected by the COVID-19 crisis since fear of contamination is highly prevalent in this illness and disease reminders are omnipresent during this crisis. The current study aimed to investigate the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown on the mental health, well-being and coping abilities of OCD patients and their families in order to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the disorder. Twenty-two patients and 13 family members were interviewed one-to-one about their experiences and challenges caused by the pandemic and home-confinement directives. Verbatim transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Five overarching themes were identified: (1) changing point of reference: confusion and legitimization of OCD behavior, (2) coping strategies were challenged: too much or too little exposure to obsessional concerns, (3) distress but also relief in some areas, (4) developing a new equilibrium within the family, (5) changes in accessibility and nature of therapy: perils and merits of online treatment. These findings make clear the importance of the accessibility of mental health services during this pandemic through direct patient contacts or in a remote format. In therapy therapists should focus on challenging the changing point of reference, providing practical advice on coping, stimulating to engage in exposure and encouraging patients to seek social support. Furthermore, it is important to involve family members in therapy to support and coach them to be validating, supportive and encouraging, without accommodating to the OCD behaviour.","Tandt, Van Parys, Leyman, Purdon, Lemmens","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01724-5","20210419","COVID-19; Family accommodation; Lockdown; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13044,""

"Understanding Psychological Distress and Protective Factors Amongst Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study examined the emotional distress and loneliness during COVID-19 and the roles of resiliency and activities. A cross-sectional national survey. Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) and Prolific Research Platforms. Five hundred and one U.S. dwelling English-speaking adults 60 years old and older. Participants completed an online survey with the PHQ-9; GAD-7; Short Health Anxiety Inventory; 3-item UCLA Loneliness scale; PROMIS measures of global health, instrumental, and emotional support; 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale; and COVID-19 needs assessment. Across the sample 13% reported moderate depressive symptoms, 9% reported moderate anxiety symptoms, and 26% endorsed being &quot;lonely.&quot; The emotionally distressed group endorsed more loneliness, lower resiliency, less physical exercise, and worse physical health. The low Socio-Economic Status group endorsed less loneliness, less likely to engage in physical exercise and worse physical health.The lonely group endorsed less resilience, less physical exercise, and worse physical health. A multiple logistic regression found that resilience, socioeconomic status, and physical health were significant predictors of loneliness, whereas global health was the best predictor of emotional distress. Even after prolonged social distancing, older adults in this study did not report greater psychological distress compared to earlier studies of older adults during COVID-19. Older adults with lower SES, worse physical health, and less resiliency, were more likely to report more loneliness.

The Western Regional Alliance for Pediatric Emergency Management held an integrated, interdisciplinary national tabletop exercise to familiarize mental health and non-mental health professionals with Psychological Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (PsySTART), an evidence-based triage and incident management system used to evaluate new mental health risk impacts following exposure to traumatic events such as COVID-19. Participants were exposed to three practice cases that reflected a combination of &quot;all hazards&quot; scenarios and were asked to triage each case using PsySTART. Participants were asked to interpret results both at an individual site and aggregate county and/or state level. The exercise had a total of 115 participants with a total of 156 discrete triage encounters. A user-defined operating picture was created with graphs of aggregate mental health risk data, generating cross-regional, real-time situational awareness. After the exercise, vast majority of the participants reported confidence in their ability to use PsySTART in their practices.

"Pregnant women's psychological state and influence factors: anxiety, and depression during COVID-19 outbreak","The outbreak of COVID-19 affects both physical and mental health of pregnant women. This study focuses on their psychological status, and analyzes the main factors affecting their emotions of pregnant women so as to provide guidance for psychological counseling and social intervention during epidemics. Multiple researchers distributed a questionnaire online via the Internet. Pregnant women volunteered, and the questionnaire was automatically collected in the background. The 298 valid questionnaires recovered showed that 82 cases of pregnant women were in states of anxiety, accounting for 27.51%, of which 78.05% were mild (82 cases), 19.51% were moderate (16 cases), and 2.44% were severe (2 cases). Moreover, 31.21% of pregnant women were in states of depression (93 cases), of which 52.69% were mild (49 cases), 40.86% were moderate (38 cases), and 6.45% were severe (6 cases). The risk factors for states of anxiety or depression were fear of fetal malformation or genetic disease, history of adverse pregnancy, can't do routine prenatal examination, and insufficient support and care from husbands and families. Besides, 16 cases had sought psychological help during the epidemic, among whom 62.50% (10 cases) experienced anxiety, 68.75% (11 cases) had depression. During the outbreak of COVID-19, obstetricians may take use of the Internet, based on the advantages in epidemic prevention, controlling health education, and popularizing science.

"How do employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young workers? A systematic review","To assess the quality of the research about how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young workers, and to summarize the available evidence. We undertook a systematic search of three databases using a tiered search strategy. Studies were included if they: (a) assessed employment conditions such as working hours, precarious employment, contract type, insecurity, and flexible work, or psychosocial workplace exposures such as violence, harassment and bullying, social support, job demand and control, effort-reward imbalance, and organizational justice; (b) included a validated mental health measure; and (c) presented results specific to young people agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°30Ã‚Â years or were stratified by age group to provide an estimate for young people agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°30Ã‚Â years. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool. Nine studies were included in the review. Four were related to employment conditions, capturing contract type and working hours. Five studies captured concepts relevant to psychosocial workplace exposures including workplace sexual harassment, psychosocial job quality, work stressors, and job control. The quality of the included studies was generally low, with six of the nine at serious risk of bias. Three studies at moderate risk of bias were included in the qualitative synthesis, and results of these showed contemporaneous exposure to sexual harassment and poor psychosocial job quality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes among young workers. Longitudinal evidence showed that exposure to low job control was associated with incident depression diagnosis among young workers. The findings of this review illustrate that even better studies are at moderate risk of bias. Addressing issues related to confounding, selection of participants, measurement of exposures and outcomes, and missing data will improve the quality of future research in this area and lead to a clearer understanding of how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young people. Generating high-quality evidence is particularly critical given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on young people's employment. In preparing for a post-pandemic world where poor-quality employment conditions and exposure to psychosocial workplace exposures may become more prevalent, rigorous research must exist to inform policy to protect the mental health of young workers.","Shields, Dimov, Kavanagh, Milner, Spittal, King","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02077-x","20210418","Employment conditions; Mental health; Psychosocial workplace exposure; Review; Risk of bias; Work; Young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13049,""

"Self-help cognitive behavioral therapy application for COVID-19-related mental health problems: A longitudinal trial","Recently, the availability and usefulness of mobile self-help mental health applications have increased, but few applications deal with COVID-19-related psychological problems. This study explored the intervention efficacy of a mobile application on addressing psychological problems related to COVID-19. A longitudinal control trial involving 129 Chinese participants with depression symptoms was conducted through the mobile application &quot;Care for Your Mental Health and Sleep during COVID-19&quot; (CMSC) based on WeChat. Participants were divided into two groups: mobile internet cognitive behavioral therapy (MiCBT) and wait-list. The primary outcome was improvement in depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes included improvement in anxiety and insomnia. The MiCBT group received three self-help CBT intervention sessions in one week via CMSC. The MiCBT group showed significant improvement in depression and insomnia (allP &lt; 0.05) compared with the wait-list group. Although both groups showed significant improvement in anxiety at the intervention's end, compared with the wait-list group, the MiCBT group had no significant advantage. Correlation analysis showed that improvement in depression and anxiety had a significant positive association with education level. Changes in insomnia were significantly negatively correlated with anxiety of COVID-19 at the baseline. CMSC was considered helpful (n=68, 81.9 %) and enjoyable (n=54, 65.9 %) in relieving depression and insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak. CMSC is verified to be effective and convenient for improving COVID-19-related depression and insomnia symptoms.

A retrospective study was performed analyzing claims data from a large German Hospital network during the COVID-19 outbreak (study period: March 13-May 21, 2020) as compared to periods directly before the outbreak (same year control: January 1-March 12, 2020) and one year earlier (previous year control: March 13-May 21, 2019). A total of 13,151 emergency hospital admissions for psychiatric diagnoses were included in the analysis. For all psychiatric diagnoses combined, emergency admissions significantly decreased during the study period with mean (interquartile range) incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 0.68 (0.65, 0.71) and 0.70 (0.67, 0.73) as compared to the same and previous year controls, respectively (both pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00001). IRR ranged from 0.56 for mood affective disorders (F30-F39) to 0.75 for mental disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19; all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00001). Mean (standard deviation) length of hospital stay for all psychiatric diagnoses was significantly shorter during the study period [9.8 (11.6) days] as compared to same [14.7 (18.7) days] and previous [16.4 (23.9) days] year controls (both pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00001). Both emergency hospital admissions and length of hospital stay significantly decreased for psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak. It needs to be assessed in further studies whether healthcare systems will face increased demand for the provision of mental health care in the nearer future.","Fasshauer, Bollmann, Hohenstein, Hindricks, Meier-Hellmann, Kuhlen, Broocks, Schomerus, Stengler","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02091-z","20210418","COVID-19; Emergency admission; Length of stay; Psychiatric disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13052,""
"Adaptations to Indiana's 21st Century Curesâ€“funded recovery coaching initiative in the wake of COVID-19","This brief commentary discusses how provider organizations from Indiana's Recovery Coach and Peer Support Initiative (RCPSI) adapted their practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions. The RCPSI, which is funded through the 21st Century Cures Act, placed peer recovery coaches (PRCs) in emergency departments (EDs) to link opioid overdose patients to medication for opioid use disorder. This commentary discusses how COVID-19 restrictions increased use of telehealth to replace in-person PRC contacts with patients, affected the timing of initial PRC contacts with patients, and led to allowances for Medicaid billing of recovery coach support sessions conducted via telehealth. Future research should further determine the effects of these changes on PRC services in the ED.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108390","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13053,""
"Differential impacts of COVID-19 across racial-ethnic identities in persons with opioid use disorder","Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health disparities, particularly among at-risk people with opioid use disorder (OUD). We sought to characterize the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on this group to understand how the pandemic has affected this group, this group's public health response to COVID-19, and whether there were differences by race/ethnicity. Methods This study recruited its sample from a drug treatment setting in the northeast region of the United States. We surveyed 110 individuals on methadone as treatment for OUD and assessed COVID-19-related impacts on their health behaviors and other indices of social, physical, and mental well-being, including sexual health behaviors, substance use, mental health status, health care access, income, and employment. Results Our findings highlight overall increases in depression, anxiety, loneliness, and frustration among the sample of people with OUD; the study also observed decreases in financial stability. Significant differences between groups indicated a greater financial burden among racial-ethnic minorities; this subgroup also reported greater direct adverse effects of COVID-19, including being more concerned about contracting COVID-19, not being able to get a COVID-19 test, and knowing someone who had died from COVID-19. A greater proportion of Whites indicated increases in alcohol consumption and nonâ€“prescription drug use than did racial-ethnic minorities. Conclusions Treatment providers must be vigilant in managing direct and indirect outcomes of COVID-19 among people with OUD. Findings highlight the need to develop culturally competent, differentiated interventions in partnership with community-based organizations to meet the unique challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic presents for people in treatment for OUD.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108387","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13054,""
"How emergency department visits for substance use disorders have evolved during the early COVID-19 pandemic","Objective Higher opioid overdoses and drug use have reportedly occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide evidence on how emergency department (ED) visits for substance use disorders (SUD) changed in the early pandemic period. Methods Using retrospective data from Januaryâ€“July 2020 compared to Januaryâ€“July 2019, we calculated weekly 2020/2019 visit ratios for opioid-related, alcohol-related, other drugâ€“related disorders, and all non-COVID-19 visits. We assess how this ratio as well as overall visit numbers changed after the mid-March 2020 onset of general pandemic restrictions. Results In 4.5 million ED visits in 2020 and 2019 to 108 EDs in 18Â U.S. states, SUD visits were higher in early 2020 compared to 2019. During the peak-pandemic restriction period (March 13â€“July 31), non-COVID-19, non-SUD visits fell by approximately 45% early on, and then partly recovered with an average decline of 33% relative to 2019 levels. Visits for opioid-related, alcohol-related, and other drugâ€“related disorders also declined, although less sharply, with an average drop of 17%, which was similar across SUD types. The visit ratios for 2020/2019 partially or fully recovered later in our sample period, depending on SUD type, but did not exceed early-2020 levels. However, substantial variation occurred across SUD types and across states. SUD visit declines were most prominent in the 65+ age group, except for alcohol-related visits where trends were similar across ages. SUD visits arriving by ambulance declined less or increased relative to self-transport visits, and ED deaths were rare. Conclusions The 2020/2019 ratios of SUD ED visits fell substantially early in the COVID-19 pandemic, yet less than non-SUD, non-COVID ED visits. SUD ED visit ratios partly or fully recovered to 2019 levels by early June 2020, but did not exceed early 2020 ratios.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108391","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13055,""

"Emotion regulation difficulties and interpersonal problems during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Predicting anxiety and depression","Background: Central components of psychological functioning, such as difficulties in emotion regulation and interpersonal problems are likely to have been substantially impacted by COVID-19 and the amelioration measures of societal lock-down and social distancing. In turn, these factors are likely to predict mental health outcomes, such as symptoms of depression and anxiety throughout the pandemic and beyond. Methods: To investigate this issue, we conducted an internet-based survey with 10,061 responders at the height of lock-down (T1). After social distancing measures had been eased (T2), 4,936 responders (49.1%) completed the survey again. Results: Emotion regulation difficulties, interpersonal problems, and symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased from T1 to T2, but changes were minor. After controlling for age and gender, emotion regulation- and interpersonal difficulties were associated with anxiety and depression throughout the study period, and changes in all domains occurred in concert. More extensive problems with emotion regulation at T1 predicted greater reductions in both symptom domains as amelioration measures were eased, while the converse was true for interpersonal problems. Furthermore, the impact of initial emotion regulation difficulties on subsequent changes in both anxiety- and depressive symptoms was dependent on the level of interpersonal difficulties, so that high interpersonal problem load at T1 reversed the effect of emotion regulation difficulties on symptom development. Conclusions: The results suggest that emotion regulation- and interpersonal difficulties are highly central to mental health during the pandemic, and may be important targets for remediation to reduce mental health problems throughout the course of the pandemic and beyond.","Ole Andre Solbakken et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600D-235-39C","20210420","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; longitudinal multilevel analyses; interpersonal problems; mental health; emotion; emotion regulation difficulties; anxiety; covid-19; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13057,""
"Bereavement from COVID-19 and Depressive Symptoms among Older Adults in Europe","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has left older adults around the world grieving the sudden death of relatives and friends. We examine if COVID-19 bereavement corresponds with older adultsâ€™ depressive symptoms in 27 countries, and test for variation by gender and country context. Methods: We analyze SHARE COVID-19 data collected between June-August 2020 from N=51,383 older adults (age 50â€“104) living in 27 countries, of whom 1,363 reported the death of a relative or friend from COVID-19. We estimate pooled-multilevel logistic regression models to examine if COVID-19 bereavement was associated with depressive symptoms and worsening depressive symptoms, and we test whether the COVID-19 mortality rate in their country has an additive or multiplicative influence. Results: COVID-19 bereavement is associated with significantly higher odds of reporting depressive symptoms, and reporting that these symptoms have recently worsened. Net of personal loss, living in a country with the highest COVID-19 mortality rate is associated with womenâ€™s depressive symptoms but not menâ€™s. However, the COVID-19 mortality rate does not moderate the implications of personal loss for depressive symptoms. Discussion: COVID-19 deaths have lingering mental health implications for surviving older adults. Even as the collective toll of the crisis is apparent, bereaved older adults are in particular need of mental health support.","Haowei Wang et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46219-154-957","20210420","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-20","",13058,""
