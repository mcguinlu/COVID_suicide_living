"Doomscrolling: Prospective associations between daily COVID news exposure, internalizing symptoms, and substance use among sexual and gender minority individuals assigned female at birth","Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated associations between COVID news exposure, anxiety, and depression. However, longitudinal research examining the directionality of these associations is extremely limited. Further, most studies have focused on the general population and neglected sexual and gender minority individuals (SGM), a population disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. To address these limitations, the current study utilized data from a 30-day diary study of SGM assigned female at birth (N = 429). We examined concurrent and prospective associations between COVID news exposure, depressed and anxious affect, COVID distress, substance use, and motives for use. Further, we examined associations between cumulative COVID news exposure across the diary period and prospective changes in anxiety, depression, and COVID distress. When participants were exposed to more COVID news, they experienced more depressed and anxious affect, more COVID distress, less positive affect, and were more likely to use alcohol and cannabis to cope. Further, when participants were exposed to more COVID news, they experienced subsequent increases in depressed affect, decreases in positive affect, and increases in the likelihood of using cannabis to cope. Findings also provided evidence of bidirectional prospective associations between COVID news exposure and COVID distress and of a cumulative impact of COVID news exposure on anxiety, depression, and COVID distress. Findings suggest that individuals should balance the need to remain informed about the pandemic and their own mental health when considering how much COVID news to consume. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Results indicate that when sexual and gender minority individuals assigned female at birth were exposed to more COVID news, they felt more anxious and depressed, were more worried about COVID, and were more likely to turn to substances to cope. Many of these effects persisted into the next day. These findings suggest that it is necessary to balance the need to stay informed about COVID with reducing the mental health effects of COVID news exposure by determining a maximum level of healthy engagement with the media, consuming higher quality media over a larger quantity of media, and determining which media outlets may encourage healthy engagement with COVID news.

"Technology-Assisted, Group-Based CBT for Rural Adultsâ€™ Depression: Open Pilot Trial Results","Purpose: This pilot study assesses the association of Raising Our Spirits Together (ROST), a technology-assisted, group-based cognitive behavioral therapy for depression, with rural adultsâ€™ depressive symptoms and anxiety. Method: Nine adults from rural Michigan participated in an open pilot of ROST. Clergy facilitated pilot groups. The pilot began in February 2020 in-person. Due to COVID-19, the pilot was completed virtually. Results: Mean depressive symptom scores, based on the PHQ-9, significantly decreased from pre-treatment (M = 14.4) to post-treatment (M = 6.33;t (8) = 6.79;P &lt; .001). Symptom reduction was maintained at 3-month follow-up (M = 8.00), with a significant pattern of difference in depressive symptoms over time (F(2) = 17.7;P &lt; .001;eta-squared = .689). Similar patterns occurred for anxiety based on the GAD-7. Participants attended an average of 7.33 of 8 sessions. Fidelity ratings were excellent. Discussion: ROST is a potentially feasible intervention for rural adultsâ€™ depressive symptoms. ROST offers a promising model for increasing treatment access and building capacity in rural areas.","Weaver, Addie, Zhang, Anao, Landry, Caroline, Hahn, Jessica, McQuown, Lynne, Oâ€™Donnell, Lisa A.; Harrington, Meghan M.; Buys, Trevor, Tucker, Katherine M.; Pfeiffer, Paul, Kilbourne, Amy M.; Grogan-Kaylor, Andrew, Himle, Joseph A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Technology-Assisted,+Group-Based+CBT+for+Rural+Adultsâ€™+Depression:+Open+Pilot+Trial+Results","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Research on social work practice; 32(2):131-145, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33211,""
"â€œItâ€™s Not a Cookie-Cutter Scenario Anymoreâ€: the COVID-19 Pandemic and Transitioning to Virtual Work","The COVID-19 pandemic forced human services agencies, including child support agencies, to find ways to continue providing services. Many agencies considered changes to where and how staff work, in addition to new modalities for service provision. This paper explores how five Wisconsin child support agencies approached staff work arrangements and service delivery during the pandemic;challenges and opportunities encountered;changes agencies expect to persist;and implications for policy and practice.Â Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with child support directors and staff in five Wisconsin counties between January and February, 2021. Data were analyzed thematically.Â Despite limited information and little prior experience working virtually, county agencies rapidly adapted staff work arrangements and service delivery methods to facilitate service continuity. Strategies used by agencies varied across counties, given local directives, resources, and constraints, and as the pandemic evolved. Despite variation, counties contended with a similar array of decision points, including changes to physical spaces, office closures, and staff work locations. Agencies also implemented creative strategies to connect with customers and keep services accessible. Findings suggest that innovative combinations of traditional and newer methods can help agencies maximize reach. Further, the infrastructure and experiences counties gained by working in new ways offer increased flexibility and improved capacity for service continuity in the future. Policymakers could support these efforts by providing guidance related to confidentiality and data security;supporting and facilitating crisis contingency planning;coordinating information exchanges;procuring technology and resources;and advocating for infrastructure, particularly broadband internet.","Vogel, Lisa Klein, Yeo, Vee","https://www.google.com/search?q=â€œItâ€™s+Not+a+Cookie-Cutter+Scenario+Anymoreâ€:+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+and+Transitioning+to+Virtual+Work","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Policy Practice and Research; 3(2):132-172, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33212,""
"Youth social innovation during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines: a quantitative and qualitative descriptive analyses from a crowdsourcing open call and online hackathon","Introduction Young people have played a pivotal role as part of the COVID-19 response, including developing health messages and social innovations. Social innovation in health engages multiple stakeholders in linking social change and health improvement. The study examined the feasibility of youth ideas and innovations to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using quantitative and qualitative descriptive analyses. Methods In partnership with the WHO, academic institutions, youth organisations and civil society groups, we conducted a crowdsourcing open call among Filipino youth (15â€“30 years old) using a structured Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases/Social Innovation in Health Initiative process. The open call had three categories: youth voices to cocreate the post-COVID-19 world (entries were texts, images, videos and music), youth-led COVID-19 social innovations, and youth-led social innovations not related to COVID-19. Each submission was evaluated by three independent judges. Finalists were selected in each of the categories alongside four grand winners. All finalists were invited to attend a 1 day online civic hackathon. Results We received a total of 113 entries (youth voices to cocreate the post-COVID world=76;youth-led COVID-19 social innovations=17;youth-led social innovations not related to COVID-19=20). Twelve entries focused on youth mental health during the pandemic. The online hackathon provided the participants mentorship for further development of their ideas. Finalists were able to produce draft health communication campaigns and improved social innovations. Conclusion Many Filipino youth created exceptional entries in response to the open call. This suggests the feasibility of including youth voices in strategic planning processes. A global youth social innovation call is recommended.","Ulitin, Allan, Mier-AlpaÃ±o, Jana Deborah, Labarda, Meredith, Juban, Noel, Mier, Abigail Ruth, Tucker, Joseph D.; Tang, Weiming, Auplish, Mallika, Chan, Po-lin","https://www.google.com/search?q=Youth+social+innovation+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+the+Philippines:+a+quantitative+and+qualitative+descriptive+analyses+from+a+crowdsourcing+open+call+and+online+hackathon","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Innovations;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33213,""

"Impact of COVID-19 and telehealth on mental health in Bangladesh: a propensity score matching approach","COVID-19 have deteriorated mental health conditions in Bangladesh. The study aims to examine the impact of COVID-19 on mental health conditions through the propensity score matching method and establish the relationship between telehealth usage on mental health improvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearest neighbor matching approach has been used to match treatment unit to nearest comparison unit and achieved balance between treatment and control groups on observable traits. A cross-sectional study on 89 participants was conducted from April to June 2020. ATE (average treatment effect) & ATET (average treatment effect of treated) techniques were used. Logistic regression was used to examine the causal relationship between telehealth usage on mental health improvement. The coefficient of ATE on the population was -Â 0.026, stating that on average, participants with no past physical health problems had fewer mental health issues than the participants with a past physical health problem. The coefficient on ATET was -Â 0.034. The association between telehealth usage on mental health improvement was highly significant as p value = 0.00 &lt; 0.05 with OR of 70 at 95% CI.

"â€œLife is Hardâ€: How the COVID-19 Pandemic Affected Daily Stressors of Women","The COVID-19 pandemic radically and rapidly altered Americansâ€™ daily life as they navigated quarantines, school closings, job insecurity, and disrupted social activities. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women who have reported higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression related to the pandemic compared to men. The study explored how the COVID-19 pandemic affected daily stressors of women. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected simultaneously using an online questionnaire from female participants (N=531) who were 18 years of age or older and residing, employed, or accessing health care in Arkansas. A qualitative descriptive approach was used to summarize and synthesize participantsâ€™ experiences and perceptions. Qualitative data allowed respondents to describe their lived experiences of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected them from their perspective. Four primary themes related to participantsâ€™ experiences of stress related to the COVID-19 outbreak are reported: 1) employment and expenses, 2) social distancing, 3) caregiving, and 4) emotional/mental health. Several subthemes emerged within primary themes. The study documented respondentsâ€™ lived experiences and how COVID-19 stress increased anxiety, depression, fear, and frustration. These findings contribute important nuances about womenâ€™s experiences of stress caused by COVID-19 and can inform future health policies to address womenâ€™s health post-pandemic and in future health crises. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature as the first article that uses qualitative methods to document sources of COVID-19 pandemic stress for women in their own words.","Purvis, Rachel S.; Ayers, Britni L.; Rowland, Brett, Moore, Ramey, Hallgren, Emily, McElfish, Pearl A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=â€œLife+is+Hardâ€:+How+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+Affected+Daily+Stressors+of+Women","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Dialogues in Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33220,""

"â€˜It was kinda like DIY closureâ€™ Using Photovoice to capture the experiences of final year social work students graduating amidst the pandemic","This article examines a recent research project that explored the lived experiences of 5 final year social work students in Scotland who graduated during the coronavirus pandemic. The project used Photovoice as the primary data collection method, followed by a 3 hour long online focus group where the participants and the researcher worked collaboratively to identify themes for further analysis. The findings demonstrated that while the data collected by participants through the photographs and captions were highly personal to each participant, there were recurring themes that connected all of them which were identified broadly as;(dis)connection, closure and identity â€“ all of which were discussed in great detail in a virtual focus group after the data was collected. This article focusses predominantly on the Photovoice method adopted for the study and how this was an effective method for participatory research. This article also focusses on how the pandemic affected the transitionary period between the participantsâ€™ identity shift from students to professionals. This study followed the principles of Participatory Action Research which meant that participants and the researcher worked together to cultivate and analyse the data collected and the findings that are discussed here reflect this collaborative process. As this report is being written, numerous new studies, reports and predictions as to the pandemics impact on our collective mental health emerge daily and so it is hoped that this project will serve as a small time stamp as to how the pandemic impacted this small group of students in Scotland and will honour their stories, creating a lasting space for them to be heard among the ever-increasing bombardment of news.","McGookin, Naomi Katie","https://www.google.com/search?q=â€˜It+was+kinda+like+D.I.Y+closureâ€™.+Using+Photovoice+to+capture+the+experiences+of+final+year+social+work+students+graduating+amidst+the+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Qualitative social work : QSW : research and practice;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33223,""

"Changes of COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Vaccination Willingness Among Residents in Jinan, China","Background Vaccine hesitancy is responsible for low vaccine coverage and increased risk of epidemics. The purpose of this study was to assess whether public knowledge, attitudes, practices, and willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 have changed over time and at different stages of vaccination. Methods Two consecutive surveys were conducted among residents of the Leshan Community in Jinan from May to June, 2021 (n = 423) (basic dose vaccination phase) and from December, 2021 to January, 2022 (n = 470) (booster vaccination phase). Randomly sampling was used in residents to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to compare the changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices of the subjects in different survey stages. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore factors related to vaccination hesitancy. Results In the booster vaccination phase, protective behaviors (89.9%) of residents increased significantly compared with the basic vaccination phase (74.5%). Residents were more hesitant to receive booster doses than basal doses of COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 18.334, 95% CI: 9.021â€“37.262). Residents with other marital statuses (OR: 2.719, 95% CI: 1.632â€“4.528), negative attitudes toward government measures were more hesitant to get vaccinated (OR: 2.576, 95% CI: 1.612â€“4.118). People who thought their physical condition was very good or good were more likely to be vaccinated than those who thought they were in fair or poor health (OR: 0.516, 95% CI: 0.288â€“0.925;OR: 0.513, 95% CI: 0.295â€“0.893). Young people inclined to use new media (such as WeChat and microblog) to obtain information, while the elderly inclined to use traditional methods (such as television). Government propaganda, residents' perception of the importance of vaccines and the risk of disease were the main reasons for accelerating residents to vaccinate. The main reasons affecting residents' lack of vaccination were contraindications to the vaccine or inconvenient time for vaccination. Conclusions Vaccine hesitancy increased significantly with change in vaccination stage. Strategies should be adopted to increase vaccination coverage such as improving the convenience of vaccination, promoting through multiple channels.","Jiang, Ning, Yang, Cheng, Yu, Wenjing, Luo, Liyan, Tan, Xin, Yang, Liping","https://www.google.com/search?q=Changes+of+COVID-19+Knowledge,+Attitudes,+Practices+and+Vaccination+Willingness+Among+Residents+in+Jinan,+China","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in public health; 10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33227,""

"An examination of risk and protective factors on the mental health of first- and second-generation immigrant adults during an exclusionary policy context in the United States","Purpose: This cross-sectional study was designed to examine the impacts of three risk factors (i.e., Trump-era policy stress, incidents of discrimination, and COVID-19 exposure) and two protective factors (i.e., resilience and social support) on mental health status. Methods: Data were collected via an online survey with first- and second-generation immigrant adults (n = 447). Hierarchical linear regression was employed to assess the risk and protective factors, in addition to demographic characteristics, on anxiety and depression scores. Results: Trump-era policy stress and discrimination predicted higher symptoms of both anxiety and depression. In terms of protective factors, resilience and social support each had a significant inverse relationship with anxiety and depression scores. Conclusion: Findings contribute to the knowledge base of risk and protective factors during a stringent immigration policy context and pandemic in the United States.

"Coping and Resilience Among Endurance Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 lockdowns constrained the training opportunities of athletes resulting in physical and mental hardship. In this study, athletes involved in the outdoor endurance sports of running, cycling or swimming were recruited through Facebook groups and using online mailing lists. The final sample (n = 3,551) consisted of 576 female respondents (16.2%), and 2,975 male respondents (83.8%). The mean age of participants was 44.13  years (min = 16, max = 83, and SD = 9.84). An online survey was designed to measure variables relevant to athletesâ€™ mental health;resilience and emotion regulation strategies;mobility restrictions;training routines;personal involvement in endurance sports;age;gender;and country of residence. Overall, the results of our study indicate that during lockdown, decreases in training volume, lower lockdown-specific resilience, and holding more negative perceptions about lockdown mobility restrictions (perceived strictness) all contributed to perceived barriers to training. In the analysis, athletesâ€™ relative observance of mobility restrictions was controlled for. Athletes exhibiting high personal commitment to their sports displayed: greater lockdown resilience, a greater use of adaptive coping strategies, and lower levels of perceived barriers to training.","Harman, Brian, Dessart, GrÃ©gory, Puke, Liene, Philippe, Roberta Antonini","https://www.google.com/search?q=Coping+and+Resilience+Among+Endurance+Athletes+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in psychology; 13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33230,""
"Rules, role models or overall climate at home? Relative associations of different family aspects with adolescents' problematic social media use","AimThis study aimed to enhance knowledge on which aspects of the family context are most relevant in identifying at-risk/problematic social media users among adolescents. Therefore, we examined the relative contribution to adolescents' at-risk/problematic social media use (SMU) of general and Internet-specific family factors related to three different family (sub)systems: parent-child (Internet-specific rule-setting, reactive restrictions towards Internet use, co-use, adolescents' involvement in rule-setting and positive parenting), parent (parental screen time, phubbing, stress, anxiety and depression) and family (family functioning, family intactness and SES) (sub)system.MethodsQuestionnaire data came from 403 adolescents (MÂ =Â 13.51, SDÂ =Â 2.15) and 396 parents (MÂ =Â 46.59, SDÂ =Â 5.29) who participated in wave 1 of the Dutch â€˜Digital Family projectâ€™.ResultsLogistic regression analyses showed that only factors related to the parent-child subsystem remained significant in predicting being an at-risk/problematic social media user when examining predictors related to the parent-child, parent and family (sub)system simultaneously. Specifically, general and Internet-specific parenting practices contributed to the prediction above and beyond each other. Positive parenting and Internet-specific rule-setting seem protective, while parental reactive restrictions towards Internet use could be a risk factor. Positive parenting showed the largest effect size.ConclusionThe results suggest that parental behaviors directed towards the child should be a focus of attention in prevention of adolescents' problematic SMU. In addition, our findings highlight the importance of untangling restrictive mediation (impulsive, in the moment, attempts to limit SMU versus communicating clear rules in advance) when examining its effects.","Geurts, Suzanne M.; Koning, Ina M.; Vossen, Helen G.

"""Suicide addict"": The sovereignty of shame in the dissociated mind","Through her obsessive artwork of infinite dots, the artist Yayoi Kusama has been expressing her depression and suicidal ideation for over eight decades. To this day, Kusama has chosen to reside by night in a mental hospital in Tokyo while during the day she continues producing her works of art with their infinitude of elaborate repetition which mirrors the loop of her depression and the monotony of her obsession with death. The title of this paper is borrowed from Kusama's book (2005) and poem. Suicide, according to the French philosopher and sociologist Emile Durkheim, is a result of both emotional and social factors and the two are inseparable. In his book Suicide (1897), Durkheim concluded that the more socially integrated and connected a person is, the less likely he or she is to commit suicide. He came up with the term anomie. Anomie is a state or condition of instability in individuals or in a society resulting from the breakdown or absence of social norms and values. He associated anomie with the influence of a loss of societal norms that was too sudden and too rigid. When this rigidity becomes normalised and obsolete as a result of the lack of connection to a sense of purpose and belonging to society, an increase in suicide is then predictable. We can see this in times of economic austerity as well as in periods of political and societal upheaval such as the one we are currently facing with the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Stratified changes in emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from a longitudinal survey of residents in Hubei province, China","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on individuals' emotional wellbeing and mental health. However, little research has examined emotional resilience during the pandemic. This study investigated the changes in emotional distress among residents in Hubei, the epicenter of the pandemic in China during the early stage of the pandemic, and we examined the sociodemographic differences in their emotional recovery. Methods We undertook a two-wave panel survey of 3816 residents aged =18 in Hubei, China. The baseline survey was conducted during early February 2020, the peak of the outbreak. The follow-up survey was carried out when the pandemic was mainly under control. The data enabled us to investigate the within-person changes in COVID-19-related negative emotions. Mixed-effect regression models with a random effect for participants were used to accommodate repeated measures. Results Respondents reported high levels of emotional distress at the peak of the pandemic and experienced a decline in emotional distress when the pandemic was under control. Moreover, respondents aged 35â€“49, with a college education or above, were employed, and having better self-rated health experienced a more substantial decrease in negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion This study identified vulnerable populations who may experience prolonged emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The results suggest that respondents who aged over 50, with no college education, were not employed, and with worse self-rated health were less resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.","Chen, Xi, Lin, Fen, Gao, Haiyan, Zou, Yuchun","https://www.google.com/search?q=Stratified+changes+in+emotional+distress+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+Evidence+from+a+longitudinal+survey+of+residents+in+Hubei+province,+China","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of psychosomatic research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33235,""

"The effect of hindrance stressors on the emotional exhaustion among front-line healthcare workers in the recuperation period during the COVID-19 epidemic in China: a prospective cross-sectional study","This study aimed to examine the influence and conditioning process of hindrance stressors on the emotional exhaustion of the front-line healthcare workers during recuperation, examine the potential mediating process of rumination, and explore the moderating role of organisational and family factors. This cross-sectional study was conducted during 12-20 July 2020. Total 418 questionnaires were collected from front-line healthcare workers by random cluster sampling. Hierarchical regression was performed to analyse the mediating effect of affective rumination using SPSS25.0, while PROCESS was used to further investigate the moderating role of servant leadership and family support. 418 healthcare workers were investigated randomly from front-line medical teams. Inclusion criteria included worked as front-line health workers and participated in the fight against COVID-19 in Hubei; age Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years; normal cognitive and comprehension abilities under physical and mental health; volunteer to participate in this study. Exclusion criteria included recently affected by major events other than COVID-19 or those with a history of neurasthenia and trauma. Using descriptive analysis of average value and SD measured by a five-item scale (MBI-GS), we found that front-line healthcare workers' emotional exhaustion score (2.45Ã‚Â±0.88) was at the medium level. Hindrance stressors, mediated by affective rumination, had a significant positive predictive effect on emotional exhaustion. Servant leadership negatively moderated the direct effect of hindrance stressors on emotional exhaustion (ÃŽÂ²=-0.106, p&lt;0.01). Family support positively moderated the impact of hindrance stressors on emotional exhaustion (ÃŽÂ²=0.082, p&lt;0.05). During the recuperation period, after successfully controlling COVID-19 at the front line, the first-line healthcare workers should be screened through affective rumination evaluation to gain insight for targeted interventions. We find that servant leadership is beneficial in alleviating emotional exhaustion while family support worsens emotional exhaustion. We suggest that servant leadership should be further promoted in medical organisations, and family support should be applied correctly and cautiously.","Wang, Zhou, Song, Yin, Shi, Zhang, Dan, Wu, Ye","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049191","20220623","Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION &amp; MANAGEMENT; Human resource management; PUBLIC HEALTH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33237,""

An interpretative qualitative, semistructured interview study employing maximum variation sampling, snowball sampling and a thematic analysis. A large West Midlands (UK) university with medical and nursing undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Study undertaken between January and May 2020. A purposive sample of eight medical (six women and two men) and seven nursing (all women) students who worked &gt;2 weeks in a healthcare setting during the COVID-19 pandemic (from 1 March 2020 onwards). Four core themes with corresponding subthemes were identified: (1) COVID-19 sources of distress-working conditions, exposure to suffering, death and dying, relationships and teams, individual inexperience and student identity, (2) negative impact on mental health and well-being-psychological and emotional distress, delayed distress, exhaustion, mental ill health, (3) protective factors from distress-access to support, environment, preparation and induction, recognition and reward, time for breaks and rest and (4) positive experiences and meaningful outcomes. Student pandemic deployment has had a significant negative impact on students' psychological well-being, as a result of demanding working conditions, unprecedented exposure to death and suffering and lack of preparation for new job roles.

"A post-lockdown study of burnout risk amongst New Zealand essential workers","Job burnout is an essential topic for researchers and a pressing issue for employers and employees. However, the most popular tool has become widely critiqued, and a new measure of burnout - the Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT) - is used here. The BAT is helpful because it provides a cut-off threshold score representing high burnout risk. This study provides one of the first BAT studies post Covid-19 pandemic and focuses on comparing high burnout risk rates between essential and non-essential workers after the first lockdown in New Zealand (May 2020). Using representative data from 955 employees across a wide range of occupations, sectors, and industries, we calculate an overall burnout risk of 11.1%, with essential workers higher (14%) than non-essential workers (9%). The odds ratios of burnout risk and having high levels of mental health complaints were 10-20 times higher for burnout risk workers. For essential workers, they were significantly higher for high job depression risk (35 times). Building on these results, to develop a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to burnout risk, we report on a qualitative analysis of comments (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 213) provided by essential workers on their lockdown work experiences. Findings provide evidence that while a range of (1) health-related concerns (i.e., increased risk of getting and spreading covid) and (2) employee- and employer-specific pressures related to challenging lockdown work practices contribute to essential worker burnout risk, an unwavering sense of pride and purpose in the value of their essential work serves to reduce this risk. We discuss the implications, highlighting the unique issues facing essential workers.","Haar, O'Kane","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115157","20220623","Burnout assessment tool; Essential workers; High burnout risk; New Zealand; Qualitative insights; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33239,""
"Consensus recommendations for opioid agonist treatment following the introduction of emergency clinical guidelines in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national Delphi study","Emergency contingency guidelines for opioid agonist treatment (OAT) were introduced in Ireland in March 2020, to ensure rapid and uninterrupted access to treatment while mitigating COVID-19 risk. The contingency guidelines deviated, across multiple clinical domains, from pre-pandemic clinical guidelines published in 2016. The objectives of this study are to (1) identify changes introduced to OAT clinical guidelines in Ireland during the pandemic; and (2) develop consensus on whether the new recommendations should be retained beyond the pandemic, using a national Delphi consensus methodology. Clinical guidance recommendations ('statements') were generated by comparing the newly established contingency guidelines with the national 2016 Clinical Guidelines for OAT. Over two rounds of on-line Delphi testing, a panel of experts (people currently accessing OAT, psychiatrists, general practitioners, community pharmacists, a nurse, a psychologist and support/key workers) independently rated their agreement with each statement and provided comments. Statements with a median score of 4 or 5 and a lower quartile of Ã¢â€°Â¥4 were classified as having reached consensus. Forty-eight panel members were recruited, with a high participation level at Round 2 (90%, n=43). Consensus was achieved for 12 of the 19 statements at Round 1. The 7 remaining statements were revised, with 2 new statements, resulting in 9 statements at Round 2. Four statements reached consensus at Round 2. The final list includes 16 clinical guidance statements; 9 relating to assessment, 3 to OAT drug choice and dosing, 1 to take-away doses, 2 to overdose prevention and 1 to the continuation of e-prescriptions. A wide range of stakeholders involved in the delivery and receipt of OAT agreed on 16 clinical guidance statements for inclusion in OAT clinical guidelines as we move beyond the pandemic, rather than reverting to pre-pandemic guidelines. The agreed statements relate to facilitating safe access to OAT with minimal waiting time, supporting patient-centred care to promote health and well-being, and preventing drug overdose. Notably, consensus was not achieved for OAT drug dosage and frequency of urine testing during the stabilisation and maintenance phase of care.","Durand, Keenan, Boland, Harnedy, Delargy, Scully, Mayock, Ebbitt, VÃƒÂ¡zquez, Corrigan, Killeen, Pate, Byrne, Cousins","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103768","20220623","Addiction services; COVID-19; Clinical guidelines; Delphi technique; Drug policy; Harm reduction; Opioid agonist treatment; Substance use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33240,""
"E-Learning Impact on Veterinary Medical Student's Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Veterinary medical students are known to have significant levels of mental illness. The COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to online learning have brought increased psychological stress. We used a web-based survey to ask 415 veterinary medical students from Portugal about the impact of the pandemic and online learning on their anxiety levels. Results were analyzed using logistic regressions and Spearman's correlation. Results indicated that 15.4% had no symptoms of anxiety, 39.5% experienced mild anxiety, 21.4% had moderate anxiety, and 23.6% experienced severe anxiety. Having difficulty sleeping, the stress associated with confinement, and family conflicts were risk factors for anxiety, while being male was found to be protective. Most veterinary medical students (77%) were satisfied with online learning. The university's adaptation to online teaching and time spent participating in online classes were significantly associated with anxiety. Due to the known fragility of veterinary medical students' mental health, this group should be monitored and supported closely during life-disrupting events such as public health emergencies.","Rodrigues, Nunes, Cortez, LourenÃƒÂ§o","https://doi.org/10.3138/jvme-2021-0052","20220623","COVID-19; generalized anxiety disorder; online learning; veterinary medical students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33241,""
"Effects of a WHO-guided digital health intervention for depression in Syrian refugees in Lebanon: A randomized controlled trial","Most displaced people with mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries do not receive effective care, and their access to care has deteriorated during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Digital mental health interventions are scalable when digital access is adequate, and they can be safely delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined whether a new WHO-guided digital mental health intervention, Step-by-Step, in which participants were supported by a nonspecialist helper, was effective in reducing depression among displaced people in Lebanon. We conducted a single-blind, 2-arm pragmatic randomized clinical trial, comparing guided Step-by-Step with enhanced care as usual (ECAU) among displaced Syrians suffering from depression and impaired functioning in Lebanon. Primary outcomes were depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) and impaired functioning (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule-12, WHODAS) at posttreatment. Secondary outcomes included subjective well-being, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and self-described problems. A total of 569 displaced people from Syria with depression (PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10) and impaired functioning (WHODAS &gt; 16) were randomized to Step-by-Step (N = 283; lost to follow-up: N = 167) or ECAU (N = 286; lost to follow-up: 133). Participants were considered to be lost to follow-up when they did not fill in the outcome measures at posttest or follow-up. Recruitment started on December 9, 2019 and was completed on July 9, 2020. The last follow-up assessments were collected in December 2020. The study team had access to the online platform, where they could see treatment arm assignment for each participant. All questionnaires were completed by participants online. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses showed intervention effects on depression (standardized mean differences [SMDs]: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.26; 0.70; p &lt; 0.001), impaired functioning (SMD: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.14; 0.56; p &lt; 0.001), post-traumatic stress (SMD: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16; 0.56; p &lt; 0.001), anxiety (SMD: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.24; 0.68; p &lt; 0.001), subjective well-being (SMD: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.26; 0.68; p &lt; 0.001), and self-identified personal problems (SMD: 0.49; 95% CI 0.28; 0.70; p &lt; 0.001). Significant effects on all outcomes were maintained at 3 months follow-up. During the trial, one serious adverse event occurred, unrelated to the intervention. The main limitation of the current trial is the high dropout rate. In this study, we found that a guided, digital intervention was effective in reducing depression in displaced people in Lebanon. The guided WHO Step-by-Step intervention we examined should be made available to communities of displaced people that have digital access.

"Racial differences in the psychosocial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in veterans with psychosis or recent homelessness","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disproportionately impact people of color and individuals experiencing psychosis and homelessness. However, it is unclear whether there are differences by race in psychosocial responses to the pandemic in vulnerable populations. The double jeopardy hypothesis posits that multiply marginalized individuals would experience worse psychosocial outcomes. The present study investigated the clinical and functional initial responses to the pandemic in both Black (<i>n</i> = 103) and White veterans (<i>n</i> = 98) with psychosis (PSY), recent homelessness (RHV), and in a control group (CTL) enrolled in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare services. Clinical interviews were administered via phone at two time points: baseline (mid-May through mid-August 2020) and follow-up (mid-August through September 2020). The baseline interview also included retrospective measures of pre-COVID status from January 2020. There were no significant differences between Black and White veterans in depression, anxiety, or loneliness. However, Black veterans did endorse more fears of contamination, <i>F</i>(1, 196.29) = 9.48, <i>p</i> = .002. Across all groups, Black veterans had better family integration compared to White veterans, <i>F</i>(1, 199.98) = 7.62, <i>p</i> = .006. There were no significant differences by race in social integration, work/role productivity, or independent living. In sum, there were few significant differences between Black and White veterans in initial psychosocial response to the pandemic. The lack of racial disparities might reflect the presence of VA's wrap-around services. The findings also highlight the robust nature of social support in Black veterans, even in the context of a global pandemic.

"The moderating and mediating roles of mindfulness and rumination on COVID-19 stress and depression: A longitudinal study of young adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has not only accounted for a substantial number of deaths in the United States but also deleterious mental health outcomes. We integrated multiple lines of previous research to better understand psychological strengths and difficulties in the face of the pandemic by testing a moderated mediation model that posited that rumination mediates the relationship between COVID-related stress and depression, and mindfulness moderates the relationship between COVID-related stress and rumination. The participants were 196 young adults (79.6% female, 53.1% persons of color), who ranged in age between 18 and 33 years (<i>M</i> = 21.21; <i>SD</i> = 3.62). The participants completed measures of COVID-19 stress, rumination, mindfulness, and depressive symptoms at four time points spanning 1 month. Cross-sectional moderated mediation analysis of the data showed that COVID-related stress predicted rumination, which in turn, predicted depressive symptoms. In addition, mindfulness buffered the relationship between COVID-related stress and rumination. Later, we ran exploratory analyses to examine the robustness of the main models at each wave, linear mixed-effects models to investigate change over time, and conducted a cross-lagged model to test for directional effects. Notably, the longitudinal findings suggested that COVID-related stress and rumination tended to decrease over time and mindfulness remained temporally stable. Additionally, increases in rumination predicted increases in depression. Some longitudinal findings did not consistently congrue with cross-sectional results. Overall, the findings highlight the diverse ways in which individuals cope with stress and the promise of mindfulness as a protective factor against the negative effects of pandemic-related stressors.

"Supporting People Who Have Lost a Close Person by Bereavement or Separation: Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Two French-Language Internet-Based Interventions","Internet-based interventions (IBIs) are as efficient as face-to-face psychotherapy for a variety of mental health disorders, including complicated grief. Most evidence stems from guided IBIs. However, recent research indicates that the benefit of guidance is lower in more interactive IBIs. As such, providing guidance only to people requiring it (guidance on demand) appears a cost-effective solution. This is particularly important to develop given the recent rise in grief symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents the protocol of a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and adherence rate of 2 IBIs for grief-related symptoms after the loss a close one following death or romantic separation, using a guidance on demand framework. LIVIA 2.0 was developed based on theoretical and empirical findings on grief processes and IBIs, and it will be compared to LIVIA 1 that has already demonstrated its efficacy. Our main hypotheses are that LIVIA 1 (control condition) and LIVIA 2.0 (experimental condition) increase participants' well-being and decrease their distress at posttest and at follow-up, that LIVIA 2.0 is more efficient than LIVIA 1 for all outcomes, and that LIVIA 2.0 has less dropouts than LIVIA 1. Outcomes will be assessed at pretest, posttest (12 weeks later), and follow-up (24 weeks later). We will recruit 234 participants through a variety of means, including social media and contacts with the press. Primary outcomes are grief symptoms, depressive symptoms, and eudemonic well-being. Secondary outcomes are anxiety symptoms, grief coping strategies, aspects related to self-identity reorganization, and program satisfaction. LIVIA 2.0 participants will additionally undergo a weekly mood and grief symptom monitoring, allowing us to explore the short-term efficacy of the sessions. The creation and development of the content of LIVIA 2.0 was completed during the first phase of the project. Participant recruitment will begin in May 2022 and will last until January 2023. This study will emphasize the relevance of the innovations included in LIVIA 2.0 regarding the efficacy and dropout rate of IBIs for grief symptoms and will allow investigations on how these changes impact the demand for guidance. In the current postpandemic times, developing and assessing IBIs targeting grief symptoms are particularly critical given the rise in grief-related symptoms. clinicaltrials.gov NCT05219760; https://tinyurl.com/3dzztjts.

"Health-related quality of life and social determinants of health following COVID-19 infection in a predominantly Latino population","As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, more information is needed on its long-term impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and social determinants of health (SDoH). The aim of the study was to assess HRQoL and SDoH among a predominantly Latino population of COVID-19 survivors and to compare effects in Latinos versus non-Latinos. This cross-sectional study consisted of a survey (in English and Spanish) of COVID-19 survivors from December 2020 to July 2021. The study assessed sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, and SDoH, consisting of 10 COVID-19-related concerns. The PROMIS-29Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°2 (PROPr) measure, which captures 8 HRQoL domains and a preference-based health utility, was used to assess HRQoL. Bivariate analyses included chi-square tests and t-tests. Generalized linear models were conducted for multivariable analyses. Of 230 respondents (6.3% response rate), the mean [SD] age was 43.1 [14.3] years; 83.0% were Latino; the mean [SD] time since diagnosis was 8.1 [3.2] months; and 12.6% had a history of hospitalization with COVID-19. HRQoL scores were slightly worse than population norms on all domains, especially anxiety; the mean [SD] PROPr health utility was 0.36 [0.25]. Domain scores were similar by ethnicity except for cognitive function-abilities, where scores were lower in Latinos. Multivariable analyses revealed that: (1) financial concerns were associated with worse health utility, as well as worse scores on all 8 PROMIS domains; (2) interpersonal conflict was associated with worse health utility and worse scores on 6 of the 8 PROMIS domains (anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social function, and pain interference); and (3) Latino ethnicity was only associated with 1 PROMIS domain (cognitive function-abilities) after controlling for covariates. COVID-19 infection is associated with HRQoL decrements long after the acute infection, and financial concerns and interpersonal conflict are particularly associated with worse HRQoL.","Case, Wang, Hosek, Lill, Howell, Taylor, Bridges, MacCarthy, Winkler, Tsevat","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-022-00473-8","20220623","COVID-19; Health disparities; Latinos; Long COVID; PROMIS-29Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°2; Patient-reported outcomes; Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19; Quality of life; Social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33246,""

"COVID-19 ethnic inequalities in mental health and multimorbidities: protocol for the COVEIMM study","The COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated ethnic health inequalities, particularly in people with multiple long-term health conditions, the interplay with mental health is unclear. This study investigates the impact of the pandemic on the association of ethnicity and multimorbidity with mortality/service use among adults, in people living with severe mental illnesses (SMI). This study will utilise secondary mental healthcare records via the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) and nationally representative primary care records through the Clinical Practice Interactive Research Database (CPRD). Quasi-experimental designs will be employed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on mental health service use and excess mortality by ethnicity, in people living with severe mental health conditions. Up to 50 qualitative interviews will also be conducted, co-produced with peer researchers; findings will be synthesised with quantitative insights to provide in-depth understanding of observed associations. 81,483 people in CRIS with schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar or affective disorder diagnoses, were alive from 1st January 2019. Psychiatric multimorbidities in the CRIS sample were comorbid somatoform disorders (30%), substance use disorders (14%) and personality disorders (12%). In CPRD, of 678,842 individuals with a prior probable diagnosis of COVID-19, 1.1% (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7493) had an SMI diagnosis. People in the SMI group were more likely to die (9% versus 2% in the non-SMI sample) and were more likely to have mental and physical multimorbidities. The effect of COVID-19 on people from minority ethnic backgrounds with SMI and multimorbidities remains under-studied. The present mixed methods study aims to address this gap.","Impara, Bakolis, BÃƒÂ©cares, Dasch, Dregan, Dyer, Hotopf, Stewart, Stuart, Ocloo, Das-Munshi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02305-y","20220623","COVID-19; Ethnicity; Mortality; Service use; Severe mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33248,""
"[Burnout and dependence among medical personnel timeless and during the COVID-19 pandemic, using surgery and anesthesia as examples]","The COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health and professional behavior of surgeons and anesthesiologists and seems to have an impact on substance dependence. What are the reasons for the occurrence of substance dependence and burnout in surgeons and anesthesiologists timelessly and during the COVID-19 pandemic and what improvement measures could help in the clinical practice? AÃ‚Â literature search was conducted in the form of aÃ‚Â systematic review of studies and review articles relevant to the topic. Over the years it has been shown that surgeons and anesthesiologists are prone to drug dependence due to their direct access to medications in the clinical field and work-related stress. In particular, surgeons and anesthesiologists appeared to have an increased propensity for addictive diseases and an increased risk of burnout in the pandemic. Preventive measures in favor of better working conditions in surgery and anesthesia and better drug control (not only for dispensing but also for correct drug testing), as well as more treatment and reintegration programs under psychiatric supervision and in collaboration with aÃ‚Â multidisciplinary team are meaningful.

"Americans' Awareness of Access Changes and Utilization of Telehealth During COVID-19: A Survey in the United States","<b>Background:</b> We examine how and why Americans have experienced interrupted health care during the COVID-19 pandemic and measure awareness and usage of expanded benefits offered by health insurers and employers. We use an expanded concept of health literacy to include knowledge of access conditions and consider if patients' knowledge of the health system may relate to utilization of care. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted an online survey of 451 U.S. adults in September 2020, asking respondents about their health care experiences since March 1, 2020. This survey measured usage of medical care and awareness of the efforts made by government, private insurers, and employers to increase access to benefits such as telehealth services, well-being and mental health programs, and new prescription options. <b>Results:</b> The most common reasons cited for postponing or skipping medical appointments included fears over COVID-19 exposure, following local restrictions, or wanting to preserve resources for those with COVID-19. Our survey also finds that many Americans are largely unaware of whether they have access to expanded benefits implemented during the pandemic. Critically, respondents who recalled telehealth and prescription medication benefits being promoted were more likely to report using such benefits. <b>Conclusion:</b> This research suggests that greater attention to health literacy can help promote participation in the system by patients and has the potential to lead to improved health outcomes and greater adherence to treatment plans. Telehealth may offer patients increased opportunities to consult with their physicians for ailments that they might otherwise have delayed seeking care.","Cook, Pittaoulis, Alderfer, Gilchrist, Sapia","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0485","20220623","COVID-19; health care access; health literacy; patient preference; survey; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33250,""
"COVID-19 Variants in Critically Ill Patients: A Comparison of the Delta and Omicron Variant Profiles","Coronavirus disease is a pandemic that has disrupted many human lives, threatening people's physical and mental health. Each pandemic wave struck in different ways, infectiveness-wise and mortality-wise. This investigation focuses on critically ill patients affected by the last two variants, Delta and Omicron, and aims to analyse if any difference exists between the two groups. intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 consecutive admissions between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2022 were recorded daily, and data concerning the patients' demographics, variants, main comorbidities, ICU parameters on admission, and the outcome were analysed by a univariate procedure and by a multivariate analysis. 65 patients were enrolled, 31 (47.69%) belonging to the Omicron versus 34 (52.31%) to the Delta group. The mortality rate was 52.94% for the Omicron group versus 41.9% for the Delta group. A univariate analysis showed that the Omicron variant was associated with total comorbidities number, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), pre-existing pulmonary disease, vaccination status, and acute kidney injury (AKI). In stepwise multivariate analysis, the total number of comorbidities was positively associated with the Omicron group, while pulmonary embolism was negatively correlated with the Omicron group. Omicron appears to have lost some of the hallmarks of the Delta variant, such as endothelialitis and more limited cellular tropism when it comes to the patients in the ICU.

However, it is unclear how these changes may have affected their experiences. We aim to identify patient characteristics that affect telehealth experiences and evaluate their preferences for using telehealth in the future. Patients who completed the Outpatient Cancer Care (OCC) Patient Experience Survey were invited to participate. They comepleted the modified OCC Survey, which focused on telehealth during the pandemic. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to identify patient characteristics that influenced telehealth experiences and preferences for future telehealth use. Perceived ease of participation in telehealth is a significant predictor of the change in patients' ratings of their telehealth experience. We found that cancer patients had lower preferences for using telehealth in the future if they were older, female, or non-white; resided in an urban area; had no previous telehealth experience; had lower education; and had poorer mental health. To optimize cancer care and improve equitable access to high-quality telehealth care during the pandemic and beyond, clinicians and policymakers will need to consider patients' self-reported experiences and their personal characteristics.","Izadi-Najafabadi, McQuarrie, Peacock, Halperin, Lambert, Mitton, McTaggart-Cowan","https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol29060335","20220623","COVID-19 pandemic; cancer; patient-reported experiences; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33252,""
"The Psychological Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Adults Treated for Childhood Cancer","Compared with the general population, childhood cancer survivors (CCS) could be at greater risk of psychological distress following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study assessed the psychological consequences of COVID-19 on the mental health of CCS. In December 2020, we interviewed through an online self-report questionnaire, 580 5-year CCS participating in the French Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (FCCSS) cohort. We first compared the mental health score of CCS with that observed in the French general population of the same age and gender. Subsequently, we studied predictors of the mental health score of CCS. External comparisons revealed that the mental health score of CCS was similar to that of the general population. Among CCS, almost 42% stated that their psychological state had been worse during the lockdown. Predictors of poorer mental health included, among others, female gender, reporting a change in the occupational situation, having a relative who had been hospitalized or had died following COVID-19, and a greater perceived infection risk. Given the pre-existing vulnerability of some CCS to mental distress, the additional psychological consequences of COVID-19 in vulnerable survivors should receive attention from health care providers.","Janah, Haddy, Demoor-Goldschmidt, Bougas, Clavel, Poulalhon, Lacour, Souchard, Jackson, Casagranda, Berger, Allodji, El Fayech, Fresneau, De Vathaire, Dumas","https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol29060327","20220623","COVID-19; childhood cancer survivors; consequences; lockdown; mental health; psychosocial; survivorship","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33253,""
"Oncology Healthcare Professionals' Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The paper begins by reviewing the literature on oncology healthcare professionals' (HCP) mental health. We summarize and present the current data on HCP mental health in order to understand the baseline state of oncology HCPs' mental health status <i>prior</i> to the COVID-19 pandemic. At each juncture, we will discuss the implications of these mental health variables on the personal lives of HCPs, the healthcare system, and patient care. We follow by reviewing the literature on these parameters during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the overall mental health of HCPs working in oncology. By reviewing and summarizing the data before and after the start of the pandemic, we will get a fuller picture of the pre-existing stressors facing oncology HCPs and the added burden caused by pandemic-related stresses. The second part of this review paper will discuss the implications for the oncology workforce and offer recommendations based on the research literature in order to improve the lives of HCPs, and in the process, improve patient care.","Granek, Nakash","https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol29060323","20220623","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; burnout; depression; oncologists; oncology; oncology nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33254,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Patients with Chronic Tinnitus-Preliminary Results","The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures are both causes of psychological distress. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the psychological effects of lockdown measures on patients with subjective chronic tinnitus diagnosed before the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of <i>n</i> = 77 patients with chronic tinnitus was contacted by mail/phone for a survey between June 2021 and September 2021. All patients filled out questionnaires on tinnitus distress (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, THI), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory, BAI) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI) and eight items of the Tinnitus Sample Case History (TSCH) about tinnitus history (i.e., loudness, pitch, perception, tinnitus location), stress, and related conditions (noise annoyance, vertigo/dizziness, headache). Forty patients with chronic tinnitus filled out the survey. No significant differences of total THI mean scores (<i>p</i> &amp;gt; 0.05) were found compared to the results obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic and after lockdown. Regarding depression and anxiety, the female population showed a significant increase in scores obtained from the BDI (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0170) and the BAI (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.049). Only two patients (0.5%) were infected by COVID-19 (positive RT-PCR), and they did not report any worsening of tinnitus. According to the data of the literature, our patients experienced a heterogeneous course of tinnitus, and the severity of tinnitus was not significantly affected by lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.","Fioretti, Natalini, Triggianese, Eibenstein, Angelone, Lauriello, Eibenstein","https://doi.org/10.3390/audiolres12030034","20220623","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; lockdown; pandemic; stress; tinnitus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33255,""
"Intersectionality in pandemic youth suicide attempt trends","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased distress at a societal level, with youth and young people bearing a disproportionate burden. A series of recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports has highlighted emergency department (ED) visit rates for suicide attempts among youth ages 12-25 during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study expands those analyses by adding race and ethnicity to the examination of suspected suicide attempts among youth. This study uses National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) data for Wisconsin from hospitals that consistently reported ED visits between the study period of January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2021. Suspected suicide attempt visits were identified using the CDC-developed suicide attempt query. During the study period, there were 8915 ED visits for suicide attempts by children and youth ages 12-25 in Wisconsin's NSSP system. We confirm gendered patterns of ED visit rates for suspected suicide attempts among youth that were first noted in studies using a non-representative national dataset. Large and significant 2019 vs. 2021 increases were noted for Black females ages 12-17 (79% increase) and White non-Hispanic females ages 12-17 (58%), but no significant change for Hispanic females ages 12-17.

"Anxiety Severity and Influencing Factors in Day Surgery Patients or Relatives in Covid-19 Normalized Prevention Phase","As the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) repeated, the prevention and treatment will be normalized in a period. ""Large number of patients"" and "" Turnover quickly"" of the day surgery ward greatly increased the difficulty of policy formulation and implementation. The normalization also had a huge negative psychological impact on patients/family members. This study aims to introduce effective epidemic prevention and control measures in day surgery wards, and to clarify the influencing factors of anxiety and subjective discomfort of patients and their families during the normalization of COVID-19. To prepare for normalization of epidemic, research discuss improvements in the management of staff, environment, process. A total of 148 patients admitted to West China Hospital from December 2021 to March 2022 and their relatives were asked to complete a questionnaire effectively. Using the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Social Support Rating Scale and Subjective Units of Distress scales to analyze anxiety and its risk factors. Under normalized control measures, no staff was infected. The subjective discomfort score was higher in people with lower body mass index (BMI). Young and high social support score were risk factors for anxiety (P &lt; .05), and social support was positively correlated with anxiety. The normalization of epidemic is an inevitable trend in a period. A stable and safe medical environment needs to fully eliminate the policy defects, to fit the people and focus on mental health of the people. For patients/family members, who are younger,a lower BMI and higher social support should be attention more.","Teng, Lin, Liu, Yin, Dai, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1177/15533506221108858","20220623","evidence based medicine; global surgery; human factors study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33257,""

"From COVID-19 Pandemic to Entrepreneurial Behavior: The Mediating Effect of Proactive Personality and the Moderating Role of Anticipated Regret","COVID-19 is a global public health issue that poses a challenge to the education sector. The pandemic has a devastating impact on student entrepreneurial behavior and their mental health. This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the student entrepreneurial intention/behavioral model with a mediating effect of proactive personality and the moderating role of anticipated regret. The sample of the study comprised 345 university students from Pakistan. Data were collected using a self-report and other report survey questionnaires. The hypotheses were investigated using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. According to the findings, COVID-19 perception has a negative and significant impact on the student entrepreneurial intention/behavior model. Meanwhile, findings show that a proactive personality significantly mediates the relationship between COVID-19 perception and entrepreneurial intention. The results show that anticipated regret moderates the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial behavior in a favorable and significant way. Furthermore, discussion and implications were also discussed in this article.","Jiatong, Murad, Bajun, Syed, Munir","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.838779","20220623","COVID-19 perception; anticipated regret; entrepreneurial behavior; entrepreneurial intention; proactive personality; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33259,""
"How Did People Cope During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Structural Topic Modelling Analysis of Free-Text Data From 11,000 United Kingdom Adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impacts on lives across the globe. Job losses have been widespread, and individuals have experienced significant restrictions on their usual activities, including extended isolation from family and friends. While studies suggest population mental health worsened from before the pandemic, not all individuals appear to have experienced poorer mental health. This raises the question of <i>how</i> people managed to cope during the pandemic. To understand the coping strategies individuals employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from free-text data on coping from over 11,000 UK adults, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020. We identified 16 topics. The most discussed coping strategy was 'thinking positively' and involved themes of gratefulness and positivity. Other strategies included engaging in activities and hobbies (such as doing DIY, exercising, walking and spending time in nature), keeping routines, and focusing on one day at a time. Some participants reported more avoidant coping strategies, such as drinking alcohol and binge eating. Coping strategies varied by respondent characteristics including age, personality traits and sociodemographic characteristics and some coping strategies, such as engaging in creative activities, were associated with more positive lockdown experiences. A variety of coping strategies were employed by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coping strategy an individual adopted was related to their overall lockdown experiences. This may be useful for helping individuals prepare for future lockdowns or other events resulting in self-isolation.","Wright, Fluharty, Steptoe, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.810655","20220623","COVID-19; coping (C); free-text analysis; mental health; structural topic modeling; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33260,""
"Effects of Character Strength-Based Intervention vs Group Counseling on Post-Traumatic Growth, Well-Being, and Depression Among University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Guangdong, China: A Non-Inferiority Trial","This study assessed the effects of character strengths-based invention (CSI) vs group counseling (GC) on mental health outcomes (ie, post-traumatic growth, well-being, and depression) among university students in Guangdong Province, China. We conducted a randomized non-inferiority trial among 124 undergraduates at a medical university during the COVID-19 pandemic. We randomly allocated students to receive either CSI (n=62) or GC (n=62). A qualified psychologist delivered both activities on campus during two consecutive weekends with a total of 7.5 hours and also gave assignments to students during weekdays. We measured the outcomes at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up. We then analyzed data using descriptive statistics and a general linear mixed model. CSI and GC groups had similar baseline characteristics. Both CSI and GC experienced an increase in post-traumatic growth and well-being. The meanÃ‚Â±SD scores for post-traumatic growth were significantly higher in CSI compared to GC groups (87.70Ã‚Â±14.22 vs 78.15Ã‚Â±20.72, respectively), whereas well-being scores were similar between CSI and GC (82.58Ã‚Â±16.57 vs 83.68Ã‚Â±15.59, respectively). Neither CSI nor GC experienced a reduction in depression scores. CSI had non-inferior effects compared to GC with regards to improvement of post-traumatic growth and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Factors Associated With Resilience Among Healthcare Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Introduction A growing body of evidence suggests that resilience is more conducive to healthcare professionals (HCPs) adaptation and growth in the face of threats, pandemics, or other major stressful events. We aimed to measure the resilience and identify influencing factors of resilience among HCPs who have been working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methodology A cross-sectional study was performed between November 2020 and January 2021 in Jeddah. The study involved four government hospitals using an electronic self-administered questionnaire, which consisted of sociodemographic questions, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Results Of the 413 participants considered in this study, only 352 were eligible. The mean resilience score of HCPs was 26Ã‚Â±6.4. The results show significant differences across age, years of work experience, nationality, type of shift, and perceived stress score. The general linear regression model indicated that the sample population's type of shift and perceived stress score (p-value = &lt;0.001) are statistically associated with the resilience score. Conclusion Attention should be paid to critical variables associated with resilience, which could help allocate scarce resources to support HCPs and retain them in the workforce.","Aldarmasi","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.25106","20220623","covid-19; healthcare workers; mental health; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33263,""
"Crossing the digital divide: A content analysis of mainstream Australian mental health websites for languages other than English","Growth in e-mental health services in the past decade has been significant, corresponding with rising rates of mental health concerns and amplified by social isolation strategies imposed by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Governments, mental health services and practitioners have identified this as a significant area for investment and highlight its capacity for widespread reach, prevention and early intervention. At a time of growth and investment, it is critical to evaluate the extent to which online mental health platforms are effective in reaching the diverse populations they aim to serve. The current study used content analysis to evaluate 33 Australian mental health websites receiving government funding for the availability of translated materials and resources for culturally and linguistically diverse people. The websites analysed covered a range of mental health topics and overall had limited translated materials available. Only four websites (12.12%) provided a translation tool and none of the interactive tools offered, such as web chat services, were available in languages other than English. From a total of 1100 subsections across all websites, eight subsections (0.73%) were specifically targeting populations identifying as culturally and linguistically diverse. Strategic reconsideration and investment are required to enhance the capacity of current mental health platforms to engage and support the mental health needs of the diverse communities they intend to serve. The research and its findings can provide a basis for research and reflection within other health and social services as online platforms proliferate.","Murray, Musumeci, Cassidy","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13890","20220623","Australia; diversity issues; health inequalities; language; mental health; mental health services; translation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33264,""
"Factors associated with satisfaction and depressed mood among nursing home workers during the covid-19 pandemic","This paper aims to examine the satisfaction and depressed mood experienced by nursing home workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated variables. Specifically, to analyse the factors that may contribute to nursing home workers developing adaptive behaviours that promote satisfaction or, on the contrary, show characteristics associated with a negative mood. Nursing homes have faced unprecedented pressures to provide appropriately skills to meet the demands of the coronavirus outbreak. A cross-sectional survey design using the STROBE checklist. Professionals working in nursing homes (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 165) completed an online survey measuring sociodemographic and professional characteristics, burnout, resilience, experiential avoidance, satisfaction with life and depression. Data were collected online from April to July 2021, the time in which Spain was experiencing its fifth wave of COVID-19. Two multiple linear regression models were performed to identify salient variables associated with depressive mood and satisfaction. Resilience, personal accomplishment and satisfaction had a significant and negative relationship with depression and emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and experiential avoidance had a positive relationship with depression. However, emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and experiential avoidance had a negative and significant relationship with satisfaction and personal accomplishment, and resilience had a positive and significant relationship with satisfaction. In addition, it was found that accepting thoughts and emotions when they occur is beneficial for developing positive outcomes such as satisfaction. Experiential avoidance was an important predictor of the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic can have on nursing home workers. Interventions focusing on resources that represent personal strengths, such as acceptance, resilience and personal accomplishment, should be developed. The complex and unpredictable circumstances of COVID's strict confinement in the nursing home prohibited access to the centres for external personnel and family members. Contact with the professionals involved could not be made in person but exclusively through online systems. However, professionals related to the work environment have subsequently valued this research positively as it analyses 'How they felt during this complicated process'.","Navarro-Prados, GarcÃƒÂ­a-TizÃƒÂ³n, MelÃƒÂ©ndez, LÃƒÂ³pez","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16414","20220623","community health care; depression; nursing; nursing homes; pandemics; protective factors; satisfaction; workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33265,""

A cross-sectional survey examining exposure to seven psychosocial hazards (bullying/harassment; verbal abuse; physical and sexual assault; and hearing about, seeing the aftermath of, or witnessing a fatality), working conditions, physical health, and the impact of COVID-19 was administered to 3,912 participants. Outcome measures were the ITQ, PHQ-9, and GAD-7. Among trauma-exposed participants, 24.3% met the criteria for PTSD or CPTSD; 38.6% and 29.2% of all participants scored in the moderate-to-severe range on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively. Data were analyzed using logistic and linear regression. Bullying/harassment was positively associated with GAD-7 scores, f<sup>2</sup> = .001, and PTSD and CPTSD, ORs = 1.83-2.02. Hearing about and witnessing a fatality were associated with PTSD and CPTSD, ORs = 1.77-2.10. Poorer ergonomics at work were positively associated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores, f<sup>2</sup> = .001. Higher job satisfaction was associated with lower odds of PTSD and CPTSD, ORs = 0.87-0.91, and negatively associated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores, f<sup>2</sup> = .008-.01. Work intensity was associated with PTSD and CPTSD, ORs = 1.79-1.83, and positively associated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores, f<sup>2</sup> = .02-.03. Reporting more physical health problems was associated with PTSD, OR = 1.07, and positively associated with GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores, f<sup>2</sup> = .008-.01.

"Longitudinal associations between going outdoors and mental health and wellbeing during a COVID-19 lockdown in the UK","The COVID-19 pandemic led to national lockdowns in countries around the world. Whilst lockdowns were shown to be effective in reducing the spread of disease, they were also associated with adverse effects on people's mental health and wellbeing. Previous studies have suggested that time spent outside may have played a role in mitigating these negative effects, but research on this topic remains limited. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the longitudinal associations between going outdoors and people's mental health and wellbeing during the first national lockdown (March-May 2020) in the UK. Data from 35,301 participants from the COVID-19 Social Study were analysed. Fixed effects regression was used to explore the longitudinal association between changes in going outdoors (the number of days spent outside) and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, life satisfaction and loneliness. A range of household and neighbourhood moderators were examined. Results show that an increase in the number of days spent outside was associated with decreases in depressive and anxiety symptoms and an increase in life satisfaction. Associations were more salient amongst people living with others, and those with greater satisfaction with their neighbourhood walkability and green spaces. No longitudinal association was found with loneliness. Overall, our analyses showed a positive association between going outdoors and improved mental health and wellbeing during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the UK. These findings are important for formulating guidance for people to stay well at home during pandemics and for the on-going nature-based social prescribing scheme.","Stock, Bu, Fancourt, Mak","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15004-0","20220622","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33269,""
"An interrupted time series analysis of hospital admissions due to alcohol intoxication during the COVID-19 pandemic in Tehran, Iran","The COVID-19 outbreak affected mental health globally. One of the major concerns following the COVID-19 pandemic was increased incidence of risky behaviors including alcohol consumption. This study evaluates the trend of alcohol poisoning in Loghman-Hakim Hospital (LHH), the main referral center of poisoning in Tehran, during the 2-year period from 1Ã‚Â year prior to 1Ã‚Â year after the onset (February 23rd, 2020) of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. All patients admitted with alcohol intoxication from February 23rd, 2019 to February 22nd, 2021 were evaluated and patient data extracted from LHH electronic hospital records. Alcohols were categorized as toxic (methyl alcohol) and non-toxic (ethyl alcohol). Of 2483 patients admitted, 796/14,493 (5.49%) and 1687/13,883 (12.15%) had been hospitalized before and after the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran, respectively. In total, 140 patients did not survive, of whom 131 (93.6%) were confirmed to have methanol intoxication. Mortality was significantly higher during the outbreak (127 vs 13; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; OR: 4.90; CI 95%: 2.75 to 8.73). Among the patients, 503 were younger than age 20. Trend of alcohol intoxication showed increases in children (57 vs 17) and adolescents (246 vs 183) when compared before and after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. A total of 955 patients were diagnosed with methanol toxicity which occurred more frequently during the COVID-19 era (877 vs 78; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; OR: 10.00; CI 95%: 7.75 to12.82). Interrupted time series analysis (April 2016-February 2021) showed that in the first month of the COVID-19 epidemic (March 2020), there was a significant increase in the alcohol intoxication rate by 13.76% (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[2.42-24.91]). The trend of alcohol intoxication as well as resulting mortality increased in all age groups during the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran, indicating urgent need for the prevention of high-risk alcohol use as well as improved treatment.","Hadeiy, Zamani, McDonald, Rezaei, Kolahi, Gholami, Farnaghi, Hassanian-Moghaddam","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14799-2","20220622","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-24","",33270,""
