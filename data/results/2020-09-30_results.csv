"A Qualitative Exploration of the Impact of COVID-19 on Individuals with Eating Disorders in the UK","COVID-19 may have substantial impact on the mental health at a population level, but also has the potential to significantly affect those with pre-existing mental health difficulties such as eating disorders. This qualitative study explores the impact of COVID-19 and associated public health measures on adults with eating disorders within the UK. We conducted 10 in depth interviews with adults (24-38 years) with a self-reported eating disorder during lockdown. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach. We identified core themes related to social restrictions (social isolation, changes in accountability to others, and increased responsibility for self and others), functional restrictions (lack of routine and structure, a need to intentionally plan activity, a desire for secrecy particularly around food shopping) and restrictions in access to mental health services. Overall, the impact of the lockdown was experienced as a catalyst for either increased disordered eating behaviours or for a drive for recovery, depending on individual circumstances going into these restrictions. This study is the first in depth interview approach with adults with mixed eating disorder presentations in the UK during COVID-19. Findings have important implications for post lockdown intervention care and practice.","Brown, Opitz, Peebles, Sharpe, Duffy, Newman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.104977","20200929","COVID-19; Coronavirus; eating disorders; lockdown; qualitative; thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-30","",5314,""

"A Coping Skills Mobile App to Support the Emotional Wellbeing of Young People During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase anxiety and distress in young people worldwide. It is important that mental health is prioritized during crisis events to mitigate the negative and often long-term effects on young people, families and society. Mental health and wellbeing apps represent a scalable approach for improving psychological outcomes in young people and have the potential to improve equity of service access. Objective: The 'Whitu-7 ways in 7 days' wellbeing app was recently developed by our group to address the urgent need for innovative approaches to reach young New Zealanders who are struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is two-fold: (1) to evaluate the acceptability of the prototype app and (2) to examine the effectiveness of the refined app at improving mental/emotional wellbeing and reducing depression, anxiety and stress in New Zealand young people. Methods: A two-phase mixed methods study will be undertaken to achieve these aims. During the first phase, 20 young people aged 16-30 years (including those of MÃ„Âori and Pacific ethnicity) will participate in a qualitative study to help refine the prototype app. During the second phase, 90 young people aged 16-30 years will participate in a randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of the refined Whitu app at 4 weeks and 3 months after baseline. Outcomes will be evaluated using validated web-based questionnaires at baseline, 4-weeks and 3-months. Results: The study received ethics approval in May 2020 and recruitment for the focus groups commenced in June 2020. Recruitment for the RCT is expected to commence in September 2020. Participants for both study phases will be recruited via social media and online communities. Data collection for the RCT is expected to be completed by January 2021 and analyses are expected to be completed by March 2021. Linear mixed modelling will be used to determine between group differences in psychological outcomes. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to develop culturally appropriate, scalable mental health interventions to address the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study will develop and test an evidence-based wellbeing app, which if effective, could be made available to all young people in New Zealand and internationally.

"Epilepsy and lockdown: A survey of patients normally attending a Spanish center","Lockdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic became a challenge to maintain care for patients with epilepsy; we aimed to find out how the pandemic affected them. We sent an online 22-item questionnaire to patients from our outpatient clinic, a reference center in Spain for drug-resistant epilepsy, inquiring about the effects of lockdown, from March to May 2020. We sent the survey to 627 patients; 312 (58% women) sent a complete response and were included. Of all respondents, 57% took &gt;2 antiseizure medications. One-third of respondents (29%) declared an associated cognitive or motor disability. A minority had confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 (1.92%). Seizure frequency remained like usual in 56% of patients, while 31.2% reported an increase. Less than 10% needed emergent assistance. Almost half reported anxiety or depression, and 25% increased behavioral disorders. Mood (F: 5.40 ; p: 0.002) and sleep disorders (F= 2.67; p:0.05) were associated with increase in seizure frequency. Patients were able to contact their physicians when needed and were open to a future telematic approach to follow up visits. Seizure frequency and severity remained unchanged in most patients during the lockdown. Mood and sleep disorders were common and associated with seizure worsening. Patients were open to telematic care in the future.","Conde Blanco, Manzanares, Centeno, Khawaja, BetrÃƒÂ¡n, Donaire, CarreÃƒÂ±o","https://doi.org/10.1111/ane.13354","20200929","Covid-19; Epilepsy; Neuroepidemiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-30","",5318,""
"Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the setting of cytokine release syndrome","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can trigger a cytokine response storm (CRS) that is associated with high mortality but for which the underlying pathophysiology and diagnostics are not yet well characterized. This review provides an overview of the underlying immune profile of COVID-19-related CRS as well as laboratory markers for acute diagnosis and chronic follow-up of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and CRS. Areas covered: Innate and acquired immune profiles in COVID-19-CRS, RNA-detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of CRS including factors that affect assay performance, serology for SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of CRS, and other biomarkers for COVID-19 will be discussed. Expert opinion: Studies support the implication of CRS in the pathogenesis, clinical severity and outcome of COVID-19 through the elevated production of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from activated innate and adaptive immune cells. Although these inflammatory molecules, including IL-6, IL-2R, IL-10, IP-10 and MCP-1, often correlate with disease severity as the possible biomarkers, the pathogenic contributions of individual molecules and the therapeutic benefits of targeting them are yet to be demonstrated. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is the gold standard method for diagnosis of COVID-19 in the context of CRS but assay performance varies and is susceptible to false negative results even as patients clinically deteriorate due to decreased viral shedding in the setting of CRS. Biomarkers including CRP, ferritin, D-dimer and procalcitonin may provide early clues about progression to CRS and help identify thrombotic and infectious complications of COVID-19.","Azar, Shin, Kang, Landry","https://doi.org/10.1080/14737159.2020.1830760","20200929","COVID-19; Cytokine release syndrome; RNA; SARS-CoV-2; cytokines; diagnosis; sensitivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-30","",5319,""
"[Investigation of anxiety and depression in patients from the emergency department during COVID-19 epidemic]","To investigate the status of anxiety and depression in patients requiring emergency treatment during the epidemic of COVID-19 to identify the patients with acute psychological stress disorder. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the medical staff divided the patients visiting the emergency department into suspected group, fever group and control group through interview of the patients at triage. Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were distributed to each patient, and a trained medical staff was responsible for assisting the patient to complete the scales. A total of 557 sets of scales were distributed, including 211 in suspected COVID-19 case group, 167 in fever group and 179 in the control group. A total of 516 scales were retrieved, including 197 in suspected case group, 151 in fever group and 168 in control group. In the 3 groups, the incidence rates of anxiety and depression were 57.87% and 58.88%, 48.34% and 43.71%, and 18.31% and 18.99%, respectively, and the rates were significantly higher in suspected group and fever group than in the control group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), and significantly higher in suspected group than in fever group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).

"Bolstering clinician resilience through an interprofessional, web-based nightly debriefing program for emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has instigated significant changes for health care systems. With clinician burnout rising, efforts to promote clinician resilience are essential. Within this quality improvement project, an interprofessional debriefing program (Brigham Resilience in COVID-19-pandemic Emergency Forum-BRIEF) was developed within two emergency departments (EDs). An interprofessional group of ED providers led optional, nightly debriefings using a web-based portal to connect with ED clinicians for six weeks. In total, 81 interprofessional staff participated in nightly debriefings with a 47% attendance rate. On average, three participants attended the BRIEF nightly (rangeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2-8) to discuss the challenges of social distancing, scarce resources, high acuity, clinician burnout and mental health. Participation increased as rates of COVID-19 positive patients rose. Debriefing leaders provided ED leadership with summaries of clinician experiences and suggestions for improvements. Feedback supported quality improvement initiatives within the ED and greater mental health support for staff. Clinicians and administrators provided positive feedback regarding the program's impact on clinician morale, and clinical processes that promoted the safety and quality of patient care. Optional debriefing with receptive departmental leadership may be a successful tool to support clinicians and hospitals during critical events.","Azizoddin, Vella Gray, Dundin, Szyld","https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1813697","20200929","Debriefing; clinician burnout; process improvement; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-30","",5321,""

"Pregnancy-related anxiety during COVID-19: a nationwide survey of 2740 pregnant women","The aim of this study is to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women's anxiety and identify factors most strongly associated with greater changes in anxiety. An anonymous, online, survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3-24, 2020) included a modified pregnancy-related anxiety scale (PRAS) reflecting respondents' perception of pregnancy anxiety before COVID-19 and a current assessment of pregnancy-related anxiety. The difference between these scores was used as the outcome variable. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. Two thousand seven hundred forty pregnant women from 47 states completed the survey. 25.8% (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°706) stopped in-person visits, 15.2% used video visits (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°415), and 31.8% (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°817) used phone visits for prenatal care as a result of COVID-19. Those planning a hospital birth dropped from 2641 (96.4%) to 2400 (87.7%) following COVID-19. More than half of women reported increased stress about food running out (59.2%, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1622), losing a job or household income (63.7%, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1745), or loss of childcare (56.3%, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1543).

This commentary reporting from the field integrates perceptions of academic, community, health system, and policy leaders from state, county, and local levels in commenting on community mental health needs in the COVID-19 pandemic. Stakeholders noted the broad public health scope of mental health challenges while expressing concern about exacerbation of existing disparities in access and adverse social determinants, including for communities with high COVID-19 infection rates, such as African Americans and Latinos. They noted rapid changes toward telehealth and remote care, and the importance of understanding impacts of changes, including who may benefit or have limited access, with implications for future services delivery. Needs for expanded workforce and training in mental health were noted, as well as potential public health value of expanding digital resources tailored to local populations for enhancing resilience to stressors. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in delivery of health care services across populations and systems. Concerns over the mental health impact of COVID-19 has enhanced interest in remote mental care delivery and preventive services, while being mindful of potential for enhanced disparities and needs to address social determinants of health.

Appointments attendance data were extracted from a computerised medical record system. Sociodemographic factors associated with outcome changes were examined by linear regression and generalised estimating equations. Data were collected from 583 older (Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years) adults. There were significant increases in loneliness, anxiety, and insomnia, after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Missed medical appointments over a 3-month period increased from 16.5% 1 year ago to 22.0% after the onset of the outbreak.

"COVID-19, social isolation, and psychological distress in a Brazilian sample","Importance: The global infection outbreak by the new SARS-CoV-2 prompted community containment schedules; however, social isolation is a predictor of psychological distress. Objective: To determine whether social isolation, in Brazil, led to higher signs of psychological distress, and which intra- and inter-psychic variables mediated this effect. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) in isolated individuals, loneliness activates distancing and escape-avoidance coping strategies with intensities that are directly correlated with symptoms of anxiety and common health disorders; 2) in isolated individuals, poor reliance on social support coping strategies increase the effects of loneliness on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders; 3) in isolated individuals, External Entrapment moderates the effects of loneliness such that the higher the feelings of entrapment, the higher the effects of loneliness on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders. 4) in both isolated and non-isolated individuals, intense reliance on positive reappraisal coping strategies decrease (moderate) the effects of information consumption on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders. No a priori hypothesis on the specific nature of the subjective experiences of social isolation were established. We proposed that the semantic field of social isolation should present a complex and multidimensional nature. Design: Two phases of web-based surveys were applied to participants between May 25th 2020 and August 19th 2020. Setting: Brazilian participants responded surveys on the web. Participants: For Phase 1, 440 participants responded to the survey. Participants were a volunteer sample of Brazilian nationality and above 18 years old. For Phase 2, a sub-sample of 55 participants was drawn from the pool of the first phase. Main outcomes and measures: For Phase 1, the primary endpoint was score in the SRQ-20 scale (an instrument to screen symptoms of common mental disorders), and the secondary endpoint was score in an anxiety scale that screened feelings of anxiety related to illness and medical procedures. Results: For Phase 1, 51% of the sample reported leaving the house less than once a week during the period of the research, 27.6% reported leaving the house 1-2 times per week, 9.8% reported leaving the house 3-4 times per week, and 11.6% reported leaving the house every day. Using SRQ-20, we found that 76.9% of the female respondents and 58.0% of the male respondents that reported leaving their houses less than once a week showed clinically significant symptoms, while these proportions fell below 65% for females and 44% for males that reported leaving their houses more than 3 times per week. Reliance on escape/avoidance as well as distancing coping strategies were significant mediators of the effect of isolation-induced loneliness. We did not find support for the hypothesis that reliance on social support coping strategies significantly altered the effects of social isolation-induced loneliness on psychological distress, nor for the hypothesis that external entrapment moderated the effects of loneliness. We also found that the impact of reliance on positive reappraisal coping strategies on the relationship between frequency of media use for COVID-19-related information and psychological distress depended on the type of media, with individuals which sought information from print or online newspapers, social networks, and podcasts at higher frequencies consistently showing more psychological distress; however, higher levels of positive reappraisal coping strategies increased this impact instead of decreasing it. In Phase 2 (qualitative survey), 47.3% of the sample reported leaving the house less than once a week during the period of the research, 21.8% reported leaving the house 1-2 times per week, 10.9% reported leaving the house 3-4 times per week, and 20% reported leaving the house every day. At the qualitative survey we found that individuals interpreted isolation as producing self-assessment with protective and introspective dimensions, but also ruminative and emotional experiences of distress. Conclusions and relevance: Our results reveal that social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased psychological distress at clinically relevant rates, with loneliness being an important predictor of this effect. We also found that escape-avoidance and distancing coping strategies mediated this effect. Psychological distress was also related to high consumption of COVID-19-related information in social networks, print or online newspapers, and podcasts, but that relying on positive reappraisal coping strategies increased this effect instead of decreasing it. Our results suggest the need for policies that diminish the impact of social isolation on mental health; the need to assess and teach alternative coping strategies in clinical settings; and the need to address the impact of Internet-based sources.","RaÃ­ssa Oliveira De MendonÃ§a et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46125-884-F01","20200930","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; media consumption; coping strategies; mental health; covid-19; entrapment; social isolation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-30","",5332,""
"COVID-19 Health Status Scale (CHSS)","This study will explore how COVID-19 impacts physical and mental health among convenience samples taken from the general US adult population to improve health and wellbeing for vulnerable groups. Any knowledge thus gained should clarify how the pandemic has affected the overall physical and mental health of these individuals. The CHSS approach to measuring health status should help evaluate general populational needs, treatments, and programs in the COVID-19 context. Study significance. There is a lack of research on how populational health is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the context of physical and mental health functioning among the general population. This study holds significant potential in three main areas. First, the US faces an unprecedented and sweeping pandemic, which threatens both the quality of life and life itself across a broad populational spectrum. It is urgent to enhance our understanding of how COVID-19 affects the general population, which requires a rapid investigation of its widespread effects on physical and mental health. Second, the knowledge gained from exploring the relationship between COVID-19 and physical/mental health status will help design new clinical and community interventions that are tailored to general populational needs. Any new health and welfare interventions must be evaluated based on their actual impact. Third, a reliable, valid, and practical outcome measure is a priority area for understanding the physical and mental health consequences of COVID-19. Although physical and mental health care outcomes can be assessed through a variety of parameters, such as satisfaction and cost, health status is the most important.","Areen Omary","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A4-CA6-F82","20200930","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-30","",5333,""
"Child, parent, and family mental health and functioning in Australia during COVID-19: Comparison to pre-pandemic data","The COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to the mental health and wellbeing of families. This study aimed to examine: (1) patterns of parent and child (0â€“18 years) mental health, parent substance use, couple conflict, parenting practices, and family functioning during COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic data; and (2) associations between parent, child, and family outcomes during the pandemic and both pre-existing risk factors and COVID-19 stressors. Participants were Australian mothers (81%) and fathers aged 18 years and over who were parents of a child 0â€“18 years (N=2,365). Parents completed an online self-report survey assessing mental health, substance use, couple conflict, parenting, and family functioning during â€˜stage threeâ€™ COVID-19 restrictions in April 2020. Data were compared to pre-pandemic data from four Australian population-based cohorts. Compared to pre-pandemic estimates, during the pandemic period parents reported higher rates of parent mental health symptoms (Cohenâ€™s d=0.26-.81, all p<.001), higher parenting irritability (d=0.17-.46, all p<.001), lower family positive expressiveness (d=-0.18, p<.001), and higher alcohol consumption (22% vs 12% drinking four or more days per week, p<.001). In multivariable analyses, pre-existing financial deprivation and COVID-19 stressors were associated with greater severity in parent and child mental health symptoms, parent emotion dysregulation, parenting irritability, couple conflict and family positive/negative expressiveness. Parents and children with pre-existing mental health conditions had elevated difficulties during the pandemic across most domains. Our data suggest wide-ranging, detrimental family impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and support policy actions to assist families with financial supports, leave entitlements, and social housing.","Elizabeth Westrupp et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-3E8-FF4","20200930","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; child; tobacco; child mental health; mother; family functioning; couple conflict; smoking; covid-19 pandemic; parenting; parenting irritability; mental health; alcohol; father","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-30","",5334,""
