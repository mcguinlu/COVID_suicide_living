"Hospitalization for self-harm during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in France: a nationwide study","Introduction. Little is known to date about the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on self-harm incidence. Methods. The number of hospitalizations for self-harm in France (mainland and overseas) from January to August 2020 (which includes the first confinement from March 17th to May 11th) was compared to the same period in 2019-2017. Hospital data with the ICD-10 codes X60-84 were extracted from the national administrative database (PMSI). Results. There were 53,583 hospitalizations for self-harm in France between January and August 2020. Compared to the same period in 2019, this represents an overall 8.5% decrease. This decrease started the first week of the confinement and the number of hospitalizations remained at lower levels relative to 2019 until the end of August. The decrease was more marked in women (-9.8%) than men (-6.4%). However, an increase in hospitalizations was observed in individuals aged 75 and older (+5.3 to +11.6%). Moreover, the number of self-harm by firearm (+20.3%), jumping from height (+10.5%), and drowning (+4.7%) increased between 2019 and 2020, as well as the number of hospitalizations in intensive care (+3.5%) and deaths at discharge from hospital (+8.0%). No correlation was found between the evolution in the number of hospitalizations for self-harm and the number of severe cases of Covid-19 (hospitalization and mortality rates) across administrative departments. Discussion. During the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in France - including the first confinement -, a general decrease in the number of hospitalizations for self-harm was observed. However, an increase was found among elderly, a population at higher Covid 19- related mortality risk, and in the number of more severe suicidal acts. These results, therefore, shed light on a complex relationship between the pandemic and self-harm occurrence. This situation may change with time, which requires active suicide prevention strategies.","Fabrice Jollant; Adrien Roussot; Emmanuelle Corruble; Jean-Christophe CHAUVET-GELINIER; Bruno Falissard; Yann Mikaeloff; Catherine Quantin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248480","20201224","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-24","",8518,""
"Emotional Adaptation During A Crisis: Decline in Anxiety and Depression After the Initial Weeks of COVID-19 in the United States","Objective: Crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic are known to exacerbate depression and anxiety, though their temporal trajectories remain unclear. The present study aims to investigate fluctuations in depression and anxiety using COVID-19 as a model crisis. Methods: 1,512 adults living in the U.S. enrolled in this online study on April 2nd, 2020 and were assessed weekly for 10 weeks (until June 4th, 2020; final n=537). Depression and anxiety were measured using the Zung Self-Rating Depression scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale), respectively, along with demographic and COVID-related questions. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to examine factors contributing to longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety. Results: Depression and anxiety levels were high in early April, but declined over time (F(9,4824)=17.53, p<.001 and F(9,4824)=23.35, p<.001, respectively). In addition to demographic factors such as sex, age, income, and psychiatric diagnoses, we identified some overlapping and some distinct dynamic factors contributing to changes in depression and anxiety: worsening of weekly individual economic impact of COVID-19 increased both depression and anxiety, while increased seven-day change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected pandemic duration were positively associated with anxiety, but not depression. Conclusions: Alongside evidence for overall emotional adaptation, these findings highlight overlapping (economic), yet distinct (change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected COVID-19 duration) factors contributing to fluctuations in depression and anxiety throughout the first wave of COVID-19. These results provide insight into socioeconomic policies and behavioral changes that can increase emotional adaptation in times of crisis.","Anastasia Shuster; Madeline O'Brien; Yi Luo; Matthew Heflin; Dongil Chung; Soojung Na; Ofer Perl; Kaustubh Kulkarni; Vincenzo G Fiore; Xiaosi Gu","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248773","20201224","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-24","",8519,""
"Psychiatric morbidities and Coping strategies in patients with different Coronavirus disease-2019 severities and chronic medical diseases: A multicenter cross-sectional study","COVID-19 patients especially those with chronic medical illnesses (CMI) may use different coping strategies to reduce their psychological distress while facing the COVID-19 infection The aim was to compare anxiety depression and coping styles between patients infected with COVID-19 disease with and without CMI during the peak of COVID-19 disease in Egypt This is a cross sectional study that included an online survey consisting of Arabic versions of General Health Questionnaire-12 Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Brief-COPE scale Questionnaires were distributed to adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection during their quarantine in Egypt. One hundred ninety nine patients responded to the survey where 46.73% of them had CMI. Religion emotional support use of informational support and acceptance were the most used coping strategies by participants. Avoidant coping strategies were frequently used by divorced patients home quarantined individuals patients who developed COVID-19 related anxiety/depression and patients who did not receive hydroxyl chloroquine. Approach strategies were frequently used by patients with mild COVID-19. Understanding the used coping strategies has implications for how individuals might be helped to manage their illness during the current presentation and intervene with development of serious long-term mental health conditions.","hend Ibrahim Shousha; Nagwan Madbouly; Shimaa Afify; Noha Asem; Rabab Maher; suaad Moussa; Amr Abdalazeem; Eslam Nageb; Khaled harhira; Hazem Elmorsy; Hassan Elgarem; Dalia Omran; mohamed hassany; Basem elsayed; Mohamed El kassas","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248379","20201224","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-24","",8520,""
"How the COVID-19 pandemic affects transgender health care in upper-middle income and high income countries - A worldwide, cross-sectional survey","Background Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to medical care was restricted for nearly all non-acute medical conditions. Due to their status as a vulnerable social group and the inherent need for transition-related treatments (e.g., hormone treatment), transgender people are assumed to be affected particularly severely by the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and health care of transgender people. Methods and findings As an ad hoc collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and 23 community organizations, we developed a web-based survey. The survey was translated into 26 languages, and participants were recruited via various social media and LGBTIQ-community sources. Recruitment started in May 2020. We assessed demographical data, physical and mental health problems (e.g., chronic physical conditions), risk factors (e.g., smoking), COVID-19 data (symptoms, contact history, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19), and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to transgender health care and health-related supplies. To identify factors associated with the experience of restrictions to transgender health care, we conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis. 5267 transgender people from 63 higher-middle income and high-income countries participated in the study. Over 50% of the participants had risk factors for a severe course of a COVID-19 infection and were at a high risk of avoiding testing or treatment of a COVID-19 infection due to the fear of mistreatment or discrimination. Access to transgender health care services was restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic for 50% of the participants. Male sex assigned at birth and a lower monthly income were significant predictors for the experience of restrictions to health care. 35.0% of the participants reported at least one mental health conditions. Every third participant had suicidal thoughts, and 3.2% have attempted suicide since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. A limitation of the study is that we did not analyze data from low-income countries and access to the internet was necessary to participate. Conclusions Transgender people are assumed to suffer under the severity of the pandemic even more than the general population due to the intersections between their status as a vulnerable social group, their high amount of medical risk factors, and their need for ongoing medical treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic can potentiate these vulnerabilities, add new challenges for transgender individuals, and, therefore, can lead to devastating consequences, like severe physical or mental health issues, self-harming behaviour, and suicidality.","Andreas Koehler; Joz Motmans; Leo Mulio Alvarez; David Azul; Karen Badalyan; Koray Basar; Cecilia Dhejne; Dragana Duisin; Bartosz Grabski; Aurore Dufrasne; Natasa Jokic-Begic; Antonio Prunas; Christina Richards; Kirill Sabir; Jaimie Vaele; Timo Ole Nieder","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248794","20201224","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-24","",8521,""
"The experience of European hospital-based healthcare workers on following infection prevention and control procedures for COVID-19","Background: Working under pandemic conditions exposes health care workers (HCWs) to infection risk and psychological strain. Protecting the physical and psychological health of HCWs is a key priority. This study assessed the perceptions of European hospital HCWs of local infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on their emotional wellbeing. Methods: We performed two rounds of an international cross-sectional survey, between 31 March and 17 April 2020 via existing research networks (round 1), and between 14 May and 31 August 2020 via online convenience sampling (round 2). Main outcome measures were (1) behavioural determinants of HCW adherence with IPC procedures, (2) WHO-5 Well-Being Index, a validated scale of 0-100 reflecting emotional wellbeing. The WHO-5 was interpreted as a score below or above 50 points, a cut-off score used in previous literature to screen for depression. Results: 2,289 HCWs (round 1: n=190, round 2: n=2,099) from 40 countries in Europe participated. Mean age of respondents was 42 ({+/-}11) years, 66% were female, 47% and 39% were medical doctors and nurses, respectively. 74% (n=1699) of HCWs were directly treating patients with COVID-19, of which 32% (n=527) reported they were fearful of caring for these patients. HCWs reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 infection risk to themselves (71%) and their family (82%) as a result of their job. 40% of HCWs considered that getting infected with COVID-19 was not within their control. This was more common among junior than senior HCWs (46% versus 38%, P value <.01). Sufficient COVID-19-specific IPC training, confidence in PPE use and institutional trust were positively associated with the feeling that becoming infected with COVID-19 was within their control. Female HCWs were more likely than males to report a WHO-5 score below 50 points (aOR 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.8). Conclusions: In Europe, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a differential impact on those providing direct COVID-19 patient care, junior staff and women. Health facilities must be aware of these differential impacts, build trust and provide tailored support for this vital workforce during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Denise van Hout; Paul Hutchinson; Marta Wanat; Caitlin Pilbeam; Herman Goossens; Sibyl Anthierens; Sarah Tonkin-Crine; Nina Gobat","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248793","20201224","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-24","",8522,""
"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of People living with SCI towards COVID-19 and their Psychological State during In-patient Rehabilitation in Bangladesh","Study Design: A prospective cross-sectional survey. Objective: The study aimed to examine the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of people living with Spinal cord injury (SCI) towards COVID-19 and their psychological status during in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh. Setting: The Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed (CRP) and the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation (NITOR), two tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: From July to September 2020, a prospective, cross-sectional survey of SCI subjects, 13-78 years of age, carried out in two SCI rehab centers in Bangladesh. Data has been collected by face to face interview through a pretested, and language validated questionnaire on KAP and Depression, Anxiety, Stress (DASS). Ethical approval and trial registration obtained prospectively. As all the patients were previously living with Spinal cord injury (SCI), therefore, all the patients admitted/ attend SCI rehab centers were considered as SCI positive samples. Results: A total of 207 people with SCI responded, 87%were male, and 13% were female with mean age34.18 (SD 12.9) years. 33.8% was tetraplegic and 66.2% was paraplegic and 63.8% of them were diagnosed ASIA-A, with a motor score mean 45.38, the sensory score of 97.2, SpO2 95.07, and Vo2max 35.7 mL/kg/min. 178 people had at least one health issue. Overall knowledge score was 8.59 (SD 2.3) out of 12, depression 11.18 (SD 8), anxiety 7.72 (SD 5.1), and stress were 9.32 (SD 6.7) from a total of 21 scores each. There was a correlation between Knowledge and DASS with age (P<.05); and Knowledge with gender (P<.05), and education (P<.01). Binary logistic regression found a higher association of Knowledge and DASS with gender (OR 6.6, 6.6, .95, 6.6; P<.01); and young age (OR.418, P<.01), illiterate (OR3.81, P<.01), and rural people (OR.48, P<.05) with knowledge. A linear relation was noted between depression and anxiety scores (r.45, P<.01) and stress scores (r.58, P<.01). A positive attitude was reported for the majority of subjects. SCI Persons reported they and the caregiver followed health advisory in consulting health professionals (65.7%), isolation (63.8%), droplet precaution (87.4%), and hygiene (90.3%). Conclusions: During in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh, the majority of SCI reported that they had communicated with health professionals and practiced behaviors that would reduce transmission and risk of COVID-19.","Mohammad Anwar Hossain; Iqbal Kabir Jahid; K M Amran Hossain; Mohamed Sakel; Md.

"Experiences of Psychotherapists With Remote Psychotherapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The current situation around the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures necessary to fight it are creating challenges for psychotherapists, who usually treat patients face-to-face with personal contact. The pandemic is accelerating the use of remote psychotherapy (ie, psychotherapy provided via telephone or the internet). However, some psychotherapists have expressed reservations regarding remote psychotherapy. As psychotherapists are the individuals who determine the frequency of use of remote psychotherapy, the potential of enabling mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic in line with the protective measures to fight COVID-19 can be realized only if psychotherapists are willing to use remote psychotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the experiences of psychotherapists with remote psychotherapy in the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria (between March 24 and April 1, 2020). METHODS: Austrian psychotherapists were invited to take part in a web-based survey. The therapeutic orientations of the psychotherapists (behavioral, humanistic, psychodynamic, or systemic), their rating of the comparability of remote psychotherapy (web- or telephone-based) with face-to-face psychotherapy involving personal contact, and potential discrepancies between their actual experiences and previous expectations with remote psychotherapy were assessed. Data from 1162 psychotherapists practicing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown were analyzed. RESULTS: Psychotherapy conducted via telephone or the internet was reported to not be totally comparable to psychotherapy with personal contact (P<.001). Psychodynamic (P=.001) and humanistic (P=.005) therapists reported a higher comparability of telephone-based psychotherapy to in-person psychotherapy than behavioral therapists. Experiences with remote therapy (both web- and telephone-based) were more positive than previously expected (P<.001). Psychodynamic therapists reported more positive experiences with telephone-based psychotherapy than expected compared to behavioral (P=.03) and systemic (P=.002) therapists. In general, web-based psychotherapy was rated more positively (regarding comparability to psychotherapy with personal contact and experiences vs expectations) than telephone-based psychotherapy (P<.001); however, psychodynamic therapists reported their previous expectations to be equal to their actual experiences for both telephone- and web-based psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotherapists found their experiences with remote psychotherapy (ie, web- or telephone-based psychotherapy) to be better than expected but found that this mode was not totally comparable to face-to-face psychotherapy with personal contact. Especially, behavioral therapists were found to rate telephone-based psychotherapy less favorably than therapists with other theoretical backgrounds.","Humer, Elke; Stippl, Peter; Pieh, Christoph; Pryss, RÃ¼diger; Probst, Thomas","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/20246","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(11): e20246, 2020 11 27.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(11): e20246, 2020 11 27.; /psychology; Psychotherapy/methods; Telemedicine/methods; /epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychotherapy/statistics & numerical data; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine/statistics & numerical data; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-24","",8533,""
"COVID-19 as 'Game Changer' for the Physical Activity and Mental Well-Being of Augmented Reality Game Players During the Pandemic: Mixed Methods Survey Study","BACKGROUND: Location-based augmented reality (AR) games, such as PokÃ©mon GO and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, have been shown to have a beneficial impact on the physical activity, social connectedness, and mental health of their players. In March 2020, global social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the AR games developer Niantic Inc to implement several changes to ensure continued player engagement with PokÃ©mon GO and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. We sought to examine how the physical and mental well-being of players of these games were affected during the unprecedented COVID-19 restriction period as well as how their video game engagement was affected. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine the impact of COVID-19-related social restrictions on the physical and mental well-being of AR game players; to examine the impact of COVID-19-related social restrictions on the use of video games and motivations for their use; and to explore the potential role of AR games (and video games in general) in supporting well-being during COVID-19-related social restrictions. METHODS: A mixed methods web-based self-reported survey was conducted in May 2020, during which COVID-19-related social restrictions were enforced in many countries. Participants were recruited on the web via four subreddits dedicated to PokÃ©mon GO or Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. Data collected included quantitative data on demographics, time spent playing video games, physical activity, and mental health; qualitative data included motivations to play and the impact of video games on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: We report results for 2004 participants (1153/1960 male, 58.8%, average age 30.5 years). Self-reported physical activity during COVID-19-related social restrictions significantly decreased from 7.50 hours per week on average (SD 11.12) to 6.50 hours (SD 7.81) (P<.001). More than half of the participants reported poor mental health (925/1766, 52.4%; raw World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index score <13). Female gender, younger age, and reduced exercise were significant predictors of poor mental health. Participants reported a significant increase in video game play time from 16.38 hours per week on average (SD 19.12) to 20.82 hours (SD 17.49) (P<.001). Approximately three quarters of the participants (n=1102/1427, 77.2%) reported that playing video games had been beneficial to their mental health. The changes made to PokÃ©mon GO and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite were very well received by players, and the players continued to use these games while exercising and to maintain social connection. In addition to seeking an escape during the pandemic and as a form of entertainment, participants reported that they used video games for emotional coping and to lower stress, relax, and alleviate mental health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: AR games have the potential to promote physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Used by populations under isolation and distress, these games can improve physical and mental health by providing virtual socialization, sustained exercise, temporal routine, and mental structure. Further research is needed to explore the potential of AR games as digital behavioral interventions to maintain human well-being in the wider population.","Ellis, Louise A; Lee, Matthew D; Ijaz, Kiran; Smith, James; Braithwaite, Jeffrey; Yin, Kathleen","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25117","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e25117, 2020 Dec 22.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e25117, 2020 Dec 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-24","",8534,""
"The mental health impact of COVID-19 and lockdown-related stressors among adults in the UK","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and subsequent lockdown may have affected the mental health of the population. This study examines whether there was an increase in the prevalence and incidence of common mental disorders (CMD) in the UK adult population during the first months of lockdown and whether changes in CMD were associated with stressors related to the pandemic and lockdown. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study waves 10-11: 2019-2020 and waves 1-4 of the COVID-19 monthly surveys in April (n = 17 761) to July 2020 (n = 13 754), a representative sample of UK adult population, were analysed. CMD was measured using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (cut-off >2). Changes in CMD were analysed in relation to COVID-19 and social stressors. RESULTS: Around 29% of adults without CMD less than a year earlier had a CMD in April 2020. However, by July 2020, monthly incidence of CMD had reduced to 9%. Most employment, financial and psychological 'shocks' were at their highest levels in April and reduced steadily in later months. Despite the lifting of some lockdown conditions by July, stressors related to loneliness, unemployment, financial problems and domestic work continued to influence CMD. CONCLUSION: Some COVID-19 policy responses such as furloughing may have been effective in mitigating the increase in CMD for some groups of employees. Despite some reduction in levels of pandemic and lockdown-related stressors by the middle of 2020, loneliness and financial stressors remained key determinants of incidence in CMD among the UK adult population.","Chandola, Tarani; Kumari, Meena; Booker, Cara L; Benzeval, Michaela","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720005048","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-10, 2020 Dec 07.; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-10, 2020 Dec 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-24","",8535,""
