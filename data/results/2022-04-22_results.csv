"THE MEDIATING ROLE OF RESILIENCE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SELFCOMPASSION AND DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS IN THE COVID-19 PROCESS","In this study, it is aimed to determine whether the symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress differ according to the data obtained on the Covid-19 process and determine the mediator role of psychological resilience in the relationship between self-compassion and depression, anxiety and stress levels in the Covid-19 process. 590 people (180 diagnosed with Covid-19, 410 people not diagnosed with Covid-19) between the ages of 25-65 participated in the study. Personal Information Form, Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) were applied to the participants in the study. According to the data obtained on the Covid-19 process, it was determined that the levels of depression, anxiety and stress differed statistically significantly. Furthermore, the research pointed out that psychological resilience plays an intermediary role on the relationship between self-compassion and the depression, anxiety;however, there is no intermediary role of psychological resilience in the relationship between self-compassion and stress. Although the research has various limitations, the findings indicate that the concepts of selfcompassion and resilience play a protective role against the psychological symptoms caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which is now considered a ' challenging life event'.

"Accurately prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections based on the basic principles of infectious disease prevention and control","The novel coronavirus pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) pandemic has been raging around the world for almost 2 years. Due to the different prevention and control policies and measures adopted by various countries, uneven distribution of vaccines and rapid mutation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pandemic is still very serious. With the process of the pandemic, in-depth research and understanding of the clinical characteristics and epidemiology of COVID-19 and biological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 have been made. Widespread vaccination of the population plays a decisive role in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is still a certain percentage of breakthrough infections after vaccination. Therefore, the physical protection is still very important based on the basic principles of infectious disease prevention and control (management of the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission and protection of the susceptible population). Practice has proved that ""widespread vaccination + effective physical precautions"" is a fundamental measure for comprehensive control of COVID-19 pandemic, and both are indispensable.","Mao, Qing","https://doi.org/10.16016/j.1000-5404.202112023","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Army Medical University; 44(1):28-33, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30389,""

"Mobile Arts for Peace (MAP) at home: digital art-based mental health provision in response to COVID-19","This article will provide an example of how the 'Mobile Arts for Peace (MAP): Online psychosocial support through the arts in Rwanda' project used digital art-based workshops to facilitate social and community cohesion and mental health provision. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increased need for psychosocial support due to the economic and social pressures of lockdown and yet many individuals had less access to mental health provision. While many mental health services around the world went online, there was still a gap between the Global South and Global North in terms of digital literacy, access to smart phones and computers, and the variation between psychosocial support through individual vs. collective healing alongside Indigenous and traditional vs. western psychosocial approaches. Implications for the use of art-based digital methods as a tool for mental health provision during and after the wake of the pandemic are explored.","Breed, A.; Uwihoreye, C.; Ndushabandi, E.; Elliott, M.; Pells, K.","https://doi.org/10.1386/jaah_00094_1","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Applied Arts & Health; 13(1):77-95, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30391,""
"Creative space for navigating complex times: using art-based inquiry to respond to uncertainty during COVID-19","This article shares the outcomes of a participatory art-based inquiry conducted during stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19 and the impact on the mental health and well-being of college-age students (age 18-21) in the United States. Participants engaged in artmaking sessions alongside researchers to respond to prompts geared to help them process their experiences. Findings that emerged from the project suggest that art-based practices in a community setting may support students in navigating times of great uncertainty by offering participants a chance to express themselves and process complicated feelings. Based on our findings, we offer art-based practices as a way to support young adults as they process the negative impact of the pandemic, transition back to campus, and navigate the college experience.","Becker, K.

"Economic and Social Interactions in Business Students during COVID-19 Confinement: Relationship with Sleep Disturbance","The objective of the study was to observe the effect of sleep on students in the first week (Point 1) of strict confinement and to analyze its evolution after one and two months (Point 2) of strict confinement during COVID-19. The evolution of sleep, in association with affected income status, family relations, and the death or infection of a family member or friend by COVID-19 was examined. Students responded to a survey that included questions relating to sleep quality and general well-being from the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). Sleep disturbance increased over strict confinement but was substantially more and with greater intensity in the case of students not living with family members. The results show that loss of family income, loss of a family member or friend, and having a friend or family member infected affected sleep quality negatively at Point 1. However, at Point 2, confinement itself affected students sleep, as well as the variables analyzed. Domestic harmony was a positive correlation for better sleep health. The study is important for managing coping policies and diagnosis.","GarcÃƒÂ­a, Garvey","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12040100","20220421","EQLS; death; family satisfaction; income; infection; lockdown; mental health; quarantine; sleep; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30393,""
"Social isolation transitions and psychological distress among older adults in rural China: A longitudinal study before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic could increase the number of older adults who are socially isolated including community-dwelling older adults, and result in the secondary damage of mental health. This study aimed to examine the longitudinal association between social isolation transitions and psychological distress among the community-dwelling older adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural China. A total of 2749 community-dwelling older adults aged 60Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years and older in rural Shandong, China were included. We used the generalized estimating equations (GEE) model to estimate the impact of social isolation transitions on psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The percentage of high and very high psychological distress (K10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¯22) was 23.54% and 31.36% before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively, indicating a 7.82% increase (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Compared with the group remaining nonisolated, ""became socially isolated"" and ""remained isolated"" groups were more likely to have a deterioration of psychological distress after experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic (became socially isolated: bÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.92, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001; remained isolated: bÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.98, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). The main variables in this study were measured by self-report information, which might result in recall bias. During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological distress increased among the community-dwelling older adults in rural China. There was a significant risk of psychological distress among those who had transitioned from nonisolation before the pandemic to social isolation after experiencing the pandemic, thus intervention on social isolation process during the pandemic may be important to protect older adults' mental health.","Li, Li, Yan, Yang, Li, Li, Gui, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.045","20220421","COVID-19; Older adults; Psychological distress; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30394,""
"The protective role of parental involvement at home in negative psychological outcomes among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic","The COVID-19 outbreak has generated many negative psychological outcomes, such as depression, in adolescents. Exploration of protective factors for adolescent mental health is urgently needed, and no research has examined the role of parental involvement. From March to April 2020, valid data were collected from 1663 Chinese adolescents through online demographic and other questionnaires. Parental involvement at home was assessed by an adapted questionnaire on parental support in learning at home, stress since the COVID-19 outbreak was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, and three negative psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)) were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and PTSD Check List-Civilian Version, respectively. In total, 35.4%, 21% and 25% of adolescents had depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and PTSS, respectively. Three moderated mediation models consistently showed the following: a. Parental involvement indirectly reduced the three psychological problems by alleviating perceived stress, and the indirect effects were not moderated by sex. b. There were negative direct effects of parental involvement on the three psychological problems, and the links were not moderated by sex. c. Sex moderated the associations between perceived stress and the three psychological problems. The cross-sectional design and the sampling of all participants from one junior high school impeded causal inferences and the generalization of our findings, respectively. We found similar indirect and direct protective roles of parental involvement in boys' and girls' mental health, and girls were more vulnerable to stress.","Ding, Jia, Xiong, Chen, Xiong, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.074","20220421","Anxiety; Depression; Mental health; Parental involvement; Posttraumatic stress symptoms; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30395,""
"Distressed Democrats and relaxed Republicans? Partisanship and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic was a potent stressor, yielding unprecedented levels of mental distress. However, public health responses and personal reactions to the pandemic were politically polarized, with Democrats highlighting and Republicans downplaying its severity. Did Republicans subsequently experience as much mental distress as Democrats during the COVID-19 pandemic? This study examines partisan patterns in mental health outcomes at three time points throughout the pandemic. Results demonstrate a clear partisan distress gap, with Democrats consistently reporting worse mental health than Republicans. Trend data suggest that the 2020 pandemic patterns are a continuation and exacerbation of an existing partisan distress gap. Consideration of race, however, demonstrates a widening partisan distress gap, specific to white Americans. Among white Americans, therefore, Democrats experienced a substantially greater increase in distress in response to the pandemic than Republicans.","Bock, Schnabel","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266562","20220421","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30396,""
"'Sleep and emotions: How much are they affected by confinement due to COVID-19? A longitudinal study'","Our aim is to study changes in sleep and emotions in Spanish population during the confinement period due to first wave of COVID-19. A total of 363 adults (69.4% women) aged between 18 and 65 (M<sub>ageÃ‚Â </sub>= 32.59; SD = 12.57) participated in the study. Socio-demographics, sleep quality and emotional experience were evaluated. The study was longitudinal: a first data collection was developed after 15Ã‚Â d of confinement (asking for a subjective comparison with the pre-confined period), and a second collection after 30Ã‚Â d. Results suggest differences in sleep quality depending on the time confined. Difficulty falling asleep increases and daytime activity decreases with longer confined periods. Morning fatigue, sleepiness and nightmares are reduced significantly after 15Ã‚Â d of confinement when compared with the subjective data from pre-confinement. After 15Ã‚Â d of confinement participants felt higher levels of apathy, sadness, irritability and lower levels of euphoria and joy than they remember feeling before confinement. Anxiety, concern and fear seem to increase at 15Ã‚Â d of confinement and decrease at 30Ã‚Â d. Sleep quality and emotional experiences in confinement are closely correlated. The confinement in Spain worsened the emotional state and changed sleep habits, although it did not necessarily worsen the quality of sleep. Key pointsThere are differences in sleep quality depending on the time spent in confinement.Confinement situation is related with higher levels of apathy, sadness, and irritability and lower levels of euphoria and joy.Anxiety, concern and fear seem to increase at 15 d of confinement and then decrease at 30Ã‚Â d.Sleep quality and emotional experiences in confinement are closely correlated.After COVID-19, there is a remarkable need of attend the disturbances emerged in sleep habits and daily moods of general popunlation.","MÃƒÂ³naco, ZaragozÃƒÂ¡, Montoya-Castilla","https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2022.2060838","20220421","COVID-19; Sleep; confinement; emotions; longitudinal study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30397,""
"[Psychological interventions on the Internet and digital therapeutics in the field of mental health: are we ready?]","In the last years, Information and Communication Technology has increasingly offered solutions in the field of psychology and mental health. Internet-based psychological interventions, apps, solutions based on social media have been suggested as tools to be used with the usual psychotherapy interventions, or in some cases, in substitution to them. Many of these are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (which by its nature is easily transferable into digital format) and fall into the category of digital therapeutics. On the other hand, tele-psychiatry, an area in strong expansion (also justified by the need to continue providing care to patients in this period of covid-19 which has prevented, or severely limited, face-to-face meetings), seems to improve the access to specialized mental health care, reduce delays in care, reduce stigma and promote greater patient attention. There is evidence that comes from randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analysis and that demonstrates the efficacy of these tools in managing and preventing episodes of depression, anxiety and addictions. For other mental health disorders further confirmation is needed. In this context, it is therefore necessary to make greater use of randomized clinical trials with an adequate number of patients recruited, with a sufficient observation period and with easily measurable endpoints.","Santoro","https://doi.org/10.1701/3792.37762","20220421","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30398,""
"Supporting business educators and students against COVID-19 trauma using trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy","The outbreak of COVID-19 manifests in peoples' mental health and psychological dispositions and may also result to acute distress, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on victims. The objective of this study was to support business educators' and students' mental health against coronavirus trauma using trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). The participants (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 74 - educators and students) who indicated PTSD symptoms based on the self-reporting questionnaire they filled, were randomly assigned to treatment and waitlist control groups. The TF-CBT manual was used for the intervention. The intervention was a 14-week treatment with 2Ã¢â‚¬Å weeks follow-up meeting. Using repeated measures of Analysis of Variance, we determined the level of improvement of each participant in the treatment group against Coronavirus trauma at the end of the intervention. The study established that gender has no significant difference in determining the effects of Coronavirus trauma on participants. Through intervention, the PTSDs and depression arising from Coronavirus event were significantly reduced in the treatment group. Again, there was a significant improvement in the participants' general mental health at the end of the intervention. Hence, we established the implication for research and practice in line with the outcome of the study. The study advocates that TF-CBT should be employed by educational institutions in Nigeria to cushion the traumatic effects of coronavirus and future disasters on both workers and students. We conclude that mental health problems remain a serious challenge among business educators and students in this COVID-19 pandemic era. The study established that low educational qualifications, PTSD symptoms and negative coping strategies are the factors aggravating the general low mental health of the study participants. Finally, we advocate that the educational institutions in Nigeria should adopt TF-CBT interventions to support staff and students' mental health against adverse effects of COVID-19.","Edeh, Ugwoke, Anaele, Madusaba, Naboth-Odums, Isiwu, Olinya, Enyi, David, Yumma, Yeldim, Odunukwe, Victor, Abubakar","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000029133","20220421","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30399,""
"A Pandemic Perspective: Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 on Diabetes Management and Mood Through the Lens of Location and Family Conflict","The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of COVID-19 on teens' diabetes management and mood and their association with family conflict.

At baseline, dyads completed the Revised Diabetes Family Conflict scale and a survey measuring the impact of COVID-19 on teens' mood and diabetes management. Parent- and teen-reported impacts of COVID-19 on diabetes management and teen mood were positively correlated. Higher levels of both parent- and teen-reported family conflict were associated with greater parent-reported impact of COVID-19 on diabetes management and teen mood. In addition, teen-reported impact of COVID-19 on their mood varied by geographical location but not population density. COVID-19 influenced teen diabetes management and mood, and the impact of COVID-19 was related to diabetes-related family conflict and differed by geographic location.

"Family relationships and familism among Mexican Americans on the US-Mexico border during the COVID-19 pandemic","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a disproportionately negative impact on communities of color across the U.S., including Mexican Americans. The present study examined the influence of the pandemic on family relationships among individuals living in the U.S.-Mexico border region and how changes in family relationships were related to both familism values and mental health. Two hundred ninety-one college Latino students participated in a survey that asked about changes in family relationships and mental health since the beginning of the pandemic. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the majority of respondents indicated their family relationships had not changed since the beginning of the pandemic. However, those who reported negative changes in their family relationships also reported worse mental health whereas those who reported positive changes reported higher familism values. Mediational models revealed an indirect effect of familism support values on depression via changes in family relationships. Although cross-sectional, these results provide preliminary evidence of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Mexican Americans in the border region, as well as cultural factors that promote resilience in times of stress.

"LC-MS/MS Determination of 88 Psychotropic Drugs in 1865 Hair Samples From Addicts in Drug Abstinence","The emergence of novel drugs and the continuous expansion of the scope of the types of drugs under control have greatly increased requests for screening of a range of drugs in hair. Here, a multi-analyte method for the detection and quantification of 88 psychotropic drugs in the hair of addicts in drug abstinence was developed and fully validated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Hair samples (25 mg) were washed, cut into pieces, cryogenically ground, and extracted in methanol. The extracted analytes were separated on an Allure PFPP column (100Ãƒâ€”2.1 mm, 5 mm i.d., Restek, USA) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The limits of detection and limits of quantification ranged from 0.1 to 20 pg/mg and 0.2 to 50 pg/mg, respectively. The intra- and inter-assay precisions (RSD) of all analysis ranged from 0.9 to 14.9% and 1.9 to 15.9%, respectively. Accuracy values were 100Ã‚Â±20%. The extraction recovery of quality control samples ranged from 50.9% to 99.6% for all analytes. The matrix effects for all analytes ranged from 46.8% to 99.7%. The method was successfully used to analyze 1,865 hair samples from addicts in drug rehabilitation at their own communities.. Among the samples, 129 cases were positive; the majority of positive cases were from males (78.29%), 92.25% of whom were over 35 years old. Traditional drugs, like methamphetamine and opioids, accounted for most positive cases, and 27 of the abstinence cases with a use history of methamphetamine were still positive. In addition to abused drugs, like methamphetamine, morphine, and cocaine, the sedative hypnotic and psychotherapeutic drugs, including clonazepam, alprazolam, estazolam, zolpidem, and quetiapine, were detected in 26% of the hair samples, suggesting that these addicts may have insomnia and mental problems such as depression and psychosis, probably due to the long-term effects of drugs and withdrawal reactions. Three synthetic cannabinoids were also detected in 4 (2.7%) cases. A total of 37 cases were positive for methadone, tramadol, and dextromethorphan, reflecting a new trend of alternative drug use when traditional drugs were not easy to obtain during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Ji, Xu, Yan, Xiang, Shen","https://doi.org/10.1093/jat/bkac024","20220421","Drug abstinence; Hair analysis; LC-MS/MS; Screening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30403,""
"Outdoor Activity in the Daytime, but Not the Nighttime, Predicts Better Mental Health Status During the COVID-19 Curfew in the United Arab Emirates","The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated infection prevention and control measures had a negative impact on the mental health of many people. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), infection control measures implemented after March 24th, 2020, placed necessary restrictions on people's freedom of movement. This study aimed to assess the association between levels of daytime vs. nighttime outdoor activity and mental health among a sample of UAE residents during the lockdown period. An opportunity sample of 245 participants completed an online survey assessing levels of depression, somatic symptoms, daytime and nighttime activity levels. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that daytime activity, but not nighttime activity, was associated with a lower risk of clinically significant depressive and somatic symptomatology. The association of better mental health with daytime not nighttime outdoor activity could be possibly attributed to vitamin D, but further studies are needed to confirm this speculation.","Al Anouti, Thomas, Karras, El Asswad","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.829362","20220421","COVID-19; United Arab Emirates; depressive symptoms; somatization; vitamin D","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30404,""
"The Impact of ""COVID-19"" and ""Webinar Pandemic"" on Plastic Surgery Practice in Teaching Institutes and Resident Training-A Multicentric Perspective","<b>Introduction</b> Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The study was carried out to quantify the changes induced by the pandemic in plastic surgery practice and training and to study the impact of the webinars on plastic surgery education from a residents' perspective. <b>Methods</b> Ã¢â‚¬Æ’In this multicentric study, the number and type of surgeries, cause of injuries, and their regional variation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) period (February-September 2020) were compared with pre-COVID-19 time. An online survey on the impact of webinars was conducted for plastic surgery trainees across the country. <b>Results</b> Ã¢â‚¬Æ’There was a significant reduction in total number of surgeries ( <i>p</i> = 0.003). The procedures for hand ( <i>p</i> = 0.156), faciomaxillary injuries ( <i>p</i> = 0.25), and replantations ( <i>p</i> = 0.46) were comparable; there was a significant reduction in combined orthopedic-plastic-surgical procedures ( <i>p</i> = 0.009) during the pandemic. There was a significant reduction in road accidents ( <i>p</i> = 0.007) and suicidal injuries ( <i>p</i> = 0.002) and increase in assault ( <i>p</i> = 0.03) and domestic accidents ( <i>p</i> = 0.01) during the COVID-19 period. A usefulness score of &gt;8 was given for the webinars by 68.7% residents. There was no significant difference in perception of utility when correlated with the academic program at their institutes ( <i>p</i> = 0.109); 92% opined webinars should continue in post-COVID times. <b>Conclusion</b> Ã¢â‚¬Æ’There was a drastic reduction in number of elective and emergency procedures during the COVID-19 time, negatively affecting resident training program.

"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on Host Factors Involved in Mental Disorders","COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a systemic illness due to its multiorgan effects in patients. The disease has a detrimental impact on respiratory and cardiovascular systems. One early symptom of infection is anosmia or lack of smell; this implicates the involvement of the olfactory bulb in COVID-19 disease and provides a route into the central nervous system. However, little is known about how SARS-CoV-2 affects neurological or psychological symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 exploits host receptors that converge on pathways that impact psychological symptoms. This systemic review discusses the ways involved by coronavirus infection and their impact on mental health disorders. We begin by briefly introducing the history of coronaviruses, followed by an overview of the essential proteins to viral entry. Then, we discuss the downstream effects of viral entry on host proteins. Finally, we review the literature on host factors that are known to play critical roles in neuropsychiatric symptoms and mental diseases and discuss how COVID-19 could impact mental health globally. Our review details the host factors and pathways involved in the cellular mechanisms, such as systemic inflammation, that play a significant role in the development of neuropsychological symptoms stemming from COVID-19 infection.","Rhoades, Solomon, Johnson, Teng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.845559","20220421","SARS-CoV-2; depression; mental disorders; psychosis; schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30406,""
"Perceptions of Telemental Health Care Delivery During COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study With Providers, February-March 2021","The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of telemental health (TMH). Providers with limited TMH experience faced challenges during the rapid switch to remote patient care. We investigated TMH providers' perceptions about remote care one year into the pandemic according to <i>when</i> providers adopted telemedicine (i.e., before <i>vs.</i> after March 2020) and <i>how much</i> of their caseloads were served remotely (i.e., &lt; 50% <i>vs.</i> Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50%). Between February-March 2021, 472 TMH providers completed a cross-sectional, web-based survey that measured perceived benefits and satisfaction with telemedicine, therapeutic alliance, patient-centered communication, eHealth literacy, multicultural counseling self-efficacy, and facilitating factors of using telemedicine. Providers who began using telemedicine before the pandemic reported having better training, task-related therapeutic alliance with patients, and ability to conduct multicultural interventions, assessments, and session management. Providers who served Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50% of their caseload remotely reported greater satisfaction with their practice, stronger beliefs about the benefits of telemedicine, and greater perceived effects of telemedicine on alleviating the impact of COVID-19. There were no differences in reports of patient-centered communication nor eHealth literacy. In conclusion, providers who adopted TMH more recently may require additional training and support to successfully establish a working alliance with their patients, especially with multicultural aspects of care.","Wilczewski, Paige, Ong, Barrera, Soni, Welch, Bunnell","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.855138","20220421","COVID-19; mental health; quality of care; telemedicine; telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30407,""
"Mindfulness-based online intervention increases well-being and decreases stress after Covid-19 lockdown","Mindfulness interventions were shown to be effective in improving well-being and reducing perceived stress in several conditions. These effects were also found in online mindfulness-based training, especially in employees in organizational environments. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness ofÃ‚Â an online mindfulness intervention on healthy employees, especially after the first Italian Covid-19 lockdown. Participants in the intervention group underwent an 8-week mindfulness online training program based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) protocol compared to a control (no-intervention) group. All participants filled in weekly surveys for the whole intervention duration via online questionnaires to measure their habits, mindfulness (FFMQ-15), emotion regulation (ERQ), positive and negative affect (PANAS), depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21), resilience (RSA) and insomnia (ISI). 69 participants in the intervention group and 63 in the no-treatment control group were considered in the longitudinal analyses. We found significant differences between the intervention and control groups over time in the measures of mindfulness (in particular the nonreactivity subscale), positive affect, depression, and insomnia. Moreover, we found that the frequency of practice and ease perceived in practicing were positively correlated to several indices of well-being (mindfulness, positive affect, cognitive reappraisal) and negatively correlated to several indices of stress (negative affect, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, expressive suppression). These results show the importance and effectiveness of online mindfulness training programs to cope with stress among employees, especially after the Covid-19 lockdown.","Bossi, Zaninotto, D'Arcangelo, Lattanzi, Malizia, Ricciardi","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-10361-2","20220421","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30408,""
"The silent burden: a landscape analysis of common perinatal mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries","Mental health has long fallen behind physical health in attention, funding, and action-especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It has been conspicuously absent from global reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health (MNCAH) programming, despite increasing awareness of the intergenerational impact of common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs). However, the universal health coverage (UHC) movement and COVID-19 have brought mental health to the forefront, and the MNCAH community is looking to understand how to provide women effective, sustainable care at scale. To address this, MOMENTUM Country and Global Leadership (MCGL) commissioned a landscape analysis in December 2020 to assess the state of CPMDs and identify what is being done to address the burden in LMICs. The landscape analysis (LA) used a multitiered approach. First, reviewers chose a scoping review methodology to search literature in PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychInfo, and Scopus. Titles and abstracts were reviewed before a multidisciplinary team conducted data extraction and analysis on relevant articles. Second, 44 key informant interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted with mental health, MNCAH, humanitarian, nutrition, gender-based violence (GBV), advocacy, and implementation research experts. Finally, reviewers completed a document analysis of relevant mental health policies from 19 countries. The LA identified risk factors for CPMDs, maternal mental health interventions and implementation strategies, and remaining knowledge gaps. Risk factors included social determinants, such as economic or gender inequality, and individual experiences, such as stillbirth. Core components identified in successful perinatal mental health (PMH) interventions at community level included stepped care, detailed context assessments, task-sharing models, and talk therapy; at health facility level, they included pre-service training on mental health, trained and supervised providers, referral and assessment processes, mental health support for providers, provision of respectful care, and linkages with GBV services. Yet, significant gaps remain in understanding how to address CPMDs. These findings illuminate an urgent need to provide CPMD prevention and care to women in LMICs. The time is long overdue to take perinatal mental health seriously. Efforts should strive to generate better evidence while implementing successful approaches to help millions of women ""suffering in silence.""","McNab, Dryer, Fitzgerald, Gomez, Bhatti, Kenyi, Somji, Khadka, Stalls","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04589-z","20220421","Child health; Common perinatal mental disorders; Maternal health; Maternal mental health; Perinatal mental health; Social determinants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30409,""
"The psychometric properties of the Bangla Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5): preliminary reports from a large-scale validation study","The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) is the most widely used screening tool in assessing posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM-5) criteria. This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly translated Bangla PCL-5. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 10,605 individuals (61.0% male; mean age: 23.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.5 [13-71Ã‚Â years]) during May and June 2020, several months after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. The survey included the Bangla PCL-5 and the PHQ-9 depression scale. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test the four-factor DSM-5 model, the six-factor Anhedonia model, and the seven-factor hybrid model. The Bangla PCL-5 displayed adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alphaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.90). The Bangla PCL-5 score was significantly correlated with scores of the PHQ-9 depression scale, confirming strong convergent validity. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated the models had a good fit to the data, including the four-factor DSM-5 model, the six-factor Anhedonia model, and the seven-factor hybrid model. Overall, the seven-factor hybrid model exhibited the best fit to the data. The Bangla PCL-5 appears to be a valid and reliable psychometric screening tool that may be employed in the prospective evaluation of posttraumatic stress disorder in Bangladesh.","Islam, Ferdous, Sujan, Tasnim, Masud, Kundu, Mosaddek, Choudhuri, Kira, Gozal","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03920-4","20220421","Bangla; Confirmatory factor analysis; Depression; PCL-5; PTSD","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30410,""
"Paradigm Shift in Pattern &amp;amp; Prevalence of Poisoning During Covid-19 Pandemic","Poisoning and drug overdose are the medical emergencies in which it is important to identify the incidence, pattern and the outcome in order to take relevant steps for stringent planning not only at the hospital level but also at the community level for its prevention and management. The current pandemic of COVID-19 has had a tremendous effect on the psychological state of the people. An observational, prospective study was conducted for 100 patients reporting to medical emergency with history of poisoning intake from April 2020 to January 2021. Age range was 14-85 years. Obtained data were analysed using descriptive statistics and results were expressed as percentage and mean. Out of 100 patients (77M,33F), mean age of 32.6 years, most cases belong to age group of 20-30 years and 50% were matriculates and majority of the patients belonged to Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. The most common poisoning agents consumed were corrosives (34%) followed by cellular toxins (24%). Respiratory distress (53%), loss of consciousness (43%), acute kidney injury (36%) were the common clinical presentations. PSS (Poisoning Severity Score) was moderate in 52% of patients, 14% had severe, 16% of patients had fatal PSS scores and 18% of patients had minor PSS. 16 patients with fatal PSS and 16 patients with moderate to severe PSS got expired. High mortality of 33% was seen in our study. The most vulnerable group in our study was of young males in age group of 21-30 years and less educated, who had lost their jobs due to Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Corrosives were the most commonly consumed poison during lockdown. Our study found that scoring systems PSS and GCS were good assessment tools for degree of severity of poisoning at an early stage.","Singla, Behera, Sharma, Sharma","https://www.google.com/search?q=Paradigm+Shift+in+Pattern+&amp;amp;+Prevalence+of+Poisoning+During+Covid-19+Pandemic.","20220421","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","",30411,""
