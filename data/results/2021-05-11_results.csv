"COVID-19 Compromises In The Medical Practice And The Consequential Effect On Endometriosis Patients","Background and purpose In response to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, self-isolation practices aimed to curb the spread of COVID-19 have severely complicated the medical management of patients suffering from endometriosis and their physical and mental well- being. Endometriosis, the main cause for chronic pelvic pain (CPP), is a highly prevalent disease characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue in locations outside the uterine cavity that affects up to 10% of women in their reproductive age. This study aimed to explore the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on patients suffering from endometriosis across multiple countries, and to investigate the different approaches to the medical management of these patients based on their self- reported experiences. Methods A cross-sectional survey, partially based on validated quality of life questionnaires for endometriosis patients, was initially created in English, which was then reviewed by experts. Through the process of assessing face and content validity, the questionnaire was then translated to fifteen different languages following the WHO recommendations for medical translation. After evaluation, the questionnaire was converted into a web form and distributed across different platforms. An analysis of 2964 responses of participants from 59 countries suffering from self-reported endometriosis was then conducted. Results The data shows an association between COVID-19 imposed compromises with the reported worsening of the mental state of the participants, as well as with the aggravation of their symptoms. For the 1174 participants who had their medical appointments cancelled, 43.7% (n=513) reported that their symptoms had been aggravated, and 49.3% (n=579) reported that their mental state had worsened. In comparison, of the 1180 participants who kept their appointments, only 29.4% (n=347) stated that their symptoms had been aggravated, and 27.5% (n=325) stated their mental health had worsened. 610 participants did not have medical appointments scheduled, and these participants follow a similar pattern as the participants who kept their appointments, with 29.0% (n=177) reporting aggravation of symptoms and 28.2% (n=172) reporting that their mental state had worsened. Conclusions These findings suggest that COVID-19 pandemic has had a clinically significant negative effect on the mental and physical well-being of participants suffering from endometriosis based on their self-reported experiences. Thus, they show the importance of further assessment and reevaluation of the current and future management of this condition in medical practices worldwide.

"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital workers over time: Relationship to occupational role, living with children and elders, and modifiable factors","The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a sustained psychological impact on healthcare workers. We assessed individual characteristics related to changes in emotional exhaustion and psychological distress over time. A survey of diverse hospital staff measured emotional exhaustion (Maslach Burnout Inventory) and psychological distress (K6) in Fall 2020 (T<sub>1</sub>) and Winter 2021 (T<sub>2</sub>). Relationships between occupational, personal, and psychological variables were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA. Of 539 T<sub>1</sub> participants, 484 (89.9%) completed T<sub>2</sub>. Emotional exhaustion differed by occupational role (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.3, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001; greatest in nurses), with increases over time in those with children (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.5, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .004) or elders (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.0, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .047). Psychological distress was inversely related to pandemic self-efficacy (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 110.0, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), with increases over time in those with children (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.0, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .008). Severe emotional exhaustion occurred in 41.1% (95%CI 36.6-45.4) at T<sub>1</sub> and 49.8% (95%CI 45.4-54.2) at T<sub>2</sub> (McNemar test pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Psychological distress occurred in 9.7% (95%CI 7.1-12.2) at T<sub>1</sub> and 11.6% (95%CI 8.8-14.4) at T<sub>2</sub> (McNemar test pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .33). Healthcare workers' psychological burden is high and rising as the pandemic persists. Ongoing support is warranted, especially for nurses and those with children and elders at home. Modifiable protective factors, restorative sleep and self-efficacy, merit special attention.","Maunder, Heeney, Kiss, Hunter, Jeffs, Ginty, Johnstone, Loftus, Wiesenfeld","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2021.04.012","20210510","Burnout; Covid-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Nursing; Occupational health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13595,""
"The Role of Trauma in Mothers' COVID-19 Vaccine Beliefs and Intentions","Research on COVID-19 vaccine beliefs has focused primarily on adults' intentions to vaccinate themselves; however, many parents will also face decisions about vaccinating their children. In this study, we examine how maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma history relate to mothers' beliefs and intentions about the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children. A total of 240 mothers with a mental health history participating in a parenting study answered online survey questions via Prolific. Questions assessed: (a) trauma indictors (past diagnosis, current symptoms, and lifetime exposure to events); (b) vaccine measures (intentions for self and child, COVID-19 vaccine confidence, general vaccine perceived safety, reasoning about vaccine intentions, sources of influence on intentions); and (c) possible explanatory variables (institutional distrust, negative worldviews). ANCOVAs and regression analyses were used. When compared with mothers with other mental health diagnoses, mothers with a PTSD history had significantly less confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and less intent to get the vaccine for themselves or their child. These effects were explained by greater institutional distrust (i.e., significant indirect effects). Mothers with a previous PTSD diagnosis also expressed different reasons for vaccine hesitancy (e.g., less belief in science) and ascribed less influence to healthcare and governmental sources in vaccine decision-making. Findings highlight the potential utility of a trauma-informed approach in efforts to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. For mothers with a history of PTSD, addressing institutional distrust, including towards the healthcare industry, may be an important element to consider in the content, delivery, and mode of vaccine messaging.","Milan, DÃƒÂ¡u","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab043","20210510","COVID-19; immunology (including HIV); parents; posttraumatic stress trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13596,""
"Immersive Virtual Reality to Improve Outcomes in Veterans With Stroke: Protocol for a Single-Arm Pilot Study","Over the last decade, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a cutting-edge technology in stroke rehabilitation. VR is defined as a type of computer-user interface that implements real-time simulation of an activity or environment allowing user interaction via multiple sensory modalities. In a stroke population, VR interventions have been shown to enhance motor, cognitive, and psychological recovery when utilized as a rehabilitation adjunct. VR has also demonstrated noninferiority to usual care therapies for stroke rehabilitation. The proposed pilot study aims to (1) determine the feasibility and tolerability of using a therapeutic VR platform in an inpatient comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program and (2) estimate the initial clinical efficacy (effect size) associated with the VR platform using apps for pain distraction and upper extremity exercise for poststroke neurologic recovery. This study will be conducted in the Comprehensive Integrated Inpatient Rehabilitation Program at the James A Haley Veterans' Hospital. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 10 clinical staff members to assess the feasibility of the VR platform from the clinician perspective. A prospective within-subject pretest-posttest pilot design will be used to examine the tolerability of the VR platform and the clinical outcomes (ie, upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, pain severity) in 10 veteran inpatients. A VR platform consisting of commercially available pain distraction and upper extremity apps will be available at the participants' bedside for daily use during their inpatient stay (approximately 4-6 weeks). Clinician interviews will be analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis. Cohen d effect sizes with corresponding 95% CIs will be calculated for upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, and pain. The proportion of participants who achieve minimal clinically important difference after using the VR platform will be calculated for each clinical outcome. This study was selected for funding in August 2020. Institutional review board approval was received in October 2020. The project start date was December 2020. The United States Department has issued a moratorium on in-person research activities secondary to COVID-19. Data collection will commence once this moratorium is lifted. Our next step is to conduct a large multi-site clinical trial that will incorporate the lessons learned from this pilot feasibility study to test the efficacy of a VR intervention in inpatient rehabilitation and transition to home environments. When VR is used in patients' rooms, it serves to provide additional therapy and may reduce clinician burden. VR also presents an opportunity similar to home-based practice exercises. VR can be implemented in both clinical settings and people's own homes, where engagement in ongoing self-management approaches is often most challenging. This unique experience offers the potential for seamless transition from inpatient rehabilitation to the home.

"Factors related to depression, distress, and self-reported changes in anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts during the COVID-19 state of emergency in Latvia","Evidence suggests that the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic might have deleterious effects on the population's mental health and psychiatric outcomes. We examined the prevalence of depression, distress, and suicidal thoughts and their association with social and economic factors during the state of emergency in a nationwide representative sample of the general population in Latvia. An online survey was conducted using a randomized stratified sample of the general adult population in July 2020 for 3Ã‚Â weeks. Distress, depression, suicidal thoughts, and self-reported changes in mental health were identified using a structured questionnaire. The statistical analysis included chi-square tests, analyses of variance, and multivariate forward-stepwise linear regressions. The study sample included 2608 respondents. Clinical depression was present in 5.75% and distress in 7.82%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 13.30% of those with a history of clinical depression, and 27.05% of those with a history of suicidal attempts. The variables that were associated with increases in self-reported anxiety, depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, and being currently depressed/distressed included lower general health, increased fears of contracting COVID-19 or having family members contract it and die, history of suicidality, increased family conflicts, decreased religiosity, caring for a vulnerable person. Protective factors included positive changes in family relationships and economic situation, maintaining one's basic routine, and having more people living in the household. Further research and interventions should focus specifically on these factors. The study's findings can help to develop future strategies for management of psychological support for different groups in general population.","Vrublevska, Sibalova, Aleskere, Rezgale, Smirnova, Fountoulakis, Rancans","https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.1919200","20210510","COVID-19; Latvia; depression; distress; mental health; pandemic; suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13598,""

"The Psychological Status of General Population in Hubei Province During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study","<b>Introduction:</b> The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), originating from Wuhan (Hubei, China), has rapidly spread across China and several other countries. During the outbreak of COVID-19, mental health of the general population in Hubei province may be affected. This study aimed to assess the psychological status and associated risk factors of the general population in Hubei province during the COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional online survey was used to evaluate the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, which were assessed by the Chinese version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, respectively. Coping style was assessed by the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to detect factors associated with mental health outcomes. <b>Results:</b> Among 9,225 participants, 44.5% rated symptoms of PTSD, and 17.9 and 12.7% suffered from moderate and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Individuals who were geographically located in Wuhan and familiar with someone who has COVID-19 had more severe symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, as well as a higher score in passive coping style (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that people who were geographically located in Wuhan [odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-1.36, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001] were associated with severe symptoms of PTSD. Besides, individuals who were familiar with someone who had COVID-19 (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 2.07-2.63, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.66-2.17, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.78-2.39, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and had a higher score in passive coping style (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.14-1.17, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.15-1.19, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.15-1.19, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) were associated with severe symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Moreover, a higher score in active coping style (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.95-0.97, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.93-0.94, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.94-0.96, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) was associated with a lower risk of symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. <b>Conclusions:</b> During the midphase of COVID-19 outbreak, quite a few people have mental health problems; nearly half of the respondents rated symptoms of PTSD, and approximately one-fifth reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression.

"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Among Pakistani Adults in Lahore","<b>Background:</b> In the wake of the worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus and the resultant restrictive measures, mental health has become a crucial issue. Physical health is not the only aspect of humans that is at risk. Globally, the rates and severity of mental illness are being significantly impacted by this pandemic. Two scales have been validated to measure the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the levels of anxiety and obsessional thinking in clinical and non-clinical populations. The present study was designed to investigate the levels of anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19 in the general public of Lahore, Pakistan. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Data were collected <i>via</i> snowball sampling from May 9 to May 19. An online survey consisting of a demographic profile and two scales, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS), was sent through email, WhatsApp, and Facebook groups to adults (18 years and above) of Lahore, Pakistan. <b>Results:</b> A total of 240 individuals (20% men and 80% women) recorded their responses. The majority belonged to a nuclear family system (60%), and their education level ranged from high school to Ph.D. The cut-off score for probable dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety and obsession levels was not met within this sample (CAS, <i>M</i> = 3.24, <i>SD</i> = 4.21; OCS, <i>M</i> = 4.14, <i>SD</i> = 3.15), suggesting that the general population of Lahore, Pakistan is not suffering from dysfunctional anxiety or obsessions related to COVID-19. Forty-seven participants' score on OCS and 35 participants' scores on CAS were above the cut-off, i.e., Ã¢â€°Â¥7 and Ã¢â€°Â¥9, respectively. The results of the correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship (<sup>**</sup><i>p</i> &lt; 0.619) between anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19. <b>Conclusion:</b> One important, yet surprising, conclusion of this study is that the average adult in Lahore does not show much anxiety or obsessions related to COVID-19. Other studies around the world using these measurement tools have indicated significantly high levels of both anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19. These findings may demonstrate the resilience of Pakistanis or perhaps the lack of understanding of the seriousness of the situation.","Majeed, Schwaiger, Nazim, Samuel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.578366","20210510","COVID-19; Pakistan; corona virus anxiety; obsessions related to COVID 19; psychological impacts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13601,""
"Nearly Fatal Hydroxychloroquine Overdose Successfully Treated with Midazolam, Propofol, Sodium Bicarbonate, Norepinephrine, and Intravenous Lipid Emulsion","In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, there has been renewed interest in the drug hydroxychloroquine. However, clinicians should be aware of the dangers of hydroxychloroquine intoxication, an insufficiently studied condition. <i>Case Report</i>. We present a case of autointoxication with 20Ã¢â‚¬â€°g hydroxychloroquine in a 35-year-old woman. Cardiac monitoring showed ventricular arrhythmias for which high-dose midazolam and propofol were initiated, resulting in a brief normalization of the cardiac rhythm. Because of the reoccurrence of these arrhythmias, intravenous lipid emulsion was administered with fast cardiac stabilization. Treatment with continuous norepinephrine, potassium chloride/phosphate, and sodium bicarbonate was initiated. On day 6, she was extubated and after 11 days, she was discharged from the hospital without complications. Since high-quality scientific evidence is lacking, treatment options are based on experience in chloroquine toxicity. Activated charcoal is advised if the patient presents early. Sedation with diazepam, early ventilation, and continuous epinephrine infusion are considered effective in treating severe intoxication. Caution is advised when substituting potassium. Despite the lack of formal evidence, sodium bicarbonate appears to be useful and safe in case of QRS widening. Intravenous lipid emulsion, with or without hemodialysis, remains controversial but appears to be safe. As a last resort, extracorporeal life support might be considered in case of persisting hemodynamic instability.","Onsia, Bots","https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8876256","20210510","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13602,""
"Age-related effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents","<b>Background</b>: Children and adolescents are affected in various ways by the lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in this age-group. <b>Objective</b>: The objective was to investigate and compare the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in three age groups (1-6Ã‚Â years, 7-10Ã‚Â years, 11-19Ã‚Â years) and to examine the associations with psychological factors. <b>Methods</b>: An anonymous online survey was conducted from 9 April to 11 May 2020 during the acute phase of major lockdown measures. In this cross-sectional study, children and adolescents aged between 1 and 19Ã‚Â years were recruited as a population-based sample. They were eligible if they were residents in Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein or Switzerland, were parents/caregivers of a child aged between 1 and 10Ã‚Â years or adolescents Ã¢â€°Â¥11Ã‚Â years, had sufficient German language skills and provided informed consent. <b>Results</b>: Among 5823 participants, between 2.2% and 9.9% reported emotional and behavioural problems above the clinical cut-off and between 15.3% and 43.0% reported an increase in these problems during the pandemic. Significant age-related effects were found regarding the type and frequency of problems (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup><sub>(4)</sub>Ã¢â€°Â¥50.2, <i>P</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 0.001). While preschoolers (1-6Ã‚Â years) had the largest increase in oppositional-defiant behaviours, adolescents reported the largest increase in emotional problems. Adolescents experienced a significantly larger decrease in emotional and behavioural problems than both preschoolers and school-children. Sociodemographic variables, exposure to and appraisal of COVID-19, psychotherapy before COVID-19 and parental mental health significantly predicted change in problem-scores (FÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 3.69, <i>P</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 0.001). <b>Conclusion</b>: A substantial proportion of children and adolescents experience age-related mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. These problems should be monitored, and support should be offered to risk-groups to improve communication, emotion regulation and appraisal style. <b>Antecedentes</b>: Los niÃƒÂ±os y adolescentes se ven afectados de diversas maneras por las medidas de confinamiento debidas a la pandemia de COVID-19. Por lo tanto, es crucial comprender mejor los efectos de la pandemia de COVID-19 en la salud mental de este grupo de edad.<b>Objetivo</b>: El objetivo fue investigar y comparar los efectos de la pandemia COVID-19 en la salud mental en tres grupos de edad (1-6 aÃƒÂ±os, 7-10 aÃƒÂ±os, 11-19 aÃƒÂ±os) y examinar las asociaciones con factores psicolÃƒÂ³gicos.<b>MÃƒÂ©todos</b>: Se realizÃƒÂ³ una encuesta anÃƒÂ³nima en lÃƒÂ­nea del 9 de abril al 11 de mayo de 2020 durante la fase aguda de las principales medidas de confinamiento. Como una muestra basada en la poblaciÃƒÂ³n, en este estudio transversal, se reclutaron niÃƒÂ±os y adolescentes de entre 1 y 19 aÃƒÂ±os.

Se encontraron efectos significativos relacionados con la edad en cuanto al tipo y la frecuencia de los problemas (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup><sub>(4)</sub>Ã¢â€°Â¥50.2, <i>P</i>Ã¢â€°Â¤0.001). Mientras que los preescolares (1-6 aÃƒÂ±os) tuvieron el mayor aumento en las conductas oposicionistas-desafiantes, los adolescentes reportaron el mayor aumento en los problemas emocionales. Los adolescentes experimentaron una disminuciÃƒÂ³n significativamente mayor de los problemas emocionales y de conducta que los preescolares y los escolares. Las variables sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficas, la exposiciÃƒÂ³n y percepciÃƒÂ³n del COVID-19, la psicoterapia antes del COVID-19 y la salud mental de los padres predijeron significativamente el cambio en las puntuaciones de los problemas (FÃ¢â€°Â¥3,69, <i>P</i>Ã¢â€°Â¤0,001).<b>ConclusiÃƒÂ³n</b>: Una proporciÃƒÂ³n sustancial de niÃƒÂ±os y adolescentes experimentan problemas de salud mental relacionados con la edad durante la pandemia de COVID-19.

"The prevalence of exposure to potentially morally injurious events among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic","<b>Background</b>: Given the profound psychological distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare workers are at high risk of being exposed to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs). <b>Objective</b>: We aimed to explore the prevalence and associated factors with PMIEs in a sample of Romanian physicians, of which almost half worked in Covid-19 treatment medical units. <b>Method</b>: We ran a web-based survey in April 2020, three weeks after the general lockdown to contain the novel coronavirus. Participants (<i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 114, aged 23 to 67, <i>M</i> =Ã‚Â 38.85, <i>SDÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â 9.82, 74.6% females) answered the PMIE scale items, in addition to questions related to the physical and emotional self-impact related questions, and demographical and work-related variables (i.e. age, gender, medical experience, and speciality). <b>Results</b>: Results suggested that almost 50% of the participants reported high levels of PMIE exposure. No significant associations were found between PMIE exposure, and the type of medical unit physicians worked in (Covid-19 or non-Covid-19), nor their specialization and medical experience. Demographic variables (i.e. age and gender) and experience did not predict PMIE exposure. However, we found significant associations between PMIE and the physicians' physical and emotional self-reported impact. <b>Conclusions</b>: Healthcare systems, governments, and societies worldwide need to recognize that physicians are prone to PMIE exposure and related adverse psychological outcomes due to their daily activity in containing the pandemic. Public policies need to actively offer and promote psychological support, to protect and help physicians from the adverse mental health outcomes following the pandemic. <b>Antecedentes</b>: Dado el profundo malestar psÃƒÂ­quico causado por la pandemia de la COVID-19, el personal de salud tiene un alto riesgo de estar expuesto a eventos potencialmente causantes de daÃƒÂ±o moral (EPDMs).<b>Objetivo</b>: Nuestro objetivo fue explorar la prevalencia y los factores asociados a EPDMs en una muestra de mÃƒÂ©dicos rumanos, de los cuales casi la mitad trabajaba en unidades mÃƒÂ©dicas de tratamiento de la COVID-19.<b>MÃƒÂ©todos</b>: Realizamos un cuestionario en lÃƒÂ­nea en abril del 2020, tres semanas despuÃƒÂ©s del confinamiento general para contener al nuevo coronavirus. Los participantes (<i>N</i> =114, de 23 a 67 aÃƒÂ±os, <i>M</i> =38.85, <i>SD</i> =9.82, 74.6% mujeres) respondieron a los elementos del cuestionario para EPDMs, ademÃƒÂ¡s de preguntas relacionadas con la autoevaluaciÃƒÂ³n del impacto fÃƒÂ­sico y emocional, asÃƒÂ­ como variables demogrÃƒÂ¡ficas y relacionadas con el trabajo (por ejemplo, la edad, el gÃƒÂ©nero, la experiencia mÃƒÂ©dica y la especialidad).<b>Resultados</b>: Los resultados sugirieron que casi el 50% de los participantes reportaron niveles altos de exposiciÃƒÂ³n a EPDMs. No se encontraron asociaciones significativas entre la exposiciÃƒÂ³n a los EPDMs y el tipo de unidad mÃƒÂ©dica en la que trabajaban los mÃƒÂ©dicos (COVID-19 o no COVID-19), ni con la especialidad o la experiencia mÃƒÂ©dica. Las variables demogrÃƒÂ¡ficas (como la edad y el gÃƒÂ©nero) y la experiencia no predijeron la exposiciÃƒÂ³n a EPDMs. Sin embargo, encontramos asociaciones significativas entre los EPDMs y la autoevaluaciÃƒÂ³n del impacto fÃƒÂ­sico y emocional de los mÃƒÂ©dicos.<b>Conclusiones</b>: Los sistemas de salud, los gobiernos y las sociedades en todo el mundo deben reconocer que los mÃƒÂ©dicos, debido a su actividad diaria para contener la pandemia, son propensos a estar expuestos a EPDMs y a las consecuencias psicolÃƒÂ³gicas adversas con las que estos se relacionan. Las polÃƒÂ­ticas pÃƒÂºblicas necesitan ofrecer y promover activamente soporte psicolÃƒÂ³gico a los mÃƒÂ©dicos para protegerlos de y ayudarlos con las consecuencias adversas para la salud mental que devienen de la pandemia. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯</b>: Ã©â€°Â´Ã¤ÂºÅ½Covid-19Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Â¼â€¢Ã¨ÂµÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã¦â€°Â°, Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦Å“â€°Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã©ÂÂ­Ã©Ââ€¡Ã¦Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã©Ââ€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥Â®Â³Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶ (PMIE) Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>: Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ§Â½â€”Ã©Â©Â¬Ã¥Â°Â¼Ã¤ÂºÅ¡Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Â Â·Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¤Â¸Â­PMIEÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥Å’Â»Ã§â€Å¸Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¨Â¿â€˜Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Å“Â¨Covid-19Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥Ââ€¢Ã¤Â½ÂÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>: Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ©ÂÂÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã¦â€“Â½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â€°Ã¥â€˜Â¨Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â°ÂÃ©â€ÂÃ¥ÂÅ½, Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¤ÂºÅ½2020Ã¥Â¹Â´4Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã§Â½â€˜Ã§Â»Å“Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦ (<i>N</i> = 114, Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€žÃ¥Å“Â¨23Ã¨â€¡Â³67Ã¥Â²ÂÃ¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´, <i>M</i>= 38.85, SD = 9.82, Ã¥Â¥Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥ÂÂ 74.6Ã¯Â¼â€¦) Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã§Â­â€Ã¤Âºâ€ PMIEÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ÂÂ¡Ã§â€ºÂ®, Ã¨Â¿ËœÃ¦Å“â€°Ã¨ÂºÂ«Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂ, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥ÂÂ£Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¥ÂËœÃ©â€¡Â (Ã¥ÂÂ³Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€ž, Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Ë†Â«, Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Â»ÂÃ©ÂªÅ’Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>: Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½, Ã¥â€¡Â Ã¤Â¹Å½50Ã¯Â¼â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã©Â«ËœÃ¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã§Å¡â€žPMIEÃ¦Å¡Â´Ã©Å“Â²Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â²Â¡Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å½Â°PMIEÃ¦Å¡Â´Ã©Å“Â²Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦â€°â‚¬Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¥Ââ€¢Ã¤Â½ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â±Â»Ã¥Å¾â€¹ (Covid-19Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã©ÂÅ¾Covid-19), Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¨Â¯â€ Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Â»ÂÃ©ÂªÅ’Ã¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã¨â€˜â€”Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¨Ââ€Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥ÂÂ£Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¥ÂËœÃ©â€¡Â (Ã¥ÂÂ³Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã©Â¾â€žÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Ë†Â«) Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§Â»ÂÃ©ÂªÅ’Ã¦â€”Â Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹PMIEÃ¦Å¡Â´Ã©Å“Â²Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â½â€ Ã¦ËœÂ¯, Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å½Â°PMIEÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€Å¸Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¦Ë†â€˜Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨ÂºÂ«Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¤Â¹â€¹Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã¨â€˜â€”Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¨Ââ€Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>: Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¤Â¸â€“Ã§â€¢Å’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã§Â³Â»Ã§Â»Å¸, Ã¦â€Â¿Ã¥ÂºÅ“Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã©Æ’Â½Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¨Â®Â¤Ã¨Â¯â€ Ã¥Ë†Â°, Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€Å¸Ã§â€Â±Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã©ÂÂÃ¥Ë†Â¶Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â´Â»Ã¥Å Â¨, Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã¥Â®Â¹Ã¦Ëœâ€œÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã§â€Å¸PMIEÃ¦Å¡Â´Ã©Å“Â²Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¨â€°Â¯Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¦Å¾Å“Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥â€¦Â¬Ã¥â€¦Â±Ã¦â€Â¿Ã§Â­â€“Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ§Â§Â¯Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦ÂÂÃ¤Â¾â€ºÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¿Æ’Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’Â, Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¦Å Â¤Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¸Â®Ã¥Å Â©Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€Å¸Ã©Â¢â€žÃ©ËœÂ²Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¨â€°Â¯Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Maftei, Holman","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1898791","20210510","Covid-19 pandemic; Healthcare; depression; morally injurious events; psycho-traumatology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13604,""
"Mental Disorders Associated with COVID-19 Related Unemployment","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions on economic activities have resulted in a sharp rise of unemployment. The purpose of this research is to explore mental disorders associated with COVID-19 related unemployment using a large, nationally representative dataset, the 2020 COVID-19 Household Pulse Survey. ANOVA with post hoc tests (Tukey HSD) are utilized to reveal the mean difference of mental disorders between various employment status, as well as between reasons of unemployment. Binary logit model is used to investigate the potential effect of different reasons of unemployment on mental disorders. Individuals who were not working during the pandemic due to involuntary reasons had higher probabilities of mental disorders than those who were working and those who voluntarily separated from work. Among respondents who were not working due to COVID-19 related reasons, respondents whose employer went out of business were the most likely to experience mental disorders. Household job uncertainty in the next four weeks positively contributed to mental disorders. Government should consider measures to contain the spread of virous while keeping as many people employed as possible.

Convalescent plasma can be a therapeutic option for these patients. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of convalescent plasma is crucial to optimize such therapeutic approach. Here, we describe a COVID-19 patient who was deeply immunosuppressed following rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) and concomitant chemotherapy for chronic lymphoid leukemia. His long-term severe T and B cell lymphopenia allowed to evaluate the treatment effects of convalescent plasma. Therapeutic outcome was monitored at the clinical, biological and radiological level. Moreover, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (IgM, IgG and IgA) and neutralizing activity were assessed over time before and after plasma transfusions, alongside to SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification and virus isolation from the upper respiratory tract. Already after the first cycle of plasma transfusion, the patient experienced rapidÃ‚Â improvement of pneumonia, inflammation and blood cell counts, which may be related to theÃ‚Â immunomodulatory properties of plasma.Ã‚Â Subsequently, the cumulative increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies due to the three additional plasma transfusions was associated with progressive and finally complete viral clearance, resulting in full clinical recovery. In this case-report, administration of convalescent plasma revealed a stepwise effect with an initial and rapid anti-inflammatory activity followed by the progressive SARS-CoV-2 clearance. These data have potential implications for a more extended use of convalescent plasma and future monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients.","Zimmerli, Monti, Fenwick, Eckerle, Beigelman-Aubry, Pellaton, Jaton, Dumas, Stamm, Infanti, Andreu-Ullrich, Germann, Mean, Vollenweider, Stadelmann, Prella, Comte, Guery, Gachoud, Rufer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.613502","20210510","B-cell depletion; chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection; convalescent plasma therapy; neutralizing antibodies; severe immunosuppression; viral clearance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13606,""
"Immunological Interfaces: The COVID-19 Pandemic and Depression","Since the start of the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an international effort has sought to better characterize associated extra-pulmonary health sequelae. The acute and or chronic detrimental impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mental health, especially depression, is increasingly described. Simultaneously the pandemic has influenced depressive symptomatology by modifying economic, social and political structures, in addition to affecting daily routines. In both cases, associated immunological perturbations favoring a pro-inflammatory state could underlie an increased risk for depressive symptomatology. A resultant elevation in global depressive burden could further tax mental health care infrastructure and contribute to a range of worse health outcomes including diminished quality of life. This suggests a critical and time-sensitive need to better understand immune interfaces between depression and COVID-19.","Perlmutter","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.657004","20210510","COVID-19; SARS- CoV-2; cytokine storm; cytokines; depression; immunity; microglia; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13607,""
"Effects of Self-Compassion Training on Work-Related Well-Being: A Systematic Review","Self-compassion, sharing some commonalities with positive psychology 2.0 approaches, is associated with better mental health outcomes in diverse populations, including workers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is heightened awareness of the importance of self-care for fostering mental health at work. However, evidence regarding the applications of self-compassion interventions in work-related contexts has not been systematically reviewed to date. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize and evaluate the utility of self-compassion interventions targeting work-related well-being, as well as assess the methodological quality of relevant studies. Eligible articles were identified from research databases including ProQuest, PsycINFO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. The quality of non-randomized trials and randomized controlled trials was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Quality Assessment Table, respectively. The literature search yielded 3,387 titles from which ten studies met the inclusion criteria. All ten studies reported promising effects of self-compassion training for work-related well-being. The methodological quality of these studies was medium. All ten studies recruited workers in a caring field and were mostly conducted in Western countries. The Self-Compassion Scale or its short-form was used in almost all instances. Findings indicate that self-compassion training can improve self-compassion and other work-related well-being outcomes in working populations. However, in general, there is need for greater methodological quality in work-related self-compassion intervention studies to advance understanding regarding the applications and limitations of this technique in work contexts. Furthermore, future studies should focus on a broader range of employee groups, including non-caring professions as well as individuals working in non-Western countries.","Kotera, Van Gordon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.630798","20210510","caring professions; self-care; self-compassion; systematic review; work mental health; work-related well-being; workers; workplace mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13608,""
"Coronavirus Awareness and Mental Health: Clinical Symptoms and Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help","The current study analyzed the relationship between Coronavirus (COVID-19) Awareness, mental health, and willingness to seek professional psychological help. This was made through a quantitative approach, using online questionnaires to collect data from 855 subjects. The questionnaires included the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-53) to measure mental health indicators, the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale-Short Form, and the Coronavirus Awareness Scale-10 (CAS-10). An Exploratory Factor Analysis suggests that three factors underlie the CAS-10: Coronavirus Concern, Exaggerated Perception, and Immunity Perception. Results indicate a significant positive correlation between Coronavirus Concern and both general anxiety and phobic anxiety symptoms. Immunity Perception is positively related to paranoid ideation and psychotic symptoms. A Mediation Analysis determined that Coronavirus Concern has a significant positive direct effect on Openness to Seeking Psychological Treatment (OSPT), while Exaggerated Perception and Immunity Perception scores have significant direct negative effects on the Value and Need in Seeking Treatment (VNST) scores. Indirectly, the relationship between Coronavirus Concern and OPST is significantly mediated by anxiety symptoms. Similar results were found for the VNST subscale. There is a negative significant effect of Immunity Perception over OSPT mediated by Paranoid Ideation. However, the overall model only achieved small <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> coefficients for the OSPT (0.060) and VNST (0.095) scores. Comparisons in Coronavirus Awareness between sex, age, and the presence of children and older adults at home were also made.

"Factors Associated With Post-traumatic Growth Among Healthcare Workers Who Experienced the Outbreak of MERS Virus in South Korea: A Mixed-Method Study","<b>Background:</b> Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 and MERS pose a major threat to healthcare workers' (HCWs) physical and mental health. Studies exploring the positive changes gained from adapting to traumatic events, known as post-traumatic growth (PTG), have attracted much attention. However, it is unclear which factors or experiences lead to PTG among HCWs. The purpose of this mixed-method study was to investigate factors associated with PTG among HCWs who experienced the MERS outbreak in South Korea, and fully describe their experience of developing PTG. <b>Methods:</b> Quantitative data from 78 participants were collected using psychometric tools for Psychological distress, Resilience, and Support for coping, and Post-traumatic growth. Qualitative interviews were conducted with seven nurses. Data were analyzed using the qualitative content analysis method according to the sub-themes of resilience, which was the main factor associated with PTG. <b>Results:</b> We found resilience to have a significant impact on PTG (ÃƒÅ¸ =0.486, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Thus the qualitative interviews were analyzed using the core concepts of resilience. Qualitative interviews with nurses illustrated how participants experienced the development of resilience in terms of its sub-factors: hardiness, persistence, optimism, and support. <b>Conclusion:</b> HCWs who endured the MERS outbreak showed high levels of PTG, and the analysis of the interview data provided a fuller understanding on the experience of remaining resilient and developing PTG. These results provide practical and pragmatic information helpful for developing intervention strategies and protocols that can help HCWs transform adversity into growth and development.","Hyun, Kim, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.541510","20210510","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; healthcare workers; mixed methods; post-traumatic growth; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13610,""
"Influence of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Disease Activity and Quality of Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients","<b>Objective:</b> The present preliminary cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the extent to which health-related quality of life of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was influenced by the outbreak of Covid-19 while controlling for disease activity. <b>Methods:</b> Two samples of 195 (recruited before Covid-19 outbreak) and 707 patients (recruited during the Covid-19-related lockdown) were included. Psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), quality of life (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, IBDQ), and somatization (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-12) were concurrently assessed. <b>Results:</b> Patients with active IBD were more prevalently affected by ulcerative colitis (60.2%, ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup> = 0.12) and, expectedly, showed higher psychological distress (HADS, d = 0.34) and somatization (PHQ-12, d = 0.39), as well as poorer disease-specific health-related quality of life (effect sizes for the total and subscale IBDQ scores in the large range of d &gt; 0.50). Hierarchical regression models revealed that setting (pre-Covid-19 outbreak <i>vs</i>. during lockdown) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) explained only a small portion (8%) of the IBDQ variance. IBD-related factors (ulcerative colitis and disease activity) and psychological factors (psychological distress and somatization) added a significant amount of 25 and 27%, respectively, to the explained IBDQ variance. The final model predicted 59% of the explained IBDQ variance. <b>Conclusion:</b> Clinical and psychological manifestations seem to be major impairments in IBD patients both before and during the Covid-19 outbreak. Furthermore, the quality of life of IBD patients seem to be more influenced by psychological and somatizing distressing symptoms than the pandemic-related living conditions.","Conti, Rosa, Zito, Grossi, Efthymakis, Neri, Porcelli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.664088","20210510","COVID-19; disease activity; health-related quality of life; inflammatory bowel disease; outbreak; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13611,""
"Media Exposure Related to the PTSS During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Risk Perception","<b>Objectives:</b> The objectives of this study are to assess the relationship between media exposure and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and to highlight the underlying mechanisms mediated by risk perception. <b>Methods:</b> This survey was conducted online in China from February 1st to February 10th, 2020. A total of 2,858 Chinese citizens aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional study. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess media exposure, PTSS, and risk perception. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of respondents with heightened PTSS scores was 22.2%. After controlling for covariates, media exposure (more than five times a day) was significantly and positively associated with a high level of PTSS (<i>B</i> = 4.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and risk perception (worry and severity) significantly mediated the relationship between media exposure and PTSS (all 95% CIs did not include 0). <b>Conclusions:</b> Based on these findings, the frequency of media exposure was associated with PTSS. Risk perception (worry and severity) mediated the relationship between media exposure and PTSS. The mental health, particularly PTSS, of the general population should be closely monitored and &quot;infodemics&quot; should be combatted while addressing the COVID-19 outbreak; cognitive interventions may be promising.","Wang, Jiang, Ma, Chen, Liu, Ahmed, Shahid, Wang, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.654548","20210510","COVID-19; PTSS; media exposure; public health; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13612,""
"Mental Burden of Hospital Workers During the COVID-19 Crisis: A Quanti-Qualitative Analysis","<b>Context:</b> This study is a quanti-qualitative analysis of all contacts to a helpline service for hospital workers during the COVID-19 crisis. Our aim was to describe the nature of mental burden in hospital workers and factors subjectively associated to this burden from the workers' perspective. <b>Methods:</b> We included all 50 contacts from 25 different workers and 10 different professions over the course of 1 month. We described the corpus and reported the computerized qualitative analysis of summary of contacts. We performed a descendant hierarchical analysis and analyzed specificities of classes of age with a correspondence factor analysis. <b>Results:</b> The corpus was composed of three classes: (1) distress specific to the COVID-19 situation, (2) help provided, and (3) pre-existing psychological vulnerability. Factors subjectively responsible for mental distress were: (a) the contamination risk, (b) confinement, and (c) the rapidly evolving situation and changing instructions. Lack of &quot;COVID-free time&quot; seemed to increase negative emotions. Reassignment to a high viral density unit was a stressor, especially in older workers. Young workers mentioned pre-existing vulnerability more than others. Fear of death was shared by all classes of age, regardless of the objective risk of contamination. <b>Discussion:</b> Hospital workers experience mental distress factors both in common with the general population and specific to the hospital environment. Preserving and organizing support for the mental health of all hospital workers is a critical challenge, including those with poorly recognized professions. Leads for institutions to avoid additional stressors for hospital workers are presented. Young workers with pre-existing vulnerability seem particularly impacted.","Luquiens, Morales, Bonneville, Potier, Perney, Faure, Canaguier","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.622098","20210510","COVIDÃ¢Ë†â€™19; QualitativeÃ¢â‚¬â€œquantitative analysis; hospital workers; mental burden; volonteers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13613,""
"Is Watching TV Series an Adaptive Coping Strategy During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Insights From an Italian Community Sample","Social distancing and lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted individuals' daily habits and well-being. Within such a context, digital technology may provide a welcome source of alternative forms of connection and entertainment. Indeed, streaming services showed a remarkable increase in membership subscriptions throughout the period considered. However, excessive involvement in watching TV series has recently become a subject of scholarly concern as it may represent an emerging form of addictive behavior with the features of what has been labeled as &quot;binge-watching&quot; (i.e., watching multiple episodes of TV series in a single session). The current study aimed to assess TV series watching behaviors and related motivations, as well as their relationships with depression, stress and anxiety, in a sample of Italian adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. Specifically, we aimed to explore which patterns of motivations and emotional states influenced either a high but healthy engagement in watching TV series, or promoted problematic and uncontrolled watching behavior under such circumstances. A total of 715 adults (<i>M</i> = 31.70, <i>SD</i> = 10.81; 71.5% female) from all over Italy were recruited (from 1st to 30th April 2020) through advertisements <i>via</i> social media platforms of Italian university communities and other online groups. Two multiple hierarchical regression analyses were performed with non-problematic and problematic TV series watching set as dependent variables. Results showed that people spent more time watching TV series during the pandemic lockdown, especially women who also reported higher levels of anxiety and stress than men. Moreover, both non-problematic (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.56; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and problematic (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.33; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) TV series watching behaviors were equally induced by anxiety symptoms and escapism motivation, thereby suggesting that watching TV series during the COVID-19 lockdown probably served as a recovery strategy to face such a stressful situation. Finally, our findings also suggest that enrichment motives may protect from uncontrolled and potentially addictive watching behaviors. These findings, therefore, hold important implications, particularly for avoiding the over-pathologization of excessive involvement in online activities emerging as a result of specific distressing situations.","Boursier, Musetti, Gioia, Flayelle, Billieux, Schimmenti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.599859","20210510","COVID-19; anxiety; binge-watching; coping strategies; watching TV series motives","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13614,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Psychiatric Emergency and Inpatient Services in the First Month of the Pandemic in a Large Urban Mental Health Hospital in Ontario, Canada","The World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (WHO). Within a couple of days, all Canadian provinces announced the implementation of social distancing measures. We evaluated the immediate effect of COVID-19 on psychiatric emergency and inpatient services in Canada's largest psychiatric hospital in the first month of the pandemic. We extracted data from the electronic medical records of the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada. We compared emergency department visits, inpatient occupancy rates, and length of stay in March 2019 and March 2020, and during the first and second half of March 2020. There was a decrease in the number of emergency department visits and inpatient occupancy rates in March 2020 compared to March 2019. There was also a significant decrease in the number of emergency department visits and inpatient occupancy rates in the second half of March 2020 compared to the first half. Our findings suggest that the pandemic was followed by a rapid decrease in the usage of psychiatric emergency and inpatient services in a large mental health hospital.

"Mental Health During the First Weeks of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","<b>Background:</b> By March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 crisis as a worldwide pandemic and many local governments instituted stay-at-home orders and closed non-essential businesses. Within the United States, tens of millions of workers lost their jobs and financial security during the first few weeks of the national response, in an attempt to slow the global pandemic. Because of the enormity of the pandemic and its potential impact on mental health, the objective of the present study was to document the prevalence of mental health problems and their association with pandemic-related job loss during the third week of the nationwide shutdown. <b>Methods:</b> Mental health was assessed via online questionnaires among a representative sample of 1,013 U.S. adults on April 9-10, 2020. Rates of clinically significant mental health outcomes were compared between participants who lost their job as a result of COVID-19 restrictions (17.4%) vs. those who did not (82.6%). Bivariate multiple logistic regression identified factors that were predictive of, and protective against, mental health problems. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of clinically significant symptoms was significantly higher than prior population estimates, ranging from 27 to 32% for depression, 30 to 46% for anxiety disorders, 15 to 18% for acute/post-traumatic stress, 25% for insomnia, and 18% for suicidal ideation. Prevalence estimates were 1.5-1.7 times higher for those who reported job loss due to COVID-19 restrictions than those who did not. Mental health problems were predicted by worry over financial instability, insomnia, social isolation, and alcohol consumption, while getting outside more often, perceived social support, and older age were protective against these problems. <b>Conclusions:</b> During the first 3 weeks of lockdowns/stay-at-home restrictions, mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress reactions were notably elevated relative to prior population estimates. Job loss related to the nationwide shutdown was particularly associated with poorer mental health.

"Being the Family Caregiver of a Patient With Dementia During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Lockdown","<b>Background:</b> Family caregivers of patients with dementia are at high risk of stress and burden, and quarantine due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have increased the risk of psychological disturbances in this population. The current study was carried out during the national lockdown declared in March 2020 by the Italian government as a containment measure of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and is the first nationwide survey on the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health of dementia informal caregivers. <b>Methods:</b> Eighty-seven dementia centers evenly distributed on the Italian territory enrolled 4,710 caregiver-patient pairs. Caregivers underwent a telephone interview assessing classical symptoms of caregiver stress and concern for the consequences of COVID-19 infection on patient's health. We calculated prevalence of symptoms and regressed them on various potential stress risk factors: caregivers' sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle, patients' clinical features, and lockdown-related elements, like discontinuity in medical care. <b>Results:</b> Approximately 90% of caregivers reported at least one symptom of stress, and nearly 30% reported four or more symptoms. The most prevalent symptoms were concern for consequences of COVID-19 on patient's health (75%) and anxiety (46%). The main risk factors for stress were identified as a conflicting relationship with the patient and discontinuity in assistance, but caregiver's female sex, younger age, lower education, and cohabitation with the patient also had an impact. Availability of help from institutions or private individuals showed a protective effect against sense of abandonment but a detrimental effect on concern about the risk for the patient to contract COVID-19. The only protective factor was mild dementia severity, which was associated with a lower risk of feeling isolated and abandoned; type of dementia, on the other hand, did not affect stress risk. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results demonstrate the large prevalence of stress in family caregivers of patients with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and have identified both caregivers and situations at a higher risk of stress, which should be taken into account in the planning of interventions in support of quarantined families and patients.","Zucca, Isella, Lorenzo, Marra, Cagnin, Cupidi, Bonanni, LaganÃƒÂ , Rubino, Vanacore, Agosta, Caffarra, Sambati, Quaranta, Guglielmi, Appollonio, Logroscino, Filippi, Tedeschi, Ferrarese, Rainero, Bruni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653533","20210510","COVID-19; burden; caregiver; dementia; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13617,""
"HSSAGA: Designation and scheduling of nurses for taking care of COVID-19 patients using novel method of Hybrid Salp Swarm Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm","The COVID-19 pandemic is viewed as the most basic worldwide disaster that humankind has observed since the second World War. There is no report of any clinically endorsed antiviral medications or antibodies that are successful against COVID-19. It has quickly spread everywhere, presenting tremendous well-being, financial, ecological, and social difficulties to the whole human populace. The COVID flare-up is seriously disturbing the worldwide economy. Practically all the countries are battling to hinder the transmission of the malady by testing and treating patients, isolating speculated people through contact following, confining huge social affairs, keeping up total or incomplete lockdown, etc. Proper scheduling of nursing workers and optimal designation of nurses may significantly affect the quality of clinical facilities. It is delivered by eliminating unbalanced workloads or undue stress, which could lead to decreased nurse performance and potential human errors., Nurses are frequently asked to leave while caring for all sick patients. However, regular scheduling formulas are not thought to consider this possibility because they are out of scheduling control in typical scenarios. In this paper, a novel model of the Hybrid Salp Swarm Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (HSSAGA) is proposed to solve nurses' scheduling and designation. The findings of the suggested test function algorithm demonstrate that this algorithm has outperformed state-of-the-art approaches.","Abadi, Rahmati, Sharifi, Ahmadi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107449","20210510","COVID-19; Designation; Genetic algorithm; Nurse; Salp swarm; Scheduling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13618,""
"The effects of app-based mindfulness practice on the well-being of university students and staff","Mental health problems like anxiety, depression, and stress have been increasing in many countries and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated their toll. Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to provide evidence-based treatments for anxiety and depression, and accumulating evidence is emerging in support of using mindfulness apps yielding small-to-moderate treatment effects. The study was a 4-week randomized controlled trial with 561 university students and staff as participants, divided into a treatment group (mindfulness app) and an active control group (psychoeducational online content). Depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated as primary study outcomes. Saliva cortisol samples were also collected from a subgroup of the treatment arm (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29). Using the mindfulness app for four weeks resulted in small reductions in stress (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.16), and depression (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.16). Attrition was 28.0%. Subjects who practiced more did not experience additional improvement in wellbeing. Mindfulness apps offer modest but clear benefits to users in terms of improved mental health. They present a promising supplement to traditional mental health services.","Lahtinen, Aaltonen, Kaakinen, Franklin, HyÃƒÂ¶nÃƒÂ¤","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01762-z","20210510","Anxiety; Depression; Mindfulness; Mindfulness-app; Students; University staff","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13619,""
"Hesitancy to Return to the Pre-pandemic Routine","The goal of the present study was to explore COVID-19 related hesitancy, which represents the inability of people to return to previous levels of functioning after a major medical crisis like the current pandemic. A new questionnaire was developed to evaluate participants' hesitancy. The study was conducted online in November, 2020, using convenience sampling. A total of 538 individuals from the general Greek population participated in the study and completed the Hesitancy Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2), the Short Health Anxiety Inventory and a COVID-19-related worry question. The Hesitancy Questionnaire proved to have adequate psychometric properties. Correlation with anxiety as assessed by GAD-2 proved to be significant but low, indicating that the two scales are measuring two different concepts.

"Changes in Sexual Functions and Alexithymia Levels of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study was conducted to determine the changes in sexual functioning and alexithymia levels in patients with type 2 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with 162 patients with type 2 diabetes. Data were collected using the Information Form, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. For 83.3% of the participants, there was a decrease in sexual functioning after diabetes, 69.8% after the COVID-19 pandemic, and 67.2% due to both conditions. The majority of the patients stated the reasons for experiencing sexual problems related to not seeing sexuality as a priority (77.1%), and stress/anxiety experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic (67.9%). Moreover, patients' alexithymia, anxiety, and depression levels were found to be high during the pandemic, when the study was conducted. A positive correlation was identified between alexithymia and anxiety and depression. Further, multiple regression results indicated that about 50% of alexithymia levels could be explained by anxiety and depression levels. The anxiety, depression, and alexithymia scores of those who had decreased sexual functioning before and during the pandemic period were statistically significantly higher than those who did not have any change (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). During the COVID-19 pandemic when the study was conducted, high levels of alexithymia, anxiety, and depression were observed in participants, and it was found that their sexual functioning was negatively affected. Healthcare professionals should evaluate their patients in extraordinary situations such as epidemics and pandemics in terms of sexual functioning as well as other vital functions.","Dincer, YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±rÃ„Â±m Ayaz, OÃ„Å¸uz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11195-021-09693-0","20210510","Alexithymia; Anxiety; COVID-19; Changes in sexual functioning; Depression; Turkey; Type 2 diabetes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13621,""
"Telemental Health Use and Refugee Mental Health Providers Following COVID-19 Pandemic","The outbreak of COVID-19 has increased stress, fear, and anxiety for many people. At the same time, social isolation restrictions have disrupted most in-person mental health services. Many mental health providers are adapting to the crisis by utilizing telemental health. However, the literature is scant about how to most effectively utilize telemental health practices with refugee clients, many of whom do not speak English and require an interpreter, may have limited technological proficiency or access, and/or have additional case management needs and coordination as part of their treatment plan. The purpose of this study is to understand how mental health clinicians and case workers at a refugee-serving mental health clinic are successfully shifting their face-to-face practice to telemental health, the obstacles they encounter, and what resources they have found to be helpful. Two main themes emerged from the data: (1) refugee mental health providers display initiative and flexibility in their adaptation to telemental health and (2) providers reported numerous obstacles to effective telemental health, including client barriers, tech barriers, communication issues, and the challenge of reading nonverbal cues virtually. By better understanding telemental health when working with refugees, clinical social workers will be more effective in meeting the needs of a population with significant mental health needs and limited mental healthcare access.","Disney, Mowbray, Evans","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10615-021-00808-w","20210510","COVID-19; Mental health practitioners; Qualitative; Refugee; Telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13622,""

"The barriers, benefits and training needs of clinicians delivering psychological therapy via video","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health services have had to offer psychological therapy via video with little time to prepare or mitigate potential problems. Identifying the barriers, benefits and training needs highlighted by clinicians may support the effective delivery of care. Changes in the mode therapy sessions were delivered in during 2020 were assessed in two high-volume psychological therapies services. Sixty-six therapists completed a survey about their experiences of delivering therapy via video. The lockdown in March 2020 precipitated a dramatic shift from face-to-face to telephone and video-delivered sessions. Most clinicians (89%) found video-based sessions acceptable. Barriers to effective delivery included technological issues, problems with online platforms, and feeling more tired after sessions. Benefits included generalised learning from behavioural work, improvements in efficiency and in the therapeutic relationship, particularly in comparison with telephone-based sessions. Tutorials and support guides were recommended to maximise use of sessions via video. Video-delivered therapy was liked by clinicians and preferred to telephone-based sessions. Issues with platforms, internet connections and access for patients need addressing, local troubleshooting guides, video-based tutorials and greater support for low-intensity therapists to maximise uptake of video sessions where appropriate, may be beneficial.","Buckman, Saunders, Leibowitz, Minton","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1352465821000187","20210510","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; cognitive behavioural therapy; depression; psychological therapies; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13625,""
"Sleep quality mediates the effect of chronotype on resilience in the time of COVID-19","This study aimed to explore the relationship between chronotype and resilience, sleep quality, and post-traumatic stress reactions during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. An online survey was distributed through social networks during forced home confinement, collecting data from1298 participants of 19 different Italian regions. Chronotype was evaluated using the reduced version of the Morningness/Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ); sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); resilience levels were measured by the 10-item version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10); post-traumatic stress reactions were assessed by the 6-item version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES6). Resilience and sleep quality were significantly lower in the evening compared to non-evening types, as well as in females as compared to males. Moreover, resilience was negatively correlated with post-traumatic stress reactions and positively correlated with sleep quality. A negative correlation was also reported between sleep quality and post-traumatic stress reactions. Sleep quality was identified as a possible mediator between chronotype and resilience, and between resilience and post-traumatic stress reactions, after controlling for age and sex. These findings provide new insights into the role of chronotype in adapting to continuous stressful situations. Sleep quality seems to mediate the causal path between the antecedents of resilience and the development of trauma. Further research is needed to explore the suitability of primary interventions based on chronobiology and sleep hygiene to mitigate the impact of pandemic-related home confinement measures on mental health among the general population.","Bazzani, Bruno, Frumento, Cruz-Sanabria, Turchetti, Faraguna","https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2021.1895199","20210510","COVID-19; chronotype; resilience; sleep problems; trauma reaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13626,""

"Anxiety and depressive symptoms of women in the perinatal period during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","The prevalence of perinatal anxiety and depressive symptoms have been speculated to increase during an infectious disease outbreak but remains unknown in the context of the COVID-19 situation. Therefore, this review aimed to examine the prevalence of antenatal and postnatal anxiety and depressive symptoms among pregnant women and postpartum mothers during the COVID-19 period. Six electronic databases were systematically searched for articles from November 2019 to December 2020. Twenty-six observational studies and brief reports were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the prevalence of anxiety was greater than depression in both antenatal and postnatal periods, and the prevalence of depression was higher in the antenatal period than the postnatal period. The pooled prevalence for antenatal anxiety symptoms, antenatal depressive symptoms and postnatal depressive symptoms were 40% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.27-0.52), 27% (95% CI: 0.20-0.33) and 17% (95% CI: 0.10-0.24), respectively. Europe (56%, 95% CI: 0.28-0.85) had significantly higher prevalence of antenatal anxiety than Asia (16%, 95% CI: 0.09-0.23).

"The rise of illicit fentanyls, stimulants and the fourth wave of the opioid overdose crisis","This review provides an update on recently published literature on the rise of illicit fentanyls, risks for overdose, combinations with other substances, e.g. stimulants, consequences, and treatment. Overdose due to illicit synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl and fentanyl analogs) continues to rise in the US both preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fentanyl-related overdose is rising in new geographic areas e.g. the western USA. Stimulant-related overdose is also increasing nationwide driven by methamphetamine and cocaine. Polysubstance use, e.g. the use of a stimulant along with an opioid is driving stimulant-related overdose. Other medical consequences of injection drug use are rising including HIV and hepatitis C infections. Medication approaches to treating opioid use disorder remain the standard of care and there are new promising pharmacological approaches to treating methamphetamine use disorder. A 'fourth wave' of high mortality involving methamphetamine and cocaine use has been gathering force in the USA. Availability and use of illicit fentanyls are still the major drivers of overdose deaths and the current rise in stimulant-related deaths appears entwined with the ongoing opioid epidemic.","Ciccarone","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000717","20210509","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13629,""
"Coping strategies and mental health trajectories during the first 21 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom","The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is well evidenced. However, there is little research on how individuals' coping strategies were related to changes in mental health over time. The current study used data from the COVID-19 Social Study in the United Kingdom (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 26,505) to explore whether coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-focused, avoidant, and socially-supportive) were associated with (i) better mental health as lockdown was introduced, and (ii) faster recovery over time. People with greater use of problem-focused, avoidant, and supportive coping displayed more mental health symptoms, while greater use of emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer mental health symptoms. Symptoms decreased over time for all coping strategies, but only socially-supportive coping was associated with a faster decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating a potential protective effect of social support on psychological distress. Problem-, avoidant- and emotion-focused coping strategies were not associated with faster improvements in mental health. Suggesting the adoption of one of these coping styles in itself is not necessarily a driver of improvements in mental health; rather, specific attributes of the behaviours expressed as part of this coping style appear to be important in and of themselves.","Fluharty, Bu, Steptoe, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113958","20210509","Anxiety; Coping; Covid-19; Depression; Longitudinal; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13630,""
"Deterioration of mental health and insufficient Covid-19 information among disadvantaged immigrants in the greater Paris area","The aim of this study is to provide information on changes in mental health among disadvantaged immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa in the Greater Paris area and their level of information about Covid-19. Prior to the Covid-19 epidemic, the Makasi community-based cohort followed 850 immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa in the Greater Paris area. Between the 1st of April and the 7th of June 2020, all participants scheduled for a follow-up survey were systematically included into an additional COVID-19-related wave of data collection (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 100). We compared participants' type of housing, level of food insecurity, work and mental health (PHQ9) before and during the first COVID-19-related lockdown, using paired-Mc Nemar chi-2 tests. We next described their level of information on Covid-19 and policy measures, broken down by sex. Among the 100 participants, 68% had no legal residence permit. Food insecurity was more often reported during lockdown than before (62% vs 52%). 9% of participants had a score indicative of severe depression (PHQ9) before lockdown and 17% afterwards (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.17). Only 51% knew about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of the COVID-19 virus. This study brings original information on a hard-to-reach population group.

"Mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: a latent class trajectory analysis using longitudinal UK data","The mental health of the UK population declined at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Convenience sample surveys indicate that recovery began soon after. Using a probability sample, we tracked mental health during the pandemic to characterise mental health trajectories and identify predictors of deterioration. This study was a secondary analysis of five waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (a large, national, probability-based survey that has been collecting data continuously since January, 2009) from late April to early October, 2020 and pre-pandemic data taken from 2018-19. Mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We used latent class mixed models to identify discrete mental health trajectories and fixed-effects regression to identify predictors of change in mental health. Mental health was assessed in 19Ã¢â‚¬â€°763 adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥16 years; 11Ã¢â‚¬â€°477 [58Ã‚Â·1%] women and 8287 [41Ã‚Â·9%] men; 3453 [17Ã‚Â·5%] participants from minority ethnic groups). Mean population mental health deteriorated with the onset of the pandemic and did not begin improving until July, 2020. Latent class analysis identified five distinct mental health trajectories up to October 2020. Most individuals in the population had either consistently good (7437 [39Ã‚Â·3%] participants) or consistently very good (7623 [37Ã‚Â·5%] participants) mental health across the first 6 months of the pandemic. A recovering group (1727 [12Ã‚Â·0%] participants) showed worsened mental health during the initial shock of the pandemic and then returned to around pre-pandemic levels of mental health by October, 2020. The two remaining groups were characterised by poor mental health throughout the observation period; for one group, (523 [4Ã‚Â·1%] participants) there was an initial worsening in mental health that was sustained with highly elevated scores. The other group (1011 [7Ã‚Â·0%] participants) had little initial acute deterioration in their mental health, but reported a steady and sustained decline in mental health over time. These last two groups were more likely to have pre-existing mental or physical ill-health, to live in deprived neighbourhoods, and be of Asian, Black or mixed ethnicity. Infection with SARS-CoV-2, local lockdown, and financial difficulties all predicted a subsequent deterioration in mental health. Between April and October 2020, the mental health of most UK adults remained resilient or returned to pre-pandemic levels. Around one in nine individuals had deteriorating or consistently poor mental health. People living in areas affected by lockdown, struggling financially, with pre-existing conditions, or infection with SARS-CoV-2 might benefit most from early intervention.

We did a cross-sectional online survey from March 2 to 2 April 2020 and a total of 19,379 healthcare workers from 25 provinces participated. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), respectively. The age-standardized prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD was 15.5%, 12.7% and 5.2%, respectively. Frontline workers had higher prevalence estimates than non-frontline workers (depression: 18.2% vs. 13.9%; anxiety: 14.7% vs. 11.6%; PTSD: 6.1% vs. 4.6%). Subgroups who were nurses, were married or had dependent children reported higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD. Despite of the large variations, the prevalence of mental disorders was lowest in East China, followed by Middle China, and highest in West China. Healthcare workers faced enormous stress not only from the direct risk presented by the COVID-19 outbreak, but also from the profound changes in their professional practice. Prevalence of adverse psychological outcomes has a significant association with geographically distribution of health resources and regional economic level.

"How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms?","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused substantial public health burden and widespread anxiety. The adverse mental health effects caused by COVID-19 may be particularly acute for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). For the present study, we developed an online survey to investigate how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions to assess multiple facets of how the pandemic has affected individuals with OCD symptoms. Responses were collected from adults with self-identified OCD recruited from OCD-specific forums and websites (n = 252). The majority (76.2 %) of respondents reported that their OCD symptoms had worsened since the outbreak, though there was substantial variability in individual responses. Negative effects of COVID-19 were more strongly linked to contamination and responsibility for harm symptoms than for other symptom dimensions. The self-identified OCD group also reported heightened concerns about COVID-19 compared to a community control sample recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Lastly, many participants reported that the pandemic had interfered with their OCD treatment, yet they remained mostly satisfied with how their treatment providers had handled the crisis. These results highlight the importance of considering how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community, with possible implications for treatment providers.","Wheaton, Ward, Silber, McIngvale, BjÃƒÂ¶rgvinsson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102410","20210509","Anxiety; COVID-19; OCD; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Pandemic; Treatment barriers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13636,""
"Securing a sustainable and fit-for-purpose UK health and care workforce","Approximately 13% of the total UK workforce is employed in the health and care sector. Despite substantial workforce planning efforts, the effectiveness of this planning has been criticised. Education, training, and workforce plans have typically considered each health-care profession in isolation and have not adequately responded to changing health and care needs. The results are persistent vacancies, poor morale, and low retention. Areas of particular concern highlighted in this Health Policy paper include primary care, mental health, nursing, clinical and non-clinical support, and social care. Responses to workforce shortfalls have included a high reliance on foreign and temporary staff, small-scale changes in skill mix, and enhanced recruitment drives. Impending challenges for the UK health and care workforce include growing multimorbidity, an increasing shortfall in the supply of unpaid carers, and the relative decline of the attractiveness of the National Health Service (NHS) as an employer internationally. We argue that to secure a sustainable and fit-for-purpose health and care workforce, integrated workforce approaches need to be developed alongside reforms to education and training that reflect changes in roles and skill mix, as well as the trend towards multidisciplinary working. Enhancing career development opportunities, promoting staff wellbeing, and tackling discrimination in the NHS are all needed to improve recruitment, retention, and morale of staff. An urgent priority is to offer sufficient aftercare and support to staff who have been exposed to high-risk situations and traumatic experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to growing calls to recognise and reward health and care staff, growth in pay must at least keep pace with projected rises in average earnings, which in turn will require linking future NHS funding allocations to rises in pay. Through illustrative projections, we show that, to sustain annual growth in the workforce at approximately 2Ã‚Â·4%, increases in NHS expenditure of 4% annually in real terms will be required. Above all, a radical long-term strategic vision is needed to ensure that the future NHS workforce is fit for purpose.","Anderson, O'Neill, Macleod Clark, Street, Woods, Johnston-Webber, Charlesworth, Whyte, Foster, Majeed, Pitchforth, Mossialos, Asaria, McGuire","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00231-2","20210509","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13637,""
"Stuck in a lockdown: dreams, bad dreams, nightmares, and their relationship to stress, depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: An upsurge in dream and nightmare frequency has been noted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and research shows increases in levels of stress, depression and anxiety during this time. Growing evidence suggests that dream content has a bi-directional relationship with psychopathology, and that dreams react to new, personally significant and emotional experiences. The first lockdown experience was an acute event, characterized by a combination of several unprecedented factors (new pandemic, threat of the disease, global uncertainty, , experience of social isolation, exposure to stressful information) that resulted in a large-scale disruption of life routines. This study aimed at investigating changes in dream, bad dream and nightmare recall; most prevalent dream themes, and the relationship between dreams, bad dreams, nightmares and symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety during the first COVID-19 lockdown (April-May 2020) through a national online survey. Methods: 968 participants completed an online survey. Dream themes were measured using the Typical Dreams Questionnaire; stress levels were measured by the Cohenâ€™s Perceived Stress Scale; symptoms of anxiety were assessed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale; and symptoms of depression were assessed using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Results: 34% (328) of participants reported increased dream recall during the lockdown. The most common dream themes were centered around the topics of 1) inefficacy (e.g., trying again and again, arriving late), 2) human threat (e.g., being chased, attacked); 3) death; and 4) pandemic imagery (e.g., being separated from loved ones, being sick). Dream, bad dream and nightmare frequency was highest in individuals with moderate to severe stress levels. Frequency of bad dreams nightmares and dreams about the pandemic, inefficacy and death were associated with higher levels of stress, as well as with greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Results support theories of dream formation, environmental susceptibility and stress reactivity. Dream content during the lockdown broadly reflected existential concerns and was associated with increased symptoms of mental health indices.","Elizaveta Solomonova et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46133-ADD-585","20210511","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; nightmares; covid-19; depression; dreams; stress; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-11","",13638,""
