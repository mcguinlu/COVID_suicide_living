"Association between increased caregiver burden and severe psychological distress for informal caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: A cross-sectional study","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, informal caregivers' mental health deteriorated more than that of non-caregivers. We examined the association between increased caregiver burden during the pandemic and severe psychological distress (SPD). We used cross-sectional data from a nationwide internet survey conducted between August and September 2020 in Japan. Of 25,482 participants aged 15-79 years, 1,920 informal caregivers were included. SPD was defined as Kessler 6 Scale (K6) score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 13. Self-rated change in caregiver burden was measured retrospectively with a single question item. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between SPD and increased caregiver burden during the pandemic, adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, health, and caregiving variables. To examine the differential association between increased caregiver burden and SPD, interaction terms were added and binary logistic regression was separately conducted for all variables. Participants' mean age was 52.3 years (standard deviation 15.9), 48.8% of participants were male, 56.7% reported increased caregiver burden, and 19.3% exhibited SPD. Increased caregiver burden was significantly associated with SPD (adjusted odds ratio: 1.90; 95% confidence interval: 1.37-2.66). The association between increased caregiver burden and SPD was stronger among caregivers who were married, those undergoing disease treatment, and those with a care-receiver with a care need level of 1-2. The results revealed that more than half of caregivers reported increased caregiver burden, and increased caregiver burden was associated with SPD during the pandemic. Measures supporting mental health for caregivers with increased caregiver burden should be implemented immediately.","Nakamoto, Murayama, Takase, Muto, Saito, Tabuchi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2022.104756","20220702","COVID-19; Caregiver burden; Informal caregiver; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-03","",33695,""
"Hair cortisol as a risk marker for increased depressive symptoms among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Determining pre-existing biological risk markers of incident depression and other mental health sequelae after exposure to a new stressor would help identify vulnerable individuals and mechanistic pathways. This study investigated primarily whether hair cortisol predicted elevated depressive symptoms in middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, 6 years later. A secondary aim was to deduce whether any association differed by sex. We studied 1025 adults aged 50 and older (75% female) as part of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Hair cortisol samples were collected at 2014 (Wave 3) and depressive symptoms were assessed using the 8-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale in 2014 (Wave 3), 2016 (Wave 4), 2018 (Wave 5) and again in 2020 as part of TILDA's COVID-19 Study. Hierarchical mixed effects logistic regression models were applied to investigate the association between cortisol levels and clinically significant depressive symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a full covariate adjusted model there was a significant interaction between cortisol and wave on depressive symptoms (Ãâ€¡2Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.5, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .03). Cortisol was positively and significantly associated with elevated depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 Study (OR =1.3, 95% CI 1.11, 1.56, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .003), and was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting clinically significant depressive symptoms during first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, when compared with before, OR =Ã‚Â 1.4, 95% CI 1.05, 1.9, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .015. There was no evidence of effect modification by sex. Higher hair cortisol, assessed 6 years previously, predicted clinically significant depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older adults during (but not before) the pandemic. Findings suggest a biological phenotype which denotes increased susceptibility to the negative impact of environmental stress on psychological health.","Feeney, Kenny","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2022.105847","20220702","COVID-19; Cortisol; Depression; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-03","",33696,""
"Impact of Technology Driven Mental Health Task-shifting for Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs): Results from a Randomised Controlled Trial of Two Methods of Training","Mental health task shifting is a potential way to address the burgeoning treatment gap for mental illness. Easily available and accessible digital technology can be utilised to continuously engage grassroot level health workers (for example, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). However, the impact of such a strategy is not yet systematically evaluated. In this randomised controlled trial, longitudinal hybrid training of ASHAs [1Ã‚Â day in-person classroom training and seven online sessions (ECHO model), aimed to screen and refer to commonly prevalent mental health issues in communities] was compared with traditional one-day in-person classroom training. ASHAs (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°75) from six Primary Health Centres in Ramanagara district, Karnataka, India were randomized into study (SG-ASHAs) and control (CG-ASHAs) groups. After excluding drop-outs, 26 ASHAs in each group were included in the final analysis of the scores on their Knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) in mental health. Two house-to-house surveys were conducted by both groups to identify and refer possible cases. The number of screen positives (potential persons with mental illnesses) and the KAP scores formed the outcome measures. Online sessions for SG-ASHAs were completed over 18Ã‚Â months, the COVID-19 pandemic being the main disruptor. SG-ASHAs identified significantly higher number of persons with potential alcohol use disorders [nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°873 (83%); pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001] and common mental disorders [nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°96(4%); pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.018], while CG-ASHAs identified significantly higher number of those with potential severe mental disorders [nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°61(61.61%); pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001]. As regards KAP, after controlling for baseline scores, the time effect in RMANOVA favoured SG-ASHAs. Mean total KAP score increased from 16.76 to18.57 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0Ã‚Â·01) in SG-ASHAs and from 18.65 to 18.84 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.76) in CG-ASHAs. However, the Time-group interaction effect did not favour either (FÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.105; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.748). Compared to traditional training, mentoring ASHAs for extended periods is more impactful. Easily accessible digital technology makes the latter feasible. Scaling up such initiatives carry the potential to considerably improve treatment access for those in need.","Nirisha, Malathesh, Kulal, Harshithaa, Ibrahim, Suhas, Manjunatha, Kumar, Parthasarathy, Manjappa, Thirthalli, Chand, Arora, Math","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-022-00996-w","20220702","ASHAs; Hybrid training; India; Task shifting in mental health; Telementoring","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-03","",33697,""
"Heterogeneity in Mental Health Change During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: The Role of Social Factors","The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a prolonged global crisis, but its effects on mental health seem inconsistent. This inconsistency highlights the importance of considering the differential impact of the pandemic on individuals. There is some evidence that mental health trajectories are heterogeneous and that both sociodemographic and personal characteristics are associated with higher risk for mental health issues. By contrast, information on the role of social factors as potential determinants of initial reactions to the pandemic and on heterogeneous trajectories over time is lacking. We analyzed seven assessments of a large-scale (N = 2,203) longitudinal study across 1.5 years, beginning in March 2020. Using self-report data on mental health and life satisfaction, we applied latent change models to examine initial reactions and mean changes across the pandemic. In addition, we applied latent class growth analyses to investigate whether there were distinct groups with different patterns of change. Results showed that on average, levels of life satisfaction and anxiety decreased (d = -0.31 and d = -0.11, respectively), levels of depressive symptoms increased (d = 0.13), and stress levels remained unchanged (d = -0.01) during the first year of the pandemic. For each outcome, we identified four distinct mental health trajectories. Between 5% (for anxiety) and 11% (for life satisfaction) of the sample reported consistently high-and even increasing-impairments in mental health and well-being. The trajectories of a sizeable number of people covaried with the course of the pandemic, such that people experienced better mental health when the number of COVID cases was low and when fewer restrictions were placed on public life. Low emotional support, high instrumental support, and the tendency to compare oneself with others were associated with more mental health issues. Findings show that whereas a substantial portion of people were largely unaffected by the pandemic, some individuals experienced consistently high levels of psychological distress. Social factors appear to play a crucial role in the maintenance of well-being. This article is protected by copyright.

"Impact of COVID-19 emergency on the psychological well-being of susceptible individuals","The current pandemic has exerted an unprecedented psychological impact on the world population, and its effects on mental health are a growing concern. The present study aims to evaluate psychological well-being (PWB) during the COVID-19 crisis in university workers with one or more diseases likely to increase the risk of severe outcomes in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as susceptible. 210 susceptible employees of an Italian University (aged 25-71Ã‚Â years) were recruited during the COVID-19Ã‚Â second wave (October-December 2020). A group comprising 90 healthy university employees (aged 26-69Ã‚Â years) was also recruited. The self-report Psychological General Well Being Index (PGWBI) was used to assess global PWB and the influence on six sub-domains: anxiety, depressed mood, positive well-being, self-control, general health, and vitality. We applied non-linear dimension-reduction techniques and regression methods to 45 variables in order to assess the main demographic, occupational, and general-health-related factors predicting PWB during the COVID-19 crisis. PGWBI score was higher in susceptible than in healthy workers, both as total score (mean 77.8 vs 71.3) and across almost all subscales. Age and jobs involving high social interaction before the pandemic were inversely associated with the PWB total score, general health, and self-control subscores. The current data suggest no decline in PWB during the second wave of COVID-19 health emergency in susceptible individuals of working age. Critically, higher risk for mental-health issues appears to be inversely related to age, particularly among individuals deprived of their previous level of social interaction at work.","Stufano, Lucchese, Stahl, Grattagliano, Dassisti, Lovreglio, FlÃƒÂ¶el, Iavicoli","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15357-6","20220701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-03","",33699,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being of seniors attending online programs at University of the Third Age: a follow-up study","Reports on psychological effects of quarantine during past outbreaks and pandemics showed that quarantined people were more likely to experience psychological problems than those who were not. It was also shown that there was an increase in anxiety, depression, and stress in all age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. So, we investigated emotional states and quality of life as components of general well-being in older participants of University of the Third Age (U3A) attending online programs during the second year of the pandemic, and compared them with the pre-pandemic COVID-19 period. This study was conducted among 27 participants of a U3A program. Data on sociodemographics, Charlson comorbidity index, the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS-SF), The Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS), and Turkish version of World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument Older Adults Module (WHOQOL-OLD) were taken in September 2019 and September 2021. The median age of the participants was 68 (60-75) years (81.5% female). In the COVID-19 pandemic period; 'Death and dying' (except for 'Fear of pain before death' score), 'Intimacy' domain, and 'Social participation' domain scores of WHOQOL-OLD decreased compared to the pre-pandemic period (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.011, and PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, respectively) whereas the scores for GAS and GDS-SF were higher (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001 and PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.011). The reason for the decrease in 'Social participation' domain scores was the decrease in 'Satisfaction with opportunity to participate in community'. There was no significant difference in 'Autonomy' domain of WHOQOL-OLD (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.598). Although there was no change in 'Autonomy' domain among the participants of U3A before and during the pandemic period, anxiety and depression scores were higher in the second year of the COVID pandemic. Only a decrease in satisfaction with opportunity to participate in community might have significant impact on social participation.","Kayhan KoÃƒÂ§ak, Ãƒâ€¡avdar, Savas, AkÃƒÂ§iÃƒÂ§ek","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12866","20220701","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; older; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-03","",33700,""
"COVID-19 pandemic impact on people with diabetes: results from a large representative sample of Italian older adults","Restrictions imposed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission should be weighed against consequences on vulnerable groups' health. Lifestyles and disease management of older people with diabetes might have been differentially impacted compared to non-chronic individuals. A cross-sectional study (LOST in Lombardia) was conducted on a representative full sample of 4 400 older adults (17<sup>th</sup>-30<sup>th</sup> November 2020), collecting data on lifestyles, mental health and access to care before and during the pandemic. We compared 947 (51.9%) people with diabetes and 879 (48.1%) healthy subjects reporting no chronic conditions. People with diabetes reported more frequently increased physical activity (odds ratio, OR 2.65, 95% confidence internals, CI 1.69-4.13), drinks/week reduction (OR 6.27, 95%CI 3.59-10.95), increased consumption of fruit (OR 2.06, 95%CI 1.62-2.63), vegetables (OR 1.41, 95%CI 1.10-1.82), fish (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.74-3.64) and olive oil (OR 3.54, 95%CI 2.30-5.46). People with diabetes increased telephone contacts with general practitioners (OR 3.70, 95%CI 2.83-4.83), hospitalisations (OR 9.01, 95%CI 3.96-20.51), visits and surgeries cancellations (OR 3.37, 95%CI 2.58-4.42) and treatment interruptions (OR 1.95, 95%CI 1.33-2.86).

"Estimation of market efficiency process within time-varying autoregressive models by extended Kalman filtering approach","This paper explores a time-varying version of weak-form market efficiency that is a key component of the so-called Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH). One of the most common methodologies used for modeling and estimating a degree of market efficiency lies in an analysis of the serial autocorrelation in observed return series. Under the AMH, a time-varying market efficiency level is modeled by time-varying autoregressive (AR) process and traditionally estimated by the Kalman filter (KF). Being a linear estimator, the KF is hardly capable to track the hidden nonlinear dynamics that is an essential feature of the models under investigation. The contribution of this paper is threefold. We first provide a brief overview of time-varying AR models and estimation methods utilized for testing a weak-form market efficiency in econometrics literature. Secondly, we propose novel accurate estimation approach for recovering the hidden process of evolving market efficiency level by the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Thirdly, our empirical study concerns an examination of the Standard and Poor's 500 Composite stock index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. Monthly data covers the period from November 1927 to June 2020, which includes the U.S. Great Depression, the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and the first wave of recent COVID-19 recession. The results reveal that the U.S. market was affected during all these periods, but generally remained weak-form efficient since the mid of 1946 as detected by the estimator.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsp.2022.103619","20220801","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-03","",33702,""
