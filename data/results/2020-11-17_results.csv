"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Older Adults Mental Health Services: a mixed methods study","Purpose The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to have a significant impact on older adults mental health care. Our study aimed to explore staff perspectives on key challenges and innovations, to help inform the delivery of older adults mental health care in subsequent waves of the pandemic. Methods A mixed methods online questionnaire developed by NIHR Mental Health Policy Research Unit (MHPRU) was used to gather staff perspectives on their challenges at work, problems faced by service users and their carers, and sources of help and support. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative analysis and descriptive content analysis for qualitative analysis. Results 158 participants, working in either community or inpatient settings, and from a range of professional disciplines, were included. For inpatient staff, a significant challenge was infection control. In the community, staff identified a lack of access to physical and social care as well as reduced contact with friends and families as being challenges for patients. Remote working was seen as a positive innovation along with Covid-19 related guidance from various sources and peer support. Conclusion Our study, with a focus on staff and patient well-being, helps to inform service development for future waves of the pandemic. We discuss measures to improve infection control in inpatient settings, the role of voluntary organisations in supporting socially isolated community patients, the need for better integration of physical and mental health services at an organisational level, and the importance of training staff to support patients and their families with end of life planning.","Rohan Bhome; Jonathan Huntley; Christian Dalton-Locke; Norha Vera San Juan; Sian Oram; Una Foye; Gill Livingston","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.14.20231704","20201116","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7166,""
"Capability impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown in association with mental well-being, social connections and existing vulnerabilities: an Austrian survey study","Background: Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and its public health measures go beyond physical and mental health and incorporate wider well-being impacts in terms of what people are free to do or be. We explored these capability impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown in association with people's mental well-being, social support and existing vulnerabilities in Austria. Methods: Adult Austrian residents (n=560) provided responses to a cross-sectional online survey about their experiences during Covid-19 lockdown (15 March-15 April 2020). Instruments measuring capabilities (OxCAP-MH), depression and anxiety (HADS), social support (MSPSS) and mental well-being (WHO-5) were used in association with six pre-defined vulnerabilities using multivariable linear regression. Results: 31% of the participants reported low mental well-being and only 30% of those with a history of mental health treatment received treatment during lockdown. Past mental health treatment had a significant negative effect across all outcome measures with an associated capability well-being score reduction of -6.54 (95%CI: -9.26,-3.82). Direct Covid-19 experience and being ""at risk"" due to age and/or physical health conditions were also associated with significant capability deprivations. When adjusted for vulnerabilities, significant capability reductions were observed in association with increased levels of depression (-1.79) and anxiety (-1.50), and significantly higher capability levels (+3.77) were associated with higher levels of social support. Compared to the cohort average, individual capability impacts varied between -9% for those reporting past mental health treatment and +5% for those reporting one score higher on the social support scale. Conclusions: Our study is the first to assess the capability limiting aspects of a lockdown in association with specific vulnerabilities. The negative impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown were strongest for people with a history of mental health treatment. In future public health policies, special attention should be also paid to improving social support levels to increase public resilience.","Judit Simon; Timea M Helter; Ross G White; Catharina van der Boor; Agata Laszewska","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.14.20231142","20201116","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7167,""
"Electrocardiographic Abnormalities and Troponin Elevation in COVID-19","Background: the COVID19 pandemic has resulted in worldwide morbidity at unprecedented scale. Troponin elevation is a frequent laboratory finding in hospitalized patients with the disease, and may reflect direct vascular injury or nonspecific supply demand imbalance. In this work, we assessed the correlation between different ranges of Troponin elevation, Electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and mortality. Methods. We retrospectively studied 204 consecutive patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID19. Serial ECG tracings were evaluated in conjunction with laboratory data including Troponin. Mortality was analyzed in respect to the degree of Troponin elevation and the presence of ECG changes including ST elevation, ST depression or T wave inversion. Results. Mortality increased in parallel with increase in Troponin elevation groups and reached 60% when Troponin was >1 ng/ml. In patients with mild Troponin rise (0.05 to 1.00 ng/ml) the presence of ECG abnormality resulted in significantly greater mortality. Conclusion. ECG repolarization abnormalities may represent a marker of clinical severity in patients with mild elevation in Troponin values. This finding can be used to enhance risk stratification in patients hospitalized with COVID19.","Ehud Chorin; Matthew Dai; Edward Kogan; Lalit Wadhwani; Eric Shulman; Charles Nadeau-Routhier; Robert Knotts; Roi Bar-Cohen; Chirag Barbhaiya; Anthony Aizer; Douglas Holmes; Scott Bernstein; Michael Spinelli; David Park; Larry Chinitz; Lior Jankelosn","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.12.20230565","20201116","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7168,""
"No evidence of increase in suicide in Greece during the first wave of Covid-19","Background and Objective: Mental health outcomes have reportedly worsened in several countries during the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. In the present study we examined whether suicides increased in Greece during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods: We used daily suicide estimates from a Suicide Observatory in Greece from 2015-2020 and followed three methodologies: A descriptive approach, an interrupted time series analysis, and a differences-in-differences econometric model. Results: We did not find any empirical evidence of any increase in suicides during the first wave of Covid-19 and the lockdown in any of the three approaches used. Conclusions: Suicides did not seem to increase during the first wave of covid-19 and lockdown in Greece. However, this does not mean that mental health did not deteriorate, or that we will not observe an increase in suicides during the second wave. Protective factors for Greece during the first wave may include working from home (for those able to tele-work), strong family ties, advertising of a suicide hotline and income support for the unemployed.","Sotiris Vandoros; Olga Theodorikakou; Kyriakos Katsadoros; Dimitra Zafeiropoulou; Ichiro Kawachi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.13.20231571","20201116","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7169,""
"Mental Health Status of Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Survey among the Bangladeshi Graduate Students at Dhaka City","ObjectivesTo identify the level of Mental Health Status of Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic among the Bangladeshi Graduate Student at Dhaka

MethodA cross-sectional survey was conducted with 330 students from different public and Private Universities in Dhaka, Bangladesh between April 01, 2020 and July 31, 2020 amid the COVID-19 lockdown period in Bangladesh. A standard, self-administered online questionnaire consisting of questions on socio-demographic variables, mental health status, as well as stress management sent to the respondents through social networking platforms. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, one-way ANOVA and correlation tests.

ResultsThe mean score of mental health status was 2.08 based on four points scale. They felt problem in decision making (3.04), in doing the things well (2.92), in enjoying normal day to day life (2.88), in playing a useful part in life (2.85), in doing their task (2.75), living in perfectly well and in good health (2.70). The respondents also developed a suicidal tendency (2.55), felt nervous in strung-up (2.24), took longer time to do things (2.14), felt tightness and pressure in head (2.12), and found themselves pressurized by various stuff (2.05). This study also found a significant positive relationship between mental health status and age, living with parents, and parents attitude. Finally, this study revealed that the respondents managed their stress by chatting with their friends, parents and siblings, and by sleeping.

ConclusionMental health status of adolescents was found moderate in this study. This study suggests further large-scale study including different socio-economic settings in order to figure out the real scenario of adolescents mental health status of the country during the pandemic.","Taha Husain; Saber  Ahmed Chowdhury; Mohammad  Main Uddin; Nazmul  Ahsan Kalimullah; 4","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.12.379487","20201112","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7170,""

"Young Peopleâ€™s Digital Interactions from a Narrative Identity Perspective: Implications for Mental Health and Wellbeing","The current response article began by situating this journal volume in the current COVID-19 pandemic context which has driven young people into digital spaces for far longer periods of time than ever  Many scholars, policy makers, and the public at large are recognizing that these social digital spaces may be the only outlet by which youth and their families can remain safe (at least physically), while also participating in some important social outlets  We discussed the notion of hybrid reality and argued that young people themselves often do not experience their digital and physical contexts as functionally distinct, despite there being good scientific reasons for examining these contexts separately  We then considered whether or not digital activity (at least some) should be considered pathological or inherently unhealthy for young people  Like most of the commentators, we advocated for a nuanced approach and emphasized the importance of a functional, developmental lens  In the second half of our response, we turned to the narrative identity framework itself and clarified misconceptions about what we considered novel about our approach  We found it particularly useful to explain why self-determination theory can be regarded as a constituent of the identity development framework, but that it does not subsume it  We moved on to discuss how the new insights provided by the commentators could be synthesized and suggested directions for new research studies and methodologies  Finally, we ended with an examination of how a more elaborated narrative identity framework offers specific directions for designing new digital interventions for promoting young peopleâ€™s mental health and wellbeing  It is our hope that the target article with its detailed articulation of the narrative identity framework, together with the thoughtful commentaries and this response, can together inform future research, practice, and policy relevant to digital activity and its impact on young peopleâ€™s mental health and wellbeing  Â© 2020 The Author(s)  Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC","Granic, I.; Morita, H.; Scholten, H.","https://doi.org/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1820225","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Psychological Inquiry;31(3):258-270, 2020.; Publication details: Psychological Inquiry;31(3):258-270, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7172,""
"""At home, with care"": Lessons from New York City Home-based Primary Care practices managing COVID-19","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 required rapid innovation throughout the health care system. Home-based primary care (HBPC) practices faced unique challenges maintaining services for medically complex older populations for whom they needed to adapt a traditionally hands-on, model of care to accommodate restrictions on in-person contact. Our aim was to determine strategies used by New York City-area HBPC practices to provide patient care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with the goal of informing planning and preparation for home-based practices nationwide. DESIGN: Cross-sectional qualitative design using semi-structured interviews and inductive and deductive thematic analysis. SETTING: HBPC practices in the New York City (NYC) metro area during spring 2020. PARTICIPANTS: HBPC leadership including clinical/medical directors, program managers, nurse practitioners/nursing coordinators and social workers/social work coordinators (n=13) at 6 NYC-area practices. RESULTS: Participants described care delivery and operational adaptations similar to those universally adopted across health care settings during COVID-19, such as patient outreach and telehealth. HBPC-specific adaptations included mental health services for patients experiencing depression and isolation, using multiple modalities of patient interactions to balance virtual care with necessary in-person contact, strategies to maintain patient trust, and supporting team connection of staff through daily huddles and emotional support during the surge of deaths among long-standing patients. CONCLUSION: NYC-area HBPC providers adapted care delivery and operations rapidly during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping older, medically complex patients safe in their homes required considerable flexibility, transparency, teamwork and partnerships with outside providers. As the pandemic continues to surge around the US, HBPC providers may apply these lessons and consider resources needed to prepare for future challenges. This article is protected by copyright.

"""It's an emotional roller coaster<U+0085> But sometimes it's fucking awesome"": Meaning and motivation of work for peers in overdose response environments in British Columbia","BACKGROUND: The province of British Columbia (BC), Canada is amid dual public health emergencies in which the overdose epidemic declared in 2016 has been exacerbated by restrictions imposed by the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Experiential workers, commonly known as 'peers' (workers with past or present drug use experience) are at the forefront of overdose response initiatives and are essential in creating safe spaces for people who use drugs (PWUD) in harm reduction. Working in overdose response environments can be stressful, with lasting emotional and mental health effects. There is limited knowledge about the personal meaning that experiential workers derive from their work, which serve as motivators for them to take on these often-stressful roles. METHODS: This project used a community-based qualitative research design. The research was based at two organizations in BC. Eight experiential worker-led focus groups were conducted (nÂ =Â 31) where participants spoke about their roles, positive aspects of their jobs, challenges they face, and support needs in harm reduction work. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using interpretative description to uncover the meaning derived from experiential work. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from focus group data that describe the meanings which serve as motivators for experiential workers to continue working in overdose response environments: (1) A sense of purpose from helping others; (2) Being an inspiration for others, and; (3) A sense of belonging. CONCLUSION: Despite the frequent hardships and loss that accompany overdose response work, experiential workers identified important aspects that give their work meaning. These aspects of their work may help to protect workers from the emotional harms associated with stressful work as well as the stigma of substance use. Recognizing the importance of experiential work and its role in the lives of PWUD can help inform and strengthen organizational supports.","Pauly, Bernadette Bernie; Mamdani, Zahra; Mesley, Lacey; McKenzie, Sophie; Cameron, Fred; Edwards, Denice; Howell, Amy; Knott, Michael; Scott, Tracy; Seguin, Ryan; Greer, Alissa M; Buxton, Jane A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103015","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Drug Policy;88: 103015, 2020 Nov 09.; Publication details: Int J Drug Policy;88: 103015, 2020 Nov 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7174,""
"Mental Health and Psychological Wellbeing in Rheumatoid Arthritis during COVID-19 - Can Physical Activity Help?","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have adopted community containment to manage COVID-19. These measures to reduce human contact, such as social distancing, are deemed necessary to contain the spread of the virus and protect those at increased risk of developing complications following infection with COVID-19. People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are advised to adhere to even more stringent restrictions compared to the general population, and avoid any social contact with people outside their household. This social isolation combined with the anxiety and stress associated with the pandemic, is likely to particularly have an impact on mental health and psychological wellbeing in people with RA. Increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour can improve mental health and psychological wellbeing in RA. However, COVID-19 restrictions make it more difficult for people with RA to be physically active and facilitate a more sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, guidance is necessary for people with RA to adopt a healthy lifestyle within the constraints of COVID-19 restrictions to support their mental health and psychological wellbeing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","van Zanten, Fenton, Brady, Metsios, Duda, Kitas","https://doi.org/10.31138/mjr.31.3.284","20201116","COVID-19; Rheumatoid arthritis; mental health; physical activity; psychological wellbeing; sedentary behaviour","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7175,""

"Anxiety and Depression Among People Under the Nationwide Partial Lockdown in Vietnam","This study aimed to evaluate the psychological effects of the partial lockdown on the people in Vietnam during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire regarding attitudes toward COVID-19 along with psychological parameters, including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was conducted. From a total of 1,382 questionnaires, the respondents reported low prevalence of depression (4.9%), anxiety (7.0%), and stress (3.4%). The mean DASS-21 scores recorded were also markedly lower compared to similar studies conducted in China, Italy, and Iran. Respondents who reported severe PTSD had significantly higher depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Factors that were associated with an increased level of depression, stress, and anxiety were being single, separated, or widowed, a higher education level, a larger family size, loss of jobs and being in contact with potential COVID-19 patients. Contrary to expectations, the level of depression, stress, and anxiety observed has been low. Our findings can aid in future research on the impact of a partial lockdown and guide mental health professionals in Vietnam and other countries in the preparation of better care for populations under such circumstances.","Le, Lai, Sun, Hoang, Vu, Pham, Nguyen, Tran, Latkin, Le, Nguyen, Pham, Ta, Nguyen, Ho, Ho","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.589359","20201116","COVID-19; Vietnam; anxiety; depression; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7177,""
"Public Health and Risk Communication During COVID-19-Enhancing Psychological Needs to Promote Sustainable Behavior Change","<b>Background:</b> The current COVID-19 pandemic requires sustainable behavior change to mitigate the impact of the virus. A phenomenon which has arisen in parallel with this pandemic is an infodemic-an over-abundance of information, of which some is accurate and some is not, making it hard for people to find trustworthy and reliable guidance to make informed decisions. This infodemic has also been found to create distress and increase risks for mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. <b>Aim:</b> To propose practical guidelines for public health and risk communication that will enhance current recommendations and will cut through the infodemic, supporting accessible, reliable, actionable, and inclusive communication. The guidelines aim to support basic human psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness to support well-being and sustainable behavior change. <b>Method:</b> We applied the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and concepts from psychology, philosophy and human computer interaction to better understand human behaviors and motivations and propose practical guidelines for public health communication focusing on well-being and sustainable behavior change. We then systematically searched the literature for research on health communication strategies during COVID-19 to discuss our proposed guidelines in light of the emerging literature. We illustrate the guidelines in a communication case study: wearing face-coverings. <b>Findings:</b> We propose five practical guidelines for public health and risk communication that will cut through the infodemic and support well-being and sustainable behavior change: (1) create an autonomy-supportive health care climate; (2) provide choice; (3) apply a bottom-up approach to communication; (4) create solidarity; (5) be transparent and acknowledge uncertainty. <b>Conclusion:</b> Health communication that starts by fostering well-being and basic human psychological needs has the potential to cut through the infodemic and promote effective and sustainable behavior change during such pandemics. Our guidelines provide a starting point for developing a concrete public health communication strategy.","Porat, Nyrup, Calvo, Paudyal, Ford","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.573397","20201116","COVID-19; behavior change; coronavirus; health communication (MESH); infodemic; public health; risk communication; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7178,""

"The Most Psychological Impacts of Coronavirus Epidemics: A Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","<b>Objective:</b> The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a considerable psychological stressor that has a significant impact on every facet of people's life. Since 2002 that the first Coronavirus epidemic has emerged, many pieces of researches have indicated several psychological problems during this period. In circumstances such as COVID-19, researchers could deploy previous resources to identify the most prevalent psychological effects of Coronavirus diseases. We aim to systematically review and quantitatively assess the psychological problems during Coronavirus epidemics to identify the most prevalent psychological problems. <b>Method:</b> A systematic review of the literature will be conducted on psychological problems during previous and the new Coronavirus epidemics. Electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO/ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar will be systematically searched using predefined search terms to identify relevant articles published from January 1, 2002 to June 20, 2020. Two authors independently identify papers that reported the prevalence rates of the psychological problems during Coronavirus outbreaks. The outcomes will include the most prevalent psychological problems during Coronavirus outbreaks. To ensure we have gathered all the evidence, we will conduct another search on the specific psychological problems revealed in the previous search. Study selection will follow the Cochrane library guideline. Afterward, data synthesis will be performed via the meta-analysis of the prevalence rates using the random effect model. <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings can allow identifying the most prevalent psychological problems since the first Coronavirus epidemic in 2002. This can help health policymakers and clinicians to be informed of the priorities of the psychological problems related to COVID-19.","Pourdehghan, Mostafavi","https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v15i3.3818","20201116","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental Health; Psychological Problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7181,""

"Long-Term Impact of Social Isolation and Molecular Underpinnings","Prolonged periods of social isolation can have detrimental effects on the physiology and behavior of exposed individuals in humans and animal models. This involves complex molecular mechanisms across tissues in the body which remain partly identified. This review discusses the biology of social isolation and describes the acute and lasting effects of prolonged periods of social isolation with a focus on the molecular events leading to behavioral alterations. We highlight the role of epigenetic mechanisms and non-coding RNA in the control of gene expression as a response to social isolation, and the consequences for behavior. Considering the use of strict quarantine during epidemics, like currently with COVID-19, we provide a cautionary tale on the indiscriminate implementation of such form of social isolation and its potential damaging and lasting effects in mental health.","Arzate-MejÃƒÂ­a, Lottenbach, Schindler, Jawaid, Mansuy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.589621","20201116","COVID-19; behavior; epigenetics; long non-coding (lnc) RNAs; microRNA; non-coding RNAs; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7183,""
"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on People With Multiple Sclerosis","<b>Objective:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has radically changed the world in a few weeks. Italy has been one of the first and most affected countries with more than 30,000 deaths up to now. Public health measures as quarantine or national lockdown are necessary to limit the spread of infectious diseases, but it is unsurprising that depriving people of their liberty has negative psychological effects. This is especially the case for people with chronic diseases, including neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS). People with MS (PwMS) have a higher burden of neuropsychiatric comorbidities and are known to undertake maladaptive coping strategies in stress conditions. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on mental health of an Italian cohort of PwMS in comparison with healthy controls (HCs). <b>Methods:</b> A total of 60 PwMS and 50 HCs (chosen among patients' cohabitants) were asked to answer a Web-based survey. This survey inquired about the impact of COVID-19 on patient's quality of life, job, and daily routine. Mood, fatigue, and sleep quality were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), the Generalized Anxiety Disease 7 (GAD-7), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). <b>Results:</b> Overall, patients had higher scores of BDI, FSS, and PSQI, and these differences were statistically significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). When we looked at the subscores of the BDI, we detected a statistically significant difference for the neurovegetative part-that concerns with sleep, appetite, sex, and quality of sleep (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). One out of five patients reported new symptoms or worsening of known symptom, in particular, sensory disturbances, and fatigue. However, no symptoms were severe enough to require hospitalization. When we looked for correlations among variables, we found that there was a significant relationship between unemployment and BDI total score, GAD-7, and PSQI in MS group. The presence of new symptoms or the worsening of symptoms positively related to FSS and to PSQI. <b>Discussion:</b> We identified that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic had a significant impact on the psychological status of patients with MS. Compared with the general population, PwMS presented a higher burden of depressive symptoms, a worse sleep quality and perceived an increase in fatigue level, one of the most disabling symptoms of MS. The COVID-19 epidemic poses a challenge to psychological resilience. More studies are warranted to better understand the long-term consequences of the pandemic on mental health of vulnerable people during the disease outbreaks.","Motolese, Rossi, Albergo, Stelitano, Villanova, Di Lazzaro, Capone","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.580507","20201116","COVID - 19; anxiety; depression; fatigue; multiple sclerosis; sleep quality; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7184,""
"Loss of Olfactory Function-Early Indicator for Covid-19, Other Viral Infections and Neurodegenerative Disorders","The loss of the senses of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) are rather common disorders, affecting up to 20% of the adult population. Yet, this condition has not received the attention it deserves, most probably because per se such a disorder is not life threatening. However, loss of olfactory function significantly reduces the quality of life of the affected patients, leading to dislike in food and insufficient, exaggerated or unbalanced food intake, unintentional exposure to toxins such as household gas, social isolation, depression, and an overall insecurity. Not only is olfactory dysfunction rather prevalent in the healthy population, it is, in many instances, also a correlate or an early indicator of a panoply of diseases. Importantly, olfactory dysfunction is linked to the two most prominent neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Anosmia and hyposmia (reduced sense of smell) affect a majority of patients years before the onset of cognitive or motor symptoms, establishing olfactory dysfunction as early biomarker that can enable earlier diagnosis and preventative treatments. In the current health crisis caused by SARS-CoV2, anosmia and dysgeusia as early-onset symptoms in virus-positive patients may prove to be highly relevant and crucial for pre-symptomatic Covid-19 detection from a public health perspective, preceding by days the more classical respiratory tract symptoms such as cough, tightness of the chest or fever. Thus, the olfactory system seems to be at the frontline of pathologic assault, be it through pathogens or insults that can lead to or at least associate with neurodegeneration. The aim of this review is to assemble current knowledge from different medical fields that all share a common denominator, olfactory/gustatory dysfunction, and to distill overarching etiologies and disease progression mechanisms.","Rebholz, Braun, Ladage, Knoll, Kleber, Hassel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.569333","20201116","COVID-19; SARSÃ¢â‚¬â€œCoV-2; anosmia; hyposmia; normosmia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7185,""

"How Do Nocebo Phenomena Provide a Theoretical Framework for the COVID-19 Pandemic?","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health issue, which leads to psychological and behavioural changes. In particular, among various negative feelings, fear seems to be one of the main emotional reactions that can be as contagious as the virus itself. The actual pandemic is likely to function as an important stressor, especially in terms of chronic anxiety and lack of control over the succession of unforeseeable environmental events. In this direction, the psychological impact of previous quarantine measures showed important negative psychological effects, including post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTTS) with long-lasting effects. The presence of psychological discomfort and disturbances due to negative contextual factors can be studied using the nocebo phenomenon as a possible theoretical explanatory framework. Although in the absence of studies linking nocebo to Covid-19 and data-driven evidence, the context of the actual pandemic may be seen as a fertile ground for amplified discomfort and anxiety. The media provide dramatic and negative descriptions and often present conflicting sources of information, which can lead to physical and mental health problems, diminishing response to treatment. This can be worse when supported by conspiracy theories or misinformation. The aim of this perspective review is to propose a new theoretical framework for the COVID-19 pandemic, which should be supported by future empirical studies. In particular, the negative contextual factors, which can predispose individuals to psychological distress and the onset of the nocebo phenomena will be presented here, in order to suggest possible guidelines to mitigate the devastating effects of COVID-19.","Amanzio, Howick, Bartoli, Cipriani, Kong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.589884","20201116","COVID-19 pandemic; mood changes; negative expectation; nocebo effects in randomised controlled trials; nocebo responses in brain imaging studies; psychosocial context","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7187,""
"Stuck Outside and Inside: An Exploratory Study on the Effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Italian Parents and Children's Internalizing Symptoms","The Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown have profoundly impacted families' daily life, challenging their psychological resilience. Our study aimed to investigate the immediate psychological consequences of the pandemic on Italian parents and children focusing on internalizing and post-traumatic symptoms. We also wanted to explore the impact of possible risk and resilience factors, e.g., lifestyle and behaviors, emotional and cognitive beliefs, on parents and children's reaction to the emergency distress. An online survey was administered during the country's nationwide lockdown to 721 Italian parents of at least one child aged between 6 and 18 years. The respondent completed the survey for himself/herself and his/her child. The survey included socio-demographic items and validated questionnaires on parents' post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression and anxiety levels, and on children's internalizing problems. Parents were asked to fill the questionnaires twice: once referring to the current emergency condition and once recalling how they and their child felt a few months before Covid-19 outbreak. Multiple regression analyses showed that specific demographic characteristics (i.e., sex and age) and psychological factors of children and parents, such as fear of contagion and the opportunity to think about possible secondary positive effects of the pandemic, had a predictive value on the presence of internalizing symptoms of both parents and children. Moreover, parents' behaviors during the lockdown period (i.e., employment status and sport practiced) were significantly related to their own internalizing symptoms; these symptoms, in turn, had a strong and positive predictive value on children's internalizing problems. Besides, analyses of variance showed that internalizing symptoms of parents and children were significantly higher during the Covid-19 pandemic than before it started. In addition to showing a direct effect of the pandemic on the psychological health of parents and children, the present results also give a series of important information on how parents perceive, and therefore influence, their children in this period of emergency. Our findings thus highlight the urgent need to provide parents with adequate support to take care of their own psychological wellbeing and to help their children coping with the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic.","Crescentini, Feruglio, Matiz, Paschetto, Vidal, Cogo, Fabbro","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.586074","20201116","Covid-19; children; internalizing symptoms; parents; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7188,""
"Character Strengths Predict an Increase in Mental Health and Subjective Well-Being Over a One-Month Period During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","This study examines whether character strengths predict resilience (operationalized as stable or higher mental health and subjective well-being despite an adverse event) over a period of approximately 1 month during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Spain. Using a longitudinal design, participants (<i>N</i> = 348 adults) completed online measures of sociodemographic data, information regarding their situation in relation to the COVID-19, character strengths, general mental health, life satisfaction, positive affect and negative affect. All variables were measured at Time 1 and Time 2, except for sociodemographic and most COVID-related information (Time 1 only). Time 1 data collection was conducted between March 21, 2020 and April 2, 2020, i.e., approximately the second week of lockdown in Spain. Time 2 data collection was conducted between April 24, 2020 and May 18, 2020, after the Spanish government announced its intention to progressively release the lockdown. A principal component analysis of character strengths was conducted. Five character strength factors were extracted: <i>fortitude</i>, <i>goodness</i>, <i>intellectual</i>, <i>interpersonal</i>, and <i>restraint</i>. Factor structures at Times 1 and 2 were highly consistent. All character strength factors at Time 1 correlated positively with life satisfaction and positive affect, and negatively with negative affect and mental health at T2 (higher scores in the mental health measure indicate poorer mental health). <i>Fortitude strengths</i> showed the highest correlations. We conducted a series of regression analyses with strength factors at Time 1 as predictors, and mental health, life satisfaction, and positive and negative affect as dependent variables, controlling for their baseline levels. To test the directionality of the relationship between strengths and the dependent variables, all analyses were reversed. All character strength factors predicted an increase in mental health. They also predicted positive affect, with the exception of <i>strengths of restraint</i>. <i>Fortitude</i>, <i>intellectual</i>, and <i>interpersonal strengths</i> predicted an increase in life satisfaction. Finally, <i>fortitude strengths</i>, <i>interpersonal strengths</i>, and <i>strengths of restraint</i>, predicted a decrease in negative affect. None of the reversed analyses yielded significant effects. Limitations, implications, and possible character strengths-based interventions aimed at promoting mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","MartÃƒÂ­nez-MartÃƒÂ­, Theirs, Pascual, Corradi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.584567","20201116","COVID-19; character strengths; longitudinal design; mental health; pandemic; resilience; subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7189,""
"COVID-19 Outbreak Effects on Job Security and Emotional Functioning Amongst Women Living With Breast Cancer","The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively impacted global economies and employment. In the UK, it is predicted that approximately eight million jobs were furloughed as a result of the outbreak and the associated restriction of movement or shielding measures. This study aimed to investigate the impact of changes in employment status on cognitive and emotional health as well as perceptions of work. Furthermore, it examined the relationships between women's job security and anxiety, depression and cognitive function. Women living with breast cancer (<i>N</i> = 234) completed online questionnaires to measure their cognitive function, general emotional well-being, COVID-19 related emotional vulnerability (COVID-EMV), work ability and COVID-19 related perceptions of work. Our results revealed that threat to job security was predictive of depression and cognitive function in the entire sample Such that those with higher levels of perceived job security had lower depression and better cognitive function. Further, women who were furloughed or unable to continue work reported higher job insecurity compared to those who had worked throughout the pandemic. Greater rumination was also associated with worse anxiety and depression as well as poorer cognitive function. Finally, moderation analysis highlighted that women who had better cognitive functioning were less likely to experience anxiety when their job security was high. Given our findings, we suggest that employers provide women with accessible interventions to enhance cognitive and emotional resilience and thus help protect against the detrimental effects of job insecurity created by the COVID-19 outbreak.","Chapman, Swainston, Grunfeld, Derakshan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.582014","20201116","COVID-19; anxiety; breast cancer; cognition; depression; employment; job security","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7190,""
"Comfort Always: The Importance of Providing Psychological Support to Neurology Staff, Patients, and Families During COVID-19","Although the impact of COVID-19 disruption on healthcare staff is increasingly understood, there has been no discussion of how it affects neurological patients and their families. This study sought to understand the impact of COVID-19 on staff, patients and families. The Department of Neuropsychology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery established three new support services for staff, patients and families. Semi-structured interviews elicited concerns and if these were affected by COVID-19. Staff members were asked to complete the General Health Questionnaire-12. Few staff members presented for support, but nearly all indicated significant distress, reflecting increased anxiety and reduced social support. Patients described exacerbated emotional, cognitive and physical concerns, and greater vulnerability to isolation and economic hardship. Families and carers reported increased distress arising from hospital lockdown. COVID-19 disruption affects staff, patients and families. Patients and families described additional challenges, which emphasize the importance of providing psychological support during these extraordinary times.","Foley, Chan, van Harskamp, Cipolotti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.573296","20201116","COVID-19; healthcare workforce; mental health; neuropsychology; patients and caregivers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7191,""

"Ahead of the Curve: Responses From Patients in Treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder to Coronavirus Disease 2019","Alongside concern about the physical health impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, public health officials have also raised concerns about the potential for massive mental health impact. This has led many to wonder, how are individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and especially those with contamination fears, doing in the era of COVID-19? We present data from eight patients in our residential treatment program for OCD who were admitted prior to any COVID-19 restrictions and continued in treatment at the facility during the pandemic. Much like the general population, our patients varied in the ways they were impacted by COVID-19, yet the majority experienced improvements in OCD symptoms despite the context. This is not to downplay the many ways in which our patients were personally affected by COVID-19. Rather our patients' relatively resilient responses mirror our program's treatment model, which emphasizes exposure and response prevention (ERP) within the complementary framework of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). The intention of this article is to challenge the notion that by definition this population will fare worse than the general public or that ERP cannot proceed effectively during this time. In contrast, we underscore that effective OCD treatment can and should continue in the era of COVID-19.","Kuckertz, Van Kirk, Alperovitz, Nota, Falkenstein, Schreck, Krompinger","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.572153","20201116","COVID-19; acceptance and commitment therapy; anxiety; coronavirus; exposure and response prevention; obsessive compulsive disorder; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7193,""
"Psychological Impact of the Civil War and COVID-19 on Libyan Medical Students: A Cross-Sectional Study","We aim to determine the psychological status of medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak and civil war in Libya. A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students from 15 medical schools between April 20 and May 1, 2020. The demographic characteristics, generalized anxiety disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) results were collected. Of the 3,500 students, 2,430 completed the survey. The mean (Ã‚Â± SD) score of anxiety symptoms determined by the GAD-7 was 7.2 (5.1). A total of 268 (11%) students had a GAD-7 score of Ã¢â€°Â¥15, which is indicative of moderate to severe anxiety. A total of 1,568 (64.5%) students showed different degrees of anxiety: mild, 910 (37.5%); moderate, 390 (16%); and severe, 268 (11%). Anxiety was significantly associated with living status and internal displacement (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The mean (+ SD) score of depressive symptoms determined by the PHQ-9 was 9.7 (6.3). A total of 525 (21.6%) students had a PHQ-9 score of Ã¢â€°Â¥15, which is indicative of moderate to severe depression. A total of 1,896 (88%) students were diagnosed with mild (PHQ Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5) depression. Suicidal ideation was present in 552 patients (22.7%).

"Motherhood in the Time of Coronavirus: The Impact of the Pandemic Emergency on Expectant and Postpartum Women's Psychological Well-Being","The birth of a child is a critical and potentially stressful experience for women, entailing several changes both at the individual and interpersonal level. This event can lead to different forms of distress, ranging in intensity and duration. Many studies highlighted medical, psychological, and social variables as risk factors potentially influencing the onset or aggravation of perinatal maternal conditions. The current pandemic emergency and the restrictive measures adopted by local governments to prevent the spread of the coronavirus infection may negatively affect mothers-to-be and new mothers potentially increasing the likelihood of anxiety, depressive or post-traumatic symptoms to develop. Moreover, the forced quarantine combined with the limited access to professional or family support may increase feelings of fatigue and isolation. The present study aims to investigate women's psychological well-being during pregnancy and in the first months after childbirth, integrating the evaluation of some traditionally studied variables with the specificities of the current situation. 575 Italian women have been administered an online self-report questionnaire assessing the presence of anxiety disorders, depressive and post-traumatic symptoms as well as the expectations toward childbirth (for mothers-to-be) or the subjective experience of childbirth (for postpartum women). Findings revealed a higher percentage of women than that reported in the literature scored above the clinical cut-off both during pregnancy and postpartum on a series of measures of psychological well-being, thus demonstrating that this period was perceived as particularly challenging and stressful and had significant impact on the women's well-being. Moreover, some socio-demographic, medical, and pandemic-related variables, especially the lack of presence and support from one's partner during labor and delivery as well as in the first days postpartum was found to predict women's mental health. These findings suggest the need for developing specific interventions targeted at women who cannot benefit from the support of their partners or family.","Molgora, Accordini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567155","20201116","COVID-19; expectant mothers; new mothers; psychological well-being; restrictive measures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7195,""
"Novel Coronavirus Outbreak and Career Development: A Narrative Approach Into the Meaning for Italian University Graduates","In times of economic crisis, the literature shows that young people have always been in the high-risk category. The COVID-19 outbreak and the consequence on the economic level have increased the sense of uncertainty and precariousness experienced by young people. The current scenario has forced young people at the school-to-work transition point to re-think their career plans. Although the difficulties of the school-to-work transition already lead to distress and mental health problems in young people, the slowdown imposed by the coronavirus could add up to these difficulties. The present study aimed to explore the process of career development and career planning in the coronavirus era. Twenty Italian university graduates were involved. A quantitative measure was used to evaluate the affective (positive/negative) experience. A narrative prompt was used to understand the individual dimensions of career planning. Cluster analysis was carried out by an unsupervised ascendant hierarchical method to explore the themes of the narration. Italian young adults have tended to experience negative affects in the recent weeks of quarantine. The themes highlighted in the narratives showed that Italian young adults experience feelings of fear, uncertainty, and anxiety about the post-pandemic future. The results appear as a starting point to re-think possible interventions for this group post-lockdown and post-pandemic.","Parola","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02255","20201116","COVID-19; cluster analysis; mental health; narrative approach; school-to-work transition; unemployment; young adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7196,""
"Negative Affect, Fatalism, and Perceived Institutional Betrayal in Times of the Coronavirus Pandemic: A Cross-Cultural Investigation of Control Beliefs","<b>Background:</b> A growing number of studies report that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in diverse aversive psychological reactions and created a global mental health crisis. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the negative emotional reactions as well as the differences between countries are only beginning to be explored. The present study examined the association of COVID-19-related fear and negative affect in Israel and Switzerland. The mediating roles of three control beliefs were explored, namely, fatalism, locus of control, and perceived institutional betrayal. <b>Method:</b> General population samples of 595 Swiss and 639 Israeli participants were recruited and completed an online self-report survey. Moderated Mediation using multigroup path analysis models for the two samples were conducted and compared using AMOS. <b>Results:</b> The multigroup path model had excellent fit for both samples. The different paths were moderated by country affiliation. Higher levels of COVID-19-related fear were associated with negative affect to an equal extent in both samples. COVID-19-related fear was associated with higher reports of institutional betrayal and a lower locus of control in both samples. Higher COVID-19-related fear was associated with lower fatalism in the Swiss sample only. In both samples, institutional betrayal mediated the association between COVID-19-related fear and negative affect, however, locus of control was a mediator in the Israeli sample only. <b>Conclusion:</b> The current results suggest that the reaction of the government was of crucial importance with regard to the emotional state of the two populations. Interestingly, while in the context of adversity fatalism is generally considered a risk factor for mental health, during the time of the pandemic it seems to have had protective qualities among the Swiss population. Interventions that strengthen the personal locus of control have the potential to mitigate the negative affect in Israel but not in Switzerland. Despite the fact that COVID-19 is a global phenomenon, prevention and intervention strategies should be adjusted to local contexts.","Bachem, Tsur, Levin, Abu-Raiya, Maercker","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.589914","20201116","COVID-19; cross-cultural; fatalism; institutional betrayal; locus of control; negative affect; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7197,""
"The Effect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Patients With COVID-19: A Randomized Controlled Trial","<b>Background:</b> As a public health emergency of international concern, the COVID-19 outbreak has had a tremendous impact on patients' psychological health. However, studies on psychological interventions in patients with COVID-19 are relatively rare. <b>Objectives:</b> This study examined the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in relieving patients' psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic. <b>Methods:</b> Ninety-three eligible participants selected by cluster sampling were randomized to an intervention group (<i>N</i> = 47) and a control group (<i>N</i> = 46). Participants in the control group received routine treatment according to the Chinese Management Guidelines for COVID-19, while participants in the intervention group received routine treatment with additional CBT. The Chinese Version of Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to evaluate depression, anxiety, and stress for all participants at baseline and post-intervention. Two-sided <i>t-</i>test, and proportion tests were used to examine the differences between the intervention and control group for each DASS-21 indicator. Univariate linear regression was used to examine the association between chronic disease status and change in each DASS-21 indicator after intervention. Two-way scatter plots were generated to show the association of the length of hospital stay and the changes of each DASS-21 indicator by intervention and control groups. <b>Results:</b> Significant decreases in means were found for scales of depression, anxiety, stress and total DASS-21 in both intervention (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and control group (<i>p</i> = 0.001), with participants in the intervention group having a bigger reduction in means. After the intervention, more participants in the intervention group had no depression or anxiety symptoms than in the control group, but no statistical differences were found (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Compared with participants with chronic disease, participants with no chronic disease had a significantly larger reduction of total DASS-21 scale (coefficient = -4.74, 95% CI: -9.31; -0.17).The length of hospital stay was significantly associated with a greater increase in anxiety scale in the intervention group (<i>p</i> = 0.005), whilst no significant association was found in the control group (<i>p</i> = 0.29). <b>Conclusions:</b> The patients with COVID-19 experienced high levels of anxiety, depression and stress. Our study result highlights the effectiveness of CBT in improving the psychological health among patients with COVID-19, also suggests that CBT should be focused on patients with chronic disease and those who have longer hospital stays. These results have important implications in clinical practice in improving psychological health in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Trial Registration:</b> ISRCTN68675756.

"Mental Violence: The COVID-19 Nightmare","The year 2020 has generated profound changes in personal and working relations, and in dreams of millions of people worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and content of nightmares during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, evaluating its associations with sociodemographic, occupational, and clinical factors. Cross-sectional exploratory study, including 1,057 participants who responded to an online survey about mental violence and nightmares during the pandemic, between May 25 and June 1, 2020. A descriptive analysis of the results was done to obtain frequency tables. McNemar's non-parametric test was used to compare the frequency of nightmares before and after the pandemic, and logistic regression models, to identify factors most strongly associated with the pandemic nightmares. Participants were from 21 Brazilian states, with a mean age of 38 Ã‚Â± 14 years, and 78% women. Half of them (<i>n</i> = 529) reported at least one nightmare episode during the pandemic, and 32.9% (<i>n</i> = 348) described a pandemic content. There was nearly a 3-fold increase in the occurrence of nightmares &quot;once a week or more&quot; during the pandemic, 9% before vs. 25% after. Prior psychiatric care, suicidal ideation, sleep medication, increased pandemic alcohol consumption, perceiving high risk of contamination, being woman, and of younger age were factors associated with having nightmares during the pandemic.

"Impact of COVID-19-Related Lockdown on Psychosocial, Cognitive, and Functional Well-Being in Adults With Down Syndrome","People with Down Syndrome (DS) have a high prevalence of physical and psychiatric comorbidities and experience early-onset dementia. With the outbreak of CoVID-19 pandemic, strict social isolation measures have been necessary to prevent the spreading of the disease. Effects of this lockdown period on behavior, mood and cognition in people with DS have not been assessed so far. In the present clinical study, we investigated the impact of CoVID-19-related lockdown on psychosocial, cognitive and functional well-being in a sample population of 46 adults with DS. The interRAI Intellectual Disability standardized assessment instrument, which includes measures of social withdrawal, functional impairment, aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms, was used to perform a three time-point evaluation (two pre-lockdown and one post-lockdown) in 37 subjects of the study sample, and a two time point evaluation (one pre- and one post-lockdown) in 9 subjects. Two mixed linear regression models - one before and one after the lockdown - have been fitted for each scale in order to investigate the change in the time-dependent variation of the scores. In the pre-lockdown period, significant worsening over time (i.e., per year) was found for the Depression Rating Scale score (ÃŽÂ² = 0.55; 95% CI 0.34; 0.76). In the post-lockdown period, a significant worsening in social withdrawal (ÃŽÂ² = 3.05, 95% CI 0.39; 5.70), instrumental activities of daily living (ÃŽÂ² = 1.13, 95% CI 0.08; 2.18) and depression rating (ÃŽÂ² = 1.65, 95% CI 0.33; 2.97) scales scores was observed, as was a significant improvement in aggressive behavior (ÃŽÂ² = -1.40, 95% CI -2.69; -0.10). Despite the undoubtful importance of the lockdown in order to reduce the spreading of the CoVID-19 pandemic, the related social isolation measures suggest an exacerbation of depressive symptoms and a worsening in functional status in a sample of adults with DS. At the opposite, aggressive behavior was reduced after the lockdown period. This finding could be related to the increase of negative and depressive symptoms in the study population. Studies with longer follow-up period are needed to assess persistence of these effects.","Villani, Vetrano, Damiano, Paola, Ulgiati, Martin, Hirdes, Fratiglioni, Bernabei, Onder, CarfÃƒÂ¬","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.578686","20201116","COVID-19; down syndrome; functioning; lockdown; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7200,""
"Depression, Environmental Reward, Coping Motives and Alcohol Consumption During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Increases in the incidence of psychological distress and alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic have been predicted. Behavioral theories of depression and alcohol self-medication theories suggest that greater social/environmental constraints and increased psychological distress during COVID-19 could result in increases in depression and drinking to cope with negative affect. The current study had two goals: (1) to examine self-reported changes in alcohol use and related outcomes after the introduction of COVID-19 social distancing requirements, and; (2) to test hypothesized mediation models to explain individual differences in self-reported changes in depression and alcohol use during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Participants (<i>n</i> = 833) were U.S. residents recruited for participation in a single online survey. The cross-sectional survey included questions assessing environmental reward, depression, COVID-19-related distress, drinking motives, and alcohol use outcomes. Outcomes were assessed via retrospective self-report for two timeframes in the single survey: the 30 days prior to state-mandated social distancing (&quot;pre-social-distancing&quot;), and the 30 days after the start of state-mandated social distancing (&quot;post-social-distancing&quot;). <b>Results:</b> Depression severity, coping motives, and some indices of alcohol consumption (e.g., frequency of binge drinking, and frequency of solitary drinking) were significantly greater post-social-distancing relative to pre-social-distancing. Conversely, environmental reward and other drinking motives (social, enhancement, and conformity) were significantly lower post-social distancing compared to pre-social-distancing. Behavioral economic indices (alcohol demand) were variable with regard to change. Mediation analyses suggested a significant indirect effect of reduced environmental reward with drinking quantity/frequency via increased depressive symptoms and coping motives, and a significant indirect effect of COVID-related distress with alcohol quantity/frequency via coping motives for drinking. <b>Discussion:</b> Results provide early cross-sectional evidence regarding the relation of environmental reward, depression, and COVID-19-related psychological distress with alcohol consumption and coping motives during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results are largely consistent with predictions from behavioral theories of depression and alcohol self-medication frameworks. Future research is needed to study prospective associations among these outcomes.","McPhee, Keough, Rundle, Heath, Wardell, Hendershot","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.574676","20201116","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; alcohol; depression; mental health; social distancing; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7201,""

"Stress, Burnout, and Coping Strategies of Frontline Nurses During the COVID-19 Epidemic in Wuhan and Shanghai, China","<b>Background:</b> Nurses at the frontline of caring for COVID-19 patients might experience mental health challenges and supportive coping strategies are needed to reduce their stress and burnout. The aim of this study was to identify stressors and burnout among frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan and Shanghai and to explore perceived effective morale support strategies. <b>Method:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted in March 2020 among 110 nurses from Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai, who were deployed at COVID-19 units in Wuhan and Shanghai. A COVID-19 questionnaire was adapted from the previous developed &quot;psychological impacts of SARS&quot; questionnaire and included stressors (31 items), coping strategies (17 items), and effective support measures (16 items). Burnout was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. <b>Results:</b> Totally, 107 (97%) nurses responded. Participants mean age was 30.28 years and 90.7% were females. Homesickness was most frequently reported as a stressor (96.3%). Seven of the 17 items related to coping strategies were undertaken by all participants. Burnout was observed in the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization subscales, with 78.5 and 92.5% of participants presenting mild levels of burnout, respectively. However, 52 (48.6%) participants experienced a severe lack of personal accomplishment. Participants with longer working hours in COVID-19 quarantine units presented higher emotional exhaustion (OR = 2.72, 95% CI 0.02-5.42; <i>p</i> = 0.049) and depersonalization (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.10-2.19; <i>p</i> = 0.033).

"Self-Perceived Stress During the Quarantine of COVID-19 Pandemic in Paraguay: An Exploratory Survey","<b>Introduction:</b> Any viral pandemic is a global health and mental health issue. The World Health Organization and mental health associations have warned that the current COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a drastic increase of stress-related conditions and mental health issues globally. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> An online web-based survey has been launched from 10 to 15 April 2020 in Paraguay in order to collect information regarding the stress related to the quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been spread through social media (&quot;<i>WhatsApp</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>Twitter</i>,&quot; and &quot;<i>Facebook</i>&quot;). Two thousand two hundred and six Paraguayan citizens, over 18 years of age, completed the survey voluntarily. Socio-demographics as well as ratings at Self-perceived Stress Scale have been collected and analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Two thousand two hundred and six subjects (74.12% men) aged between 18 and 75 with an average of 34 Ã‚Â± 11 years old completed the survey. 12.42% (276 subjects) of sample reported a preexisting diagnosis of mental disorder, and 175 participants (7.93%) reported an increase of preexisting symptoms with the onset of COVID-19 quarantine. 41.97% of them had anxiety and 54.38% did not receive any specific treatment. The general population rated 18.10 Ã‚Â± 5.99 at Self-perceived Stress Scale, which indicates a moderate level of self-perceived stress. Significant association was found between higher levels of stress and female sex, being single, or reporting preexisting mental disorder, above all anxiety and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). In fact, in 63.87% of mentally ill subjects (<i>n</i> = 175), the quarantine has worsened symptoms of preexisting mental disorders. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study suggests a stressful impact of COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of participants reporting a moderate level of self-perceived stress. We suggest mental health services to provide a phone-based or web-based support to the general population in order to contrast the psychological impact of the pandemic.

"Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) for Anxiety Due to Fear of COVID-19 Infection: A Case Series","Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is becoming popular for treating phobia and anxiety disorder. The recent pandemic of COVID-19 not only causes infection per se but also has an impact on mental health. This case series aimed to explore the role of VRET in the intervention of psychiatric illnesses with chief complaints of fear of COVID-19 infection. In vivo exposure therapy for fear of COVID-19 infection is not possible due to the risk of virus infection; in this scenario, the VRET provides an immersive experience and can act as adjunctive therapy for treating phobias and anxiety disorders arising due to novel coronavirus pandemic. Clinical presentation and findings as well as management and procedures of VRET are discussed. Medical record of three patients (two male and one female) at the Shenzhen Mental Health Center (Shenzhen Kangning Hospital), China, was included in the present case series. Patients were assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Fear of COVID-19 Scale to measure anxiety and fear, respectively. Throughout VRET sessions, we gradually and systematically exposed the patient to virtual COVID-19 scenarios (for example, touching stained door handle which may have viruses, watching pandemic news, watching frontline health care workers, etc.). In our study, VRET intervention significantly reduced the related symptoms caused by fear of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, virtual reality can provide relevant theoretical and practical support for exploring the remote psychological counseling of patients in isolation wards.","Zhang, Paudel, Shi, Liang, Liu, Zeng, Zhou, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S276203","20201116","COVID-19; VRET; exposure therapy; phobia; telehealth; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7206,""
"Correlation Study of Short-Term Mental Health in Patients Discharged After Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection without Comorbidities: A Prospective Study","The WHO has upgraded the status of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from epidemic to global pandemic. The psychometric properties aspects of COVID-19 patients without comorbidities in the short term after discharge have not been reported. In this study, the Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used to evaluate the psychometric properties and to find relevant risk factors. The study was conducted in seven hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. The SF-36 questionnaire was administered one month after discharge. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression model were used to analyze the risk factors of psychometric properties impairment. In univariate analysis of independent risk factors, according to the comparison of whether the duration of positive nucleic acid was greater than 20 days, the positive nucleic acid duration was independently related to the decreased role-emotional value [100, IQR (66-100) vs 100, IQR (0, 100); p = 0.0156]. In addition, multivariable linear regression model showed that male sex and positive nucleic acid duration were related to decreased role-emotional value (p = 0.03&lt; 0.05; p = 0.01&lt; 0.05, respectively). Mental health was associated with age (p= 0.0435). Subsequently, we divided into three subgroups: less than seven days, 7 to 14 days and more than 14 days according to the positive nucleic acid duration. The results revealed that there were significant differences in the vitality value and mental health value of patients aged 46 to 69 in the subgroup where the positive nucleic acid duration longer than 14 days (p= 0.0472; p= 0.0311&lt; 0.05, respectively). Similarly, there are also significant differences in role-emotional value in different genders (p= 0.0316).

"Intersecting Vulnerabilities: The Impacts of COVID-19 on the Psycho-emotional Lives of Young People in Low- and Middle-Income Countries","Across diverse contexts, emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing levels of anxiety and stress. In calling for greater attention to people's psychosocial and emotional well-being, global actors have paid insufficient attention to the realities of the pandemic in low- and middle-income countries, where millions of people are already exposed to intersecting vulnerabilities. Chronic poverty, protracted violence, conflict and displacement, coupled with weak health, education and protection systems, provide the backdrop of many adolescents' lives. Drawing on qualitative in-country telephone interviews with over 500 adolescents in Ethiopia, CÃƒÂ´te d'Ivoire and Lebanon, this article unpacks the age and gendered dimensions of COVID-19 and its response. We conclude by discussing the implications for COVID-19 recovery efforts, arguing that embedding adolescent-centred, inclusive approaches in education, community-based health and social protection responses, has the potential to mitigate the psycho-emotional toll of the pandemic on young people and promote resilience.

"Rapid transitional response to the COVID-19 pandemic by opioid agonist treatment programs in Ukraine","On March 16, 2020, Ukraine's Ministry of Health issued nonspecific interim guidance to continue enrolling patients in opioid agonist therapies (OAT) and transition existing patients to take-home dosing to reduce community COVID-19 transmission. Though the number of OAT patients increased modestly, the proportion receiving take-home dosing increased from 57.5% to 82.2%, which translates on average to 963,952 fewer clinic interactions annually (range: 728,652-1,016,895) and potentially 80,329 (range: 60,721-84,741) fewer hours of in-person clinical encounters. During the transition, narcologists (addiction specialists) expressed concerns about overdoses, the guidance contradicting existing legislation, and patient dropout, either from incarceration or inadequate public transportation. Though clinicians did observe some overdoses, short-term overall mortality remained similar to the previous year. As the country relaxes the interim guidance, we do not know to what extent governmental guidance or clinical practice will change to adopt the new guidance permanently or revert to pre-guidance regulations. Some future considerations that have come from COVID-19 are should dosing schedules continue to be flexible, should clinicians adopt telehealth, and should there be more overdose education and naloxone distribution? OAT delivery has improved and become more efficient, but clinicians should plan long-term should COVID-19 return in the near future.

Psychological distress was associated with age, psychological coping strategies, and having had symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but not with MS disease-related variables and COVID-19 risk factors. Perception of COVID-19-related risk was associated with age, MS disease severity, COVID-19-related factors, and anxiety. This study demonstrated that even during COVID-19, distress and risk perception are primarily driven by psychological factors, experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and age, with minimal contribution from individual differences in health status, providing an impetus for continued efforts to optimize psychological interventions for people living with MS.","Alschuler, Roberts, Herring, Ehde","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102618","20201116","COVID-19; Coping; Distress; Multiple sclerosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7212,""

"The protective role of life satisfaction, coping strategies and defense mechanisms on perceived stress due to COVID-19 emergency: A chained mediation model","The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic represents a worldwide emergency, which may have harmful consequences on people's mental health. Parallel to research focused on risk factors, it could be useful to investigate the factors that help to cope with such crises at an emotional level. Therefore, this study aimed to strengthen the role of variables that protect from subjective distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, explore the pathways between satisfaction with life and perceived stress, and consider the role of coping strategies and defense mechanisms in this relationship. A sample of 1102 Italian participants who were experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown measures (Mage = 34.91, SD = 11.91) completed an online survey in which the Ten Item Perceived Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory and Forty-Item Defense Style Questionnaire were included. The data were analyzed using Pearson's r correlations and moderation analysis. A chained-mediation model showed that the relationship between life satisfaction and perceived stress is partially mediated by approach coping, positive attitude and mature defenses. This study contributes toward gaining a better understanding of a protective pathway for mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings could be useful from both a preventive and an intervention perspective.","Gori, Topino, Di Fabio","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242402","20201116","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7214,""
"Current state of research on psychotherapy for home-living vulnerable older adults with depression","Older home-living vulnerable adults often suffer from chronic conditions accompanied by restrictions in mobility, social participation and reduced independence. Among this rapidly growing population depression is aÃ‚Â common and serious health problem; however, there are shortcomings in the diagnosis of depression and provision of psychotherapy. Despite growing evidence in treating depression among the group of nursing home residents or the &quot;young-old&quot;, there is aÃ‚Â research gap regarding needs-oriented healthcare strategies for very old, frail or care-dependent older adults living at home. The present article provides an overview of different outpatient psychotherapeutic treatment approaches for vulnerable older adults with depression, in particular adaptations tailored to those who are homebound or in need of care. Based on the current state of research, this article derives recommendations for psychotherapy in this special setting to consider the physical and psychosocial resources of this patient group. Furthermore, healthcare strategies for embedding psychotherapy in collaborative, telehealth or home-delivered healthcare services are described and their applicability as psychosocial support for older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is discussed. Psychotherapy is an efficacious treatment for depression in home-living vulnerable older adults. Further implementing telehealth or home delivered settings, individually tailored psychotherapeutic approaches as well as collaborative and stepped care approaches can increase utilization and medical supply of this patient group. More research and innovative programs are needed to improve access to and provision of psychotherapeutic care as well as their social inclusion.","Tegeler, Beyer, Hoppmann, Ludwig, Kessler","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00391-020-01805-3","20201113","Collaborative care; Frailty; Homebound individuals; Psychosocial interventions; State of the art review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7215,""
"COVID-19 Crisis Effects on Caregiver Distress in Neurocognitive Disorder","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have mental health implications for both people with neurocognitive disorder and their caregivers. The study aimed to shed light on relations between caregiver mental reaction to the pandemic and caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms, memory impairment progression, and functional impairment of people with neurocognitive disorder during the period of confinement in Greece. The study included caregivers of patients with mild (NÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 13) and major (NÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 54) neurocognitive disorder. The caregiver-based telephone interview was based on items of the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire, the AD8 Dementia Screening Instrument, and the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale. Regarding the mental impact of the COVID-19 crisis on caregivers, four single questions referring to their worries in the last seven days were posed, in addition to the scales Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). A stepwise linear regression model was employed for studying the relationship between caregiver distress and demographic and clinical data and caregiver mental reaction to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Caregiver distress severity during the confinement period was influenced not only by memory deficits (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.009) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.001) of patients, but also by caregiver hyperarousal (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.003) and avoidance symptoms (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.033) and worries directly linked to the COVID-19 crisis (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.022). These observations provide further evidence for the urgent need for support of caregivers of patients with neurocognitive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alexopoulos, Soldatos, Kontogianni, Frouda, Loanna Aligianni, Skondra, Passa, Konstantopoulou, Stamouli, Katirtzoglou, Politis, Economou, Alexaki, Siarkos, Politis","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200991","20201113","COVID-19; Confinement; impairment in activities of daily living; memory deficits; neuropsychiatric symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7216,""
"How Adolescents Use Social Media to Cope with Feelings of Loneliness and Anxiety During COVID-19 Lockdown","Next to physical health problems and economic damage, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated lockdown measures taken by governments of many countries are expected to cause mental health problems. Especially for adolescents, who highly rely on social contacts with peers, the prolonged period of social isolation may have detrimental effects on their mental health. Based on the mood management theory, the current study examines if social media are beneficial for adolescents to cope with feelings of anxiety and loneliness during the quarantine. A survey study among 2,165 (Belgian) adolescents (13-19 years old) tested how feelings of anxiety and loneliness contributed to their happiness level, and whether different social media coping strategies (active, social relations, and humor) mediated these relations. Structural equation modeling revealed that feelings of loneliness had a higher negative impact on adolescents' happiness than feelings of anxiety. However, anxious participants indicated to use social media more often to actively seek for a manner to adapt to the current situation, and to a lesser extent as a way to keep in touch with friends and family. The indirect effect of anxiety on happiness through active coping was significantly positive. Participants who were feeling lonely were more inclined to use social media to cope with lacking social contact. However, this coping strategy was not significantly related to their happiness feelings. Humorous coping was positively related with feelings of happiness, but not influenced by loneliness or anxiety. To conclude, social media can be used as a constructive coping strategy for adolescents to deal with anxious feelings during the COVID-19 quarantine.","Cauberghe, Van Wesenbeeck, De Jans, Hudders, Ponnet","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0478","20201113","COVID-19; adolescents; coping; mood management theory; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7217,""
"&quot;Depression, Anxiety and Stress&quot; in a Cohort of Registered Practicing Ophthalmic Surgeons, Post Lockdown during COVID-19 Pandemic in India","<b>Purpose</b>: To assess the magnitude of mental health problems among ophthalmologists in India post lockdown during COVID pandemic. <b>Method</b>: Cross-sectional survey conducted online on registered practising ophthalmologists of India, post lockdown at the start of elective surgeries (20<sup>th</sup> to 25<sup>th</sup> May, 2020). The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress was assessed by DASS -21 questionnaire. DASS -Subscales: DASS- D (depression), DASS- A (anxiety) and DASS-S (stress) and grading of severity (mild, moderate, severe) were analysed. <b>Results</b>: A total of 144 ophthalmologists aged 29-72Ã‚Â years responded to online survey. Of all participants, 94 (64.2%) of ophthalmologists suffered from mental health problems. Seventy six (52.7%) ophthalmologists had depression and anxiety whereas 20 (14%) reported stress. Women ophthalmologists scored highest total DASS mean score and DASS-stress mean score (<i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .04 and <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .03). Results of DASS-D and DASS-A showed female preponderance (men vs women 42.5% vs 61.5%, <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .02; 42.5% vs 60%, <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .04). Severity of symptoms revealed that ophthalmologists above 40 years of age with more than 10 years' experienced severe stress (<i>p</i> =Ã‚Â .005). Comprehensive ophthalmologists presented with severe stress and ophthalmologists practicing speciality with severe anxiety. Pearson's correlation analysis showed positive correlation between total DASS-21 score with each of the three subscales scores (DASS D, r-0.88: <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001; DASS-A, r =Ã‚Â 0.96: <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â &lt;0.001; DASS-S, r =Ã‚Â 0.95: <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001). <b>Conclusion</b>: Screening by Dass-21 scale has brought noticeable transient mental health issue among ophthalmologist to the fore.

"Mental health problems and correlates among 746 217 college students during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health concern all over the world. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population. This study aimed to assess the mental health problems and associated factors among a large sample of college students during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. This cross-sectional and nation-wide survey of college students was conducted in China from 3 to 10 February 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess psychosocial factors, COVID-19 epidemic related factors and mental health problems. Acute stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by the Chinese versions of the impact of event scale-6, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively. Univariate and hierarchical logistic regression analyses were performed to examine factors associated with mental health problems. Among 821 218 students who participated in the survey, 746 217 (90.9%) were included for the analysis. In total, 414 604 (55.6%) of the students were female. About 45% of the participants had mental health problems. The prevalence rates of probable acute stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms were 34.9%, 21.1% and 11.0%, respectively. COVID-19 epidemic factors that were associated with increased risk of mental health problems were having relatives or friends being infected (adjusted odds ratio = 1.72-2.33). Students with exposure to media coverage of the COVID-19 Ã¢â€°Â¥3 h/day were 2.13 times more likely than students with media exposure &lt;1 h/day to have acute stress symptoms. Individuals with low perceived social support were 4.84-5.98 times more likely than individuals with high perceived social support to have anxiety and depressive symptoms. In addition, senior year and prior mental health problems were also significantly associated with anxiety or/and depressive symptoms. In this large-scale survey of college students in China, acute stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple epidemic and psychosocial factors, such as family members being infected, massive media exposure, low social support, senior year and prior mental health problems were associated with increased risk of mental health problems. Psychosocial support and mental health services should be provided to those students at risk.","Ma, Zhao, Li, Chen, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Yu, Jiang, Fan, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796020000931","20201113","COVID-19; College students; mental health problems; nation-wide survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7219,""
"What can a home hemodialysis program offer to patients in a nursing home setting? A case series and feasibility analysis","Over the last decades, the number of elderly patients on dialysis has rapidly grown on account of increased life expectancy, improved care and reduced mortality rate. Therefore, cooperation between geriatricians and nephrologists has become mandatory for co-managing kidney disease in these patients. Based on renewed interest in home hemodialysis (HHD), elderly patients may benefit from not being transported from their home for therapy. Here, we report our experience with HHD involving three elderly patients who were followed-up over a 15-months period in a nursing home. Our experience demonstrates that hospitalization abruptly dropped from 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°days to zero days, the need for erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) diminished, transportation-related costs for home treatments decreased, and quality of life (QoL) improved. This was confirmed by a questionnaire administered to our patients at the start and again after 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of HHD which evaluated the Physical Health Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Health Component Score (MCS). Home hemodialysis may represent an important way to improve social, mental, and physical recovery, while also eliminating the cost of transportation and the discomfort of abandoning their &quot;homes&quot; and daily habits. Home hemodialysis is an effective alternative to in-center HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD) that should be offered to elderly patients when a home caregiver is not available, nonetheless, nursing assistance is required. Moreover, HHD allows patients to stay at home, thereby avoiding several weekly trips to the dialysis center, and may be useful in reducing infections, especially in times of the COVID-19 pandemic, as demonstrated by our experience.","Scarpioni, Ricardi, Manini, Chiappini, Ballocchi, Albertazzi, DeAmicis, Melfa, Rocca, Valsania, Blanco, Fenocchio","https://doi.org/10.1111/hdi.12904","20201113","COVID-19; Home hemodialysis; chronic kidney disease; dialysis; feasibility; nursing home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7220,""

Two job insecurity measures and four anxiety and depression measures were analyzed using multivariable Poisson regression models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status. Fifty-nine percent of participants experienced direct or household employment loss since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 38% were expected to experience direct or household employment loss in the coming 4 weeks. Recent direct or household employment loss and expected direct or household employment loss, among participants who did not experience recent employment loss, were associated with a greater risk of poor mental health on all four measures. U.S. young adults experience a significant mental health burden as a result of job insecurity amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ganson, Tsai, Weiser, Benabou, Nagata","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.10.008","20201113","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Job insecurity; Unemployment; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7223,""
"Psychological response of children to home confinement during COVID-19: A qualitative arts-based research","The evidence has shown that children are more susceptible to the emotional effects of traumatic events such as outbreaks with the possible disruption in their daily lives. In this paper, we discussed the psychological wellbeing of children during the COVID-19 outbreak through the art-based qualitative study using the drawing method among children in Iraqi Kurdistan. In this qualitative arts-based research study, 15 children aged 6 to 13Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old who were confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak for at least 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month were included following obtaining the consent from their parents. The children were asked to draw his/her feelings, reflections, and responses during the COVID-19 on a paper. The children were guided to paint their reflections during the COVID-19 based on the following criteria: if they experienced loneliness, tiredness, insomnia, depression, worry or anxiety, or have behavior changes and their relationship with their parents and other siblings. This study showed that children have a high level of stress at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The children had great fear about the coronavirus. They experienced loneliness and stress, and felt sad, depressed due to home confinement and social distancing. The possibility of infection by coronavirus has occupied their entire mind. Mental health care providers must take the experiences of children who are caught in this global pandemic seriously and ensure that appropriate care is offered to the children and their parents. The children exhibited a strong feeling of distress, loneliness, and fear during the COVID-19 outbreak. This has implications for mental health care.","Abdulah, Abdulla, Liamputtong","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020972439","20201113","Art-based method; COVID-19; drawing method; emotional wellbeing; outbreak; pediatric population","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7224,""
"Changes in pediatric emergency department visits for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Limited early results indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant impact on the mental health of children and adolescents. Pediatric emergency departments (PED) play a pivotal role in the identification, treatment, and coordination of care for children with mental health disorders, however, there is a dearth of literature evaluating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care provision in the PED. We sought to evaluate whether changes in frequency or patient demographics among children and adolescents presenting to the PED has occurred. This is a cross-sectional study conducted at the Yale New Haven Children's Hospital (YNHCH) PED. Data representing the early COVID-19 pandemic period was abstracted from the electronic medical record and compared using descriptive statistics to the same time period the year prior. Patient demographics including patient gender, ED disposition, mode of arrival, race-ethnicity, and insurance status were assessed. During the pandemic period, 148 patients presented to the YNHCH PED with mental health-related diagnoses, compared to 378 in the pre-pandemic period, a reduction of 60.84%. Compared to white children, black children were 0.55 less likely to present with a mental health condition as compared to the pre-pandemic study period (<i>p</i> = 0.002; 95% CI 0.36-0.85). Children with mental and behavioral health disorders who seek care in PEDs may be at risk for delayed presentations of mental health disorders. African American children may be a particularly vulnerable population to screen for mental health disorders as reopening procedures are initiated and warrants further study.","Leff, Setzer, Cicero, Auerbach","https://doi.org/10.1177/1359104520972453","20201113","COVID-19; Pediatric emergency medicine; child psychiatry; emergency services; pandemics; psychiatric","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7225,""

"Clinical and functional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing on Veterans with psychotic disorders and recently-housed Veterans","Background: The COVID pandemic has upended the daily lives of everyone in the United States, negatively impacting social interactions, work, and living situations. The pandemic could lead to or exacerbate mental health issues, especially in people who are already vulnerable to such effects. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system two populations vulnerable to social and functional disruptions include those who have recently experienced homelessness (recently housed Veterans, RHV) and those who have a psychotic disorder (PSY). Methods and Findings: We conducted phone interviews with PSY (n = 81), RHV (n = 76) and control Veterans (CTL, n = 74) between mid-May â€“ mid-August, 2020 (â€œcurrentâ€) and a retrospective assessment relative to January, 2020 (â€œpre-COVIDâ€). We assessed clinical factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, loneliness) and community integration (e.g., family and social functioning, work) at both time periods, and risk and protective factors (e.g., resilience, uncertainty) for the current period. The two vulnerable groups had higher levels of clinical symptoms and poorer community integration relative to CTL, as expected. Regarding the effect of the pandemic, results showed that all three groups experienced worse clinical outcomes (i.e., increased depression, anxiety, loneliness) currently vs. pre-COVID; there were no significant interactions between group and time period indicating all three groups were equally impacted by the pandemic. For community integration, there was a small but significant decrease in social networks in all three groups currently vs. pre-COVID. RHV showed a small but significant increase in independent living relative to pre-COVID ratings. Finally, RHV had greater levels of intolerance of uncertainty compared to PSY and CTL. Conclusions: Our results indicate that vulnerable and non-vulnerable Veterans were equally negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of a disproportionate effect of the pandemic on the vulnerable groups may be due to the availability and utilization of comprehensive VA services available to vulnerable Veterans (e.g., housing and financial support, medical and mental health services), which may have helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","Jonathan Wynn et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F5-5E8-C58","20201117","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; recently housed; community integration; veterans; covid19; clinical; psychosis; coronavirus","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7227,""

Social isolation as a result of social distancing during the pandemic potentially affects the associations among perceived available peer support, emotional well-being, and depression in university students. The present study examined the associations among perceived available peer support, emotional well-being (as indicated negatively by loneliness and negative affects, and indicated positively by positive affects and hope), and depressive symptoms in university students. During the 3rd stage of the outbreak in July, 2020, 255 students at a public university in Hong Kong participated in an online-based survey which assessed their perceived available peer support, emotional well-being, and depressive symptoms. Results showed that perceived available peer support negatively contributed to depressive symptoms; both negative and positive indicators of emotional well-being mediated the association between perceived available peer support and depressive symptoms. The university students showed signs of depressive symptoms, highlighting the need for preventive efforts and increased access to mental health care that supports the psychological and emotional needs of young people during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yao Sun et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609E-7A0-B7D","20201117","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; covid-19; emotional well-being; depressive symptoms; positive and negative affects; loneliness; peer support; hope","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7228,""
"Keeping Kids Busy: Family Factors Associated with Hands-on Play and Screen Time During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Parent-child interactions are crucial for child development. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected mental health and increased parenting challenges impacting parent-child functioning. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between parent factors and child activities to identify parental needs. A convenience sample of parents (N = 708), primarily mothers (n = 610; 87.4%) aged 35.59 years old (SD = 5.59; range = 21-72), with children ages 2-8 years completed an online questionnaire between April 14-June 1, 2020. Participants mostly resided in Canada and had an income of >$100,000. Parent-child activities were measured as total weekly time and combined time across activities within two categories: hands-on play and screen time. Bivariate correlations informed block-wise linear regression models. For families with childcare needs, parental anxiety was associated with higher total hands-on play (F(3,142) = 14.01, p < .001), combined hands-on play (F(2,85) = 6.82, p = .011), and combined screen time (F(2,82) = 6.25, p = .014). Families without childcare needs indicated parenting stress was associated with lower total hands-on play (F(3,212) = 7.95, p < .005) and combined hands-on play (F(2,110) = 5.67, p = .019), and higher supervised screen time (F(3,138) = 6.14, p = .014). Family structure and indices of socioeconomic status were also predictive of activities across childcare needs and child ages. To promote high-quality parent-child interactions and positive developmental outcomes in the pandemic, policy makers should support childcare needs, parent mental health and stress, and provide evidence-based guidelines for child screen time.","Shaelyn Stienwandt et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F1-5FD-A8C","20201117","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; parenting; parent-child interactions; covid-19; hands-on play; screen-time","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-17","",7229,""
