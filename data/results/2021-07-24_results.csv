"Probiotic consortia improve anti-viral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets","Probiotics have been suggested as one solution to counter detrimental health effects by SARS-CoV-2, however, data so far is scarce. We tested the effect of two probiotic consortia, OL-1 and OL-2, against SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets and assessed their effect on cytokine production and transcriptome in a human monocyte-derived macrophage (Mf) and dendritic cell (DC) model. The results showed that the consortia significantly reduced the viral load, modulated immune response, and regulated viral receptor expression in ferrets compared to placebo. In human Mf and DC model, OL-1 and OL-2 induced cytokine production and genes related to SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral immunity. The study results indicate that probiotic stimulation of the ferret immune system leads to improved anti-viral immunity against SARS-COV-2 and that critical genes and cytokines for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity are stimulated in human immune cells in vitro. The effect of the consortia against SARS-CoV-2 warrants further investigations in human clinical trials.","Markus Lehtinen; Ritesh Kumar; Bryan Zabel; Sanna M Makela; Derek Nedveck; Peipei Tang; Sinikka Latvala; Sebastien Guery; Charles R Budinoff","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453521","20210723","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16429,""
"Does COVID-19 vaccination improve mental health? A difference-in-difference analysis of the UnderstandingCoronavirus in America study","Background: Mental health problems increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge that one is less at risk after being vaccinated may alleviate distress but this hypothesis remains unexplored. Here we test whether psychological distress declined in those vaccinated against COVID-19 in the US and whether changes in perceived risk mediated any association. Methods: A nationally-representative cohort of U.S. adults (N=5,792) in the Understanding America Study were interviewed every two weeks from March 2020 to June 2021 (28 waves). Difference-in-differences regression tested whether getting vaccinated reduced distress (PHQ-4 scores), with mediation analysis used to identify potential mechanisms, including perceived risks of infection, hospitalization, and death. Results: Vaccination was associated with a 0.09 decline in distress scores (95% CI:-0.62 to -0.35) (0-12 scale), a 5.7% relative decrease compared to mean scores in the wave prior to vaccination. Vaccination was associated with an 8.44 percentage point reduction in perceived risk of infection (95% CI:-9.15% to -7.73%), a 7.44-point reduction in perceived risk of hospitalization (95% CI:-8.07% to -6.82%), and a 5.03-point reduction in perceived risk of death (95% CI:-5.57% to -4.49%). Including risk perceptions decreased the vaccination-distress association by two-thirds. Event study models suggest vaccinated and never vaccinated respondents followed similar PHQ-4 trends pre-vaccination, diverging significantly post-vaccination. Analyses were robust to individual and wave fixed effects and time-varying controls, and were similar across sociodemographic groups. Conclusion: Receiving a COVID-19 vaccination was associated with declines in distress and perceived risks of infection, hospitalization, and death. Vaccination campaigns could promote this additional benefit of being vaccinated.","Jonathan Koltai; Julia Raifman; Jacob Bor; Martin McKee; David Stuckler","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.19.21260782","20210722","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16430,""
"Effects of COVID-19 2021 lockdown on the sleep quality and mental health of undergraduate medical and dental students of Pakistan: A cross-sectional study","Background and objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has been recognized as a cause of direct and indirect psychological consequences that impact mental health such as acute stress disorders, anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, and insomnia. This study was planned to evaluate the sleep quality and mental health of undergraduate students amidst the COVID-19 lockdown of 2021. Materials and Methods: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted in Lahore, Pakistan, where 261 undergraduate medical and dental students enrolled at a private medical and dental school were approached from March to May 2021. The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to identify the sleep quality along with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to establish anxiety symptoms and the Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression symptoms. Results: The results show that 212 (81.2%) female and 49 (18.8%) male students participated in the study. Of the participants 75.1% experienced poor sleep quality, 90% had symptoms of depression, and 85.4% had symptoms of anxiety. The mean score on the PSQI scale was 8.59+4.10, on the GAD-7 scale was 11.36+5.94 and on the PHQ-9 scale was 13.70+6.81. Multiple regression analysis showed that anxiety symptoms ({beta} = 0.315, p = 0.000) and depression symptoms ({beta} = 0.398, p = 0.000) were significant predictors of sleep quality amongst the undergraduate medical and dental students. Conclusion: A high majority of the study participants are experiencing poor sleep quality along with suffering from depression and anxiety amidst the COVID-19 lockdown. It is concluded from the analysis that anxiety and depression symptoms are significant predictors of sleep quality. Relevant authorities need to set up systems that help undergraduate medical students in alleviating and coping with these symptoms midst the COVID-19 pandemic.","Naveen Siddique Sheikh; Aiza Anwar; Iqra Pervaiz; Zunaira Arshad; Huma Saeed Khan; Farida Hafeez","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.17.21260690","20210722","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16431,""
"Spanish Version of the Attitude Towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale: Reliability and Validity Assessment","Background and purpose: The negative attitude to vaccines for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has motivated the adaptation of instruments for this specific purpose. However, details of the reliability and validity of these scales are unknown. The study aimed to evaluate some indicators of the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the Attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale. Methods: A validation study was carried out with 1,136 students of emerging age (18 and 29 years) from a Colombian university; 65.5% were female. Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega were calculated for reliability, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyzes for validity. Additionally, the gender differential item functioning (DIF) was estimated with Kendall's tau b. Results: The Spanish version of Attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.94 and McDonald's omega of 0.95), a one-dimensional structure with acceptable goodness-of-fit indicators (CFI=0.94, TLI=0.91, and SRMR=0.04), and non-gender DIF (Kendall's tau b between 0.02 and 0.06). Conclusions: The Spanish version of the Attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale presents some appropriate reliability and validity indicators among university emerging adults. These findings should be explored in samples with other characteristics.","Adalberto Campo-Arias; Leynin Esther Caamano-Rocha; John Carlos Pedrozo-Pupo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.18.21260733","20210722","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16432,""
"Predicting Managers' Mental Health Across Countries Using Country-Level COVID-19 Statistics","Background: There is limited research focusing on publicly available statistics on the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as predictors of mental health across countries. Managers are at risk of suffering from mental disorders during the pandemic because they face particular hardship. Objective: We aim to predict mental disorder (anxiety and depression) symptoms of managers across countries using country-level COVID-19 statistics. Methods: A two-wave online survey of 406 managers from 26 countries was finished in May and July 2020. We used logistic panel regression models for our main analyses and performed robustness checks using ordinary least squares regressions. In the sample of 406 managers from 26 countries, 26.5% of managers reached the cut-off levels for anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7) and 43.5% did so for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ- 9) symptoms. Findings: We found that cumulative COVID-19 statistics (e.g., cumulative cases, cumulative cases per million, cumulative deaths, and cumulative deaths per million) predicted managers' anxiety and depression symptoms positively, whereas daily COVID-19 statistics (daily new cases, smoothed daily new cases, daily new deaths, smoothed daily new deaths, daily new cases per million, and smoothed daily new cases per million) predicted anxiety and depression symptoms negatively. In addition, the reproduction rate was a positive predictor, while stringency of governmental lockdown measures was a negative predictor. Individually, we found that the cumulative count of deaths is the best single predictor of both anxiety and depression symptoms. Conclusions: Cumulative COVID-19 statistics predicted managers' anxiety and depression symptoms positively, while non-cumulative daily COVID-19 statistics predicted anxiety and depression symptoms negatively. Cumulative count of deaths is the best single predictor of both anxiety and depression symptoms. Reproduction rate was a positive predictor, while stringency of governmental lockdown measures was a negative predictor.","Lun Li; Stephen X.

"Can situations awaken emotions? The compilation and evaluation of the Emotional Situation Sentence System (ESSS)","We aimed to establish and evaluate a standardized emotional situation sentence system (ESSS) relevant to the lives of college students to supplement prior literature and adapt to the needs of emotional research. Two studies were designed for this research;study 1 examined the effect of words in the ESSS and study 2 involved the use of pictures. For Study 1, 778 items were selected by 607 college students and 15 experts. We then tested the scale with 80 undergraduate participants. The ESSS sentences were rated on their degree of valence, arousal, and dominance using a 9-point scale. Cronbachâ€™s a (greater than 0.986) of the overall score as well as each sub-score in the three components confirmed the scaleâ€™s reliability. As seen on a scatter plot, the results suggest that negative emotions (fear, disgust, anger, sadness, anxiety) are convergent and different from the distribution of positive (happiness) and neutral emotions. Study 2 included 30 participants to compare the difference in valence and arousal between the ESSS and emotional pictures. The results indicate that the ESSS is a standardized, situational, and ecological emotional contextual text system, well-suited to invoke emotion in college students. The ESSS has significantly better arousal and potency than pictures;moreover, it can be applied to experimental studies of anxiety-related emotions. However, emotion pictures have shorter response times, and wider application ranges, and they can include more cross-cultural characteristics compared to words.","Zhao, Yuan, Yin, Ming, Zhu, Chuanlin, Tan, Chenghui, Hu, Shengjie, Liu, Dianzhi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252671","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: PLoS One; 16(7), 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One; 16(7), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16434,""
"Sense of coherence and strategies for coping with stress among nurses","Background The nursing profession is associated with constant presence of difficult situations and stress, which arise from responsibility for the highest values â€“ human life and health. With demographic changes in the society, the demand for nursing care increases. Looking after the health of nursing staff becomes a non-material investment in employees. One of the most important health potentials described in literature is the sense of coherence. It can significantly contribute to maintaining good health, modify oneâ€™s functioning in a stressful working environment and influence the choice of strategies for coping with stress. Aim The aim of the study was to describe the specific relationship between the sense of coherence and strategies for coping with stress in a group of professionally active nurses. Methodology and methods The study involved 91 nurses in central Poland, aged 22â€“52. The group was diversified in terms of: education, work system, marital status and place of residence. The study was conducted with the use of: Sense of Coherence Questionnaire SOC-29 and Inventory to Measure Coping Strategies with Stress - Mini-COPE. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of scientific research set out in the Helsinki Declaration. Results The sense of coherence value in the test group was M = 134.24 (SD = 19.55). In stressful situations nurses most often used active strategies to cope with stress: Planning M = 2.10 (SD = 0.54), Seeking Emotional Social Support M = 1.95 (SD = 0.68) and Seeking Instrumental Social Support M = 1.95 (SD = 0.69), and the least frequently: Alcohol/Drug Use M = 0.28 (SD = 0.48). The level of the sense of coherence and its components differentiated the strategies of coping with stress used in the examined group of nurses. Conclusions The research confirmed that the sense of coherence serves as a health potential in a stressful working environment - a high sense of coherence translate into better mental health, correct functioning in the working environment, and using adaptive strategies of coping with stress. Nurses with a stronger sense of coherence used more adaptive strategies to deal with stress than those with average or low levels.","Betke, Katarzyna, Basinska, Malgorzata Anna, Andruszkiewicz, Anna","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-021-00631-1","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMC Nursing; 20:1-10, 2021.; Publication details: BMC Nursing; 20:1-10, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16435,""
"Research news in clinical context","Transient impact of COVID-19 on HIV care in four African countries Investigators analysed data from the African Cohort Study, which prospectively collects information from 12 clinics across 5 HIV care programmes in Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Nigeria.3 Parameters including HIV clinic visit adherence, virological suppression and food security were compared between the periods January 2019â€“March 2020 (prepandemic phase) and May 2020â€“February 2021 (pandemic phase).

"Healthcare superheroes need rescue during pandemics","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed extraordinary pressure on an already strained healthcare workforce (HCWs). Public health measures, such as prolonged periods of social isolation, unexpected employment disruptions, school closures, financial distress, and changes to routine, are having an unprecedented negative impact on mental well-being. Unaddressed stress and burnout can lead to depression, suicidal ideation and substance abuse. We conducted a review of the literature (a) to synthesize the common triggers of stress, burnout and depression faced by HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) to identify interventions at the individual, organizational and systemic levels that can support the well-being of HCWs during a pandemic.A systematic search of literature databases was conducted from 2003 to June 2020. We included review articles that reported on stress, burnout and depression in HCWs;that primarily focused on women;and that included the percentage or number of women surveyed.Of the 2,803 papers found, 31 were included. Our preliminary findings show that HCWs are at increased risk for stress, burnout and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are triggered by individual-level factors such as gender, family status and lack of social support;organizational-level factors such as high workload and access to PPE;, and systemic-level factors such as prevalence of COVID-19, rapidly changing public health guidelines and a lack of recognition at work. There is a limited amount of evidence on effective interventions that prevent anxiety, stress, burnout and depression during a pandemic. Preliminary findings of causes of increased stress and mental health issues suggest possible strategies healthcare organizations can use to address modifiable factors such as ongoing training to increase confidence in caring for COVID-19 patients, clear infection control guidelines and sufficient PPE and optimization of working conditions for HCWs.","Sriharan, Abi, Ratnapalan, Savithiri, Lupea, Doina, Tricco, Andrea","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-FMLM.179","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 4(Suppl 1):A67-A68, 2020.; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 4(Suppl 1):A67-A68, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16437,""

"Service development project: creating a trust level mental capacity act awareness week","AimTo improve the understanding and confidence of clinical staff working in forensic services in applying Mental Capacity Act (MCA) legislation.MethodA multidisciplinary group including a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker and mental health law expert developed a MCA Awareness Week. This included a two hour workshop repeated across three forensic directorates. The workshop featured large and small group activities based on frequently arising scenarios. Workshop attendees were asked to complete a pre and post workshop questionnaire.ResultsThe workshops were fully booked with 80 staff members attending from all clinical specialities including: nurses (33), psychologists (8), healthcare assistants (7), doctors (7), occupational therapists (6), social workers (5), pharmacists (3) and clinical managers (3). 90% of participants completed both the pre and post workshop questionnaires. The mean usefulness score of the workshop was 8.8/10. There was a statistically significant increase (at the 0.05 level) in mean scores across all four measures, including: understanding capacity (26.7% increase), confidence in assessing capacity (29.3%), confidence in being a decision maker (31.6%) and awareness of the principles of capacity (35%). Qualitative feedback was that participants valued having face-to-face learning and group discussions allowed staff to share their views and experiences from the perspective of their disciplines.ConclusionsThe project was developed in response from the feedback and recommendations of a Care Quality Commission inspection. This meant that senior sponsorship was provided for initiating the project.

"Exploring the teaching and training needs of students and clinicians in digital health","There has been exponential growth in technology use within the NHS, further accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and video consultations, e-Consults and remote monitoring are now commonplace. However, undergraduate medical education is not keeping up with this pace and medical schools risk producing graduates who are unqualified to work in a digital NHS.The Medical Education Innovation and Research Centre (MEdIC) led two projects exploring views of primary care educators and medical students. MEdIC is a translational centre bringing cutting-edge evidence from health, education, community and policy into medical education innovations and research.Primary care educators attended a digital health workshop where activities included discussing challenges and risks around digital technology. Key challenges identified included digital consultation skills, access, workload, patient safety and ethics.Third year medical students were invited to enrol on â€˜Digital Health Futuresâ€™, a specialty choice module. After the module, students were invited to participate in focus groups to reflect on digital health education. Key themes included lack of preparedness for practice, a call for digital to be fully integrated within the curriculum, and concerns around attitude of the medical school to technology and digital innovation.LeadershipImplementing curricular improvement requires strong leadership;and close collaborations and consultation with students and educators is vital. This must be an ongoing and iterative process due to the nature of technological development. Aligning the curriculum to the Topol Report and NHS Long Term plan is key for student learning and ultimately patient care.MEdICâ€™s dedicated leadership in this area has demonstrated the need for curricular reform at undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing professional development level. This emerging and urgent priority must be tackled across the whole medical education spectrum.","Neve, Georgina, Dutta, Nina, Kumar, Sonia","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-FMLM.103","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 4(Suppl 1):A39, 2020.; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 4(Suppl 1):A39, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16440,""
"Harnessing COVID-19 lockdown trainee leadership to expand a local healthcare workforce wellbeing initiative nationally","There is lack of access at work to free sanitary products, personal hygiene products and sleep aids for healthcare workers, especially after hours or if unexpectedly resting on site. This may adversely affect personal dignity, hygiene and ability to sleep comfortably, negatively impacting staff engagement, sense of being valued and belonging and workplace performance. More intense shift working and increased fatigue and need to clean after wearing PPE during the Covid-19 pandemic increased these challenges.The Sanitary Products On Site (SOS) and Too Tired To Travel Home (T4H) boxes were established to meet these needs. Led by a junior doctor, they were piloted at three South East Wales acute hospitals, targeting junior and SAS doctors. All female doctor survey respondents felt that the pilot SOS box: was very useful;relieved concerns about being at work without sanitary products;and improves dignity, wellbeing and peace of mind at work. SOS box usage across a health board cost Â£0.33/week. T4H pilot survey respondents stated that personal hygiene products maintain dignity and wellbeing and improve their sense of being valued.Expansion of the SOS and T4H box schemes in March-April 2020 in response to COVID-19 targeted all healthcare staff in Emergency Departments and/or Intensive Care Units at all acute hospitals and the new field hospital in Wales. Expansion involved recruiting individuals to site boxes in hospitals, fundraising and seeking box contents donations. Interim feedback was via user emails and social media.The wellbeing box scheme expansion demonstrates that leadership can be flexible and delivered effectively via remote means. This involved expanding the Wales project, alongside empowering others to take a vision for positive change forward UK-wide. Leadership during a pandemic can be particularly powerful when meeting needs or channelling feelings of helplessness into purpose.

A weekly planner was disseminated to the lead members of the Covid 19 team, then cascaded to the remainder of the teams with all issues identified and clear action plan outlined in a table format.The weekly Covid 19 planner was adopted by all three units and disseminated quickly after each weekly meeting. Consistency across the units meant that if staff needed to relocate due to the high sickness rate, they knew the plans in place. Patients adapted to the pandemic well with no critical incidents. There were no shortages of drugs or PPE because planning began well in advance of the Pandemic peak. Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, we had only one patient who tested positive who was rapidly identified and hospitalised. Staff felt supported and anxiety reduced due to clear plans being formulated.We learned that in highly stressful circumstances such as the Covid Pandemic, a different leadership style is required;one which is flexible, creative and more assertive.","Self, Mary C.; Mehrpooya, Neda","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-FMLM.44","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 4(Suppl 1):A16-A17, 2020.; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 4(Suppl 1):A16-A17, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16442,""
"Leading systems change through co-production with beneficiaries and champions from multiple sectors","BackgroundSocial disadvantage is associated with problems in child development and studies have found this was largely mediated by maternal mental health (Ban et. al, 2012). In Southwark, 40% of children live in poverty and 30â€“40% of GP visits were mental health related. Yet, there is a shortage of mental health support services for their population even before the surge in demand triggered by Covid-19. Given this backdrop, support for parental mental health should be more distributed in the wider society, utilising preventative community approaches for mental well-being, particularly for disadvantaged parents.Leadership interventionCombining principles of design thinking and co-production, the root causes of the problem of maternal and more broadly, parental distress, were investigated through focus group, individual interviews, clinical observations and preliminary data from primary care database. People considered to be important in the parentsâ€™ network of influence were then invited to â€˜parent championsâ€™ co-production sessions over zoom where champions were asked to co-design and co-deliver ways to better meet these needs. A total of 4 sessions were held to date with 60 champions from 13 sectors.OutputsInterventions co-produced from the multi-sector parent champions events include expanding a computer bank for the digitally deprived, developing culturally sensitive GP video briefings to address parentsâ€™ concern about Covid-19, and building a buddy system between parent champions and social prescribers.Process outcomes85% of the parent champions said they would do one thing differently to support self or other parents as as result of conversations during co-production. 60% said they feel more connected and less alone in coping with the crisis through the co-production process.Leadership learningWhen diverse and relevant people are involved in co-production, synergy happens, creating a higher point of leverage for wider impact.","Ip, Lindsay, Casey, Joseph, Edginton, Mark","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-FMLM.37","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 4(Suppl 1):A14, 2020.; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 4(Suppl 1):A14, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16443,""
"Prevalence of childhood mental disorders in high-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis to inform policymaking","QUESTION: Mental disorders typically start in childhood and persist, causing high individual and collective burdens. To inform policymaking to address children's mental health in high-income countries we aimed to identify updated data on disorder prevalence. METHODS: We identified epidemiological studies reporting mental disorder prevalence in representative samples of children aged 18 years or younger-including a range of disorders and ages and assessing impairment (searching January 1990 through February 2021). We extracted associated service-use data where studies assessed this. We conducted meta-analyses using a random effects logistic model (using R metafor package). FINDINGS: Fourteen studies in 11 countries met inclusion criteria, published from 2003 to 2020 with a pooled sample of 61 545 children aged 4-18 years, including eight reporting service use. (All data were collected pre-COVID-19.) Overall prevalence of any childhood mental disorder was 12.7% (95% CI 10.1% to 15.9%;I2=99.1%). Significant heterogeneity pertained to diagnostic measurement and study location. Anxiety (5.2%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity (3.7%), oppositional defiant (3.3%), substance use (2.3%), conduct (1.3%) and depressive (1.3%) disorders were the most common. Among children with mental disorders, only 44.2% (95% CI 37.6% to 50.9%) received any services for these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: An estimated one in eight children have mental disorders at any given time, causing symptoms and impairment, therefore requiring treatment. Yet even in high-income countries, most children with mental disorders are not receiving services for these conditions. We discuss the implications, particularly the need to substantially increase public investments in effective interventions. We also discuss the policy urgency, given the emerging increases in childhood mental health problems since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (PROSPERO CRD42020157262).","Barican, J.

"Heterogeneity in the association between youth unemployment and mental health later in life: a quantile regression analysis of longitudinal data from English schoolchildren","ObjectivesAn association between youth unemployment and poorer mental health later in life has been found in several countries. Little is known about whether this association is consistent across individuals or differs in strength. We adopt a quantile regression approach to explore heterogeneity in the association between youth unemployment and later mental health along the mental health distribution.DesignProspective longitudinal cohort of secondary schoolchildren in England followed from age 13/14 in 2004 to age 25 in 2015.SettingEngland, UK.Participants7707 participants interviewed at age 25.Primary and secondary outcome measures12-Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) Likert score, a measure of minor psychiatric morbidity.ResultsYouth unemployment was related to worse mental health at age 25. The association was several times stronger at deciles of GHQ representing the poorest levels of mental health. This association was only partly attenuated when adjusting for confounding variables and for current employment status. In fully adjusted models not including current employment status, marginal effects at the 50th percentile were 0.73 (95% CI -0.05 to 1.54, b=0.11) points, while marginal effects at the 90th percentile were 3.76 (95% CI 1.82 to 5.83;b=0.58) points. The results were robust to different combinations of control variables.ConclusionsThere is heterogeneity in the longitudinal association between youth unemployment and mental health, with associations more pronounced at higher levels of psychological ill health. Youth unemployment may signal clinically relevant future psychological problems among some individuals.","Wright, Liam, Head, Jenny, Jivraj, Stephen","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047997","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(7), 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(7), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16445,""
"Frailty differences across population characteristics associated with health inequality: a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA)","ObjectiveTo evaluate the pattern of frailty across several of social stratifiers associated with health inequalities.Design, setting and participantsCross-sectional baseline data on 51 338 community-living women and men aged 45â€“85 years from the population-based Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (collected from September 2011 to May 2015) were used in this study.Primary outcomes and measuresA Frailty Index (FI) was constructed using self-reported chronic conditions, psychological function and cognitive status and physical functioning variables. Social stratifiers were chosen based on the Pan-Canadian Health Inequalities Reporting Initiative, reflecting key health inequalities in Canada. Unadjusted and adjusted FIs and domain-specific FIs (based on chronic conditions, physical function, psychological/cognitive deficits) were examined across population strata.ResultsThe overall mean FI was 0.13Â±0.08. It increased with age and was higher in women than men. Higher mean FIs were found among study participants with low income (0.20Â±0.10), who did not complete secondary education (0.17Â±0.09) or had low perceived social standing (0.18Â±0.10). Values did not differ by Canadian province of residence or urban/rural status. After simultaneously adjusting for population characteristics and other covariates, income explained the most heterogeneity in frailty, especially in younger age groups;similar patterns were found for men and women. The average frailty for people aged 45â€“54 in the lowest income group was greater than that for those aged 75â€“85 years. The heterogeneity in the FI among income groups was greatest for the psychological/cognitive domain.ConclusionsOur results suggest that especially in the younger age groups, psychological/cognitive deficits are most highly associated with both overall frailty levels and the gradient in frailty associated with income. If this is predictive of later increases in the other two domains (and overall frailty), it raises the question whether targeting mental health factors earlier in life might be an effective approach to mitigating frailty.","Griffith, Lauren E.; Raina, Parminder, Kanters, David, Hogan, David, Patterson, Christopher, Papaioannou, Alexandra, Richardson, Julie, Gilsing, Anne, Thompson, Mary, van den Heuvel, Edwin","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047945","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(7), 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(7), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16446,""
"The cost of harvesting process in teak community forest during the covid-19","This pandemic also affected the amount of costs incurred from the teak harvesting process. Based on previous research, we tried to compare the costs arising from teak harvesting during the pandemic. On the other hand, Cost analysis of community teak harvesting aims to analyse the costs incurred by the community at each harvesting process, starting at the felling, skidding, to transportation stages, both in self-managed systems and in wholesale systems. Data were collected through observation and interviews which were then analysed using quantitative descriptive analysis by calculating the costs for each harvesting process. Machine costs are obtained by adding up fixed costs and variable costs incurred, while operating costs are obtained by adding up machine costs with operator and helper wages. The results showed that the total cost for felling group I was IDR 53,837.17 per m3 with an average cutting ability of 0.72 m3 per hour. Meanwhile, the total cost for felling group II was IDR 40,361.69 per m3 with an average cutting capacity of 0.87 m3 per hour. Loggersâ€™ costs of harvesting forests during the pandemic do not differ significantly from the costs incurred by loggers before the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gautama, I.; Mujetahid, A.; Dalya, N.; Faradiba, A.

"Patient and staff survey on use of tablets and developing video communication information governance guidance","The Coronavirus pandemic limited patient visitors to Barnet General Hospital for infection control reasons. Consequently, families were unable to visit their loved ones in their final days. This was having detrimental effects on patient physical and mental health and family experience.We conducted a Quality Improvement Project where we surveyed patients, families, and hospital staff about the use of video communication. We surveyed staff regarding their confidence of facilitating video communication before and after a guideline was produced. We then asked families, patients and staff whether they found video communications useful.We found that 71% of healthcare staff surveyed have used tablets provided on the wards to communicate with patientâ€™s relatives. 99% of respondents would use tablets again and 71% expressed no concerns about their use. 77% of staff were unaware of guidelines regarding use of video technology. In response to this we created an information sheet which was distributed trust wide. Subsequently 97% of staff were aware of the guidelines, this also improved staff confidence in facilitating video calls from 55% to 90%. We found that 96% of staff, relatives and patients were all very likely to recommend video communication for further use. With 97.4% of all respondents recommending this service to continue beyond coronavirus times.Our project showed outstanding results and video communication is now well established in the hospital for all patients. Due to the positive results received in this project our trust received funding for a further 100 digital devises.","Lunat, Raees, Miah, Lukon, Yahya Abu, Seido, Elmi, Abdul","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-FMLM.117","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 4(Suppl 1):A44, 2020.; Publication details: BMJ Leader; 4(Suppl 1):A44, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16450,""

"Polysubstance use trends and variability among individuals with opioid use disorder in rural versus urban settings","Rural areas of the United States have been disproportionately impacted by the opioid epidemic, exacerbated by COVID-19-related economic upheavals. While polysubstance use is an important determinant of overdose risk, variability in polysubstance use as a result of numerous factors (e.g., access, preference) has yet to be described, particularly among rural persons with opioid use disorder (PWOUD). Survey data on past-month use of prescription and illicit opioids and 12 non-opioid psychoactive drug classes were analyzed from a national sample of rural (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3872) and urban (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯8153) residents entering treatment for OUD from 2012 to 2019. Trend analyses for opioid and stimulant use were compared between rural and urban PWOUD. Latent class analyses assessed substance use trends through identified typologies of rural/urban PWOUD, which then underwent comparative analyses. By 2019, prescription opioid use remained greater in rural versus urban PWOUD, and methamphetamine use showed greater growth in rural, compared to urban areas. Latent class analyses identified variability in polysubstance use, with five identical subgroups in rural/urban PWOD: high polysubstance, polyprescription, prescription opioid-focused, prescription opioid-focused with polysubstance use, and illicit opioid-focused. Polyprescription was highest in rural areas, with illicit opioid-focused use highest in urban areas. Demographic characteristics, co-morbid conditions and healthcare coverage were all associated with between-group differences. There is significant variability in polysubstance use that may identify specific prevention and treatment needs for subpopulations of OUD patients: interventions focused on reducing opioid prescriptions, early engagement with mental health resources, wider distribution of naloxone, and screening/treatment plans that take into account the use of multiple substances.","Ellis, Kasper, Cicero","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106729","20210722","Opioid use disorder; Polysubstance use; Rural","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16452,""
"Moral distress in frontline healthcare workers in the initial epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States: Relationship to PTSD symptoms, burnout, and psychosocial functioning","Little is known about the relationship between moral distress and mental health problems. We examined moral distress in 2579 frontline healthcare workers (FHCWs) caring for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients during the height of the spring 2020 pandemic surge in New York City. The goals of the study were to identify common dimensions of COVID-19 moral distress; and to examine the relationship between moral distress, and positive screen for COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, burnout, and work and interpersonal functional difficulties. Data were collected in spring 2020, through an anonymous survey delivered to a purposively-selected sample of 6026 FHCWs at Mount Sinai Hospital; 2579 endorsed treating COVID-19 patients and provided complete survey responses. Physicians, house staff, nurses, physician assistants, social workers, chaplains, and clinical dietitians comprised the sample. The majority of the sample (52.7%-87.8%) endorsed moral distress. Factor analyses revealed three dimensions of COVID-19 moral distress: negative impact on family, fear of infecting others, and work-related concerns. All three factors were significantly associated with severity and positive screen for COVID-19-related PTSD symptoms, burnout, and work and interpersonal difficulties. Relative importance analyses revealed that concerns about work competencies and personal relationships were most strongly related to all outcomes. Moral distress is prevalent in FHCWs and includes family-, infection-, and work-related concerns. Prevention and treatment efforts to address moral distress during the acute phase of potentially morally injurious events may help mitigate risk for PTSD, burnout, and functional difficulties.","Norman, Feingold, Kaye-Kauderer, Kaplan, Hurtado, Kachadourian, Feder, Murrough, Charney, Southwick, Ripp, Peccoralo, Pietrzak","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23205","20210722","COVID-19; PTSD; burnout; functioning; mental health; moral distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16453,""
"Rapid Onset of Functional Tic-Like Behaviours in Young Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Clinicians have reported an increase in functional tic-like behaviours in children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe adults developing rapid onset of functional tic-like behaviours between May 2020 and June 2021. Data were analysed from the Adult Tic Disorders Registry, a single-site,12-month prospective cohort study which began enrolment in January 2021. We compared clinical features of participants with Tourette Syndrome or Persistent Motor/Vocal Tic Disorder to participants with Rapid Onset Tic-Like Behaviours. 33 participants registered between January and June of 2021; 9 had Rapid Onset Tic-Like Behaviours, and 24 had Tourette syndrome or Persistent Motor Tic Disorder. Participants with Rapid Onset Tic-Like Behaviours were younger (19.9 vs 38.6, p=0.003), had older age of onset (15.3 vs 10.1, p=0.0009), and were more likely female (p&lt;0.0001). They had higher motor and vocal tic severity and impairment scores (all p&lt;0.01) and were more likely to have complex arm/hand motor tics (p&lt;0.0001) complex vocal tics (p&lt;0.0001) and coprolalia (p=0.004). They had significantly higher scores on all mental health symptom self-report measures (all p&lt;0.05) and were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with depression (p=0.03). The clinical features which help differentiate rapid onset tic-like behaviours from Tourette syndrome or Persistent Motor Tic Disorder include their phenomenology, onset age and clinical course. Rapid onset tic-like behaviours are a distinct subtype of functional neurological disorder which has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic in young people and appears strongly socially influenced.","Pringsheim, Martino","https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.15034","20210722","COVID-19 pandemic; Functional Neurological Disorders; Tourette syndrome; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16454,""
"Emotional intelligence training as a protective factor for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a major challenge to mental health and emotional wellbeing. The present study examined whether training in emotional intelligence (EI) skills, provided before the pandemic, would serve as a protective factor for sustaining mental health during the COVID-19 crisis. Data came from a longitudinal study (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°89) that was initially designed to test the effectiveness of an EI training program versus a non-emotion-focused placebo program. The design and timing of the study were such that baseline and posttraining assessments of depression and anxiety had been completed before the pandemic, and planned 6-month follow-ups were serendipitously scheduled to occur after the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. This provided us with an unexpected real-world opportunity to investigate whether EI training would bolster emotional resilience to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although mental health concerns generally increased after the start of the pandemic, individuals who completed the EI training program scored lower on depression, suicidal ideation, and state anxiety relative to individuals who had been assigned to the placebo training program. Online EI training appears to be effective at sustaining critical aspects of mental health during a subsequent real-life crisis.","Persich, Smith, Cloonan, Woods-Lubbert, Strong, Killgore","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23202","20210722","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; emotional intelligence; emotional intelligence training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16455,""
"""All of this was awful:"" Exploring the experience of nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in the United States","Little research documents the experience of nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in the United States. This article explores the experience of nurses providing direct care to COVID-19 patients to understand the working conditions and emotional impact of working in this pandemic on nurses. Data were gathered through an online survey distributed via snowball sampling in July 2020. The survey included an open-ended question asking nurses to describe a personal experience providing care to a COVID-19 patient. Researchers analyzed 118 responses using content analysis. The experience of nurses providing care to patients with COVID-19 was summarized into six themes: (1) feeling overwhelmed with the quantity of work (33.1%), (2) patient death (30.5%), (3) helplessness (23.7%), (4) absence of patient family presence and need for additional support (22.9%), (5) personal protective equipment (PPE) concerns regarding safety and how PPE can impair the nursing role (20.3%), and (6) lack of preparedness for the pandemic (16.9%). These findings suggest working directly with COVID-19 patients is a significant psychological strain on nurses. Adequate personal and institutional support for nurses is needed to prevent and treat mental distress from working under these conditions.","Kellogg, Schierberl Scherr, Ayotte","https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12633","20210722","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; United States; content analysis; nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16456,""

"The impact of COVID-19 related restrictions on social and daily activities of parents, people with disabilities and older adults: Protocol for a longitudinal, mixed-methods study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to wide-scale changes in societal organization. This has dramatically altered people's daily activities, especially among families with young children, those living with disabilities such as spinal cord injury (SCI), those who have experienced a stroke, and older adults. We aim to 1) investigate how COVID restrictions influence daily activities 2) track the psychosocial effects of these restrictions over time; and 3) identify strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of these restrictions. Objective: We aim to 1) investigate how COVID restrictions influence daily activities 2) track the psychosocial effects of these restrictions over time; and 3) identify strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of these restrictions. Methods: This was a longitudinal concurrent mixed-methods study in British Columbia, Canada. Data collection occurred at four time points, between April 2020 and February 2021. The first three data collection time points occurred within phases 1-3 of the Province of British Columbia Restart Plan. The final data collection coincided with the initial distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines. At each time point, participants' socio-demographics, depressive and anxiety symptoms, resilience, boredom, social support, instrumental activities of daily living, and social-media and technology use were collected in an online survey. These data supplemented qualitative videoconference interviews exploring participants' COVID-19 related experiences. Participants were also asked to upload photos representing their experience during the restriction period, which facilitated discussion during the final interview. Five groups of participants were recruited: 1) families with children under the age of 18, 2) adults who have a spinal cord injury (SCI), 3) experienced a stroke or 4) other types of disabilities, and 5) older adults (&gt;64 years) with no self-reported disability. The total sample size was 81. The number of participants we could recruit from each group was limited, which may impact the validity of some sub-group analyses. Results: This study was approved by the University of British Columbia Behavioural Research Ethics Board (Approval #: H20-01109) on 2020-04-17. Eighty-one participants were enrolled in this study and data are being analyzed.

"Schools on the front lines: School based health centers amidst COVID-19","School based health centers (SBHCs) are often at the front line of medical and mental health services for students in the schools they serve. Citywide school closures in New York City in March 2020 and ongoing social distancing procedures resulted in significant changes in SBHC services as well as access to these services. Furthermore, the combination of COVID-19 related stressors and the increased likelihood of adverse childhood events experienced by urban youth creates conditions for the exacerbation of mental health concerns among youth in metropolitan areas. The following article will explore the role of SBHCs as community agents focused on prevention and reduction of mental health concerns prior and during the current pandemic, as well as existing health disparities experienced by urban youth populations. The authors will also discuss research examining mental health concerns already present in global populations affected by COVID-19 as it may foreshadow the challenges to be faced by U.S. urban youth. Lastly, the authors describe recommendations, practice implications, and opportunities for preventative strategies and therapeutic interventions in school based health settings.

"Parental identity as a resource for parental adaptation during the COVID-19 lockdown","The lockdown measures that were taken to contain the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 caused many parents to stay at home with their children. This unusual situation created both risks and opportunities for families. In the present study, we examined the role of parental identity as a resource for parental adaptation during this challenging period, thereby considering both parenthood experiences and parents' general mental health while also taking into account the cumulative risk to which parents were exposed (e.g., single parenthood). Furthermore, to shed light on the mechanisms behind the effects of parental identity, this study addressed the mediating role of parental satisfaction of their basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. During the lockdown period in Belgium, 492 parents (88% mothers, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 44 years, 63.7% in intact family, 31.2% with a university degree) completed online questionnaires on parental identity, need-based experiences, positive and negative parenthood experiences, and mental health. Several weeks earlier, these participants also rated their mental health and a variety of risks they were exposed to as part of a larger study. Results showed that a clear and self-endorsed parental identity was related to better parental adaptation, with parental need satisfaction playing a mediating role in these associations. Moreover, these associations remained significant after controlling for the prior levels of parental mental health and for cumulative risk. Overall, findings suggest that parental identity serves as a source of resilience in an uncertain period such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

"Delayed educational services during Covid-19 and their relationships with the mental health of individuals with disabilities","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, individuals with disabilities (IWD), like many others, have not been able to benefit effectively from educational and school-based mental health services, which are vital to achieving mental good health. This study aimed to collect views of IWD about how their mental health was affected by the school closure during Covid-19. Thirty-one IWD were interviewed and data were analyzed thematically. Findings indicated that the educational delay, combined with the pressure of the preventive measures against Covid-19 was associated with (i) difficulties in emotional well-being, structured routines, learning, and socialization, (ii) enhanced feelings of isolation and pain, and (iii) negative perceptions of academic-self-efficacy and therapy-related outcomes.

"COVID-19: Fear and Anxiety among Healthcare Workers in Saudi Arabia A Cross-Sectional Study","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious respiratory disease. It poses a serious threat to healthcare workers which may cause substantial degree of psychological distress. This study aimed to evaluate the level of fear and anxiety among healthcare workers. A cross sectional study was designed to collect data from healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia using an online questionnaire. A non-probability convenient sampling technique was used to collect the data from 1st August to 10th August 2020 with the exclusion of non-healthcare worker and general public. A 5-point Likert scale was used to evaluate the level of fear and anxiety. The data was analyzed by using Spss version 23 .The descriptive data were represented as frequencies and percentage. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to control the confounding factors and assess the relationship between variables. Data analyzed 737 participants revealed that 10.7%, 73.5%, and 15.7% of HCWs had a mild, moderate, and severe degree of fear and anxiety respectively. The multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that gender and specialty of the participants were significantly associated with moderate and severe anxiety level. This study demonstrates that two-third of the healthcare workers had a moderate risk of fear and anxiety. However, females participants found to have elevated fear and anxiety level. Social distancing has a major impact on social well-being therefore its important to address social support through a policy.

"Racial Differences in Generalized Anxiety Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic among Brazilian University Students: a National Survey","There is evidence that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in anxiety and depression rates among college students. However, little is known about how generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) developed among individuals of different race/skin color. This study aimed to determine whether there are racial differences in GAD in Brazilian university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a nationwide cross-sectional study, carried out through the application of online questionnaires to university students from 94 Brazilian universities. Self-reported data on age, sex, economic class, race/skin color, anthropometric data, and adherence to social distancing measures were collected. To determine the GAD, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale was applied. A total of 5879 participants were included, with a mean age of 24.1 Ã‚Â± 6.4 years, and the majority were female (n = 4324, 73.5%), most self-declared to be whites (n = 2945, 50.1%), followed by browns (n = 2185, 37.2%) and blacks (n = 749, 12.7%). The prevalence of GAD among black Brazilian university students (47.3% [95% CI 43.7, 50.8]) was significantly higher than that of browns (38.6% [95% CI 36.6, 40.7]) and whites (44.1% [95% CI 42.3, 45.9]), even after multivariable adjustment by other sociodemographic factors. The findings of the present study suggest a possible racial difference in GAD among Brazilian university students, in which those who declared their race/skin color as black showed a greater risk for GAD than those who declared themselves as white or brown.","da Silva JÃƒÂºnior, de Lima Macena, de Oliveira, Praxedes, de Oliveira MaranhÃƒÂ£o Pureza, Bueno","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01107-3","20210722","Ethnicity; GAD-7; Mental health; Race; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16463,""
"Creativity and Leisure During COVID-19: Examining the Relationship Between Leisure Activities, Motivations, and Psychological Well-Being","Social distancing policies have been implemented around the world to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These measures have included temporary restrictions on mass gatherings and the closure of public facilities, limiting the pursuit of leisure activities such as travel while allowing more time for at-home pursuits, including creative activities such as gardening and painting. Previous research has demonstrated the benefits of physical activity for psychological well-being during COVID-19, but less attention has been given to the potential benefits of creative pursuits, such as arts and music. The present study investigated changes in the pursuit of creative, non-creative, and physical leisure activities and the relationship between engaging in leisure, the motivations for and barriers to pursuing these activities, and psychological well-being during COVID-19. A total of 3,827 participants from 74 countries completed an online leisure activities questionnaire and the World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index. Logistic regression indicated that gender, age, social distancing adherence, and employment status significantly predicted leisure engagement during COVID-19. Compared to sports and outdoor pursuits, participation in creative activities was generally more likely to increase during this period, while participation in non-creative activities was less likely to increase. Multiple linear regression indicated that maintaining or increasing time on leisure activities significantly predicted well-being during COVID-19, with increased time spent on home crafts and artisanship, fine arts, musical and performing arts engagement, sports and outdoor pursuits, niche and IT interests, and language activities each predicting higher well-being outcomes. Motivations such as seeking creative expression and mental stimulation, keeping fit, and maintaining social connections also predicted higher well-being. These findings suggest that participation in both physical and creative leisure activities may offer protective benefits for well-being during COVID-19, and that strategies to promote engagement in creative activities should also be considered in future guidance for mental health during periods of lockdown or isolation.","Morse, Fine, Friedlander","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.609967","20210723","COVID-19; RIASEC; creativity; hobbies; leisure activities; leisure disengagement; leisure motivations; psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","",16464,""

The sample was randomly selected from the primary schools in Denizli, Turkey. Denizli is a large city and the total population is around one-million. The study was conducted online. The caregivers responded to a sociodemographic and daily life during pandemic questionnaire and psychological symptoms screening form (which evaluated whether the children had any newly developed symptoms after the start of the COVID-19 outbreak) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). One-thousand-seven-hundred-ninety-seven people were included in the study. Data was collected between 3 July and 31 August 2020. Symptoms such as anhedonia, gets angry easily, fidgets around, sleeping problems, impulsivity, appetite problems, restlessness or nervousness, and feels sad can be seen more frequently than other symptoms in children. Caregivers' PSS scores were higher in mothers than fathers. An association was found between the PSS scores of the caregivers and all psychological symptoms questioned in the study for children, except for encopresis. Lower education level of the father, lower family income, having a child with a psychiatric disease, impaired sibling relationship, and impaired functionality at home were risk factors for higher caregivers' PSS scores.
