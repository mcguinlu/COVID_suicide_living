"Disparities in Naltrexone Prescriptions to Medicaid Enrollees During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic strained healthcare facilities and the isolation and uncertainty associated with the pandemic compromised mental health around the world. The pandemic has also been associated with an exacerbation of the opioid crisis in the United States (US), and previous studies have reported changing trends in opioid misuse during the pandemic. Our study investigated naltrexone, a prescription drug used to treat alcohol and opioid use disorders by blocking opioid receptors to reduce cravings. We sought to investigate the changes in naltrexone prescriptions issued to Medicaid enrollees in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The total number of naltrexone, generic and brand name, prescriptions across the US were obtained from the Medicaid.gov database, expressed as prescriptions per state corrected for the number of enrollees, and organized into two time periods - the pre-pandemic period from January 2019 to December 2019 and the pandemic period from January 2020 to March 2021. Statistical analyses included a paired t-test, a heat map to depict state level variation, and waterfall figures. Procedures were approved by the IRB of Geisinger. Results: There were increases in total naltrexone prescriptions throughout the time frame studied, but a decrease in prescriptions per 100,000 Medicaid enrollees. A paired t-test revealed a significant decrease in naltrexone prescriptions during the pandemic period. There was a 398-fold difference between the highest and lowest states in 2019 Quarter 1 and 424-fold in 2021 Quarter 1. Percent change calculations indicated South Dakota (+141%) and Oregon (+172%) showed a significant increase in total naltrexone 3 prescriptions from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic from the national mean (- 23.57%+5.60%). Conclusions: The results of this study were significant and indicated a relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and declining naltrexone prescription rates. Naltrexone prescriptions per 100,000 enrollees decreased in most states during the pandemic and fell by over 32% nationally from 2019 to 2021 despite a slight increase in total prescription numbers and an increase in Medicaid enrollees. These data suggest wide variation in access to substance use disorder treatment during the pandemic. Further research with privately insured patients may be beneficial.","Hemmy A Subervi; Lysine E Varghese; Brian J Piper","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.05.22280706","20221007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38810,""
"Changes in Social, Economic, and Health Risk Factors Across the Lifespan during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Latent Transition Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic led to unique, pervasive, and changing global impacts. It is imperative to characterize groups of individuals based on modifiable factors, and to describe how groups have been impacted by the continuing pandemic in the United States to promote health and well-being and to inform preventive interventions. We used latent transition analysis to identify subgroups of modifiable psychosocial, economic, and health risk factors;to explore subgroup shifts across time;and to assess the prevalence of non-modifiable factors associated with subgroup membership. We recruited 450 participants 18 years and older living in the United States to complete a longitudinal survey exploring health during the pandemic. Participants completed three waves of data collection from April to November 2020. We used latent transition analysis to identify statuses, shifts in prevalence over three waves, and the relationships of non-modifiable covariates with each status. Five statuses were identified: high risk together, low risk together, high risk alone, low risk alone, and financial risk together. Statuses were relatively stable over time;the majority (60%â€“66%) of participants were in statuses categorized by multiple indicators of high modifiable risk, and the largest transitions were to lower risk subgroups. Increasing age, being male, and living in an urban area were the only non-modifiable covariates associated with status membership. It is imperative to continue to scale up targeted interventions aimed at promoting resilience, well-being, financial well-being, delays in healthcare use, food insecurity, and depression among individuals in higher-risk subgroups to promote health and well-being.","Jackson, Alexandra, Weaver, Raven H.; Weybright, Elizabeth, Lanigan, Jane, Parker, Louise, Iniguez, Anaderi, Decker, Autumn","https://doi.org/10.1177/26320770221096839","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Prevention and Health Promotion;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38811,""
"Evaluating interventions to promote the psychological wellbeing of critical care patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: It is well known that a proportion of patients who survive an ICU admission suffer ongoing physical, psychological and cognitive disability referred to as Post Intensive Care Syndrome.1 There is also evidence of increased frequency of anxiety, depression, and PTSD amongst survivors of ICU admission with ARDS,2 as such it is likely that those admitted with COVID-19 may suffer similarly. There are several factors specific to the COVID-19 pandemic which are likely to exacerbate the effects of an ICU admission on the psychological wellbeing of survivors. These include lack of family visiting, staff wearing PPE, and frequent media content related to pandemic/healthcare. There is little evidence to guide what we can do as ICU staff to promote psychological wellbeing. Objectives: To evaluate the relative benefits of three interventions trialled for ICU inpatients to help psychological recovery: â€¢ Trips to an outside space -The Garden â€¢ Facilitated video calls with family/friends â€¢ Inpatient psychology sessions Methods: We contacted individuals who survived an ICU admission for level 2 or 3 care having been treated for COVID-19 during March-May 2020. A total of 13 ICU survivors were successfully contacted after being identified from ICU follow up clinic.We collected qualitative data via questionnaires completed over the telephone facilitated by a member of ICU staff. Results: 8/13 people had a video call with family or friends whilst in ICU and 5 of these identified that a video call was the most helpful of the three interventions for their psychological recovery (Chart 1). Survivors emphasised the joy of being able to see the faces of loved ones but also reported issues with signal and staff availability making it hard to plan video calls. 7/8 patients who had a trip to the garden would recommend this to others. People highlighted positives including feeling fresh air and sunshine, and the change of scenery/ getting away from the ICU. Many people identified being put off a garden trip by the preparation involved and 4/8 people identified feelings of guilt about the amount of staff time required to facilitate a trip to the garden. Only 4 people remember having review by a member of the psychology team whilst an inpatient but 3/4 found this helped their recovery by helping them understand and explain their experiences. People who did not have access to psychology as an inpatient were asked if they thought they would have benefited from this experience. The majority said do not know because of concerns that they would have been too unwell to engage. Conclusions: In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic we are likely to see lasting impacts on the psychological wellbeing of ICU survivors. Further evidence is needed to evaluate the costs and benefits of measures to promote psychological wellbeing within ICU. However, this project suggests that there are simple interventions with minimal cost implications which can be easily implemented by ICUs to support the psychological recovery of their patients: video calls and trips to an outside space.","Smedley, C.; Sainsbury, H.; Cheater, L.","https://doi.org/10.1177/17511437221095122","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the Intensive Care Society; 23(1):186-187, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38812,""
"The Politics of Prevention: Polarization in How Workplace COVID-19 Safety Practices Shaped the Well-Being of Frontline Service Sector Workers","The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically reshaped the labor market, especially for service sector workers. Frontline service sector workers, already coping with precarious working conditions, faced proximate risks of COVID-19 transmission on the job and navigated new workplace safety measures, including masking, social distancing, and staying home while sick, all in a polarized political environment. We examine polarization in the effects of COVID-19 workplace safety measures on workersâ€™ feelings of safety and well-being. Specifically, we examine how support for former President Trump moderates the relationship between COVID-19 safety practices (masking, social distancing, staying home while sick) and workersâ€™ feelings of safety and well-being. To do so, we draw on novel data collected by The Shift Project from 2,039 service sector workers at 89 large firms during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that workplace safety measures are positively associated with workersâ€™ self-assessments of feeling safe and with mental health, but only for Biden voters.","Woods, Tyler, Schneider, Daniel, Harknett, Kristen","https://doi.org/10.1177/07308884221125821","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Work and Occupations;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38813,""
"The macroeconomic effect of COVID-induced economic policy uncertainty in Nigeria: aÂ DSGE approach","Purpose This study examined the macroeconomic effects of COVID-19-induced economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in Nigeria. The study considered the effects of three related shocks: EPU, COVID-19 and correlated economic policy uncertainty and COVID-19 shock. Design/methodology/approach First, the study presented VAR evidence that fiscal and monetary policy uncertainty depresses real output. Thereafter, a nonlinear DSGE model with second-moment fiscal and monetary policy shocks was solved using the third-order Taylor approximation method. Findings The authors found that EPU shock is negligible and expansionary. By contrast, COVID-19 shocks have strong contractionary effects on the economy. The combined shocks capturing the COVID-19-induced EPU shock were ultimately recessionary after an initial expansionary effect. The implication is that the COVID-19 pandemic-induced EPU adversely impacted macroeconomic outcomes in Nigeria in a non-trivial manner. Practical implications The result shows the importance of policies to cushion the effect of uncertain fiscal and monetary policy path in the aftermath of COVID-19. Originality/value The originality of the paper lies in examining the impact of COVID-19 induced EPU in the context of a developing economy using the DSGE methodology.","Adeiza, Adams, Oye, Queen Esther, Alege, Philip O.","https://doi.org/10.1108/ajems-04-2022-0154","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: African Journal of Economic and Management Studies;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38814,""
"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and physical health of children attending a paediatric weight management clinic","Background: Obesity is a global health problem. Given the widespread disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to assess its effect in children with chronic health conditions. This study assesses the health of obese paediatric patients enrolled in a weight management programme at a tertiary care hospital before the COVID-19 pandemic and then one year after the onset of the pandemic. Methodology: The researchers conducted a retrospective chart review of patients aged two to 17 years enrolled in a paediatric weight management clinic. They compared mental health outcomes (new referrals to psychology, social work, eating disorder programme, incidence of eating dysregulation, suicidal ideation or self-harm) and physical health outcomes (anthropometric measures) before the pandemic and then one year after the start of the pandemic. Results: Among the 334 children seen during either period, the number of psychology referrals (12.4% vs. 26.5%;p=0.002) and the composite mental health score (17.2% vs. 30.2%;p=0.005) increased during the pandemic compared to before. In a subgroup of children (n=30) for whom anthropometric measures were known in both time periods, the rate of decrease in body mass index z-score was lower (-1.5 [2.00] vs -0.3 [0.73]/year;p=0.002) and adiposity higher (-0.8 [4.64] vs 2.7 [5.54] %/year;p=0.043) during the pandemic. Overview: The pandemic affected the mental and physical health of obese children enrolled in a weight management clinic. The study shows a negative effect on mental health and less improvement in anthropometric measures, but future research, when patients return to clinic care, will examine our results in light of new objective measures.","Nsamenang, S.

"Participatory Research with Care Leavers to Explore their Support Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has perpetuated the challenges faced by care leavers and increased the need for support. Online participatory research was conducted to explore care leavers' support experiences during the pandemic. A research team of twenty-five care leavers aged sixteen to twenty-five years and support workers from six local authorities across England identified priorities and developed an online questionnaire that was completed by ninety-four care leavers aged seventeen to twenty-six years. The research team also participated in focus groups, reflected on findings and agreed recommendations. The findings focused on four overarching themes: finances and practical issues, mental health, social connection, and support from services. The recommendations suggest that corporate parent services should provide information, offer equal opportunity to access support, facilitate connection for care leavers, and proactively reach out and ensure someone is always there for them. So that support is responsive to their needs, the continued participation of care leavers in decisions that affect them is paramount, along with commitment by the government and corporate parent services to listen and take action. By using a participatory approach that involved care leavers in the research process, this research promotes their voices and strengthens the evidence for enhancing care leaver support during the pandemic and beyond.","Dadswell, A.; O'Brien, N.","https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bcac001","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Journal of Social Work; 52(6):3639-3657, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38816,""

"Melamine-derived N-rich C-entrapped Au nanoparticles for sensitive and selective monitoring of dopamine in blood samples","Several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and restless leg syndrome, majorly result from disruption in the dopamine (DA) level. Thus, useful information about the treatment and prevention of various genetic majorly mental health problems can be obtained through precise and real-time monitoring of DA. Herein, we report the fabrication of novel N-rich carbon-coated Au nanoparticles (NC@Au-NPs) by deriving from melamine-crosslinked citrate-stabilized Au NPs. NC@Au-NPs offer fast electro-oxidation efficacy towards DA, because of strong electrostatic attraction between negatively charged NC@Au-NPs and positively charged DA. The catalytic efficacy and shelf life of the designed system were further boosted by applying a mixture of polydopamine (PDA) and benzimidazolium-1-acetate ionic liquid (IL) as a sandwich between the working electrode surface (graphitic pencil electrode: GPE) and the designed nanohybrid NC@Au-NPs as a redox mediator. The results indicate that the designed novel NC@Au/PDA-IL/GPE exhibits excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility over a wide linear range (50-1000 nm) and a low detection limit of 0.002 mu M +/- 0.001 as well. The developed sensor was successfully applied to monitor DA in the blood of COVID-19 quarantined patients and pharmaceutical samples with high accuracy, thus suggesting a powerful tool for the diagnosis of mental problems.","Shakeel, F.; Fazal, M.

"Prevalence of burnout among health care workers during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis study was to estimate the pooled prevalence of burnout among health care workers (HCWs), who worked in health centers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Questionnaire. A comprehensive search based on specific terms was performed through the online studies of Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest, until January 2022. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tool. Data analysis was carried out through the random-effects model, and the heterogeneity was investigated by I-2 statistic using the software STATA Version 16. In total, seven articles with 5,022 participants were included in the final analysis. Four studies with 4,419 participants reported the prevalence of burnout as percent in moderate and severe types for all three components of burnout syndrome. Our results showed that the 45% of pooled moderate and 37% of severe levels of emotional exhaustion, 49% of pooled moderate and 18% of severe levels of depersonalization, 38% of pooled moderate and 51% of pooled severe levels of reduced personal accomplishment. Whereas six studies with 4,838 sample size reported the mean prevalence of MBI-based burnout syndrome and the mean pooled prevalence of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and accomplishment was 21.57, 7.47, and 33.48, respectively. Based on our findings, HCWs who worked in health centers during COVID-19 outbreak, experienced significant burnout. Therefore, it is necessary to design and implement programs to deal with burnout among this populations. Public Significance Statement What is the public health significance of this article? This study suggests that health care workers (HCWs) who worked in health centers during the outbreak of COVID-19 and were in direct and/or indirect contact with COVID-19 patients experienced significant burnout. Burnout among HCWs is an important issue because it not only has an impact on their quality of life, but it can potentially affect the quality of care provided, increase medical errors, reduce patient safety, and even the influence on the mental health of their families and society. Therefore, it is necessary to design and implement programs to deal with burnout among this populations.","Parandeh, Akram, Ashtari, Sara, Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid, Gohari-Moghadam, Keivan, Vahedian-Azimi, Amir","https://doi.org/10.1037/pro0000483","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Professional Psychology: Research and Practice;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38819,""
"Does COVID-19 threat relate to intergroup attitudes? A test in the UK","Social and evolutionary psychologists propose that humans have acquired an evolutionary mechanism that facilitates pathogen avoidance behavior: the behavioral immune system (BIS). Previous studies have revealed that the BIS yields negative attitudes toward out-group members. Given the clear relevance of pathogen-avoidance psychology to individuals' reactions to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the present research examined whether attitudes toward potentially pathogenic outgroups during the pandemic would reflect the BIS. Using large-scale panel data (N = 1,548) collected in May 2020 in 3 of the U.K.'s devolved nations (England, Scotland, and Wales), we examined whether perceived COVID-19 threat was associated with negative attitudes toward 2 different national out-groups linked to the initial outbreak (Italy and China), as well as the in-group (the U.K.). Failing to support the BIS hypothesis, mini-meta-analyses on results from the 3 nations revealed that COVID-19 threat was only very weakly associated with attitude toward the U.K., Italy, and China. Results suggest that implications from pathogen psychology might be more limited than previously thought and apply only to specific out-group members.","Imada, Hirotaka, Lalot, Fanny, Abrams, Dominic","https://doi.org/10.1037/ebs0000311","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38820,""
"Introduction: Journaling and Mental Health during COVID-19: Insights from the Pandemic Journaling Project","In this article, we introduce the SSM-MH Special Issue â€œJournaling and Mental Health during COVID-19: Insights from the Pandemic Journaling Project,â€ which presents findings from the Pandemic Journaling Project (PJP). PJP is an online journaling platform and mixed-methods research study created in May 2020 to provide ordinary people around the world an opportunity to chronicle the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in their livesâ€”for themselves and for posterity. The essays in this collection demonstrate how journaling via an online platform can help illuminate experiences of mental wellbeing and distress, with important implications for both research and clinical practice. We begin by introducing the Pandemic Journaling Project and describing our procedures for generating the data subsets analyzed in the papers collected here. We then outline the principal interventions of the special issue as a whole, introduce the papers, and identify a number of cross-cutting themes and broader contributions. Finally, we point toward key questions for future research and therapeutic practice by highlighting the three-fold value of online journaling as a research method, a therapeutic strategy, and a tool for advancing social justice. We focus in particular on how this innovative methodological approach holds promise as both a modality for psychotherapeutic intervention and a form of grassroots collaborative ethnography. We suggest that our methods create new opportunities for confronting the impact of pandemics and other large-scale events that generate radical social change and affect population-level mental health.","Wurtz, Heather M.; Willen, Sarah S.; Mason, Katherine A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100141","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100141, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38821,""
"Psychosocial wellbeing of healthcare workers during COVID-19","During the present COVID-19 pandemic healthcare workers are confronted with multiple stressors. At the beginning of the pandemic these stressors mainly related to health and safety issues. In the course of the pandemic societal stressors became more salient. These include lacking credibility of important stakeholders (leadership, organization and policy) as well as lacking appreciation from society and policy. Both, stressors referring to safety related issues, as well as stressors referring to trust or morally related issues have negative impact on psychosocial wellbeing in terms of distress, anxiety, burnout, depression and moral injury. To mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on healthcare workers and to enhance the resilience and psychosocial well-being of healthcare workers, psychosocial support is important to be delivered on different levels. RÃ©sumÃ© Pendant la pandÃ©mie actuelle COVID-19, les personnels de santÃ© ont Ã©tÃ© confrontÃ©s Ã  de multiples facteurs de stress.

"Changes in Utilization and Access to Care for Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction : Children and youth with specials healthcare needs (CYSHCN) are vulnerable to healthcare disruption and policies were adopted to mitigate COVID-19 related disruptions. We compare CYSHCN utilization of and access to care in 2019 to 2020. Methods : Using the National Survey of Children's Health we identified CYSHCN and assessed for differences in healthcare utilization, unmet health care needs, frustrations accessing care, and barriers to care using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results : The final sample included 17,065 CYSHCN. In the fully adjusted analysis, there was a significant decrease in odds of accessing preventative dental care (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]:0.63, 95%CI:0.51-0.77) and increased odds of unmet mental health care needs (AOR:1.34, 95%CI:1.02â€“1.77). Inability to obtain an appointment was a barrier that increased during the study period (AOR: 2.77, 95%CI:1.71-4.46).

"Role of Psychologist in Adolescent Medicine: An International Perspective","Adolescent Medicine addresses the health care of adolescents, young adults, and their families. Adolescent psychology constitutes an important part. The COVID-19 pandemic has given insight into adolescent needs, bringing the focus on prevention rather than mere correction. One needs to factor in the unique aspects of adolescence, their need to impress peers and gain acceptance, and their unique information processing, not calculating trade-offs between risk and reward the way adults might, in a linear, rational, logical, and verbal manner. The article focuses on the need for collaborative training among the various stakeholders in Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","Bhave, Sovani, Shah","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcl.2022.05.001","20221007","Adolescent help-seeking; Adolescent mental health; Adolescent psychology; Adolscent Counseling; Integrated behavioural health, focus on adolescent disorders, distress, development, need for team work; Psychological assessment and interventions with adolescents; life skills and positive psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38824,""
"Assessing the impact of COVID-19 measures on COPD management and patients: a simulation-based decision support tool for COPD services in the UK","To develop a computer-based decision support tool (DST) for key decision makers to safely explore the impact on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) care of service changes driven by restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The DST is powered by discrete event simulation which captures the entire patient pathway. To estimate the number of COPD admissions under different scenario settings, a regression model was developed and embedded into the tool. The tool can generate a wide range of patient-related and service-related outputs. Thus, the likely impact of possible changes (eg, COVID-19 restrictions and pandemic scenarios) on patients with COPD and care can be estimated. COPD services (including outpatient and inpatient departments) at a major provider in central London. Four different scenarios (reflecting the UK government's Plan A, Plan B and Plan C in addition to a benchmark scenario) were run for 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year. 856, 616 and 484 face-to-face appointments (among 1226 clinic visits) are expected in Plans A, B and C, respectively. Clinic visit quality in Plan A is found to be marginally better than in Plans B and C. Under coronavirus restrictions, lung function tests decreased more than 80% in Plan C as compared with Plan A. Fewer COPD exacerbation-related admissions were seen (284.1 Plan C vs 395.1 in the benchmark) associated with stricter restrictions. Although the results indicate that fewer quality-adjusted life years (in terms of COPD management) would be lost during more severe restrictions, the wider impact on physical and mental health must also be established. This DST will enable COPD services to examine how the latest developments in care delivery and management might impact their service during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the event of future pandemics.","Yakutcan, Hurst, Lebcir, Demir","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062305","20221007","COVID-19; chronic airways disease; health policy; respiratory infections; respiratory medicine (see thoracic medicine)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38825,""
"The ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on endometriosis patients: A survey of 1,089 UK patients","The impact of Covid-19 on endometriosis patients is under-researched. Endometriosis has significant psychosocial effects on patients. Moreover, the mainstay of diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis is elective surgery, impacted as a result of healthcare strain. To better understand the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on endometriosis patients. An online survey sent to adult UK endometriosis patients between 27th August and 15th September 2021. The study received HRA and HCRW research ethic committee approval. Effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on endometriosis symptoms and surgery. We received 1,089 survey responses. Respondents had a median age of 34, and 82.0% of respondents were white British. 18.8% of respondents reported a previous positive Covid-19 PCR test. 84.6% of patients had been double vaccinated at time of response. 20 patients reported Covid-related hospital admission, with 1 requiring intubation. Large numbers of patients (31.4-55.2%) reported worsening of endometriosis symptoms during the pandemic. 69.2% of respondents reported worsening of associated mental health symptoms. Whilst 44% of respondents had elective endometriosis surgery planned, the majority of operations were disrupted, and 18.7% of total respondents did not have a new surgery date. More research and support are needed for endometriosis patients as they wait longer for surgery. A holistic approach, encompassing mental health needs, may be particularly beneficial for patients. This is the first survey examining the effects of Covid-19 on endometriosis patients including data beyond January 2021.","Spencer, Mezquita, Shakir","https://doi.org/10.52054/FVVO.14.3.037","20221007","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38826,""
"Long-acting Injectable Antipsychotics during the COVID-19 pandemic in schizophrenia: An observational study in a real-world clinical setting","The COVID-19 pandemic is having an important impact on the practice of mental health services and on schizophrenia patients, and heterogeneous and conflicting findings are being reported on the reduction of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics use. Aims of the study were to assess the total number of patients treated with LAI, the start of novel LAI and the discontinuation of LAI treatments, analyzing register data of the first year of the pandemic, 2020, compared to a pre-pandemic reference year, 2019. Data from two outpatient centers were retrieved, for a total of 236 participants in 2020: no significant differences were observed comparing 2020 and 2019 when considering the total number of patients on LAI treatment (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.890) and the number of dropouts (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.262); however, a significant reduction in the start of LAI was observed (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.022). In 2020, second generation LAI were more prescribed than first generation LAI (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.040) while no difference was observed in 2019 (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.191).

"Association between lifestyle choices and mental health among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Mental health is recognized as a critical component of public health Given the close relationship between mental health and life style and the importance of students as valuable human resources, the present study aimed at determining the relationship between life style and mental health among medical students in Sousse during COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study in university students from the first to the fifth grade of the Faculty of Medicine of Sousse during the academic year 2020/2021. Data were collected anonymously via an online questionnaire published on the Facebook groups of each grade, on december 2020. The online survey consisted of three sections. The first one aimed to collect sociodemographic information. The second section of the survey addressed recent lifestyle choices and the third one assessed psychological distress using the French version of 12 items of The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The significance level was considered 0.05. Overall 147 were studied. Using the bimodal scoring, the total score was between 0 and 12, to evoke psychiatric disorders, we set the threshold of 4. For our sample, the median scale was 7 [4-9], and more than half of the students (68%; n = 100) had a score higher than 4. Psychiatric disorder was significantly more frequent in female students (73.3% vs 42.3%; p = 0.002). Higher GHQ-scale was found in younger students, foreigners, students who need more than 30 minutes to get to the faculty, unemployed students, and students of fifth grade. However, differences were not statistically significant. Regarding lifestyle choices, we found that physical inactivity, no smoking habits, no alcohol use, no illicit substance use, other substance use, changing in eating habits, and absence of coping methods of stress were higher in students with psychiatric disorders. However, this association was statistically significant only for physical activity (p = 0.016). The results of the regression analysis suggest female gender as an independent predictor of high GHQ-12 scores. Practicing physical activity was found as protective factor for psychiatric disorders. Considering the vital role of medical students in providing and promoting community health, the need for more detailed planning and interventions to improve their life style and mental health is essential.","Ghali, Ghammem, Baccouche, Hamrouni, Jedidi, Smaali, Earbi, Hajji, Kastalli, Khalifa, Maagli, Romdhani, Halleb, Jdidi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274525","20221007","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38828,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the development of burnout syndrome in healthcare providers: prevalence and predictive factors","In Tunisia, the pandemic is still ongoing, resulting in the burnout of healthcare providers. This study aimed to assess the impact of the management of COVID-19 patients on the physical and mental health of healthcare providers, and to identify the independent and predictive variables for the three components of severe burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and lack of personal accomplishment at work. It was a cross-sectional survey. Data were collected between February 8, and April 11, 2021. Healthcare providers, who were positive for COVID, completed the questionnaire. The primary endpoint was to assess the degree of burnout in healthcare providers by adopting the original version of the severe Maslach Burnout Inventory: emotional exhaustion (Ã¢â€°Â¥30), depersonalization (Ã¢â€°Â¥12), and lack of personal accomplishment at work (Ã¢â€°Â¤ 33). A descriptive analysis followed by a bi- and multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent and predictive factors for each component of burnout. 700 healthcare providers were audited. Emotional exhaustion was Ã¢â€°Â¥ 30 in 86%, depersonalization was Ã¢â€°Â¥ 12 in 61%, and lack of personal accomplishment at work was Ã¢â€°Â¤ 33 in 69%. Of the 700 healthcare providers, 93% were working at the same time in the COVID units, 85% had not received compensatory rest. Healthcare provider who had been infected by COVID-19 was the only independent predictive variable of severe emotional exhaustion and severe depersonalization. Healthcare provider who had been infected by COVID-19 and did not have a compensatory rest were two independent predictive variables of severe lack of personal accomplishment at work. Healthcare provider who had been infected by COVID-19 was the only predictive variable of severe emotional exhaustion and severe depersonalization.

"Trends of Pandemic Parenting in Medical Academia","The pandemic has been difficult on physicians, with two fifths of doctors in one survey reporting that their mental health is now worse than before the pandemic. It is likely that a significant proportion of these physicians are parents of children necessitating childcare, as approximately 32% of the US workforce has someone in their household under the age of 14. We sought to study the impact of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on physician parents in academia. Our goal was to investigate the intersection of professional and personal challenges, as well as perceived impact on domestic life and professional development secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Survey Monkey, we developed a 37-question survey to address the aim of this study. Questions were grouped into four categories: demographics; impact on childcare; impact on care; and impact on mental health/wellness. Most of the questions were multiple choice with a few fill-in-the-blank options to allow participants to provide additional information related to their experiences as physicians during the pandemic. A link to the survey was disseminated via email to physicians at our home institution, Rush University Medical Center (Chicago), via our own intra- and interdepartmental communications, We used private social media accounts such as Facebook physician groups to reach out to physicians at other academic medical centers. Survey responses were voluntary and collected anonymously over an eight-week period, without identifiable data. Inclusion criteria included any physician identifying themselves as working full or full or part time in an academic facility in the US and caregivers for children &lt;18 years. Survey respondents were mostly female (83.2%), practicing in the Midwest (61.2%), and ranked as assistant professor (59.5%). The majority of respondents had two children (65.1%) who were &lt;11 years in age (85.6%). Most respondents worked full time with 72.8% working over 50% clinically. Childcare was disrupted for 171 of 232 respondents (73.7%); 62.9% struggled with balancing work with childcare; 81.9% worried often or very often about fulfilling their responsibilities. A vast majority, 210 of 232 respondents (90.5%) had some degree of concern about feeling overburdened by their roles. More than half (57.3%) worried that their professional advancement was impacted by the pandemic, and 53.9% considered making adjustments to their clinical workload/. Over half (51.6%) thought that increased domestic responsibilities impacted their professional advancement. In the survey, which was completed primarily by early-career women physicians practicing in a variety of specialties and geographic regions, we noted that childcare disruption amidst the pandemic was extremely prevalent. The majority of respondents reported full-time equivalent work; thus, it is reasonable to assume that significant workloads and limitations in remote work in combination with childcare constraints resulted in significant burden. A large number felt the challenges were negatively impacting their professional development and felt overburdened by their various roles.","Shah, Holmes, Husain, Davenport, Dugan, Ansari","https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2022.6.54144","20221007","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38830,""
"Nurses' recovery experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Isfahan, Iran: a qualitative study","To explore and describe the recovery experiences of nurses working in COVID-19 wards. The global outbreak of coronavirus in 2020 has extracted job stress for nurses. Job stress has impacts on physical and mental health and performance, so recovery is essential to restore the lost energy resources. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 nurses in Isfahan city of Iran. The research results were extracted as 5 main themes, 14 subthemes and 54 items. The main themes are detachment from work, relaxation, non-work activities, affiliation, and meaning. The combination of these themes led to the clear statement that using recovery experiences is a major step toward relieving the nurses' COVID-19-related stress and their physical and mental resuscitation. The use of recovery experiences, including detachment from work, relaxation, non-work activities, affiliation, and meaning by nurses helps them cope with job stressors and regain their resources. It is the responsibility of health system policy makers, hospital managers and nurse managers to design and implement training programs for nurses to use recovery experiences as stress management techniques in their profession.","Hosseinzadeh, Khorasgani, Gheitani, Ebrahimzadeh, Torkashvand","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13863","20221007","COVID-19; Nurses; Phenomenology; Recovery experiences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38831,""
"Transitioning to Telehealth: The Multifaceted Impact of a Midcareer Transition in Practice","The medical education continuum is interrupted by several transition periods that can adversely affect performance. Most of what has been learned about such periods focuses upon movement from one stage of training to another and movement from training to practice. Established physicians, however, experience transitions throughout their careers at idiosyncratic times and with little assistance. Better understanding how physicians experience transition, where they struggle and how they adapt, would enable better support to be provided. We investigated the COVID-19-forced transition in clinical practice to virtual care, particularly its effect on physician roles and the ways that established physicians faced challenges they encountered when transitioning to virtual care. Ten semistructured interviews were conducted between November 2020 and February 2021 with physicians across different specialties and practice contexts who transitioned their practice to virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interview data were analyzed iteratively using ""generic qualitative methodology"" with constant comparison to identify themes in relation to observations. The transition to telehealth had implications that extended beyond the patient encounter, appearing to affect all aspects of the physician's practice. To reflect that, CanMEDS was chosen as a useful organizing framework. The effects, captured in the theme ""changes to the physician's roles,"" were nuanced, illustrated a consistent need to adapt to context, and could be framed positively or negatively or both. Additionally identified themes were labeled ""physicians' mental health"" and ""strategies to mitigate challenges."" These themes highlighted that, despite the effort involved and novelty of the situation, all participants found remarkably similar ways of grappling with the challenges faced. While the basic roles of the physician do not appear to have changed through the transition to telehealth, our findings indicated that these roles were redefined in fundamental ways in response to changing societal needs.","Stoynova, Eva","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000005007","20221007","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38832,""
"Developing an equitable intervention approach for communities of color: mental health and co-occurring physical health concerns in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated disparities in mental health treatment for people of color in the USA. Meeting the needs of those most burdened by this disparity will require swift and tactical action in partnership with these communities. The purpose of this paper is to describe how a community-based participatory research approach was employed to assess the priorities and needs of four communities of color (African immigrant, Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, and Pacific Islander) in a major U.S. city. A brief quantitative survey devised jointly by community leaders and the research team was deployed to community members (N = 59) in the fall of 2020. The most endorsed mental health issues across the communities were excessive worry (51%) and stress regarding COVID-19, racism, and immigration policies (49%). The most endorsed physical health concerns included sleep difficulties (44%), headaches, and backaches (each 39%). Physical symptoms predicted the endorsement of a mental health issue above and beyond COVID-19-related hardships, multiplying the odds of reporting an issue by 1.73 per physical health concern endorsed. Based on these findings, the community-research team conceptualized and proposed an evidence-based, effectiveness-implementation hybrid type-2 intervention approach for chronic worry and daily stress. This paper highlights detail on how the community-research team arrived at the proposed multilevel intervention that addresses community-stated barriers to mental health treatment (e.g., preferring trusted health workers to deliver emotional health treatments) and considers the burden of the additional stressful context of COVID-19. Diverse community members and university researchers collaborated on the development of an equitable intervention approach for community membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mental health needs.","Gutierrez Chavez, Kaur, Baucom, Sanchez-Birkhead, Sunada, Mukundente, Tavake-Pasi, Napia, Villalta, Asnaani","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibac033","20221007","Community-based research; Health disparities; Health equity; Mental health; Physical health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38833,""
"The impact of mindfulness practice on physician burnout: A scoping review","Physician burnout is a growing phenomenon in current health systems worldwide. With the emergence of COVID-19, burnout in healthcare is progressively becoming a serious concern. Increasing emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment threaten the effective delivery of healthcare. Compassion fatigue and moral injury are a considerable risk to the doctor-patient relationship. These issues can potentially be mitigated by mindfulness practice, which has shown promising results in reducing burnout, restoring compassion, and preventing moral injury in physicians. A scoping review was conducted to investigate the effects of mindfulness practice on physician burnout. High-ranking journals were targeted to analyze high-quality studies and synthesize common themes in the literature. Studies conducted on current practicing physicians were included. Mindfulness practice of varying forms was the main intervention studied. Gray literature and studies conducted only on allied health personnel were excluded from this review. 31 studies were included in this scoping review. Mindfulness practice decreased emotional exhaustion and depersonalization while improving mood, responses to stress, and vigor. Self-awareness, compassion, and empathy were also increased in study participants. From this review, four themes emerged: innovations in mindfulness practice, mindfulness and positive psychology, the impact of mindfulness on work and patient care, and barriers and facilitators to physician mindfulness practice. Mindfulness was widely reported to benefit mental health and well-being, but the studies reviewed seemed to adopt a mono focus and omitted key considerations to healthcare leadership, systems-level culture, and practices. Mindfulness practice is a quintessential component of positive psychology and is inherently linked to effective leadership. A mindful and compassionate physician leader will play a crucial role in addressing current practice gaps, prioritizing staff mental health, and providing a supportive platform for innovation.","Malik, Annabi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.956651","20221007","COVID-19; burnout; compassion fatigue; healthcare leadership; mindfulness practice; moral injury; organizational culture; physician","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38834,""
"Women's groups and COVID-19: An evidence review on savings groups in Africa","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and some of the associated policy responses have resulted in significant gendered impacts that may reverse recent progress in gender equality, including in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper presents emerging evidence from studies in diverse contexts in sub-Saharan Africa -with a deep dive into Nigeria and Uganda-on how COVID-19 has affected women's groups, especially savings groups, and how these groups have helped mitigate the gendered effects of the pandemic's and the associated policy responses' consequences up until April 2021.Ã‚Â The synthesis presents evidence that savings groups found ways to continue operating, provided leadership opportunities for women during the pandemic, and mitigated some of the negative economic consequences of COVID-19 on individual savings group members. Savings, credit, and group support from other members all likely contributed to the ability of groups to positively affect the resilience of women's group member during COVID-19. Households with a female member in a savings group in Nigeria and Uganda have coped with the crisis better than those not in savings groups. While savings groups have shown the potential for resilience during the pandemic, they often faced financial challenges because of decreased savings, which sometimes resulted in the depletion of group assets. Savings groups also contributed to community responses and provided women a platform for leadership. These findings are consistent with a recent evidence synthesis on how past covariate shocks affected women's groups and their members. We conclude the paper by presenting various policy recommendations to enable savings groups to achieve improvements in women's empowerment and economic outcomes, and research recommendations to address some of the current evidence gaps on how COVID-19 is affecting women's groups and their members.","Adegbite, Anderson, Chidiac, Dirisu, Grzeslo, Hakspiel, Holla, Janoch, Jafa, Jayaram, Majara, Mulyampiti, Namisango, Noble, Onyishi, Panetta, Siwach, Sulaiman, Walcott, Desai, de Hoop","https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13550.1","20221007","Africa; COVID-19; Gender Equality; Nigeria; Resilience; Gender; WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Empowerment; Savings Groups; Uganda; Women's Groups","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38835,""
"Bipolar I Disorder Exacerbation Following COVID-19 Vaccination","We present the cases of a 60-year-old female patient and 40-year-old male patient who experienced exacerbations of previously well-controlled symptoms of bipolar I disorder (BD1) after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, despite being stable for years on the same medications. The first patient experienced worsened depression, mania, and psychosis that improved with an increase in risperidone. The second patient experienced depression, mania, psychosis, and suicidal ideation that resulted in hospitalization. Prior to hospitalization, he took lamotrigine and bupropion, the latter of which was changed to aripiprazole in hospital. We reviewed current literature on inflammation in mental disorders, vaccination-related inflammatory changes, and the type of inflammation induced by COVID-19 vaccines. Inflammation is a component of psychiatric disorders, and the inflammatory response induced by vaccines might potentiate acute mental health exacerbations, necessitating treatment changes. However, this case series should not be used to justify recommendations against vaccination without larger, well-designed studies.

Millions of lives have been lost in the COVID pandemic, and it has also severely harmed our collective mental health and cognition. The elderly population has felt that this impact the greatest as they are at the highest risk of isolation, cognitive inactivity, loneliness, and depression, all of which are risk factors for dementia. Studies associate loneliness with a 40% increase in the risk of dementia; thus, this pandemic and resulting isolation have likely caused an increase in cognition loss of the elderly. Furthermore, there is a documented bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and psychiatric illness, both of which increase the likelihood of the other and are associated with worsening mental cognition.

"The Difference in the Quality of Life of Korean Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Between Before and After COVID-19","This study aimed to compare the quality of life (QoL) of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) before and during coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and to examine how their QoL is affected by emotional and environmental factors during COVID-19. Participants in the pre-COVID-19 (n=43) and COVID-19 (n=36) groups were recruited from the same university hospital. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Child Self-report, the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), the PedsQL 4.0 Parent Proxy Report, and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) were employed. Independent t-tests, Pearson's correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were conducted. Caregivers assessed the children's QoL more negatively than the children themselves in both groups. Children with ADHD evaluated their physical function more negatively and anxiety was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group.

"Pneumomediastinum as patient self-inflicted lung injury in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19: a case series","In patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, pneumomediastinum has been increasingly reported in cases of noninvasive oxygen therapy, including high-flow nasal cannula, and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, its pathogenesis is still not understood. We report two cases of pneumomediastinum in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19. In both cases, control of spontaneous breathing with neuromuscular blocking agents resulted in resolution of pneumoperitoneum. The improvement of pneumomediastinum with control of spontaneous breathing suggested patient self-inflicted lung injury as a possible mechanism in this case series. In ARDS cases with pneumomediastinum, in addition to controlling plateau pressure with conventional lung protective ventilation, spontaneous breathing should be controlled if the patient's inspiratory effort is suspected to be strong.","Watanabe, Nakayama, Bunya, Yama, Iwamoto, Katayama, Kasai, Sawamoto, Uemura, Narimatsu","https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.796","20221007","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; case report; patient selfÃ¢â‚¬Âinflicted lung injury; pneumomediastinum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38839,""
"How does growth mindset affect mental health of high school students during the COVID-19 epidemic? The role of grit and coping strategies","The outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic continues to unfold globally, which harms the public's mental health. Adolescents' mental health is affected by social isolation and lockdown during the COVID-19 epidemic. The implicit theory of thoughts-emotion-behavior states that individuals with a growth mindset believe that thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can be changed through effort and tend to persist in pursuing higher goals and maintain enthusiasm as well as cope with stress resiliently, thus having higher gritty and levels of mental health. This study aimed to explore the role of grit and coping strategies in the influence of the growth mindset on adolescents' mental health during the COVID-19 epidemic period. A total of 1564 participants (<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 17.02, 760 boys, 804 girls) from three high schools in China were recruited to complete The Self-report Questionnaire-20, The Growth Mindset Scale, The Short Grit Scale, and The Coping Style Scale to evaluate mental health, growth mindset, grit, and positive coping strategies, respectively. The results showed that growth mindset has no significant indirect effect on mental health through grit but has a significant indirect effect on mental health through coping strategies. The results of chain mediation analysis showed that grit and coping strategies play chain mediating roles between growth mindset and adolescents' mental health. The findings suggest that cultivating a growth mindset, developing grit, and teaching adolescents to adopt positive coping strategies can improve adolescents' mental health.","Zhang, Qi, Wang, Wang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.969572","20221007","COVID-19; adolescents; cope strategies; grit; growth mindset; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38840,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and mental health in pregnant women: A review article","A rapid spreading of the COVID-19 virus in recent years had a great impact on every single aspect of live and the world faced with unexpected and unpredictable crisis in both physical and mental condition. As with any crisis, vulnerable individuals like pregnant women were the concern of societies. Several physiological and psychological changes occur during pregnancy which put individuals in a risk of mental health problems. During the outbreak of the COVID-19, pregnant women have experienced more psychological stresses, fear, anxiety, and depression. The prenatal mental distresses and psychiatric disorders may cause poor compliance, reduce help-seeking behaviors, and neglect to take the follow up screening visits and risk of harm for mother and others. Addressing the mental health in pregnant women is crucial to prevent the consequences. The purpose of this narrative review was to investigate the available literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in pregnant women and provide some recommendations to improve mental health in them. It also shed some light on providing mental health services for women during pregnancy and can be used by health professionals and policymakers.","Arzamani, Soraya, Hadi, Nooraeen, Saeidi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.949239","20221007","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38841,""

This was an explorative cross-sectional survey. The survey was distributed to 884 chiropractors through the membership databases of the Chiropractic Association of South Africa and the Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa from July 9, 2020, until August 4, 2020. The study was conducted through Google Forms and included the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests and comparatively using the Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The response rate was 17%. The chiropractor scores for depression, anxiety, and stress were within the normal range (7.35, 5.42, and 11.58, respectively). Female chiropractors under the age of 40 years old were found to be affected to a greater degree than the other participants in this study (9.87, 7.56, and 14.14).

A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted through an anonymous questionnaire on the personal websites of UniversitÃƒ Cattolica del Sacro Cuore medical students. The study included 1,166 participants, the majority of whom were experienced with child maltreatment and defensive medicine; only a small percentage was aware of the government's efforts to prevent child maltreatment and safeguard vaccination physicians. Moreover, there was no agreement on the use of telemedicine for non-serious pediatric patients or on the consequences it might have on their health. Finally, the detrimental impacts of lockdown on children's mental health are a major worry. Knowledge of these themes is mainly implemented by deepening these concepts during the undergraduate studies since a high level of knowledge on child maltreatment and on the management of COVID-19 pandemic was significantly associated with clinical years of course. Specific seminars analyzing telemedicine and legislative protections concerning minors and those concerning vaccination doctors should be included in the study plan to raise awareness these concepts.","Aulino, Beccia, Rega, Siodambro, Capece, Boccia, Lanzone, Oliva","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.968286","20221007","COVID-19; child maltreatment; child safety; medical education; medical liability; survey; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38843,""
"Benefits of an online multimodal nursing program among patients with peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis","Asymptomatic peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis (PICC-RT) is one of the most common and dangerous complications caused by peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion. A variety of factors might lead to huge psychological pressures on patients and markedly affect their quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of an online multimodal nursing program on the quality of life and psychological resilience of asymptomatic PICC-RT patients with ovarian cancer. This was a prospective cohort study on patients with asymptomatic PICC-RT. Patients in the control group received routine nursing care, while patients in the intervention group obtained extra assistance through an online multimodal nursing program. Individual guidance, psychological support, and real-time consultation were provided to patients in the intervention group. All participants were followed for 3 months. The health-related quality of life and psychological resilience of patients were evaluated by using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), respectively. Compared to baseline, most of the items in the SF-36 scores were significantly increased in both intervention and control groups after 3 months (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), except for the role emotional domain (<i>p</i> = 0.085 in control group). However, the SF-36 scores of the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group in All health domains, including physical functioning (<i>p</i> = 0.001), role physical (<i>p</i> = 0.004), bodily pain (<i>p</i> = 0.003), general health (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), vitality (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), social functioning (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), role emotional (<i>p</i> = 0.002), mental health (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and health transition (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). For CD-RISC scores, the mean value of the control group was 42.03 Ã‚Â± 4.42 at baseline and increased to 50.36 Ã‚Â± 4.70 after 3 months (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while the intervention group was 40.00 Ã‚Â± 6.61 at baseline and increased to 65.12 Ã‚Â± 5.21 after 3 months (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the CD-RISC score in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group after 3 months (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The application of an online multimodal nursing program could significantly improve the health-related quality of life and psychological resilience of asymptomatic PICC-RT patients.

"The relationship between COVID-19-related restrictions and fear of missing out, problematic smartphone use, and mental health in college students: The moderated moderation effect of resilience and social support","As one of the groups most affected by the epidemic, the mental health of college students during the epidemic is a focus of attention in multiple fields. Based on resource conservation theory, this study investigates the impact of COVID-19-related restrictions on college students' problematic smartphone use and mental health from two perspectives, students' individual factors and external environmental factors, and specifically explores the role of fear of missing out (FoMO), resilience and social support in this context. This study used a questionnaire method, and to control for common method bias, a multitemporal data collection strategy was used. The study used online questionnaire distribution, the final sample included 975 Chinese college students (497 males and 478 females), and of these, 10.3% were freshmen, 31.9% were sophomores, 31.6% were juniors, 12.3% were seniors, and 13.9% were postgraduates. The results of this study showed the following: (1) Perceived COVID-19-related strain was positively correlated with perceived FoMO, problematic smartphone use and mental health problems (depression, anxiety, stress) among college students. (2) FoMO partially mediated the relationship between perceived COVID-19-related restrictions and problematic smartphone use, and it fully mediated the relationship between perceived COVID-19-related restrictions and mental health problems.

"COVID-19-related impact on mental health and career uncertainty in student-athletes-Data from a cohort of 7,025 athletes in an elite sport high school system in Sweden","Mental health consequences and behavior change has been described in elite athletes following the vast impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world of sports. However, most study samples have been of limited size, and few studies have assessed student-athletes. This study aimed to analyze perceived mental health impact, measured as clinical degree of depression and anxiety, worry about one's sport and about one's career, and behavioral change with respect to video gaming behavior, in high-school athletes in Sweden. Data on anxiety and depression as well as on perceived behavioral changes during COVID-19 were collected from students at sports high schools in Sweden (<i>N</i> = 7,025) in February 2021, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Sixteen and 14% met criteria of moderate/severe depression and anxiety, respectively. Many respondents reported feeling mentally worse during the pandemic (66%), and were worried about the future of their sport (45%) or about their own future in sports (45%). Increased gaming behavior during COVID-19 was reported by 29%. All mental health variables were significantly more common in women, except increased gaming (more common in men). Being worried about one's career was less common in winter sports, more common in team sports and more common in older student-athletes, and associated with both depression and anxiety in regression analyses. Self-reported mental health impact of COVID-19 is substantial in student-athletes, and even more so in women and in team sports. The lower impact in winter athletes suggests a moderating effect of the seasons in which the COVID-19 outbreak occurred.","HÃƒÂ¥kansson, Moesch, KenttÃƒÂ¤","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.943402","20221007","COVID-19; adolescents; anxiety; athletes; depression; gaming disorder; pandemic; student-athletes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38846,""

The study was a prospective, observational analysis of postmenopausal women before and after the COVID-19 vaccination. The population previously answered different questionnaires, such as the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Twelve weeks after the end of the vaccine cycle, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail to evaluate if vaccination coverage could positively impact the quality of life of postmenopausal women.

"Increased alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking, and suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada","Alcohol use is a known risk factor for suicidality, yet this relationship has not been explored during the pandemic in Canada. As a growing body of evidence demonstrates the negative impact of COVID-19 on alcohol consumption and associated harms in Canada, there is a need to examine this more closely. Using the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health 2020, we compared the prevalence of suicide ideation among: (1) individuals who reported an increase in alcohol consumption vs those who reported a decrease/no change,Ã‚Â and (2) individuals who reported past month heavy episodic drinking vs those who did not. We compared overall unadjusted odds ratios and across a number of sociodemographic and mental health variables. All estimates were weighted to ensure they were nationally representative. The prevalence and likelihood of suicide ideation were significantly higher among people who reported increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic (4.9% vs 2.0%; OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.8, 3.7) and people who reported past month heavy episodic drinking (3.4% vs 2.1%; OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.3). Males and middle-aged and older-aged individuals had the highest odds ratios for increased alcohol consumption and past month heavy episodic drinking with suicide ideation. In the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant associations between suicide ideation and increased alcohol use as well as past month heavy episodic drinking across specific sociodemographic subgroups. Future research could explore these associations while adjusting for social determinants of health such as income security, employment, education, social support, stress, and mental health. RÃƒÂ©SUMÃƒÂ©: CONTEXTE: La consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool est un facteur de risque connu de suicidabilitÃƒÂ©, mais cette relation nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢a pas ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© explorÃƒÂ©e pendant la pandÃƒÂ©mie au Canada. Comme un nombre croissant de preuves dÃƒÂ©montre les rÃƒÂ©percussions nÃƒÂ©gatives de la COVID-19 sur la consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool et les mÃƒÂ©faits associÃƒÂ©s au Canada, il est nÃƒÂ©cessaire dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢examiner cette question de plus prÃƒÂ¨s. MÃƒÂ©THODES: En utilisant lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢enquÃƒÂªte de 2020 sur la COVID-19 et la santÃƒÂ© mentale, nous avons comparÃƒÂ© la prÃƒÂ©valence des idÃƒÂ©es suicidaires chez : (1) les individus qui ont dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ© une augmentation de leur consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool par rapport Ãƒ ceux qui ont dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ© une diminution ou aucun changement,Ã‚Â et (2) les individus qui ont dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ© une consommation ÃƒÂ©pisodique excessive dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool au cours du dernier mois par rapport Ãƒ ceux qui nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢en ont pas dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ©. Nous avons comparÃƒÂ© les rapports des cotes globaux non ajustÃƒÂ©s et selon un certain nombre de variables sociodÃƒÂ©mographiques et de santÃƒÂ© mentale. Toutes les estimations ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© pondÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©es afin de garantir leur reprÃƒÂ©sentativitÃƒÂ© nationale. RÃƒÂ©SULTATS: La prÃƒÂ©valence et la probabilitÃƒÂ© dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢idÃƒÂ©es suicidaires ÃƒÂ©taient considÃƒÂ©rablement plus ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©es chez les personnes ayant dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ© une consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool accrue pendant la pandÃƒÂ©mie (4,9 % contre 2,0 %; RC=2,6, IC Ãƒ 95 % : 1,8 Ãƒ 3,7) et chez les personnes ayant dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ© une consommation ÃƒÂ©pisodique excessive au cours du mois ÃƒÂ©coulÃƒÂ© (3,4 % contre 2,1 %; RC=1,7, IC Ãƒ 95 % : 1,2 Ãƒ 2,3). Les hommes, les personnes dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ¢ge moyen et les personnes ÃƒÂ¢gÃƒÂ©es prÃƒÂ©sentaient les rapports des cotes les plus ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©s pour une consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool accrue et une consommation ÃƒÂ©pisodique excessive dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool au cours du mois prÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ©dent avec des idÃƒÂ©es suicidaires. CONCLUSION: Dans la population gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale canadienne, pendant la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVID-19, il y avait des associations significatives entre les idÃƒÂ©es suicidaires et lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢augmentation de la consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool ainsi que la consommation ÃƒÂ©pisodique excessive dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool au cours du dernier mois dans des sous-groupes sociodÃƒÂ©mographiques prÃƒÂ©cis.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on opioid overdose and other adverse events in the USA and Canada: a systematic review","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted healthcare beyond COVID-19 infections. A better understanding of how COVID-19 worsened the opioid crisis has potential to inform future response efforts. To summarize changes from the COVID-19 pandemic on outcomes regarding opioid use and misuse in the USA and Canada. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL for peer-reviewed articles published between March 2020 and December 2021 that examined outcomes relevant to patients with opioid use, misuse, and opioid use disorder by comparing the period before vs after COVID-19 onset in the USA and Canada. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed methodological quality and bias via Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and synthesized results. Among 20 included studies, 13 (65%) analyzed service utilization, 6 (30%) analyzed urine drug testing results, and 2 (10%) analyzed naloxone dispensation. Opioid-related emergency medicine utilization increased in most studies (85%, 11/13) for both service calls (17% to 61%) and emergency department visits (42% to 122%). Urine drug testing positivity results increased in all studies (100%, 6/6) for fentanyl (34% to 138%), most (80%, 4/5) studies for heroin (-12% to 62%), and most (75%, 3/4) studies for oxycodone (0% to 44%). Naloxone dispensation was unchanged and decreased in one study each. Significant increases in surrogate measures of the opioid crisis coincided with the onset of COVID-19. These findings serve as a call to action to redouble prevention, treatment, and harm reduction efforts for the opioid crisis as the pandemic evolves.

"PhD Students' experiences and emotions in neoliberal tourism academia","Situated within the emerging social science literature contesting the diffusion of neoliberal ideologies into academia, this study explores the effects of neoliberalism (in the face of Covid-19 as well) on doctoral students. It employs a qualitative arts-based approach amalgamating aspects of autoethnography, ethnography, ethnodrama, and qualitative interviews to co-construct empirical material on Ph.D. students' experiences and emotions. In general, the discussions with the doctoral students portray a rather hostile tourism academy, characterized by unhealthy levels of competition, questionable supervisory practices, and quantitative measurements of output that discourage intellectual engagement and creativity. As such, tourism doctoral students often experience negative emotional experiences, such as fear and anxiety, which in some instances also lead to high levels of stress and depression. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of the effects of neoliberalism on tourism academia by unveiling the multiple power structures tourism doctoral students have to face throughout their Ph.D. journeys.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmp.2022.101022","20221001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-08","",38850,""
