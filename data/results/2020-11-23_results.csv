The risk of dying from COVID-19 increases with age and is often associated with pre-existing health conditions. Globally, more than 50Â million-in Austria currently approximately 140,000 people-suffer from dementia. The co-occurrence of dementia as aÂ ""pandemic of old age"" together with the COVID-19 pandemic has aÂ double impact on persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The COVID-19 pandemic poses major challenges for individuals with dementia and their caregivers: (1)Â People with dementia have limited access to information on COVID-19, may have difficulties with protective measures such as wearing masks and in remembering safety regulations. (2)Â People with dementia live alone or with their family, or are institutionalized. To reduce the chance of infection among older people in nursing homes, Austrian local authorities have banned visitors to nursing homes and long-term care facilities and implemented strict social-distancing measures. As aÂ result, older people lost face-to-face contact with their family members, became isolated and social activities stopped. Consequently, anxiety, stress and serious concerns about infections among staff in nursing homes increased and they developed signs of exhaustion and burnout during the full lockdown of the facilities. Thus, due to the emerging COVID-19 crisis, the Austrian Alzheimer Association (Ã–sterreichische Alzheimer Gesellschaft, Ã–AG) and international societies developed recommendations to support people living with dementia and their caregivers on various issues of physical and mental health.","Defrancesco, Michaela; Bancher, Christian; Dal-Bianco, Peter; Hinterhuber, Hartmann; Schmidt, Reinhold; Struhal, Walter; Ransmayr, Gerhard; StÃ¶gmann, Elisabeth; Marksteiner, Josef","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40211-020-00363-9","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Neuropsychiatr;2020 Oct 29.; Publication details: Neuropsychiatr;2020 Oct 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7353,""
"Depression, Anxiety, and Acute Stress Disorder Among Patients Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Prospective Cohort Study","BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of psychiatric symptoms among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: This article sought to identify the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and acute stress disorder among hospitalized patients with coronavirus diseaseÂ 2019. METHODS: Adult patients recently admitted to nonintensive care unit medical ward settings with coronavirus disease 2019 were eligible for enrollment. Enrolled patients were screened for depression, anxiety, and delirium. Subsequently, patients were followed up by phone after 2 weeks and rescreened for depression, anxiety, and acute stress disorder symptoms. Subjects' medical records were abstracted for clinical data. RESULTS: A total of 58 subjects were enrolled; of whom, 44 completed the study. Initially, 36% of subjects had elevated anxiety symptoms and 29% had elevated depression symptoms. At 2-week follow-up, 9% had elevated anxiety symptoms, 20% had elevated depression symptoms, and 25% had mild-to-moderate acute stress disorder symptoms. Discharge to home was not associated with improvement in psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety. While anxiety improved after index admission, depression remained fairly stable. Furthermore, a significant minority of patients experienced acute stress disorder symptoms, though these were largely mild to moderate.","Parker, Catherine; Shalev, Daniel; Hsu, Ian; Shenoy, Akhil; Cheung, Stephanie; Nash, Sara; Wiener, Ilona; Fedoronko, David; Allen, Nicole; Shapiro, Peter A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.10.001","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychosomatics;2020 Oct 10.; Publication details: Psychosomatics;2020 Oct 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7354,""
"Determination of stress, depression and burnout levels of front-line nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic","All healthcare professionals, especially nurses, are affected psychosocially due to reasons such as uncertainty and work intensity experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this descriptive study, it was aimed to determine the stress, depression and burnout levels of front-line nurses. Data were obtained from 705 nurses who worked at hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic between May and July 2020, using a Personal Information Form, the Perceived Stress Scale, Beck Depression Inventory and Maslach Burnout Inventory. The data collection tools were sent online to nurse managers, requesting front-line nurses to answer the forms and scales. The nurses were mostly women and had bachelor's degrees, single and worked as nurses for between 1 and 10Ã‚Â years. They had high levels of stress and burnout and moderate depression. Those who were younger and had fewer years of work experience felt inadequate about nursing care and had higher levels of stress and burnout. More burnout was detected in nurses who had a positive COVID-19 test and did not want to work voluntarily during the pandemic. The authors suggest that preventive and promotive interventions in mental health should be planned and implemented to improve the mental health and maintain the well-being of front-line nurses during the pandemic, and to prepare nurses who may work during pandemics in the future.","Murat, KÃƒÂ¶se, SavaÃ…Å¸er","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12818","20201122","COVID-19; depression; mental health; nurses; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7355,""

"Stress-Buffering Role of Social Support during COVID-19","In order to reduce the high infection rate of COVID-19, individuals began to engage in self-isolation amid a time of uncertainty and worry. Given that social support can be protective against the negative effects of distress on mental and physical health, the lack of support may negatively impact individuals during their self-isolation. Thus, the current study examined the role of self-isolation on feelings of stress, the perception and reception of social support, and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 405 college students were asked to report on the amount of self-isolation in which they were engaging, worry about COVID-19, psychological health, and received and perceived social support. Results indicated that when the length of time in self-isolation was taken into account, perceived social support buffered the connection between worry about COVID-19 and psychological health. These results indicate that social support, worry about COVID-19, and self-isolation may influence individuals' psychological health during times of stress. Con el fin de disminuir el alto ÃƒÂ­ndice de contagio de la COVID-19, las personas comenzaron a autoaislarse en medio de un momento de incertidumbre y preocupaciÃƒÂ³n. Teniendo en cuenta que el apoyo social puede ser protector contra los efectos negativos del distrÃƒÂ©s en la salud mental y fÃƒÂ­sica, la falta de apoyo puede afectar negativamente a las personas durante su autoaislamiento. Por lo tanto, el presente estudio analizÃƒÂ³ el papel que desempeÃƒÂ±a el autoaislamiento en los sentimientos de estrÃƒÂ©s, la percepciÃƒÂ³n y la recepciÃƒÂ³n de apoyo social y los problemas de salud mental durante la pandemia de la COVID-19. Se solicitÃƒÂ³ a una muestra de 405 estudiantes universitarios que informen sobre la cantidad de autoaislamiento que estaban haciendo, las preocupaciones acerca de la COVID-19, la salud psicolÃƒÂ³gica y el apoyo social recibido y percibido. Los resultados indicaron que cuando se tuvo en cuenta el periodo de tiempo en autoaislamiento, el apoyo social percibido amortiguÃƒÂ³ la conexiÃƒÂ³n entre la preocupaciÃƒÂ³n acerca de la COVID-19 y la salud psicolÃƒÂ³gica. Estos resultados indican que el apoyo social, la preocupaciÃƒÂ³n acerca de la COVID-19 y el autoaislamiento pueden influir en la salud psicolÃƒÂ³gica de las personas durante momentos de estrÃƒÂ©s.

"COVID-19 and children with cancer: Parents' experiences, anxieties and support needs","Children with cancer were designated as clinically extremely vulnerable if they were to contract SARS-CoV-2 due to immune suppression in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim was to explore experiences, information and support needs, and decision making of parents with a child with cancer in response to this phase in the United Kingdom. Parents of a child with cancer completed a survey at a time when the UK moved into a period of 'lockdown'. An online survey was developed by the research team to capture parents' experiences, information and support needs, and decision making, using closed statements and open text boxes. Descriptive quantitative analyses and qualitative thematic content analysis were undertaken. One hundred seventy-one parents/caregivers completed the survey. Eighty-five percent were worried about the virus and they were vigilant about the virus (92%) or cancer symptoms (93.4%). For two-thirds (69.6%), hospital was no longer considered a safe place. Eight overarching themes were identified related to the virus: (a) risk of infection; (b) information, guidance and advice; (c) health care provision; (d) fears and anxieties; or related to lockdown/isolation: (e) psychological and social impact; (f) keeping safe under lockdown; (g) provisions and dependence; and (h) employment and income. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to report experiences of parents of a child with cancer during the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of parents were worried about SARS-CoV-2 and transmitting the virus to their child. Hospital was no longer perceived to be a safe place, and parents were worried about suboptimal cancer care. Parents described fear and anxiety and the psychological, social and economic impact of isolation.","Darlington, Morgan, Wagland, Sodergren, Culliford, Gamble, Phillips","https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.28790","20201121","COVID-19; cancer; child; mental health; parents; well-being; worries","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7364,""

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a major physical and psychological burden on nursing staff in the United States and worldwide. A better understanding of these conditions will lead to tailored support and resources for nursing staff during and after the pandemic. Cross-sectional study. Hospital nurses and nursing assistants (N=587) were recruited online between May-June, 2020.The survey included measures on insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index) fatigue and intershift recovery (Occupational Fatigue and Exhaustion Recovery-15), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey), post-traumatic stress (Short Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Rating Interview) and psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), and questions on work and demographics. The STROBE checklist was followed for reporting. The sample had subthreshold insomnia, moderate-to-high chronic fatigue, high acute fatigue, and low-to-moderate intershift recovery. The sample experienced increased emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, increased personal accomplishment, moderate psychological distress, and high post-traumatic stress. Nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients had significantly scored worse on almost all measures than their coworkers. Certain factors like working hours per week and the frequency of 30-minute breaks were significant. Nursing staff experienced poor sleep, fatigue, and multiple psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, staff who were involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, worked more than 40 hours per week and skipped 30-minute breaks showed generally worse self-reported outcomes. Nursing administration is recommended to monitor for fatigue and distress on nursing units, re-visit current scheduling practices, reinforce rest breaks, and provide access to mental-health and sleep wellness resources with additional support for their frontline nursing groups.","Sagherian, Steege, Cobb, Cho","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15566","20201121","COVID-19; PTSD; burnout; distress; fatigue; insomnia; nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7365,""

"Assessment of mental health, knowledge, and attitude of patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in response to 2019 novel coronavirus","With the recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients for their compromised immune system have been in significant concern. Awareness and attitude about this virus have an important impact on infection prevention and coping with stress and anxiety. So we conducted this study to assess knowledge, attitude, and mental health status in MS and NMOSD patients within the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, the link of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and a self-administered structured questionnaire were sent through social media to MS and NMOSD patients and two control groups consisting of healthy and migraine individuals. A total of 223 MS patients, 41 NMOSD, 29 migraine, and 245 healthy subjects participated in this study. MS patients had higher total DASS scores compared to healthy participants (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.012). There were no significant differences among the study groups regarding knowledge and attitude. In MS patients, physical comorbidity was associated with a total score of attitude (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.53, 2.66, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004). We did not find association between other demographic and clinical variables with DASS scores, attitude, and knowledge in MS patients. The current data highlight the necessity of attitude, knowledge, and mental health assessment among MS and NMOSD patients.

"Mental Health, Sense of Coherence, and Interpersonal Violence during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Germany","Preliminary data indicates that the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) pandemic may have a substantial impact on mental health and well-being. We assessed mental health in response to the lockdown in Germany between 1 April 2020 and 15 April 2020 using a cross-sectional online survey (<i>n</i> = 3545) with a mixed-methods approach. We found increased levels of psychosocial distress (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) stress module), anxiety, depressive symptoms (PHQ-4), irritability, and a decrease in overall well-being (WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5)), sense of coherence (Short Form of the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-L9)), sexual contentment, and sleep quality. The four-week-prevalence of interpersonal violence was yet at 5% and included verbal, physical, and sexual violence. Participants reported finding comfort in family, friends, conversation, exercise, and activity. Findings are also in line with research showing that women seem to have more trouble coping with the pandemic and lockdown measures. Our observations demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures lead to a mental health burden even in a highly developed Western country and should, therefore, be taken seriously. The findings for interpersonal violence are alarming. Thus, we should sharpen our focus on the matter and activate and enhance supporting systems to help protect those affected.","Jung, Kneer, KrÃƒÂ¼ger","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9113708","20201121","COVID-19; coronavirus; depression; interpersonal violence; lockdown; mental health; sense of coherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7368,""
"Psychological Distress in Patients with Autoimmune Arthritis during the COVID-19 Induced Lockdown in Italy","Lockdowns imposed by governments worldwide as a way to limit the spread of severe atypical respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) have had heavy psychological and economic consequences. Arthritis patients are a vulnerable population at an increased risk of peritraumatic stress. This could be due to several reasons, including the fear of shortage of medicine and difficulty receiving periodical medical checks. In the present case-control study, psychological distress in patients with autoimmune arthritis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were investigated. An electronic survey was conducted to gather information on the perceived change in the emotional state, general health (GH), fatigue, joint pain, and disease activity during the lockdown, in 100 patients with autoimmune arthritis and 100 controls. Mental health status was measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) was used to assess the frequency of peritraumatic stress disorders related to COVID-19. Patients reported a significant worsening of perceived GH (36% vs. 7%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), a significantly higher mean CPDI score (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) than controls. Using multivariate analysis, arthritis patients had significantly higher CPDI scores (+3.67 points; <i>p</i> = 0.019), independent of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, comorbidities, and sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of reporting worsened GH was 9-fold higher in patients than controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Patients with autoimmune arthritis are at higher risk of psychological distress related to COVID-19 pandemic; thus targeted intervention should be designed to strengthen coping capacity in this vulnerable population.","Picchianti Diamanti, Cattaruzza, Di Rosa, Del Porto, Salemi, Sorgi, Martin Martin, Rai, Iacono, Sesti, Alessandri, LaganÃƒÂ ","https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8111818","20201121","COVID-19; CPDI; DASS-21; anxiety; chronic autoimmune arthritis; depression; disease activity; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7369,""
"Prevalence of Internet Addiction during the COVID-19 Outbreak and Its Risk Factors among Junior High School Students in Taiwan","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has significantly disrupted normal activities globally. During this epidemic, people around the world were expected to encounter several mental health challenges. In particular, Internet addiction may become a serious issue among teens. Consequently, this study aimed to examine the prevalence of Internet addiction and identify the psychosocial risk factors during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study was constructed using a cross-sectional design with 1060 participants recruited from among junior high school students around Taiwan using stratified and cluster sampling methods. Taiwan's first COVID-19 case was diagnosed on 28 January 2020. New cases exploded rapidly in February, and as a result, participants were surveyed during March 2 through 27 March 2020. The prevalence of Internet addiction was found to be 24.4% during this period. High impulsivity, high virtual social support, older in age, low subjective well-being, low family function, and high alexithymia was all independently predictive in the forward logistic regression analyses. The prevalence rate of Internet addiction was high among junior high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results from this study can be used to help mental health organizations and educational agencies design programs that will help prevent Internet addiction in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17228547","20201121","COVID-19; adolescents; internet addiction; prevalence; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7370,""
"The effect of meditative movement on the quality of life in patients recovering from COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia is currently ongoing all over the world. The treatment scheme is generally isolation treatment and symptomatic support treatment. While the majority of patients recover from this disease through methods above, COVID-19 Infection severely affect the physical and mental health of rehabilitation patients, as well as their living quality. Thus, meditative movement is needed to improve outcome of COVID-19 patients in recovery period. We will conduct systematic searches to identify all relevant studies without any language limitation from the following electronic databases from inception to October 2020: Medline, Ovid, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System and Wan fang Database. At the same time, we will search the following Clinical trial registries to identify records of on-going or completed but not yet published trials, including WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Trials Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI) and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR). No limits will be placed on language. The article will study the effect of meditative movement on the quality of life of convalescent patients. The main outcome will be the effect of meditative movement on the quality of life of patients in recovery period. The secondary results will select accompanying symptoms (including myalgia, cough, sputum, runny nose, pharyngalgia, anhelation, chest distress, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea), disappearance rate, negative COVID-19 results rate on 2 consecutive occasions (not on the same day), the quality of life improved, CT image improvement, average hospitalization time, occurrence rate of common type to severe form, clinical cure rate, and mortality. Data collection and management 3 authors will independently carry out data from eligible studies in a pretested and standardized Microsoft Excel sheet, with reciprocal validation of data extraction results. Data analysis and quantitative data synthesis will be performed using RevMan software (V.5.3). The findings of the study will provide new and relatively high-quality evidence in meditative movement treatment for COVID-19. The conclusion of systematic review will provide evidence to judge whether meditative movement is an effective intervention for patient with COVID-19 in recovery period.

"Effects of progressive muscle relaxation training on negative emotions and sleep quality in COVID-19 patients: A clinical observational study","This study investigates the effect of progressive muscle relaxation training on negative mood and sleep quality in Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) patients.COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease, and there is still uncertainty about when the outbreak will be contained and the effectiveness of treatments. Considering that this disease is highly contagious, patients need to be treated in isolation. This may lead to psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression, and even sleep problems.This study is a clinical observation study.Participants included 79 COVID-19 patients admitted to a designated hospital for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan from February to March, 2020. Patients were selected and assigned to the control group and the observation group according to their wishes, with 40 and 39 cases in each group, respectively. The control group received routine treatment and nursing, and the observation group received progressive muscle relaxation training, in addition to the routine treatment and nursing. We compared scores of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Scale (PSQI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) before and after the intervention.There was no significant difference in PSQI, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 scores between the control group and the observation group before the intervention (PÃ¢â‚¬Å &gt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .05). After the intervention, the difference in scores of PSQI, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 in the 2 groups were statistically significant (PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .05).Progressive muscle relaxation training can significantly reduce anxiety and depression and improve sleep quality in COVID-19 patients during isolation treatment.Progressive muscle relaxation training was shown to improve the treatment effect of patients and is worthy of clinical promotion.","Xiao, Lin, Lin, Liu, Zhong, Lan","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000023185","20201121","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7372,""
"The same storm but not the same boat: Effects of COVID-19 stay-at-home order on mental health in individuals with overweight","To describe the effects of stay-at-home orders and social distancing during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak on mental health and to compare these outcomes between individuals with normal weight and overweight. This cross-sectional study included 1857 Brazilian adults, who were invited through social media to answer an online questionnaire from 5 May 2020 to 17 May 2020. The instrument included questions related to health behaviour, mental health (anxiety, depression, self-esteem, sadness and stress) and overall health. Overweight was defined as body mass index (BMI)Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°25Ã¢â‚¬â€°Kg/m<sup>2</sup> . Multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify whether overweight is associated with mental health variables. Women reported increased anxiety (36.5% vs 22.2%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), depression (16.2% vs 8.8%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), low self-esteem (19.8% vs 10.6%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), sadness (17.7% vs 10.2%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), and stress (29.5% vs 19.3%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) relative to men. Women with overweight are more likely to report higher feeling of anxiety (OR 1.62, CI 95% 1.22-2.14), depression (OR 1.79, CI 95% 1.25-2.55), low self-esteem (OR 1.82, CI95% 1.28-2.58) and sadness (OR 1.51, CI 95% 1.08-2.10), adjusted for age, social isolation days, educational level, chronic diseases, smoke, alcohol intake and physical activity.

"Longitudinal associations of meaning in life and psychosocial adjustment to the COVID-19 outbreak in China","Literature suggests that 'meaning in life' may be a mental strength that enables individuals to function healthily and adaptively in the face of stress events. Therefore, this study aims to examine the longitudinal associations between meaning in life and psychosocial adjustment to the COVID-19 outbreak among Chinese people. A prospective design was adopted. 154 Chinese college students (Mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 20.41Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1.45Ã‚Â years) completed two waves of the assessment. Participants reported their meaning in life before the outbreak (Time 1) and their psychosocial adjustment 7Ã‚Â weeks later after the outbreak had occurred (Time 2). Participants' meaning in life at Time 1 was positively related to life satisfaction and negatively related to depression, anxiety, stress, and negative emotions at Time 2. Additionally, levels of meaning in life at Time 1 were positively associated to COVID-19-related behavioural engagement - prosocial behaviour and information addiction at Time 2. Individuals' perceptions of the outbreak and status of self-quarantine did not moderate these relationships. Findings suggest that individuals' prior level of meaning in life may help them maintain a healthy psychosocial adjustment during disease outbreak, though cautions regarding the possibility to render an addiction to information about the outbreak are warranted.","Lin","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12492","20201120","COVID-19 outbreak; longitudinal associations; meaning in life; psychosocial adjustment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7374,""
"The mediating role of fear of COVID-19 in the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and depression","Living during the COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by the emergence of great uncertainty surrounding multiple aspects of daily life. This study explored the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and depression, as well as the potential mediation effect of COVID-19-related fear. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey from 10 April until 13 April 2020, three weeks after a national lockdown had been imposed in Greece. The convenience sample used in this study consisted of 2,827 adults. Participants voluntarily provided sociodemographic data and completed the following scales: the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Depression Scale. Participants appeared to be moderately depressed [MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 14.75, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.52]. There was a significant indirect effect of IU to depressive symptoms ((.058), CI (0.051-0.066)). FCV-19S was tested as a mediator in the relationship between IUS-12 (independent variable) and PHQ-9 (dependent variable). Partial mediation of fear of COVID-19 was supported ((.54) (.41)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 13, CI (0.051-0.066), Sobel z-valueÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 14.93). Depressive symptomatology affected study participants at a moderate level. IU was shown to be a significant predictor of depressive symptomatology with higher levels of IU being associated with more severe depressive symptoms. Fear of COVID-19 partially mediated this association. The mediation effect may be explained by the uncertainty around COVID-19-related health issues, which are reflected in the FCV-19S and cause worry and/or anxiety. Uncertainty related with other factors, such as the impact on the economy and education, not assessed by the FCV-19S, may explain part of the relationship between IU and depressive symptoms that is not mediated by FCV-19S. Intolerance of uncertainty is related to depressive symptomatology, and fear of COVID-19 explains part of the relation. Fear of COVID-19 indicates worry and anxiety related to health issues. Psychotherapeutic interventions enhancing individuals' capacity to endure uncertainty could be beneficial. Provision of simple and clear information by the authorities should be a priority issue.","Voitsidis, Nikopoulou, Holeva, Parlapani, Sereslis, Tsipropoulou, Karamouzi, Giazkoulidou, Tsopaneli, Diakogiannis","https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12315","20201120","COVID-19; adult; depression; fear; greek; intolerance of uncertainty; mediation; mental health; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7375,""

"Trauma and orthopaedic team members' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: results of a UK survey","Healthcare systems have been rapidly restructured to meet COVID-19 demand. Clinicians are working to novel clinical guidelines, treating new patient cohorts and working in unfamiliar environments. Trauma and orthopaedics (T&amp;O) has experienced cancellation of routine clinics and operating, with redistribution of the workload and human resources. To date, no studies have evaluated the mental health impact of these changes on the T&amp;O workforce. We report the results of a novel survey on the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of our orthopaedic workforce and the contributory factors. A 20-question survey-based cross-sectional study of orthopaedic team members was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective was to identify the impact of the pandemic on mental health in the form of major depressive disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD). The survey incorporated the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2), which is validated for screening of MDD, and the generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-2), which is validated for screening of GAD. There were 62 respondents (18 females and 44 males). As compared to the general population, we noted a greater estimated prevalence of GAD (17.7% vs 5.9%, p = 0.0009297) and MDD (19.4% vs 3.3%, p = 0.0000007731). The prevalence of MDD symptoms was greatest among senior house officers (SHOs) (p = 0.02216). Female respondents scored higher for symptoms of MDD (p = 0.03583) and GAD (p = 0.0001086). Those identifying as 'Black, African, Caribbean or Black British' displayed a higher prevalence of GAD symptoms (p = 0.001575) and felt least supported at work (p = 0.001341). Our study, in the first of its kind, shows a significant prevalence of GAD and MDD in the workforce. We found that SHOs, females and those of Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British origin were disproportionately affected. Action should be taken to help prevent adverse mental health outcomes for our colleagues during the pandemic.Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint Open</i> 2020;1-6:316-325.","Thakrar, Raheem, Chui, Karam, Wickramarachchi, Chin","https://doi.org/10.1302/2046-3758.16.BJO-2020-0053.R1","20201121","Covid 19; anxiety; depression; mental health; orthopaedics; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7383,""

"The COVID-19 Outbreak and Subjects With Mental Disorders Who Presented to an Italian Psychiatric Emergency Department","We performed a retrospective study from January to May 2020 to establish the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with mental health problems who arrived at an Italian emergency department during the COVID-19 outbreak. We divided the sample into two groups taking as a watershed March 11, when the World Health Organization announced COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Chi-square/t-tests, adjusted p values (Bonferroni method), and regression analysis were performed. Patients who arrived at the emergency department during the lockdown decreased by 56%; showed greater active suicidal ideation, more tension, and more severe psychopathological state; were living alone more frequently; and were taking home treatment mainly based on second-generation antipsychotics. According to our study, it seems that patients with mental disorders have consulted psychiatric services less frequently during the pandemic, but the economic, health, and social distress may be linked with an increase in suicidal risk and the severity of the psychopathological state.","Montalbani, Bargagna, Mastrangelo, Sarubbi, Imbastaro, De Luca, Anibaldi, Erbuto, Pompili, Comparelli","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001289","20201120","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7385,""

"Drugs and the liver","The liver is a major organ with multiple functions. A number of drugs are metabolized by the liver during phase 1 and 2 reactions which include complex processes involving cytochrome P450 enzymes. Genetic and acquired variability in cytochrome P450 activity may have profound effects on pharmacokinetics. Additionally, drugs can also modify how the liver functions and cause dysfunction or even failure of the organ both by a direct effect on the liver or by alteration in liver blood flow. It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of liver failure in patients and identify possible causes including drug interactions. Furthermore, once a patient has been recognized to be suffering with liver dysfunction or failure drug choice and dosing regime will need to be rationalized. Paracetamol overdose can have severe and life threatening consequences for patients due to its effect on liver function. It is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the UK, 1 Correct and early management is crucial and will be discussed within this article.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpaic.2020.07.001","20201001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7388,""

"A longitudinal study on depressive symptoms and physical activity during the Spanish lockdown","Background/Objective: The aim was to evaluate the evolution of depressive symptoms and to explore the influence of physical activity (PA) practice during the home confinement due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. Method: Information was collected from 595 confined participants who reported personal and contextual information, depressive symptoms and PA levels at four time points. Results: The changes in depressive symptoms were analyzed using a linear mixed model with cubic splines. Results showed a significant increase, with a significant rise between T1 and T2 (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.83-3.10). It continued growing until T4 (OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.97-4.38). A negative relationship was observed between the increase in depressive symptoms and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels, with a significant slope up to 4 hours of MVPA per week (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.29-0.90) that tended to increase until 16 hours per week of MVPA (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.20-0.87). Conclusions: Results from a partition model showed that moderate intensity of PA could be enough to prevent an increase of depressive symptoms during home isolation.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.09.001","20200101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7390,""
"Families face pandemic â€“ A review of psychological suggestions and empirical findings regarding the Covid-19 pandemic","Aims. Even though child psychology researches related to a pandemic are extensive, the knowledge of practitioners about interventions and practices is still very limited. The complete novelty of such an epidemic situation in Europe, the diversity of terminology and methods are factors that make results hard to interpret. Therefore, the current study aims to give an overview of the psychological literature of the family aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods. A search was executed in four databases (Science Direct, Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar) using the following keywords: pandemic, Covid 19, family, children, adolescents, anxiety, depression. Our review focuses only on English language literature. Results. The majority of the articles focus on non-pathological phenomena and draws attention to the behavior of healthy populations (increase in internet use, the decline of concentration). Methods were dominated by online surveys. These surveys were mainly constructed ad-hoc and they preferred to address parents. Direct child investigations are underrepresented, but several suggestions were formulated for their optimal functioning. Conclusion:. Researches focusing on psychopathology emphasize the growth in the prevalence of disorders. However, other researches are needed to explore the psychodynamics of the pandemic on the family level. Our study aimed to contribute to the field by summarizing the main findings, suggestions, and interventions hoping that it might be a useful tool for practitioners and reduce the territory of the unknown.","Krisztina Dr TÃ¶ro et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-A62-2A0","20201121","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; developmental psychology; domestic violence; adolescents; review; stress; risk; covid-19; family; perceived stress; pandemic","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7391,""
"Context, design and conduct of the longitudinal COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study â€“ Wave 3","Objectives: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the adult population in multiple countries. This paper describes the execution of the third wave of the UK survey (the â€˜parentâ€™ strand of the Consortium) during July-August 2020. Methods: Adults (N=2025) who previously participated in the baseline and/or the first follow-up surveys were reinvited to participate in this survey, which assessed: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders; as well as the role of (3) psychological factors and (4) social and political attitudes, in influencing the publicâ€™s response to the pandemic. Weights were calculated using a survey raking algorithm to ensure that the cross-sectional sample is nationally representative in terms of gender, age, household income, household composition, and urbanicity. Results: 1166 adults (57.6% of baseline participants) were successfully recontacted and provided full interviews at Wave 3. As expected, the raking procedure successfully re-balanced the cross-sectional sample to within 1% of population estimates across the selected socio-demographic characteristics. Conclusion: This paper outlines the growing strength of the C19PRC Study data to facilitate and stimulate interdisciplinary research addressing important public health questions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Orla Mcbride et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612A-16D-A16","20201121","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; survey; psychological; economic; covid-19; social; longitudinal","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-23","",7392,""
