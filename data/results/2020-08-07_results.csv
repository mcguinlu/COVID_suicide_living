"""Pandemonium of the pandemic"": Impact of COVID-19 in India, focus on mental health","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global health threat, with every nation facing unique challenges during the outbreak. Such pandemics are much beyond biological phenomena. They have psychosocial and economic implications that might long outlast the infection itself. India recently crossed 50,000 cases and is undergoing a historic nationwide lockdown in an attempt to control the outbreak. Considering the sociocultural diversity, limited public health resources, increasing psychological comorbidities, and substantial number of vulnerable populations (e.g., homeless, migrants), the subcontinent is facing unprecedented challenges at all fronts. This commentary glances at the COVID-19 scenario in India through the psychosocial lens, highlights the strategies so far, and discusses the recommended ways ahead.

"A cross-sectional study of mental health status and self- psychological adjustment in nurses who supported Wuhan for fighting against the COVID-19","To evaluate the mental health status, stressors and self-adjustment of nurses in isolation wards at different periods in Wuhan, China. Mental health issues easily occurred among the frontline medical workers of a major epidemic. However, the stressors and psychological adjustments experienced by nurses have not been well described. This is crucial to improving clinical quality and nursing safety and ensuring nurses' physical and psychological health. We performed a cross-sectional prospective study using the Self Reporting Questionnaire-20, stressor and self-adjustment questionnaire administered to frontline nurses in Wuhan at two time points: after they had worked in isolation wards for 7-10 days (T<sub>1</sub> ) and 2 months (T<sub>2</sub> ). This paper complies with the STROBE reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies. T<sub>1</sub> has 92 respondents and T<sub>2</sub> has 86. The positive rates of mental health problems were 26.09% and 9.30%, respectively, showing significantly different in the two periods. The main factors influenced mental health were self-perceived stress and only child status. The most common stressors were: a large infected population, high infectivity; concerned about family's health status; high mortality if not treated in time (T<sub>1</sub> ); and long duration of the epidemic, separate from family for a long time (T<sub>2</sub> ). In terms of self-adjustment, 97.83%(T<sub>1</sub> )/88.04%(T<sub>2</sub> ) of nurses thought it was necessary, but 9(T<sub>1</sub> ) /5(T<sub>2</sub> ) chose to avoid addressing it, and 8(T<sub>1</sub> ) /5(T<sub>2</sub> ) utilized a professional psychological counseling hotline. Mental health problems among frontline nurses fighting COVID-19 need special attention, so administrators should offer timely counseling and strengthen effective psychosocial support to improve their mental resilience. This study surveyed the mental problems and self-adjustment status among nurses working Wuhan during the outbreak of COVID-19, to provide administrators with a scientific basis to effectively intervene.","Chen, Sun, Du, Zhao, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15444","20200806","COVID-19; Clinical; Infection Control; Mental Health; Novel coronavirus; Nurses; Psychological Adaptation; Psychological and Social Coping; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-07","",3699,""

"The Psychological Experience of Obstetric Patients and Health Care Workers after Implementation of Universal SARS-CoV-2 Testing","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’This study was aimed to describe the hospitalization and early postpartum psychological experience for asymptomatic obstetric patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as part of a universal testing program and report the impact of this program on labor and delivery health care workers' job satisfaction and workplace anxiety. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’This is a cohort study of asymptomatic pregnant women who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing between April 13, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Semistructured interviews were conducted via telephone at 1 and 2 weeks posthospitalization to assess maternal mental health. Depression screening was conducted using the patient health questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). An online survey of labor and delivery health care workers assessed job satisfaction and job-related anxiety before and during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as employees' subjective experience with universal testing. Patient and employee responses were analyzed for recurring themes. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’A total of 318 asymptomatic women underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing during this 2-week period. Six of the eight women (75%) who tested positive reported negative in-hospital experiences secondary to perceived lack of provider and partner support and neonatal separation after birth. Among the 310 women who tested negative, 34.4% of multiparous women reported increased postpartum anxiety compared with their prior deliveries due to concerns about infectious exposure in the hospital and lack of social support. Only 27.6% of women, tested negative, found their test result to be reassuring. Job satisfaction and job-related anxiety among health care workers were negatively affected. Universal testing was viewed favorably by the majority of health care workers despite concerns about delays or alterations in patient care and maternal and neonatal separation. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in obstetric units has mixed effects on maternal mental health but is viewed favorably by labor and delivery employees. Ongoing evaluation of new testing protocols is paramount to balance staff and patient safety with quality and equality of care. Ã‚Â· Women with SARS-CoV-2 had a negative hospital experience.. Ã‚Â· A negative SARS-CoV-2 test was not reassuring for patients..

"Coronavirus disease 2019 crisis and intentional injuries: now is not the time to erode alcohol control policies","In Canada, and elsewhere, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has resulted in a social, economic, and alcohol policy environment that is likely to contribute to a rise in intentional injuries, whether interpersonal or self-directed violence. Heavy drinking has been identified as an important risk factor for intentional injuries, and with the erosion of alcohol control policies on alcohol availability, heavy drinking is likely to increase. During a time of social isolation, economic loss, psychological distress, and reduced access to health services and support networks, all of which areÃ‚Â catalytic factors for both intentional injuries and heavy alcohol use, what is needed isÃ‚Â individualized and population-based preventive interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption, rather than decisions to increase certain forms of alcohol availability.","Lange, Probst, Rehm","https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00391-6","20200806","Alcohol availability; COVID-19; Heavy alcohol use; Intentional injuries; Interpersonal violence; Suicidal behaviour","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-07","",3702,""
"Temporal changes in psychobehavioural responses during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia","Monitoring public psychological and behavioural responses during the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is important for the management and control of infection. This study aims to investigate the temporal trend in (1) avoidance and protective behaviors, (2) fear, (3) socio-economic impact, and (4) anxiety levels during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a high level of anxiety may have a detrimental impact during an infectious disease outbreak, factors associated with anxiety were also explored. The survey was carried out for 10Ã‚Â weeks and the responses were divided into three periods of around 3Ã‚Â weeks: 25 January-21 February, 22 February-17 March and 18 March-3 April (the period the Malaysian Government issued Movement Control Order). Findings revealed that most of the pyschobehavioural variables showed small increases during first (25 January-21 February) and second (22 February-17 March) periods, and high psychobehavioral responses were reported during the third period. A total of 72.1% (95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°69.2-75.0) reported moderate to severe anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Factor influencing moderate to severe anxiety is a high perception of severity (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.09; 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.48-2.94), high perceived susceptibility (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.71; 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.17-2.50), high impact score (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.63; 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.17-2.26) and high fear score (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.47; 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.01-2.14). In conclusion, the psychological and behavioural responses were found to increase with the progression of the outbreak. High anxiety levels found in this study warrant provision of mental health intervention during the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak.","Wong, Alias","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-020-00172-z","20200806","COVID-19; Malaysia; Psychobehavioural; SARS-CoV-2; Temporal changes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-07","",3703,""
"Exacerbating Inequalities: Social Networks, Racial/Ethnic Disparities, and the COVID-19 Pandemic","The disruption and contraction of older adults' social networks are among the less-discussed consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective is to provide an evidence-based commentary on racial/ethnic disparities in social network resources and draw attention to the ways in which disasters differentially impact social networks, with meaningful insight for the ongoing pandemic. We draw upon prior research on social networks and past natural disasters to identify major areas of network inequality. Attention is given to how pre-pandemic racial/ethnic network disparities are exacerbated during the current crisis, with implications for physical and mental health outcomes. Evidence from the literature shows a robust association between strong social networks and physical and mental health outcomes. During times of crisis, access to social networks for older adults are disrupted, particularly for marginalized groups. We document pre-pandemic disparities in social networks resources and offer insight for examining the impact of COVID-19 on disrupting social networks among older adults. Importantly, racial/ethnic disparities in social networks both prior to and as a result of the pandemic intensify existing inequalities and demonstrate the necessity of better understanding social network inequalities for marginalized older adults, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis.","Gauthier, Smith, GarcÃƒÂ­a, Garcia, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa117","20200806","COVID-19; Racial and Ethnic Minorities; Social Networks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-07","",3704,""
"Loneliness and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A study among Dutch older adults","With the spread of COVID-19, the Netherlands implemented a policy to keep citizens physically distanced. We hypothesize that consequent reduction in the frequency of social contacts, personal losses and the experience of general threats in society reduced well-being. Data were collected from 1,679 Dutch community-dwelling participants aged 65 to 102 years old comprising a longitudinal online panel. Social and emotional loneliness and mental health were measured in May 2020, i.e., two months after the implementation of the measures, and earlier in October and November 2019. In this pandemic, not only loneliness of older people increased, but mental health remained roughly stable. The policy measures for physical distancing did not cause much social isolation but personal losses, worries about the pandemic, and a decline in trust in societal institutions were associated with increased mental health problems and especially emotional loneliness. The consequences of long-term social isolation and well-being must be closely monitored.","van Tilburg, Steinmetz, Stolte, van der Roest, de Vries","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa111","20200806","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-07","",3705,""
"Strategy for the Practice of Spine Oncological Surgery During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Case series. For each of the most frequent clinical scenarios, the authors reached a consensus on how should be timing and indications be optimized to reduce risk while maintaining the expected outcomes under the COVID 19 pandemics. The organization of healthcare has been changed by the Covid-19 pandemic with a direct impact on Spine Oncology Surgery. Emergency surgery is still a priority, but in case of Spinal Tumors it should be better defined which conditions require emergency treatment. An expert panel with general spine surgeons, oncological spine surgeons and radiation oncologists was formed to analize the most frequent scenarios in spinal musculoskeletal oncology during COVID 19 pandemics. Spine Metastases can be found incidentally during follow-up or can clinically occur by increasing pain, pathologic fracture and/or neurological symptoms. Primary Spine Tumors are much more rare and very rarely present with acute onset. The first step is to suspect this rare condition, in order to avoid to treat a primary tumor as it were a metastasis. Most complex surgery, like enbloc resection, associated with high morbidity and mortality rate for the treatment of low grade malignancy like Chordoma or Chondrosarcomas, if Intensive Care Unit availability is reduced, can be best delayed some weeks, as not impacting on prognosis, due to the slow growth rate of these conditions. The currently accepted protocols for Ewing's Sarcoma (ES) and Osteogenic Sarcoma (OGS) must be performed for local and systemic disease control. For ES, after the first courses of Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy can be selected instead of surgery, during Covid-19, to the end of the full course of chemotherapy. When delaying surgery (chemotherapy completed or toxicity), is essential to avoid contact between immune depressed and Covid-19 patients, during the hospital stay for surgery. Even more than during normal times, a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to share the decision to modify a treatment strategy. 5.","Berjano, Vanni, Fariselli, Cecchinato, Boriani","https://doi.org/10.1097/BRS.0000000000003623","20200806","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-07","",3706,""
