"Prevalence of Chronic Diseases, Depression, and Stress among US Child Care Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: There is no published national research reporting child care professionals' physical health, depression, or stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given their central role in supporting children's development, child care professionals' overall physical and mental health is important. Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of chronic diseases, depression, and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. child care professionals. Design: In this large-scale national survey, data were collected through an online survey from May 22, 2020 to June 8, 2020. We analyzed the association of sociodemographic characteristics with four physical health conditions (asthma, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity), depression, and stress weighted to national representativeness. Sociodemographic characteristics included race, ethnicity, age, gender, medical insurance status, and child care type. Setting: Center- and home-based child care. Participants: Child care professionals (n = 81,682) from all U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Results: Mean age was 42.1 years (standard deviation = 14.1); 96.0% (n = 78,725) were female, 2.5% (n = 2,033) were male, and 0.3% (n = 225) were non-binary. For physical health conditions, 14.3% (n = 11,717) reported moderate to severe asthma, 6.5% (n = 5,317) diabetes, 4.9% (n = 3,971) heart disease, and 19.8% (n = 16,207) being obese. Regarding mental health, 45.7% (n = 37,376) screened positive for depression and 66.5% (n = 54,381) reported moderate to high stress levels. Race, ethnicity, and gender disparities were evidenced for physical health conditions of child care professionals, but not for mental health during the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings highlight that child care professionals' depression rates during the pandemic were much higher than before the pandemic, and depression, stress and asthma rates were higher than U.S. adult depression rates during the pandemic. Given the essential work child care professionals provide during the pandemic, policy makers and public health officials should consider what can be done to support the physical and mental health of child care professionals.","Jad A Elharake; Mehr Shafiq; Ayse Cobanoglu; Amyn A Malik; Madeline Klotz; John Eric Humphries; Thomas S Murray; Kavin A Patel; David Wilkinson; Inci Yildirim; Rachel Diaz; Rosalia Rojas; Anael Kuperwajs Cohen; Aiden Lee; Chin Reyes; Saad B Omer; Walter S Gilliam","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.01.22271717","20220302","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27697,""

"An essay on blindness: mental health in primary care and disputes in the face of the pandemic of covid-19; Um ensaio sobre a cegueira: saÃºde mental na atenÃ§Ã£o bÃ¡sica e as disputas diante da pandemia da covid-19","Resumo A atenÃ§Ã£o bÃ¡sica Ã  saÃºde (ABS) Ã© um importante recurso para o enfrentamento de problemas relacionados ao sofrimento psÃ­quico. A partir disso, o presente ensaio visa discutir a saÃºde mental (SM) na ABS diante da pandemia da covid-19. A pandemia ilumina problemas antigos em que Ã© observado a lÃ³gica assistencialista e medicalizada do cuidado em SM. AlÃ©m disso, persistem prÃ¡ticas de subaproveitamento e nÃ£o reconhecimento das potencialidades da ABS como produtora do cuidado num espinhoso cenÃ¡rio polÃ­tico-econÃ´mico de disputa de poder e que incentiva a privatizaÃ§Ã£o dos serviÃ§os pÃºblicos. Esse jogo de forÃ§as tem influÃªncia na produÃ§Ã£o do cuidado, sobretudo em contextos caÃ³ticos, de injustiÃ§as e desigualdades sociais, terrenos fÃ©rteis para a disseminaÃ§Ã£o da covid-19. Assim, torna-se importante um olhar mais atento sobre os efeitos da SM na ABS, visto que gestores, profissionais e usuÃ¡rios podem mergulhar na ""cegueira branca"". Portanto, Ã© fundamental reconhecer a legitimidade dos saberes, valores e desejos que movimentam os trabalhadores e usuÃ¡rios dos serviÃ§os pÃºblicos; ou seja, compreender a SM como um campo relacional e dinÃ¢mico. TambÃ©m Ã© importante depositar um sopro de esperanÃ§a ao gerar reflexÃµes que acendam as luzes para que esse cuidado se aproxime do cuidado integral.; Abstract Primary health care (PHC) is an important resource for facing issues associated with psychological distress. Thus, this essay aims to discuss mental health (MH) in PHC in the face of the covid-19 pandemic. Besides bringing to light old problems related to the assistentialist and medicalized logic of the MH care, the pandemic upholds practices that underutilize and disregard PHC potentialities as a care provider in a political-economic scenario of power struggle, which encourages the privatization of public services. Such power play influences care provision, especially in chaotic scenarios of injustices and inequalities - fertile ground for covid-19 spread. This context evinces the need for taking a closer look at the effects of MH on PHC, since managers, professionals, and users can be plunged into the so-called ""white blindness"". Thus, recognizing the legitimacy of knowledge, values, and desires that move different types of workers and users is crucial; that is, understanding MH as a relational field in constant movement. Likewise, bringing a glimmer of hope by promoting reflections that turn on the lights so that this care approaches integral care is also important.","Mattos, MÃºssio PirajÃ¡; Pereira, Beatriz Medrado; Gomes, Daiene Rosa","http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0104-12902022000100302","","Database: COVIDWHO; LILACS; Publication type: article; Publication details: SaÃºde Soc;31(1): e200783, 2022.; Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Humans; Male; Female; Primary Health Care; Mental Health; Delivery of Health Care; COVID-19; Health Policy","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27699,""
"Mental health, human rights and penal system: reinventing extension in desmedited pandemic times; SaÃºde mental, direitos humanos e sistema penal: reinventando a extensÃ£o em tempos pandÃªmicos desmedidos","Resumo Partindo de uma problematizaÃ§Ã£o acerca da noÃ§Ã£o de periculosidade e do dispositivo da medida de seguranÃ§a, este relato tem como objetivo trazer ao debate experiÃªncias de um programa de extensÃ£o pautado nas relaÃ§Ãµes entre saÃºde mental, direitos humanos e sistema penal. Com a pandemia do novo coronavÃ­rus, as aÃ§Ãµes do programa foram reestruturadas e passaram a ter como foco a formaÃ§Ã£o-intervenÃ§Ã£o de estudantes e profissionais. Com base na perspectiva metodolÃ³gica da pesquisa-intervenÃ§Ã£o, a extensÃ£o promoveu um ciclo de diÃ¡logos com entrevistas de profissionais que trabalham o tema-foco do programa. AlÃ©m disso, realizou a construÃ§Ã£o de um observatÃ³rio, com um repositÃ³rio on-line dispondo de materiais sobre o tema e aÃ§Ãµes do programa. Por fim, organizou um curso, na modalidade a distÃ¢ncia, sobre saÃºde mental, direitos humanos e sistema penal. O fluxo de acessos aos conteÃºdos publicados e, principalmente, a quantidade de inscritos no curso, que atraiu profissionais e estudantes majoritariamente das Ã¡reas de direito, psicologia e serviÃ§o social, indicam o interesse e a pertinÃªncia de aÃ§Ãµes que visam a desinstitucionalizaÃ§Ã£o das medidas de seguranÃ§a, um tema necessÃ¡rio para a sustentaÃ§Ã£o do processo de reforma psiquiÃ¡trica e defesa dos direitos humanos no paÃ­s.; Abstract From a problematization of the notion of dangerousness and the security measure device, this manuscript aims to bring to light experiences of an extension program based on the association between mental health, human rights, and the penal system. With the novel coronavirus pandemic, the program actions were restructured, now focusing on the training-intervention of students and professionals. Based on the methodological perspective of research-intervention, the extension promoted a cycle of dialogues with interviews of professionals who work with the Program's focus. Moreover, it also developed an observatory with an online repository including materials on the Program's theme and actions and organized an online learning course on mental health, human rights, and the penal system. The access to the published content and the number of students and professionals enrolled in the course, mostly from the fields of law, psychology, and social work, indicate the interest and pertinence of actions aimed at the deinstitutionalization of security measures as a necessary theme to sustain psychiatric reform and human rights defense in the country.","Romanini, Moises; Paulon, Simone Mainieri; Pasche, DÃ¡rio Frederico; Pinto Neto, MoysÃ©s da Fontoura","http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0104-12902022000100800","","Database: COVIDWHO; LILACS; Publication type: article; Publication details: SaÃºde Soc;31(1): e210391, 2022.; Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Humans; Male; Female; Prisons; Security Measures; Mental Health; Dangerous Behavior; COVID-19; Human Rights","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27700,""
"Metabolic Syndrome and Mental Health in the Time of Covid-19 Pandemic","Introduction. At the end of 2019, China was hit by a disease with pandemic potential. It was a new coronavirus, also called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the situation a pandemic. Those most at risk were people with metabolic syndrome, mentally ill and the elderly. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components have become a monitored issue in the context of mental illnesses. The COVID-19 pandemic, metabolic syndrome, and mental health have become interrelated. The number of mental illnesses has grown exponentially around the world, having affected several age groups. Methodology. A search and selection of articles from the online scientific database WOS through bibliometric analysis, using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""metabolic syndrome"", ""mental illnesses"" in the period from 2020 to 2021 to present the relationships between metabolic syndrome and mental illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion. In the area of publications, the issue of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic was the most watched topic. A higher incidence of metabolic syndrome or its components has been reported in patients suffering from mental illnesses.","Stefkova, G.; Zamboriova, M.","https://doi.org/10.22359/cswhi_12_5_02","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Social Work and Health Intervention; 12(5):15-21, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27701,""
"Seizure, abdominal pain, and urine pink in an adolescent female-what's the link?","Case Report A 17 year-old female with history of depression was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) from an emergency department (ED) for first time seizure and subsequent encephalopathy after five days of severe, diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting. The night prior to admission, she complained of lightheadedness and then had a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting 45 seconds. She initially returned to her baseline but then had three additional seizures requiring ED evaluation. She received intravenous doses of lorazepam and levetiracetam that aborted the clinical seizures. She remained encephalopathic and was orotracheally intubated for airway protection. Family denied known ingestions but reported she did vape nicotine. Urine drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines, consistent with seizure management. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unrevealing. Urinalysis showed moderate ketones and trace blood. Urine pregnancy test and nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction were negative. Head computerized tomography scan showed no intracranial pathology. On arrival to the PICU, the patient was afebrile, tachycardic, and hypertensive to 171/118 mmHg. She was somnolent on arrival but aroused to sternal rub without focal neurologic deficit. She presented with a Foley catheter that drained pinkorange urine. A nicardipine infusion was started given concern for the development of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Thyroid function tests were consistent with euthyroid sick syndrome. BioFire meningitis panel, plasma SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and toxicologic evaluation were all negative. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed cortical and subcortical areas of diffusion restriction consistent with PRES. Ultimately, a random urine porphobilinogen and a 24-hour measurement of urine porphyrins collected on hospital day 1 were both markedly elevated. A diagnosis of Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) was made. A gastrointestinal porphyria specialist was consulted and recommended monthly outpatient injections of givosiran upon hospital discharge. Discussion This case illustrates the importance of considering AIP in the differential diagnosis of new onset seizure or encephalopathy associated with hypertension, tachycardia, and abdominal pain in an adolescent. This case also adds to a small number of cases associating AIP with PRES. AIP is often viewed as an adult disease because it typically presents in the third or fourth decade of life. Timely recognition of AIP in the pediatric setting is critical to preventing delays in diagnosis, treatment, and patient education on triggers of acute attacks. AIP attacks are treated with dextrose and hemin infusions to reduce production of porphyrin precursors. Prophylactic treatment of AIP now includes givosiran, an interfering mRNA that reduces levels of intermediates in heme synthesis that are neurotoxic when elevated.","Stone, H.; Donahue, A.; Fleisher, S.","https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2022-SRMC.314","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Investigative Medicine; 70(2):603, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27702,""
"INFLUENCE OF OPTIMISM UPON THE ACCUMULATION OF STRESS, MENTAL STATE AND PERCEIVED RISKS FOR THE FUTURE OF STUDENTS, IN THE CONDITIONS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC","An empirical psychological study was conducted with students from Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy, using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The aim of the research was to test the role of optimism on the accumulation of stress in the conditions of pandemic of COVID-19, their mental states, experiences in connection with social isolation and perceived risks for the future and career. It has been found that optimism, as a generalized personal expectation, has a strong buffering effect on the impact of accumulated pandemic stress on students' emotional states. Negative expectations do not have a significant effect on the emotional state. Optimism and negative expectations have no effect on fears for the future and perceived risks for young people as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Obviously, other personal and social factors determine the negative expectations for the acquired competencies during distance learning online, as well as for more difficult careers and career problems for this reason. More pronounced negative expectations make it more difficult for students to tolerate social isolation, while optimism has no statistically significant impact on social isolation experiences during a pandemic. Students with more optimism perceive their mental state as stable, good, while those with reduced optimism and more pronounced negative expectations as shaky, depressed. The results of the study suggest the need for additional activity of higher education institutions in such conditions to support and advise students.","Stoyanov, V.","https://doi.org/10.53656/ped21-6s.05infl","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pedagogika-Pedagogy; 93(6):63-72, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27703,""

"Couple Connectedness in the Time of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented global morbidity and mortality which altered people's daily lives, as well as created multiple societal challenges. One significant problem posed by this unique stressor is maintaining healthy intimate relationships, which are linked to mental and physical health. The literature has shown that the pandemic has exacerbated issues for couples such as financial difficulties, a lack of privacy, medical issues, and family and professional concerns. The pandemic has also forced all healthcare systems, hospitals, and clinics to quickly incorporate telehealth services. The number of requests for mental health consultations has risen to the point where demand exceeds supply. This paper provides an overview of ways couples can stay emotionally connected during this time as well as provide future directions for therapists to help couples develop or improve adaptive relationship mechanisms.","Tadros, Eman, Gomez, Eunice, Dudek, Meghan","https://doi.org/10.1177/10664807221082397","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Family Journal;: 10664807221082397, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27706,""
"Restorative yoga therapy for third year medical students in pediatrics rotation: Working to improve medical student well-being","Purpose of Study Medical education is academically rigorous and time-intensive, leading to emotional and physical strain for students throughout their training. Subsequently, many medical students report experiencing anxiety, depression, and other changes in mood in response to sustained stress. These negative effects on psychological well-being may even precipitate burn-out, a major issue among medical providers, as students enter the workforce. During the third year of medical school, students traditionally transition to a more clinical role for education and to choose a field of medicine, while continuing to study for exams. This period is likely pivotal for establishing long-term coping strategies that can be used throughout their career. One strategy is the implementation of a yoga practice, which works to reduce the stress response and lower the likelihood of anxiety and depression development. This study seeeks to measure the effect of a yoga intervention on third-year medical student well-being. Methods Used A restorative yoga practice was offered for third-year medical students on their pediatrics rotation, practicing 45 minutes of yoga once a week for six weeks. 25 students participated over the course of a year, with sessions held virtually due to COVID-19. Screening via the 14-question Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) was done before and after the intervention. Summary of Results All but one statement from the WEMWBS showed a positive increase in average rating post-intervention. The statements, 'I've been feeling more relaxed' and 'I've been thinking clearly' showed the greatest average increase. Following chi-squared testing, p &lt;.05, two statements were found to be significantly different pre- and post-intervention: 'I've been feeling more relaxed' and 'I've been feeling good about myself ' Conclusions Although limited due to small sample size, attrition, and social distancing restrictions, these data indicate that restorative yoga could be an effective mitigator against the stresses of medical education. In particular, our results indicate that yoga is correlated with a positive change in relaxation, mental clarity, and self-esteem. Increasing these qualities during a pivotal time of medical education when students are making important, and potentially anxiety-inducing, career choices could hopefully have enduring benefits for well-being.","Thompson, C.

"Hallucinations in Hospitalized Rehabilitation Patients with COVID-19","To describe the characteristics of hallucinations in hospitalized rehabilitation patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). An observation study of case series. Acute inpatient rehabilitation public hospital. Patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the acute inpatient rehabilitation unit (ARU) during a four-month period. Not applicable. To describe the characteristics of hallucinations in hospitalized rehabilitation patients with COVID-19. Eight (21.6%) of a cohort of 37 patients admitted to the ARU with COVID-19 exhibited visual hallucinations. Most of the visual hallucinations occurred during their ICU stay. The mean age of the eight patients was 56.5-year-old (range: 38 â€“ 71). There were seven males and one female. Seven of the eight patients exhibited peduncular hallucinations, four were associated with auditory components, five with tactile components. One patient's hallucinations were characterized by a duplication of an extra finger, an enlargement of an upper extremity, a tactile hallucination of crawling bugs, and a somatic component of abnormal positioning of an extremity. The content of the hallucinations was related to the fearful and threatening situations in three patients and the experience of seeing deceased family members in two patients. Five of the patients had ICU delirium. Seven patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and one patient developed respiratory distress secondary to Guillain-Barre Syndrome. One patient experienced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome which was associated with visual hallucinations. Four patients had anxiety, four had depression, and one had both anxiety and depression. None had a pre-existing history of psychiatric illness, but one had a pre-existing history of methamphetamine use. All eight patients had evidence of cognitive impairment. Hallucinations of six patients resolved spontaneously but those of two patients had persisted during their ARU stay.

"Characterizing Life Stress and Psychological Distress During Acute SCI: A Mixed Methods Analysis of Tele-CBT Notes","To characterize domains of life stressors encountered by individuals with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) and change in psychological distress in the context of tele-cognitive behavioral therapy (tele-CBT). A within-arm (tele-CBT) mixed methods analysis in an ongoing randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of CBT telepsychology intervention on depressive symptomology, secondary symptoms (anxiety), and quality of life (QoL). Community setting. Fifteen individuals (Demographics: mean injury age=47.93years [SD=20.17], 53.3% male, 26.7% White;Injury Characteristics: time since injury mean=67.97days [SD=53.36], 66.7% traumatic etiology, 46.7% tetraplegia, 33.3% complete SCI) with acute SCI. The intervention group received 10 tele-CBT sessions over 12 weeks via Apple's FaceTime application with a licensed psychologist specializing in treating individuals with SCI. Session adhered to the basic structure outlined in Wenzel et al. (2011)1 and the study psychologist used individualized behavioral and/or cognitive strategies. Domains of life stressors qualitatively coded from CBT therapy notes. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)3 measured each session. Findings are preliminary as the study is ongoing. Participants attended an average of 9.8 CBT sessions. Thirty life stressors typically associated with psychological distress were identified from participants' CBT notes. The most frequently concerns were pain (73.3%), relationship issues (66.7%), sleep problems (60.0%), other non-SCI medical concerns (46.7%), COVID-19 (46.7%), UTIs (40.0%), perceived burden (26.7%), fatigue (26.7%), and returning to work (26.7%). At the first CBT session, the average PHQ-9 and GAD-7 total scores were 7.00 (SD= 3.72) and 5.80 (SD= 4.42). Over the course of therapy, symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased (PHQ-9:B=-0.346, SE=0.051, p&lt;.001;GAD-7:B=-0.232, SE=0.109, p&lt;.05). Individuals with acute SCI experience a diverse range of challenges that may impact mood.4â€“6 Although the majority of concerns and life stressors endorsed were medical, a substantial number were related to relationships, perceived burden, and resumption of functional roles.5 Tele-CBT provided by an SCI specialist may be an effective intervention to support adjustment and bolster against life stressors after acute SCI. The authors have no disclosures to report.","Truong, Phuoc Thien, Khong, Cria-May, Pasipanodya, Elizabeth, Dirlikov, Benjamin, Held, Mark, Shem, Kazuko","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2022.01.056","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation; 103(3):e20-e21, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27709,""

"A quasi-experimental study of parent and child well-being in families of color in the context of COVID-19 related school closure","Families of color living in historically disinvested neighborhoods face a multitude of health disparities which have been exacerbated by COVID-19 and the resulting strategies to mitigate its transmission. School closure, which occurred with little warning and few, if any, resources for preparation, disrupted multiple aspects of familiesâ€™ lives;these disruptions are anticipated to adversely impact mental health and well-being. The current study aims to advance understanding of the experiences of families of young children of color during the pandemic by utilizing a natural experiment design to test impact on child and parent mental health and sleep in the context of COVID-19 related school closure among families in historically disinvested neighborhoods. Data from this study come from an ongoing study of 281 families of color enrolled in 41 pre-kindergarten (pre-K) programs in neighborhoods across New York City (NYC). In NYC, school closure occurred on March 16, 2020, during a data collection period involving phone surveys with parents;the quasi-experimental design allows for comparison of the 198 families who had completed the survey prior to March 16, and the 83 families who completed the survey after March 16, using identical protocols and procedures. Results demonstrate poorer mental health among parents surveyed after school closure as compared to before school closure. No differences were found for parent sleep, child mental health, or child sleep. Implications of this work highlight the need for structural and systemic supports for families faced with compounding stressors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related school closure.","Ursache, Alexandra, Barajas-Gonzalez, R.

"Coping Mechanisms Among Youth and Young Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Competitive Employment","To explore how youth and young adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) cope with stress and anxiety (i.e., normal/typical anxiety) in competitive employment. An interpretative phenomenological approach involving in-depth interviews. Due to the impact of COVID-19, all interviews took place remotely over the phone or through Zoom Communications. Participants were recruited across Canada. A purposive sample of 12 youth and young adults with ASD aged 15-30 who were employed or had work experience participated in this study. Not applicable. Semi-structured interviews with participants. Findings indicated that stress and/or anxiety inducers for participants in the workplace included: challenges with social communication at work, tasks at work, impact of COVID-19 on employment experiences, past trauma/experiences impacting ability to work, and personal experiences with disability disclosure. Participants reported using the following coping strategies to combat work-related stress and/or anxiety: (1) problem-focused (i.e., finding ways to solve issues at hand), (2) emotion-focused (i.e., using strategies to reduce negative feelings and emotions), and/or (3) resilience (i.e., pushing through the situation despite feeling stressed and/or anxious). Participants also identified workplace barriers and facilitators, which may impact future occurrences of stress or anxiety. Uncovering stress and/or anxiety inducers in a workplace setting can help employers be better informed of the potential barriers that are present for employees with ASD, which can lead to better inclusion on the job. The findings from this study have the potential to improve employment outcomes, transition skills, and overall mental health among youth and young adults with ASD in competitive employment.

"Association Between Urban Greenspace and Mental Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a US Cohort","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought unprecedented socially isolating measures to mitigate the spread of disease, heightening the importance of public outdoor urban greenspace. Here, we investigated the association between tree-rich greenspace and mental health in a large opportunity sample surveyed using a crowdsourcing research website (www.covid19resilience.org) between April 6th and October 12th, 2020 during the pandemic in the United States. Participants living in the U.S. (N = 2,089, 83.1% females, mean age 42 years, age range 18-90 years) were mapped to 1,080 unique ZIP Codes and mean tree canopy density was calculated with a 250m buffer around each ZIP Code grouped by quartile as a proxy for nearby greenspace. Four mental health parameters were assessed: (1) COVID-19-related worries;(2) anxiety symptoms;(3) depression symptoms;and (4) a standardized and weighted composite mental health score of all three parameters. Multivariate regression analyses with multilevel models were used to study the association between nearby greenspace and the four mental health outcomes, controlling for participant demographics and ZIP Code urbanicity. In the entire cohort, increased nearby greenspace showed a significant protective effect for depression (Coef. = -0.27;p = 0.0499), and composite mental health scores (Coef. = -0.19;p = 0.038) when comparing ZIP Codes with the most greenspace to ZIP Codes with the least, with no observed effects on COVID-19 related worries or anxiety individually. Stratifying by age suggested protective trends of greenspace on mental health in older subsets of the population (top age quartile, over 51 years old) experiencing less depression (Coef. = -0.45;p = 0.048) and lower composite mental health scores (Coef. = -0.34;- = 0.032) as a function of nearby greenspace. Additionally, younger subsets of the population (second youngest age quartile, 31-38 years) experienced lower COVID-19 related worries (Coef. = -1.34;p = 0.022) as a function of greenspace. These findings may indicate that tree-rich greenspace plays a protective role on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in certain age groups, supporting the use of greenspace-related strategies to help mitigate mental health burden during this challenging and isolating time.","Wortzel, J.

"How can I keep from singing? The effects of COVID-19 on the emotional wellbeing of community singers during early stage lockdown in the United States","This study investigates the emotional wellbeing of community choral musicians during the early lockdown stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In an effort to understand participant wellbeing and document lived experiences in rapidly changing circumstances, the researchers gathered quantitative and qualitative data from almost 400 self-identified musicians in May-June 2020. Responses from community choir members indicated decreased wellbeing as a result of cancelled rehearsals and performances, unfamiliar online musicking practices and loss of community. Other themes included sadness, worry and grief concerning separation from fellow ensemble members and, in the case of ageing choristers, fear that they might not sing with others again in their lifetimes. Ultimately, this article sheds light on the complexity and necessity of sustaining community choirs during the COVID-19 pandemic while addressing the decreased wellbeing of singers as they were isolated in an effort to prevent viral spread through aerosolized means.","Youngblood, F.

"Womenâ€™s well-being during a pandemic and its containment<U+2606>","The COVID-19 pandemic brought the dual crises of disease and the containment policies designed to mitigate it. Yet, there is little evidence on the impacts of these policies on women in lower-income countries, where there may be limited social safety nets to absorb these shocks. We conduct a large phone survey and leverage Indiaâ€™s geographically varied containment policies to estimate the association between the pandemic and containment policies and measures of womenâ€™s well-being, including mental health and food security. On aggregate, the pandemic resulted in dramatic income losses, increases in food insecurity, and declines in female mental health. While potentially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19, the greater prevalence of containment policies is associated with increased food insecurity, particularly for women, and reduced female mental health. For surveyed women, moving from zero to average containment levels is associated with a 38% increase in the likelihood of reporting more depression, a 73% increase in reporting more exhaustion, and a 44% increase in reporting more anxiety. Women whose social position may make them more vulnerable â€“ those with daughters and those living in female-headed households â€“ experience even larger declines in mental health.","Bau, Natalie, Khanna, Gaurav, Low, Corinne, Shah, Manisha, Sharmin, Sreyashi, Voena, Alessandra","https://www.google.com/search?q=Womenâ€™s+well-being+during+a+pandemic+and+its+containment<U+2606>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of development economics;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27724,""

"The Impacts of COVID-19 on Collegiate Student-Athlete Training, Health, and Well-Being","Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of COVID-19 and stay-at-home (SAH) orders on collegiate student-athletes' training, nutrition, sleep habits, and mental health and to identify disparities between sexes and competitive divisions. Methods: Collegiate student-athletes (n = 401;age, 20 +/- 2 yr) completed an 84-question anonymous survey regarding demographics, sport/exercise training, nutrition, sleep habits, and mental health. Response frequencies were calculated for each question, and chi 2 analyses were used to determine statistical significance (alpha = 0.05). Results: Although 80.7% of respondents indicated training for their sport, only 38.7% could fully perform their training programs. More D1 versus D3 athletes reported they could perform their training plan as written (D1: 44.4% [n = 83] vs D3: 27.3% [n = 50];P &lt; 0.01), but there were no differences between sexes. Cardiovascular exercise was the most common mode (87.5%) followed by resistance exercise (78.4%). Although there were no differences for cardiovascular exercise, more males (87.5%) than females (74.8%) indicated resistance training (P &lt; 0.01). Average number of meals consumed per day remained similar before and during SAH, but females reported consuming less food and perceived increased healthfulness of their diets. Although most athletes did not use nutritional supplements, rates were higher among D3 and females. Respondents reported longer sleep durations but increased sleep disturbances, negative psychological states, and overall concerns during SAH. Maintaining fitness and sport-specific skills (similar to 70.0%) were the most common concerns. In addition, similar to 60.6% of females and 41.9% of males indicated increased mental health concerns. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that while attempting to be diligent with training during SAH, many student-athletes reported difficulties regarding limited equipment, motivation, and mental health concerns such as heightened anxiety. Many of these difficulties were division- and sex-specific. Discussions between coaches and student-athletes regarding SAH training and mental stressors may aid in determining student-athletes' readiness to return to sport.","Chandler, A. J.; Arent, M.

The authors Chikuni, Makwambeni and Chigona use Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) Feenbergs typology of e-learning discourses to analyse the dominant discourses that underpin e-learning policies in HEIs in SA. The studys findings show the dominance of deterministic and instrumentalist discourses in the e-learning policies. Moving to the theme of student attitudes and its effect on learning in a technology enhanced environment, Singh and Sandhu in an article entitled, The relevant social group analysis of the SCOT theory for gender differences among Teacher Education students' attitude towards using the Internet for their learning potentials, used the social group factor of the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) theory to examine the relationship between gender differences and tertiary education students' attitude in India towards Internet use for their learning potential.

"COVID-19 post-vaccination depression in older Israeli adults: the role of negative world assumptions","Background With the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the aging population has been shown to be highly vulnerable. As a result, policy makers and the media urged older adults to restrict social interactions, placing them at greater risk of mental health problems, such as depression. However, there has been a little previous attempt to examine coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-related risk factors and depressive symptoms amongst older adults. Methods Participants (938 older adults, Mage = 68.99, s.d. = 3.41, range 65â€“85) answered an online questionnaire at the start of the COVID-19 vaccination program in Israel. Participants completed measures of background characteristics, world assumptions, COVID-19 vaccine-related variables, and symptoms of depression. Results Univariate logistic regression revealed that more negative world assumptions were linked with clinical depression levels. Conclusions Older adults in our sample were susceptible to unique factors associated with clinical depression influenced by their world assumptions during their COVID-19 vaccination. The high level of depression following vaccination indicates that it may take time to recover from depression associated with pandemic distress. Cognitive interventions that focus on world assumptions are recommended.","Greenblatt-Kimron, Lee, Hoffman, Yaakov, Ben-Ezra, Menachem, Goodwin, Robin, Palgi, Yuval","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+post-vaccination+depression+in+older+Israeli+adults:+the+role+of+negative+world+assumptions","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Global mental health (Cambridge, England);: 1-4, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27731,""

"Toward Improved Addiction Treatment Quality and Access for Black Patients","A recent study showed a 40% increase in the opioid overdose death rate for Black individuals relative to non-Hispanic White individuals, but no change among other races/ethnicities was noted.3 In their article, ""Individual and Health Policy Factors Associated With Positive Heroin and Opioid Treatment Response: United States, 2018,"" Pro et al. (p. S66) examine variations in treatment outcomes and highlight the existence of multiple subepidemics among racial/ethnic groups. A 2018 Florida study found that Black Americans experienced significant delays in entry to addiction treatment (four to five years) compared with White Americans, leading to greater severity of symptoms and increased overdose rates.4 Studies have also shown that Black youths with an opioid use disorder are less likely than White youths to be prescribed medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD),5 and Black patients have statistically significantly lower odds of receiving a buprenorphine prescription as part of their opioid use disorder treatment.6 From disparities in sentencing7 to higher arrest rates for drug-related offenses for Black individuals than White individuals,8 punitive responses to addiction have disproportionately impacted communities of color. The timing and access point of MOUD for Black patients must be addressed to provide early intervention and pharmacotherapies to Black communities through health care systems, primary care, employers, and public health infrastructures and not merely through criminal justice involvement or other punitive interventions. Early intervention and prevention programs and strategies are equally critical, with an emphasis on partnering with Black leaders, Black churches, and trusted community leaders and entities not only to help ensure cultural sensitivity but also to build trust and confidence in evidence-based services for addiction.","Hulsey, Jessica N.

"Social and Behavioral Sciences: Response to the Opioid and Pain Crises in the United States","Chronic pain is a prevalent, debilitating, and costly public health problem.1 Recent estimates suggest that approximately 20% of all adult Americans report chronic pain (i.e., pain on most days) and approximately 8% report high impact chronic pain (i.e., pain that interferes with work and daily functioning on most days).2 Unfortunately, despite evidence of the benefits of integrated, multimodal care that emphasizes nonopioid and nonpharmacological approaches for the management of chronic pain, it is more common for chronic pain to be managed by a single provider following a biomedical model of care and with limited education and training in pain management, resulting in opioidcentric treatment. Experts in the field have called for increased attention to psychosocial factors in national health policy, research, and practice initiatives to combat these public health crises.1,3 In 2018, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a workshop on these topics to identify and discuss social and behavioral considerations that could help frame research priorities to address the opioid and pain crises. Sud et al. (p. S56) argue that commonly employed approaches for reducing opioid-related harms, including health professional education, clinical decision support systems, and state prescription drug monitoring programs, have clearly been insufficient given continued escalation in rates of opioid overdose and death. [...]Merlin et al. (p.

"Mental Health of Teachers in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Time of COVID-19 Pandemics","Background: The pandemic of COVID-19 has affected all spheres of life, including education. Teachers at all levels were faced with numerous challenges during the pandemic. These challenges had an impact on their mental health. Objective: The goal of the present study was to examine the depression, anxiety, and stress levels in teachers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Methods: The sample for this study consisted of 559 teachers (471 female teachers and 88 male teachers). We used the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS 21) to measure teachersâ€™ emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. Results: The findings of this study clearly indicate the high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers. We also identified that levels of support provided by family members and school administration served as protective factors in the time of crisis.

"Build It Better for Public Health: Improved Data Infrastructure Is Vital to Bending the Curve of the Overdose Crisis","For most decedents, the COD is determined by the attending physician or nurse;however, death investigations are required for cases in which the COD is sudden or unexpected, is not of natural causes, is unattended, or is unexplained.2 Therefore, coroners and medical examiners are typically the authorized certifiers of death in cases involving overdose.3 In this issue of AJPH (p. S36), Merlin et al. provide a timely analysis of overdose surveillance in the health care settings, where deaths may be miscategorized by attending physicians for decedents with underlying illness. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, of the 28 states with county coroners, 22 states do not have a state medical examiner, and half do not require the coroner position to be held by a medical professional or an individual with certified credentials to conduct autopsies, such as pathology, toxicology, and forensic medicine.4 The accuracy of COD related to drugs is higher for medical examiners than for coroners. [...]the specific drug was not listed for 38% of death certificates in states with decentralized county coroner systems, compared with 8% in states with a statewide medical examiner system, leading to underestimates for death rates.3 Even in situations where medical examiners are present, death investigations continue to be substantially underfunded and threaten the accuracy of COD data. COD determination exists within a broader context of institutional racism and racial bias in clinical policy and practice.11 Genomic research has unequivocally determined that race is not a biological categorization;yet, erroneous beliefs persist in the medical community about biological differences between Black and White individuals.12 These biases are associated with clinical recommendations and how services are delivered.13 Recognizing signs that overdose may have occurred is also limited by the lack of foundational training provided by medical institutions for substance use disorder, despite its being a leading COD for unintentional injury.","Latimore, Amanda D.

"Was it Good for You? Gender Differences in Motives and Emotional Outcomes Following Casual Sex","Casual sex, also referred to as a hookup, has been associated with a range of negative emotional outcomes for women, including regret, anxiety, depression and social stigma. However, it has been argued that it is the nature of the sexual motivation, not gender that influences the emotional outcome. This study was designed to ascertain what motivates people to have casual sex, what emotional outcomes follow casual sex and whether there are gender differences among these variables. Seven hundred and one participants (47% men and 52.8% women) completed a 44-item online survey. Gender differences were found for both sexual motivations and emotional outcomes of casual sex, with women generally having more negative emotional outcomes than men. Additionally, a principal components analysis uncovered four reliable principal motivations underlying engagement in casual sex, and three principal emotional outcomes of casual sex. Predictors of negative emotional outcomes included being motivated to regulate negative emotions and to achieve positive emotions. No predictors (apart from being a man) were found for a positive emotional outcome. While the stigma surrounding female sexual agency is diminishing, results generally support the presence of a sexual double-standard which encourages male promiscuity but dissuades female sexual autonomy.","McKeen, Billie E.; Anderson, Ryan C.; Mitchell, David A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Was+it+Good+for+You?+Gender+Differences+in+Motives+and+Emotional+Outcomes+Following+Casual+Sex","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sexuality & culture;: 1-21, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27738,""

"Evolution of the emotional impact in patients with early inflammatory bowel disease during and after Covid-19 lockdown EvoluciÃ³n del impacto emocional en pacientes con enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal temprana durante y despuÃ©s del bloqueo de COVID-19","Background Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are vulnerable to some psychological disorders. Here we describe the psychological impact of a COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in patients with IBD. Methods This multicenter prospective cohort study included 145 patients recently diagnosed with IBD. Data on clinical and demographic characteristics, anxiety and depression scales, and IBD activity were collected in two telephone surveys, during and after the first COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results During lockdown, 33.1% and 24.1% scored high on the anxiety and depression scales, respectively. Independent factors related to anxiety (all values ORs;95% CIs) during lockdown were female sex (2;1.2â€“5.4) and IBD activity (4.3;1.8â€“10.4). Factors related to depression were comorbidity (3.3;1.1â€“9.8), IBD activity (6;1.9â€“18.1), use of biologics (2.9;1.1â€“7.6), and living alone or with one person (3.1;1.2â€“8.2). After lockdown, anxiety and depression symptoms showed significant improvement, with 24.8% and 15.2% having high scores for anxiety and depression, respectively. Factors related to post-lockdown anxiety were female sex (2.5;1.01â€“6.3), Crohn's disease (3.3;1.3â€“8.5), and active IBD (4.1;1.2â€“13.7). Factors associated with depression were previous history of mood and/or anxiety disorders (6.3;1.6â€“24.9), active IBD (7.5;2.1â€“26.8), and steroid use (6.4;1.4â€“29). Conclusions Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant psychological impact in patients with IBD.

"Psychosocial and Mental Health Issues of the Migrants Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic in India: A Narrative Review","Background: The objective of this review was to identify and synthesize the findings of the existing literature that highlighted the psychosocial and mental health issues of the migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Materials and Methods: An exploration of the PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google search, and some other manual searches was undertaken so that no relevant study was missed. A search on Indian scientific literature and cross-references retrieved was also conducted to get further information. The period of the search has been one year from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021. The database was searched with the terms â€œmigrants,â€ â€œmigrant workers,â€ â€œCOVID-19 pandemic,â€ â€œlockdown,â€ â€œmigrant population,â€ â€œmental health issues,â€ â€œpsychosocial issuesâ€ to retrieve the published literature. Results: Initially, 48 research articles were retrieved and 10 of them were excluded as they had no sufficient information about mental and psychosocial challenges faced by the migrants. In the remaining 38 articles, 9 articles were original research work (n = 9) published from India related to the impact of COVID-19 on migrants. The second category consisted of editorials or commentary or letters to the editor or policy paper on psychosocial and mental health aspects of migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 17). The third category was 11 articles on perspectives or opinions or viewpoints (n = 11) related to various psychosocial and mental health issues among migrants in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. Predominantly psychosocial issues found among migrants were living conditions, basic needs, family concerns, and joblessness. The mental health issues found among migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic included psychological distress, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders. Conclusion: Existing literature from India has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the psychosocial and mental health status of the migrants in India. This review suggests the need for more research work from the affected states of India and the development of psychosocial and mental health intervention strategies to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrants.","Singh, Gurvinder Pal","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychosocial+and+Mental+Health+Issues+of+the+Migrants+Amidst+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+India:+A+Narrative+Review","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychological medicine; 43(6):473-478, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27742,""
"Behavioural insight of resident doctors into COVID-19 pandemic: A cross sectional study","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has been declared as a global pandemic by WHO. It has placed an unprecedented burden on health systems and authorities.In this complex context, their knowledge and attitude towards the pandemic can influence their psychological state and information about their behavioral insights can be valuable to ascertain effective strategies to reduce overall burden and tackle the crisis better 3. Aims: To assess knowledge, risk perceptions, preventive behaviors and psychological variables regarding COVID-19 in Resident doctors. Methodology: A list of all resident doctors working in New Civil Hospital were informed about the study and after obtaining an informed consent, they were asked to fill the WHO tool for Behavioral insight. After collecting data, statistical analysis of the data was done using appropriate Statistical test like z test, chi-square test. Results: A total of 110 doctors participated in the study.Depression was very low (14.7%) to extremely low (38.2%) in majority of doctors. In our study, 9% of the doctors attributed their psychological burden of worries and fears to losing someone close to them in the pandemic. Conclusion:Since most participants use almost all sources for gathering information about covid-19, regular updates should be provided by media and relevant authorities, regular group meetings, trainings to disseminate knowledge about guidelines and recent treatment protocols should be organized by the concerned tertiary care hospitals.","Tendolkar, S.; Panigrahi, S.; Shatadal, P.; Mehta, R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Behavioural+insight+of+resident+doctors+into+COVID-19+pandemic:+A+cross+sectional+study","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Molecular and Clinical Medicine; 9(1):1078-1091, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27743,""
"The Correlation between the Serum Level of Adropin and Blood Pressure: A Case-Control Study","Background: Hypertension is considered a fundamental health issue globally, and adropin is a vascular endothelial protection factor. The increasing prevalence of Hypertension (HTN);i.e., 20 - 50%, among adult populations in developed countries is one of the most common causes of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs). HTN is also the major modifiable risk factor for stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic). Adropin has the potential to protect the endothelium by increasing the expression of Nitric Oxide (NO) synthesis in the endothelium. Nonetheless, few studies have been conducted on the role of adropin in regulating blood pressure. Objectives: The present study aimed to assess the adropin level and its relationship with blood pressure. Methods: The present observational, case-control study was conducted on 40 hypertensive and 40 non-hypertensive patients. The patients' data such as gender, age, years passed since HTN diagnosis, and blood pressure were recorded by the researcher. Then, adropin was measured by the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technique. After all, the significance of the relationship between the variables was statistically analyzed. Results: The mean level of adropin was 5.44 +/- 1.31 pg/mL in the study population. This measure was 4.91 pg/mL in the case group and 5.98 pg/mL in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01). The results of ANCOVA showed that mean level of adropin was 1.19 units (24.5%) lower in the case group than in the control group after adjusting for age. The results also revealed a significant difference in the mean adropin level of the hypertensive patients based on the years passed since diagnosis (P &lt; 0.01). Moreover, a negative correlation was observed between the adropin level and systolic blood pressure (rs = -0.273, n = 80, P = 0.014) and diastolic blood pressure (rs = - 0.273, n = 80, P = 0.008). However, no significant correlation was found between age and adropin level (rs = -0.173, n = 80, P = 0.124). Conclusions: Hypertensive patients had lower adropin levels in comparison to non-hypertensive ones. In addition, increase in the number of years passed since diagnosis was associated with decreased adropin levels.","Vase, M.; Taheri, A.; Hemmati, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Correlation+between+the+Serum+Level+of+Adropin+and+Blood+Pressure:+A+Case-Control+Study","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Cardiovascular Research Journal; 15(3):101-104, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27744,""

"Annular scars with hyperpigmentation","The true prevalence is likely higher, based on hospitalization rates for physical abuse and adult reports of childhood physical abuse from other entities.3,4 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused loss of income and increased social isolation, both of which exacerbate the risk of child maltreatment.4 Recent data reveal a decline in both official reports to CPS agencies and the number of ED visits related to maltreatment, but the percentage of hospitalizations for child abuse and neglect rose from the previous year.4 This trend in data may be attributed to decreased in-person contact between children and mandated reporters, as well as a shift in health care-seeking patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting decline in the total number of ED visits.4 These concerning findings suggest that the severity of child abuse injuries has remained the same or worsened.4 The law requires that injuries that are suspicious for neglect or abuse be reported to state CPS agencies. ""1 This federal legislation provides a foundation for identifying child maltreatment, but each state has its own definition of child abuse and neglect that influences the recognition and reporting of child physical abuse.1,3 Personal and cultural experiences also influence recognition and reporting.3 Child physical abuse can result in permanently disfiguring injuries.3 Children who experience physical abuse are at greater risk of developing behavioral problems including conduct disorders, aggression, and depression.3 Victims of child physical abuse are more likely to begin use of tobacco and drugs as adolescents and report chronic physical and mental health diseases as adults.3 There are many factors related to the parent, child, and environment that increase the risk of child physical abuse. Required reporting As stated earlier, when a history and/ or physical examination prompts reasonable suspicion for physical abuse, pediatric providers are mandated by law to make a report to local CPS agencies.3 Mandatory reporting laws do not require freedom of doubt of physical abuse, and states must provide immunity from prosecution even if the reported allegations cannot be substantiated as child abuse or neglect.3,13 However, failure to make a report can result in civil action or criminal charges against the provider or, worse, additional injury or death of the child.3 In this particular case, the child was admitted to the hospital overnight and placed in foster care by CPS while the evaluation was completed, which was the appropriate action to safeguard the patient.","York, Sarah R.

"Children with Chronic Disease during COVID-19 Pandemic and Nurses' Roles","First COVID-19 case was first reported on December 31, 2019, and has become a major public health problem, spreading from China to the whole world in just two months. All people, regardless of age, gender, or health status, were at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic measures taken in this process have led to the emergence of various obstacles in accessing quality health care for children with chronic diseases. These children faced problems such as not being able to get the necessary treatment and counseling for their illness, not being able to access rehabilitation services, not being able to benefit from tele-health services adequately, and not being able to provide the necessary equipment for the disease in sufficient number. During the pandemic nurses have responsilibities such as;providing physical activity with a balanced diet for children with chronic diseases, preserving mental health, applying the vaccination schedule suitable for the age period without interruption, continuing routine follow-ups, providing the necessary medical equipment for the treatment of chronic disease and cooperation with the school administration. In addition, they have roles to protect these children from COVID-19, such as monitoring the symptoms of COVID-19, ensuring that they wear a mask, and informing them about the ways of transmission.","Zehra, Capa MSc, Gulendam, Karadag","https://www.google.com/search?q=Children+with+Chronic+Disease+during+COVID-19+Pandemic+and+Nurses'+Roles","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Caring Sciences; 14(3):2058-2065, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27747,""

"Risks of mental health outcomes in people with covid-19: cohort study","OBJECTIVE To estimate the risks of incident mental health disorders in survivors of the acute phase of covid-19. DESIGN Cohort study. SETTING US Department of Veterans Affairs. PARTICIPANTS Cohort comprising 153 848 people who survived the first 30 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and two control groups: a contemporary group (n=5 637 840) with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2, and a historical control group (n=5 859 251) that predated the covid-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES Risks of prespecified incident mental health outcomes, calculated as hazard ratio and absolute risk difference per 1000 people at one year, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Predefined covariates and algorithmically selected high dimensional covariates were used to balance the covid-19 and control groups through inverse weighting. RESULTS The covid-19 group showed an increased risk of incident anxiety disorders (hazard ratio 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.30 to 1.39);risk difference 11.06 (95% confidence interval 9.64 to 12.53) per 1000 people at one year), depressive disorders (1.39 (1.34 to 1.43);15.12 (13.38 to 16.91) per 1000 people at one year), stress and adjustment disorders (1.38 (1.34 to 1.43);13.29 (11.71 to 14.92) per 1000 people at one year), and use of antidepressants (1.55 (1.50 to 1.60);21.59 (19.63 to 23.60) per 1000 people at one year) and benzodiazepines (1.65 (1.58 to 1.72);10.46 (9.37 to 11.61) per 1000 people at one year). The risk of incident opioid prescriptions also increased (1.76 (1.71 to 1.81);35.90 (33.61 to 38.25) per 1000 people at one year), opioid use disorders (1.34 (1.21 to 1.48);0.96 (0.59 to 1.37) per 1000 people at one year), and other (non-opioid) substance use disorders (1.20 (1.15 to 1.26);4.34 (3.22 to 5.51) per 1000 people at one year). The covid-19 group also showed an increased risk of incident neurocognitive decline (1.80 (1.72 to 1.89);10.75 (9.65 to 11.91) per 1000 people at one year) and sleep disorders (1.41 (1.38 to 1.45);23.80 (21.65 to 26.00) per 1000 people at one year). The risk of any incident mental health diagnosis or prescription was increased (1.60 (1.55 to 1.66);64.38 (58.90 to 70.01) per 1000 people at one year). The risks of examined outcomes were increased even among people who were not admitted to hospital and were highest among those who were admitted to hospital during the acute phase of covid-19. Results were consistent with those in the historical control group. The risk of incident mental health disorders was consistently higher in the covid-19 group in comparisons of people with covid-19 not admitted to hospital versus those not admitted to hospital for seasonal influenza, admitted to hospital with covid-19 versus admitted to hospital with seasonal influenza, and admitted to hospital with covid-19 versus admitted to hospital for any other cause. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that people who survive the acute phase of covid-19 are at increased risk of an array of incident mental health disorders.

"COVID-19-related stress in postpartum women from Argentina during the second wave in 2021: Identification of impairing and protective factors","Postpartum women are a vulnerable population to pandemic stressors that challenge their psychological well-being. Thus, reliable and valid instruments are necessary to measure pandemic-related stress and to identify risk and protective factors. This work aimed to assess psychometric properties of the COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Stress Scale (PSS-10-C) and associations of maternal pandemic stress with demographic, reproductive and pandemic factors of Argentinian postpartum women during the second COVID-19 wave. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from April to June 2021. Online recruitment of postpartum women was carried out during the second wave of COVID-19 in Argentina. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and had the corresponding ethical approval. This study was performed on 300 women, aged 18-49 years, up to 12 months postpartum in Argentina. Stress was assessed with PSS-10-C, with a sociodemographic questionnaire being used to collect demographic, reproductive and pandemic variables. Statistical analysis included psychometric procedures, structural equation modeling, and multiple regressions. PSS-10-C was a reliable and structurally valid instrument with two subscales, with entire scale, Stress and Coping subscales scoring 17.31 (6.52), 9.70 (4.61) and 7.61 (2.77), respectively. History of mood disorders, pregnancy loss, and unhealthy child during the pandemic predisposed to increased stress (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 0.10, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05), whereas having work and practicing breastfeeding promoted coping to face it (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â -0.13, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). This situation was impaired by mood changes, loss of happiness, economic changes, fear of contracting COVID-19 -own or by a loved one- (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 0.11, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). The study highlighted the vulnerability of postpartum women's mental health in the pandemic context, with PSS-10-C being a useful instrument for clinicians and researchers to assess perceived stress.

"Association of Global Cognitive Function with Psychological Distress and Adherence to Public Health Recommendations during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Women's Health Initiative","The association of cognitive function with symptoms of psychological distress during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or adherence to COVID-19 protective health behaviors is not well understood. We examined 2,890 older women from the Women's Health Initiative cohort. Pre-pandemic (i.e., within 12 months prior to pandemic onset) and peri-pandemic global cognitive function scores were assessed with the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m). Anxiety, stress, and depressive symptom severity during the pandemic were assessed using validated questionnaires. We examined adherence to protective behaviors that included safe hygiene, social distancing, mask wearing, and staying home. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, education, region of residence, alcohol intake, and comorbidities. Every five-point lower pre-pandemic TICS-m score was associated with 0.33-point mean higher (95% CI, 0.20,0.45) perceived stress, and 0.20-point mean higher (95% CI, 0.07,0.32) depressive symptom severity during the pandemic. Higher depressive symptom severity, but not anxiety or perceived stress, was associated with a 0.69-point (95% CI, -1.13, -0.25) mean decline in TICS-m from the pre- to peri-pandemic period. Every five-point lower peri-pandemic TICS-m score was associated with 12% lower odds (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80,0.97) of practicing safe hygiene. Among older women, we observed that: 1) lower pre-pandemic global cognitive function was associated with higher stress and depressive symptom severity during the pandemic; 2) higher depressive symptom severity during the pandemic was associated with cognitive decline; and 3) lower global cognitive function during the pandemic was associated with lower odds of practicing safe hygiene.","Shadyab, Larson, Rapp, Shumaker, Kroenke, Meliker, Saquib, Ikramuddin, Michael, Goveas, Garcia, Wactawski-Wende, Luo, Hayden, Chen, Weitlauf, Baker","https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glac053","20220302","SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27752,""
"Perceptions of green space usage, abundance, and quality of green space were associated with better mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among residents of Denver","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted both physical and mental health. This study aimed to understand whether exposure to green space buffered against stress and distress during the COVID-19 pandemic while taking into account significant stressors of the pandemic. We leveraged a cross-sectional survey on green space exposure and mental health among residents of Denver, CO that ran from November 2019 through January 2021. We measured objective green space as the average NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) from aerial imagery within 300m and 500m of the participant's residence. Perceived green space was measured through Likert scores on five questions about vegetation near the home that captured perceived abundance, visibility, access, usage, and quality of green space. We used generalized linear models to assess the relationship between each green space exposure variable and perceived stress (PSS-4), depression (CES-D-10), or anxiety (MMPI-2) adjusted for sociodemographic and COVID-19 impact variables. We found significantly higher depression scores for all covid periods compared to the ""before covid"" period, and significantly higher anxiety scores during the ""fall wave"" compared to earlier periods. Adjusted for sociodemographic and pandemic stressors, we found that spending a lot of time in green space (usage) was significantly associated with lower anxiety and depression. We also observed significantly lower depression scores associated with NDVI in both buffers (objective abundance) and significantly lower anxiety scores with perceived abundance of green space. There was some evidence of lower anxiety scores for people reporting having high quality green spaces near the home (quality). We did not observe significant associations for any green space metric and perceived stress after adjustment for confounding variables. Our work provides further evidence of mental health benefits associated with green space exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic even after adjustment for sociodemographic variables and significant pandemic-related stressors.","Reid, Rieves, Carlson","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263779","20220302","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27753,""
"Missense variants in human ACE2 strongly affect binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike providing a mechanism for ACE2 mediated genetic risk in Covid-19: A case study in affinity predictions of interface variants","SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Spike) binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the strength of this interaction could influence parameters relating to virulence. To explore whether population variants in ACE2 influence Spike binding and hence infection, we selected 10 ACE2 variants based on affinity predictions and prevalence in gnomAD and measured their affinities and kinetics for Spike receptor binding domain through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 37Ã‚Â°C. We discovered variants that reduce and enhance binding, including three ACE2 variants that strongly inhibited (p.Glu37Lys, ÃŽâ€ÃŽâ€G = -1.33 Ã‚Â± 0.15 kcal mol-1 and p.Gly352Val, predicted ÃŽâ€ÃŽâ€G = -1.17 kcal mol-1) or abolished (p.Asp355Asn) binding. We also identified two variants with distinct population distributions that enhanced affinity for Spike. ACE2 p.Ser19Pro (ÃŽâ€ÃŽâ€G = 0.59 Ã‚Â± 0.08 kcal mol-1) is predominant in the gnomAD African cohort (AF = 0.003) whilst p.Lys26Arg (ÃŽâ€ÃŽâ€G = 0.26 Ã‚Â± 0.09 kcal mol-1) is predominant in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AF = 0.01) and European non-Finnish (AF = 0.006) cohorts. We compared ACE2 variant affinities to published SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infectivity data and confirmed that ACE2 variants with reduced affinity for Spike can protect cells from infection. The effect of variants with enhanced Spike affinity remains unclear, but we propose a mechanism whereby these alleles could cause greater viral spreading across tissues and cell types, as is consistent with emerging understanding regarding the interplay between receptor affinity and cell-surface abundance. Finally, we compared mCSM-PPI2 ÃŽâ€ÃŽâ€G predictions against our SPR data to assess the utility of predictions in this system. We found that predictions of decreased binding were well-correlated with experiment and could be improved by calibration, but disappointingly, predictions of highly enhanced binding were unreliable. Recalibrated predictions for all possible ACE2 missense variants at the Spike interface were calculated and used to estimate the overall burden of ACE2 variants on Covid-19.","MacGowan, Barton, Kutuzov, Dushek, van der Merwe, Barton","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009922","20220302","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27754,""
"Assets, stressors, and symptoms of persistent depression over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been accompanied by an increase in depression in U.S. adults. Previous literature suggests that having assets may protect against depression. Using a nationally representative longitudinal panel survey of U.S. adults studied in March and April 2020 and in March and April 2021, we found that (i) 20.3% of U.S. adults reported symptoms of persistent depression in Spring 2020 and Spring 2021, (ii) having more assets was associated with lower symptoms of persistent depression, with financial assets-household income and savings-most strongly associated, and (iii) while having assets appeared to protect persons-in particular those without stressors-from symptoms of persistent depression over the COVID-19 pandemic, having assets did not appear to reduce the effects of job loss, financial difficulties, or relationship stress on symptoms of persistent depression. Efforts to reduce population depression should consider the role played by assets in shaping risk of symptoms of persistent depression.","Ettman, Cohen, Abdalla, Trinquart, Castrucci, Bork, Clark, Wilson, Vivier, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abm9737","20220302","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27755,""
"Interruptions in Mental Health Care, Cannabis Use, Depression, and Anxiety during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a Cohort of HIV-Positive and HIV-Negative MSM in Los Angeles, California","The objective was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care, cannabis use, and behaviors that increase the risk of STIs among men living with or at high risk for HIV. Data were from mSTUDY - a cohort of men who have sex with men in Los Angeles, California. Participants who were 18 to 45Ã‚Â years and a half were HIV-positive. mSTUDY started in 2014, and at baseline and semiannual visits, information was collected on substance use, mental health, and sexual behaviors. We analyzed data from 737 study visits from March 2020 through August 2021. Compared to visits prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant increases in depressive symptomatology (CES-DÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°16) and anxiety (GAD-7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10). These increases were highest immediately following the start of the pandemic and reverted to pre-pandemic levels within 17Ã‚Â months. Interruptions in mental health care were associated with higher substance use (especially cannabis) for managing anxiety/depression related to the pandemic (50% vs. 31%; p-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). Cannabis use for managing pandemic-related anxiety/depression was higher among those reporting changes in sexual activity (53% vs. 36%; p-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and was independently associated with having more than one sex partner in the prior 2Ã‚Â weeks (adjusted ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.5; 95% CI 1.0-2.4). Our findings indicate increases in substance use, in particular cannabis, linked directly to experiences resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated interruptions in mental health care. Strategies that deliver services without direct client contact are essential for populations at high risk for negative sexual and mental health outcomes.","Javanbakht, Rosen, Ragsdale, Richter, Shoptaw, Gorbach","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-022-00607-9","20220302","Anxiety; Cannabis use; Depression; MSM","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27756,""
"Molecular variants of SARS-CoV-2: antigenic properties and current vaccine efficacy","An ongoing pandemic of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 has puzzled many scientists and health care policymakers around the globe. The appearance of the virus was accompanied by several distinct antigenic changes, specifically spike protein which is a key element for host cell entry of virus and major target of currently developing vaccines. Some of these mutations enable the virus to attach to receptors more firmly and easily. Moreover, a growing number of trials are demonstrating higher transmissibility and, in some of them, potentially more serious forms of illness related to novel variants. Some of these lineages, especially the Beta variant of concern, were reported to diminish the neutralizing activity of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies present in both convalescent and vaccine sera. This could imply that these independently emerged variants could make antiviral strategies prone to serious threats. The rapid changes in the mutational profile of new clades, especially escape mutations, suggest the convergent evolution of the virus due to immune pressure. Nevertheless, great international efforts have been dedicated to producing efficacious vaccines with cutting-edge technologies. Despite the partial decrease in vaccines efficacy against worrisome clades, most current vaccines are still effective at preventing mild to severe forms of disease and hospital admission or death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we summarize existing evidence about newly emerged variants of SARS-CoV-2 and, notably, how well vaccines work against targeting new variants and modifications of highly flexible mRNA vaccines that might be required in the future.","Rayati Damavandi, Dowran, Al Sharif, Kashanchi, Jafari","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-022-00729-6","20220302","COVID-19; Escape mutations; Neutralizing activity; SARS-CoV-2; Spike protein; Vaccines efficacy; Variants of concern","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27757,""

"Acquired Von Willebrand Syndrome and Desmopressin Resistance During Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Patients With COVID-19: A Prospective Observational Study","Although COVID-19 is associated with high von Willebrand factor (vWF) parameters promoting thrombosis, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO) is associated with the development of acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) promoting bleeding. This study was designed to assess both the incidence and severity of AVWS in COVID-19 patients undergoing vvECMO, and the benefit of comprehensive vWF analyses. Prospective observational study. ICU at a tertiary-care center. Twenty-seven consecutive COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring vvECMO. Comprehensive vWF analyses (including sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were performed before, during, and after vvECMO. In a subgroup of 12 patients with AVWS, effectiveness of treatment with desmopressin was assessed. The patients' mean age was 53 years (range, 23-73), 70% were male, and all had various comorbidities. Following markedly elevated vwf antigen (vWF: Ag; mean, 546% (SD, 282]), vWF collagen binding capacity (mean, 469% [SD, 271]), vWF activity (vWF:A; mean, 383% [SD, 132]), and factor VIII activity (mean, 302% [SD, 106]), and only borderline decreases in high-molecular-weight (HMW) vWF multimers before vvECMO, all of these variables decreased and HMW vWF multimers became undetectable within hours following initiation of vvECMO. All variables fully recovered within 3-38 hours after discontinuation of vvECMO. During vvECMO, decreases in the vWF:A/vWF:Ag ratio correlated with absent HMW vWF multimers. Desmopressin did not affect vWF parameters. In patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS, AVWS developed soon after initiation of vvECMO. The vWF:A/vWF:Ag ratio was a suitable screening test for AVWS. As desmopressin was ineffective, bleeding during vvECMO-associated AVWS should preferably be treated with concentrates containing vWF.","Kalbhenn, Glonnegger, Buchsel, Priebe, Zieger","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000005467","20220302","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27759,""
"Sleep and Circadian Health of Critical COVID-19 Survivors 3 Months After Hospital Discharge","To evaluate the sleep and circadian rest-activity pattern of critical COVID-19 survivors 3 months after hospital discharge. Observational, prospective study. Single-center study. One hundred seventy-two consecutive COVID-19 survivors admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Seven days of actigraphy for sleep and circadian rest-activity pattern assessment; validated questionnaires; respiratory tests at the 3-month follow-up. The cohort included 172 patients, mostly males (67.4%) with a median (25th-75th percentile) age of 61.0 years (52.8-67.0 yr). The median number of days at the ICU was 11.0 (6.00-24.0), and 51.7% of the patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). According to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 60.5% presented poor sleep quality 3 months after hospital discharge, which was further confirmed by actigraphy. Female sex was associated with an increased score in the PSQI (p &lt; 0.05) and IMV during ICU stay was able to predict a higher fragmentation of the rest-activity rhythm at the 3-month follow-up (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, compromised mental health measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was associated with poor sleep quality (p &lt; 0.001). Our findings highlight the importance of considering sleep and circadian health after hospital discharge. Within this context, IMV during the ICU stay could aid in predicting an increased fragmentation of the rest-activity rhythm at the 3-month follow-up. Furthermore, compromised mental health could be a marker for sleep disruption at the post-COVID period.","Benitez, Moncusi-Moix, Vaca, Gort-Paniello, Minguez, Santisteve, Carmona, Torres, Fagotti, Labarca, Torres, Gonzalez, de Gonzalo-Calvo, Barbe, Targa","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000005476","20220302","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27760,""

The significant association observed in the first two models between mental health and number of days consuming five or more servings of fruits and vegetables became non-significant after inclusion of self-rated health. <b>Conclusion:</b> The relationship between mental health and physical activity and diet reaffirms a need for healthcare providers to promote the importance of maintaining both a healthy physical activity level and a nutrient-rich diet in the face of challenging circumstances, such as a global pandemic.","Andersen, Rowland, Gloster, Willis, Hernandez, Felix, Long, McElfish","https://doi.org/10.1177/02601060221082362","20220302","Dietary consumption; mental health assessment; pandemic; physical activity; self-reported health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27761,""
"Socioeconomic correlates of health outcomes and mental health disparity in a sample of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","To investigate socioeconomic, behavioural and healthcare delivery factors that are associated with health outcomes of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among underserved cancer patients. Cancer patients are at a higher risk of adverse physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic than those without cancer. Cross-sectional online survey. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines in this study. The sample comprised 322 individuals diagnosed with incident cancer between January 2019 and January 2020. Demographically, 64% were female, 49% had a college degree, 12% were African American, and 88% were White (77% of the Whites were from metropolitan and 23% from nonmetropolitan areas). Descriptive analysis and multivariable regression analyses of global health status, depression and irritability were performed. After adjusting for demographic variables and comorbidity, the feelings of loneliness, crowded living space, lower confidence in taking preventive measures and less satisfaction with telehealth visits were significantly associated with poorer global health, depression and irritability. Daily exercise was associated with better global health, and difficulty in getting medicine was associated with depression and irritability. Moreover, African Americans who felt lonely reported more depression and irritability and those who had less confidence in taking preventive measures reported more irritability than Whites. Respondents having low income and feeling lonely reported more depression than others. In this study, socioeconomic factors (e.g. loneliness or crowded living conditions) were as important to health outcomes during the pandemic as behavioural (e.g. prevention and exercises) and quality-of-care factors (e.g. telehealth, access to medicine). Disparity was more pronounced in the mental health of African Americans and those with low incomes.

"On the single and multiple associations of COVID-19 post-acute sequelae: 6-month prospective cohort study","Medical research is progressing to clarify the full spectrum of sub-acute and long-term effects of the post-COVID-19 syndrome. However, most manuscripts published to date only analyze the effects of post-COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital, which may induce significant bias. Here, we propose a pioneering study to analyze the single and multiple associations between post-COVID-19 characteristics with up to 6-months of follow-up in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The cohort study was conducted from May to October 2020 at the University Hospital Virgen de la Nieves, the leading hospital assigned for patients with COVID-19 in Granada, Spain. A total of 372 and 217 patients-with 217 and 207 included in the first and second follow-up visits-were referred 2 and 6Ã‚Â months after diagnosing COVID-19, respectively. We find out that post-COVID-19 clinical and mental health impairment symptoms are correlated with patient gender. Logistic adjustments showed strong statistically robust single and multiple associations of demographic, clinical, mental health, X-ray, laboratory indices, and pulmonary function variables. The functional lung tests are good predictors of chest CT imaging abnormalities in elderly patients.

"Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms among patients with mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive public health concerns, posing significant challenges to healthcare services. One particular area of concern is the mental health of patients with mental disorder, who are often a neglected group. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of, and associated factors for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among patients with mental disorder in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reported questionnaires were distributed to patients in four psychiatric hospitals in Beijing, China, between April 28th and May 30th, 2020. Information regarding sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related factors, support, psychosomatic factors, and PTSD symptoms were collected using a series of scales, such as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, and so on. Multivariate regression was used to identify factors related to PTSD symptoms. A total of 1,055 patients with mental disorder were included in the final sample. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 41.3%. Hierarchical linear regression demonstrated that fear of the pandemic and anxiety were shared associated factors for both symptoms of PTSD and their subscales.

"Association Between Increased Dispensing of Opioid Agonist Therapy Take-Home Doses and Opioid Overdose and Treatment Interruption and Discontinuation","During the COVID-19 pandemic, modified guidance for opioid agonist therapy (OAT) allowed prescribers to increase the number of take-home doses to promote treatment retention. Whether this was associated with an increased risk of overdose is unclear. To evaluate whether increased take-home doses of OAT early in the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with treatment retention and opioid-related harm. A retrospective propensity-weighted cohort study of 21Ã¢â‚¬Â¯297 people actively receiving OAT on March 21, 2020, in Ontario, Canada. Changes in OAT take-home dose frequency were assessed between March 22, 2020, and April 21, 2020, and individuals were observed for up to 180 days to assess outcomes (last date of follow-up, October 18, 2020). Exposure was defined as extended take-home doses in the first month of the pandemic within each of 4 cohorts based on OAT type and baseline take-home dose frequency (daily dispensed methadone, 5-6 take-home doses of methadone, daily dispensed buprenorphine/naloxone, and 5-6 take-home doses of buprenorphine/naloxone). Primary outcomes were opioid overdose, interruption in OAT, and OAT discontinuation. Among 16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯862 methadone and 4435 buprenorphine/naloxone recipients, the median age ranged between 38 and 42 years, and 29.1% to 38.2% were women. Among individuals receiving daily dispensed methadone (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5852), initiation of take-home doses was significantly associated with lower risks of opioid overdose (6.9% vs 9.5%/person-year; weighted hazard ratio [HR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.96]), treatment discontinuation (51.0% vs 63.6%/person-year; weighted HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.72-0.90]), and treatment interruption (19.0% vs 23.9%/person-year; weighted HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]) compared with no change in take-home doses. Among individuals receiving daily dispensed buprenorphine/naloxone (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°662), there was no significant difference in any outcomes between exposure groups. Among individuals receiving weekly dispensed OAT (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯010 for methadone; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3773 for buprenorphine/naloxone), extended take-home methadone doses were significantly associated with lower risks of OAT discontinuation (14.1% vs 19.6%/person-year; weighted HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.62-0.84]) and interruption in therapy (5.1% vs 7.4%/person-year; weighted HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53-0.90]), and extended take-home doses of buprenorphine/naloxone were significantly associated with lower risk of interruption in therapy (9.5% vs 12.9%/person-year; weighted HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.99]) compared with no change in take-home doses. Other primary outcomes were not significantly different between groups. In Ontario, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic, dispensing of increased take-home doses of opioid agonist therapy was significantly associated with lower rates of treatment interruption and discontinuation among some subsets of patients receiving opioid agonist therapy, and there were no statistically significant increases in opioid-related overdoses over 6 months of follow-up. These findings may be susceptible to residual confounding and should be interpreted cautiously.","Gomes, Campbell, Kitchen, Garg, Bozinoff, Men, Tadrous, Munro, Antoniou, Werb, Wyman","https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2022.1271","20220302","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27768,""
"Suicide Deaths Before and During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: An Interrupted Time-series Study","With stressors that are often associated with suicide increasing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been concern that suicide mortality rates may also be increasing. Our objective was to determine whether suicide mortality rates increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an interrupted time-series study using data from January 2019 through December 2020 from 2 large integrated health care systems. The population at risk included all patients or individuals enrolled in a health plan at HealthPartners in Minnesota or Henry Ford Health System in Michigan. The primary outcome was change in suicide mortality rates, expressed as annualized crude rates of suicide death per 100,000 people in 10 months following the start of the pandemic in March 2020 compared with the 14 months prior. There were 6,434,675 people at risk in the sample, with 55% women and a diverse sample across ages, race/ethnicity, and insurance type. From January 2019 through February 2020, there was a slow increase in the suicide mortality rate, with rates then decreasing by 0.45 per 100,000 people per month from March 2020 through December 2020 (SE=0.19, P=0.03). Overall suicide mortality rates did not increase with the pandemic, and in fact slightly declined from March to December 2020. Our findings should be confirmed across other settings and, when available, using final adjudicated state mortality data.","Rossom, Penfold, Owen-Smith, Simon, Ahmedani","https://doi.org/10.1097/MLR.0000000000001700","20220301","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27769,""
"Veterans' Perinatal Care and Mental Health Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Examination of the Role of Prior Trauma and Pandemic-Related Stressors","<b><i>Background:</i></b> Many pregnant and postpartum Veterans have experienced multiple lifetime traumas, including military sexual trauma, intimate partner violence, and combat trauma. These women may be particularly vulnerable to increased post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health problems following additional trauma exposures or stressful events, such as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study sought to examine the impact of prior trauma exposures on the lived experience of pregnant and postpartum Veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Pregnant Veterans at 15 VA medical centers were surveyed at 20 weeks of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum asked about their COVID-19-related perinatal and mental health experiences, as well as the stressors that impacted them as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Overall, 111 women Veterans completed both the pregnancy and postpartum surveys that included COVID-19 items. Sixty percent of our sample had experienced at least one potentially traumatic lifetime event, with 22% of our sample experiencing two or more of the included exposures. Women with a trauma history had 3.5 times increased odds of reporting their mental health as ""much worse"" compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-11.75) and were more likely to report that COVID-19 negatively affected their mental or emotional health ""a lot"" compared with women without a trauma history (odds ratio: 8.5; 95% CI: 1.93-37.48). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> COVID-19 has had a significant impact on pregnant and postpartum Veterans' mental health. Obstetricians should consider strategies to ensure women have access to mental health care during pregnancy, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Hospitals should also consider the importance of labor support companions during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine adjusting policies to allow for at least one labor support companion during labor and delivery.","Mattocks, Kroll-Desrosiers, Marteeny, Walker, Vogt, Iversen, Bastian","https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2021.0209","20220301","COVID-19; Veterans; access to care; perinatal care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27770,""
"The mental distress of our youth in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","Epidemiological evidence from population-based surveys suggest that the psychological well-being of adolescents has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic itself, as well as by the safety measures implemented. The rationale of the study was to investigate the influence of the pandemic on psychiatric emergency service use, psychiatric admissions rates, emotional well-being, suicidality and self-harm behaviour in help-seeking children and adolescents. Retrospective cohort study of electronic patient records before and during the COVID-19 pandemic from the emergency out-patient facility of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Psychiatric University Hospital ZÃƒÂ¼rich. The frequency of all emergency service contacts from 1 January 2019 to 31 June 2021 were described and the frequency of records compared in half-year intervals. Emotional well-being, behavioural problems, suicidality and self-harm were estimated based on the mental state examination notes of electronic patient records from the 1 March to the 30 April for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. After an initial decline in emergency contacts at the beginning of the first lockdown, the use of the centralised emergency service increased during the subsequent months and has since stabilised at a significantly higher level than before the pandemic. Comparison of emergency contacts in the first half of 2019 with the first half of 2021 shows that the number of emergency phone contacts nearly doubled, emergency outpatient assessments increased by 40%, emergency bridging interventions increased by 230%, and inpatient admissions of minors to adult psychiatric inpatient units more than doubled because of lack of service capacity in child and adolescent psychiatry. The proportion of adolescents who reported suicidal ideation increased significantly by 15%, from 69% to 84%, and the proportion of adolescents who reported self-harm behaviour increased by 17%, from 31% to 48%. We found a significant increase in psychiatric service use, as well as in reported serious mental health symptoms such as suicidality and self-harm behaviour in help-seeking children and adolescents in the course of the pandemic. The child and adolescent psychiatric healthcare system is overburdened and down-referral of adolescents in need of ongoing therapy is becoming increasingly difficult. We recommend prioritising preventive and therapeutic measures to support the mental health of our children and adolescents alongside the somatic management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Berger, HÃƒÂ¤berling, Lustenberger, Probst, Franscini, Pauli, Walitza","https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2022.w30142","20220302","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27771,""

This cross-sectional telephone study involved Parkinson's disease patients who had at least one control examination at University Hospital Center Rijeka in 2020 and were Croatian citizens. A questionnaire was used to obtain data on the socio-demographic characteristics and the severity of motor, anxiety, depression, and non-motor symptoms. The final sample included 87 patients. Most patients reported subjective worsening of motor symptoms. Patients who lived alone had worse motor scores than those not living alone. The majority of patients reported worsening of anxiety symptoms. Significant worsening of anxiety symptoms was found in patients who lived alone, had a longer disease duration, and had avoided check-ups. Fewer patients had depression symptoms than motor and anxiety symptoms. Significantly higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were observed in patients with a longer disease duration. Significant worsening of non-motor symptoms was identified in patients who lived alone, were less educated, had a longer disease duration, and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index. Patients who live alone, have longer disease duration, are less educated, avoid check-ups, and have more comorbidities are more vulnerable to the negative effects of social isolation.","Hero, RoÃ…Â¾mariÃ„â€¡, Ã…Â ukunda, PapiÃ„â€¡, RaÃ„Âki, VuletiÃ„â€¡","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effect+of+the+coronavirus+disease+2019+pandemic+on+people+with+Parkinson's+disease:+experience+from+a+Croatian+regional+center.","20220302","COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Pandemics; Parkinson Disease; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27772,""
"Mental health effects prevalence in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review","The COVID-19 pandemic health crisis has changed household and school routines leaving children and adolescents without important anchors in life. This, in turn, can influence their mental health, changing their behavioral and psychological conditions. To systematically review the literature to answer the question: ""What is the worldwide prevalence of mental health effects in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic?"". Embase, Epistemonikos database, LILACS, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and World Health Organization Global literature on coronavirus disease were searched. Grey literature was searched on Google Scholar, Grey Literature Report, and Preprint server MedRxiv. Observational studies assessing the prevalence of mental health effects in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Four authors independently collected the information and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. From a total of 11,925 identified studies, 2873Ã‚Â remained after the removal of the duplicated records. Nineteen studies remained after the final selection process. The proportion of emotional symptoms and behavior changes varied from 5.7% to 68.5%; anxiety 17.6% to 43.7%, depression 6.3% to 71.5%, and stress 7% to 25%. Other outcomes such as the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (85.5%) and suicidal ideation (29.7% to 31.3%) were also evaluated. Overall findings showed that the proportion of children and adolescents presenting mental health effects during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a wide variation in different countries.

"Effects of a multimodal approach to food art therapy on people with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia","Food art therapy (FAT) has multiple modalities in which cognition, emotion, and social changes are stimulated. The purpose of this study was to design a multimodal approach to a food art therapy (MM-FAT) program and identify its effects on cognitive ability, daily living functioning, depression, self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-expression, and social functioning in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia by employing a mixed methods research design. The participants included 39 patients from a public dementia care centre in Seoul, Korea. The intervention group, which comprised 20 participants, received 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°MM-FAT sessions 3 times a week for 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks, and the control group, which included 19 participants, received usual care. The MM-FAT program was evaluated based on its effectiveness on cognitive, daily living, emotional, and social functioning outcome measures at three time points using repeated measures analysis of variance. Semi-structured interviews (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9) were conducted to evaluate the overall experience of the MM-FAT program and its outcomes. The findings reveal that MM-FAT has a positive effect on the cognitive, emotional, and social functioning of individuals with MCI and mild dementia. However, there were no enhancements in individuals' daily living functioning, and the lasting effects of the intervention could not be assessed. Cognition and depression increased significantly at the end of the MM-FAT program. Self-expression and self-efficacy were significantly higher in the MM-FAT group than in the control group. The semi-structured interviews revealed improvements in participants' behaviour, communication, and interaction. This mixed methods study focused on individuals with MCI or mild dementia contributes to an understanding of the effectiveness of a FAT program employing a multimodal approach. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was able to enrich the effects of MM-FAT on cognitive, emotional, and social functioning through qualitative findings.","Lee, Kim, Yoon","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12822","20220301","art therapy; combined modality therapy; dementia; food; mild cognitive impairment; nonpharmacological intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27774,""

"COVID-19 infection and neurodegeneration: Computational evidence for interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and monoamine oxidase enzymes","Although COVID-19 has been primarily associated with pneumonia, recent data show that its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, can infect many vital organs beyond the lungs, including the heart, kidneys and the brain. The literature agrees that COVID-19 is likely to have long-term mental health effects on infected individuals, which signifies a need to understand the role of the virus in the pathophysiology of brain disorders that is currently unknown and widely debated. Our docking and molecular dynamic simulations show that the affinity of the spike protein from the wild type (WT) and the South African B.1.351 (SA) variant towards MAO enzymes is comparable to that for its ACE2 receptor. This allows for the WT/SAÃ¢Ë†â„¢Ã¢Ë†â„¢Ã¢Ë†â„¢MAO complex formation, which changes MAO affinities for their neurotransmitter substrates, thereby impacting their metabolic conversion and misbalancing their levels. Knowing that this fine regulation is strongly linked with the etiology of various brain pathologies, these results are the first to highlight the possibility that the interference with the brain MAO catalytic activity is responsible for the increased neurodegenerative illnesses following a COVID-19 infection, thus placing a neurobiological link between these two conditions in the spotlight. Since the obtained insight suggests that a more contagious SA variant causes even larger disturbances, and with new and more problematic strains likely emerging in the near future, we firmly advise that the presented prospect of the SARS-CoV-2 induced neurological complications should not be ignored, but rather requires further clinical investigations to achieve an early diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.","Hok, Rimac, Mavri, Vianello","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2022.02.020","20220302","Brain amines; Molecular dynamic simulations; Neurodegeneration; Neurotransmitters; SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; South African B.1.351 variant","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27776,""
"A Brief Gratitude Writing Intervention Decreased Stress and Negative Affect During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Exploring ways to mitigate the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic is important for long-term health. Expressive and gratitude-focused writing are effective methods to help individuals process traumatic or stressful events. Gratitude-focused writing may yield additional benefits because it helps individuals appraise events positively. We hypothesized that an online gratitude writing intervention would yield greater benefits than an expressive writing intervention or control group. Participants were randomized to one of three groups and completed assessments one-week and one-month post-intervention. The gratitude writing group maintained gratitude levels and decreased stress and negative affect at one-month post-intervention. The expressive writing group decreased in gratitude and showed no changes in stress or negative affect at one-month post-intervention. The control group decreased in gratitude and negative affect and showed no changes in stress at one-month post-intervention.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 ""Infodemic"" on Well-Being: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic created a crisis in the world of information and digital literacy. The amount of misinformation surrounding COVID-19 that has circulated through social media (SM) since January 2020 is notably significant and has been linked to rising levels of anxiety and fear amongst SM users. This study aimed to assess SM practices during COVID-19 and investigated their impact on users' well-being. An online survey was distributed between June 10 and July 31 2020 via different SM platforms in the United Arab Emirates and other Arabic-speaking countries. Adults above 18 years of age who spoke Arabic or English were invited to complete the survey which covered multiple domains, use and practices related to social media platforms and mental health questions, including the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. Out of 993 participants, 73% were females, 76% were non-Emirati, 91% were university graduates, and 50% were employed in various occupations, of which 20% were health care professionals. Participants indicated that they acquired COVID-19 related information primarily from social media and messaging applications of which WhatsApp was the most used. Most participants reported sharing information after verification. The mean well-being score was 12.6 Ã‚Â±5.6, with 49% of participants reporting poor well-being (WHO-5 score &lt;12.5). Adjusted linear regression showed that Facebook usage was negatively associated with well-being scores. Additionally, high time use was associated with poorer well-being. When adjusting for other factors, including low confidence in information around COVID-19 and poor knowledge overall, SM usage was significantly associated with poorer well-being. The study sheds light on the use of SM during the pandemic and its impact on well-being throughout the novel coronavirus pandemic. Social media practices during emergencies and disasters may impact public well-being. Authorities are advised to step in to minimize the spread of misinformation and more frequent use of social media as it may influence well-being.

"Year of Zoom in a Year of Doom: Lessons Learned Delivering ERP Remotely During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and consequential shutdown measures, many mental health professionals started providing therapy to patients exclusively via telehealth. Our research center, which specializes in studying and treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), historically has provided in-person exposure and response prevention (ERP) to adults with OCD, but shifted to telehealth during the pandemic. Unlike in other modes of talk therapy, ERP's emphasis on therapist-supervised exposures presented unique opportunities and challenges to delivering treatment entirely via a virtual platform. This paper provides case examples to illustrate lessons we learned delivering ERP exclusively via telehealth in New York from March 2020 through June 2021 and offers recommendations for future study and practice.

We used these probability estimates to examine how optimism and/or pessimism relate to protecting oneself from COVID-19. When COVID-19 first reached Turkey, we asked a snowball sample of 494 Istanbul adults how much they engaged in various COVID-protective behaviours. They also estimated the probabilities of their catching COVID-19, and of other positive and negative events happening to them. Estimated probability of positive events (optimism) correlated positively with officially-recommended helpful behaviours (e.g. wearing masks), but not with less-helpful behaviours (e.g. sharing 'alternative' COVID-related information online). Estimated probability of general negative events (pessimism) or of catching COVID did not correlate significantly with COVID-related behaviours, but did correlate with psychopathological symptoms, as did less-helpful COVID-related behaviours. This shows important nuances can be revealed by measuring optimism and pessimism, as separate variables, using probability estimates.","Booth, Peker, Yavuz, Aksu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2022.111576","20220302","COVID-19; Health behaviours; Optimism; Pessimism; Psychopathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27780,""

Here we document population-wide shifts in dietary interests in 18 countries in 2020, as revealed through time series of Google search volumes. We find that during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic there was an overall surge in food interest, larger and longer-lasting than the surge during typical end-of-year holidays in Western countries. The shock of decreased mobility manifested as a drastic increase in interest in consuming food at home and a corresponding decrease in consuming food outside of home. The largest (up to threefold) increases occurred for calorie-dense carbohydrate-based foods such as pastries, bakery products, bread, and pies. The observed shifts in dietary interests have the potential to globally affect food consumption and health outcomes.

"[Mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic among mothers of young children and the related factors: A focus on their difficulties in raising their child, concerns about their child's development, social support, and capacity to receive support]","ObjectivesÃ£â‚¬â‚¬We examined the relationships between the development of severe mental distress among mothers of young children during COVID-19 and the related factors including difficulties in raising child, concerns about child's development, social support, and capacity to receive support using comparable pre-COVID-19 baseline data. Severe mental distress was defined by a score of K6Ã¢â€°Â§10 on the Psychological Distress Scale.MethodsÃ£â‚¬â‚¬We conducted a baseline survey in February 2020 and obtained responses from 4,700 mothers of young children. A follow-up survey was conducted in June 2020. We obtained responses from 2,489 participants of the original group. The K6 scores (four groups) of two surveys were compared. Thereafter, 521 participants who had severe mental distress at the baseline were excluded, and 1,968 participants were included in the Poisson regression analysis. We adjusted for maternal age, education, marital and employment status, household income, children's age, number of children, and changes during COVID-19 pandemic. The adjusted incident rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using K6Ã¢â€°Â§10 at follow-up as the dependent variable, and the independent variables were having difficulty in raising a child, concerns about child's development, social support, and capacity to receive support.ResultsÃ£â‚¬â‚¬At the baseline, 20.9% of mothers had severe mental distress. At follow-up, this value increased significantly to 25.3%. Mothers who developed severe mental distress by the time of the follow-up survey were 333 (16.9%), and they were more likely to have had difficulty in raising their child, concerns about child's development, lower levels of positive attitudes toward receiving support (capacity to receive support), and lower levels of social support.ConclusionsÃ£â‚¬â‚¬The mental health of mothers caring for young children worsened during the COVID-19 outbreak. Factors related to the development of severe mental distress included having difficulty in raising a child, concerns about child's development, and lower levels of positive attitudes toward receiving support (capacity to receive support) and lower levels of social support. Providing parenting support, consultation and rehabilitation, and exploring approaches to enhance capacity for receiving support are required.","Kimura, Ide, Ojima","https://doi.org/10.11236/jph.21-058","20220301","COVID-19; capacity to receive support; longitudinal study; mental health; mothers of young children; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27782,""
"Occupational health, frontline workers and COVID-19 lockdown: new gender-related inequalities?","The abrupt onset of COVID-19, with its rapid spread, has had brutal consequences in all areas of society, including the workplace. In this paper, we report the working conditions, health, and tranquilisers and opioid analgesics use of workers during the first months of the ensuing pandemic, according to whether they were frontline workers or not and also according to sex. Our analysis is based on cross-sectional survey data (collected during April and May 2020) from the wage-earning population in Spain (n=15Ã¢â‚¬â€°070). We estimate prevalences, adjusted prevalence differences and adjusted prevalence ratios by sex and according to whether the worker is a frontline worker or not. Employment and working conditions, exposure to psychosocial risks, as well as health status and the consumption of tranquilisers and opioid analgesics all showed sex and sectoral (frontline vs non-frontline) inequalities, which placed essential women workers in a particularly vulnerable position. Moreover, the consumption of tranquilisers and opioid analgesics increased during the pandemic and health worsened significantly among frontline women workers. The exceptional situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to revalue essential sectors and to dignify such employment and working conditions, especially among women. There is an urgent need to improve working conditions and reduce occupational risk, particularly among frontline workers. In addition, this study highlights the public health problem posed by tranquilisers and opioid analgesics consumption, especially among frontline women.","Utzet, Bacigalupe, Navarro","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-217692","20220301","COVID-19; mental health; occupational health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27783,""
"Pre-pandemic individual- and community-level social capital and depressive symptoms during COVID-19: A longitudinal study of Japanese older adults in 2019-21","During a pandemic, it is important to know whether social capital can mitigate the risk of mental disorders, given the restrictions on social interactions. However, evidence using longitudinal data is scarce. This study examined the association between pre-pandemic social capital and depressive symptoms during COVID-19 among older adults. We used longitudinal data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES), including 8291 participants aged 65 or older who were physically and cognitively independent and not depressed at baseline. We conducted baseline and follow-up mail surveys in ten municipalities in Japan from November 2019 to January 2020 (pre-pandemic period) and from November 2020 to February 2021 (pandemic period), respectively. We measured depressive symptoms using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Social capital was measured with three validated subscales, namely, civic participation, social cohesion, and reciprocity. We performed a multilevel logistic regression analysis to examine the association. A total of 1089 (13.1%) participants newly developed depressive symptoms during the pandemic. The logistic regression showed that pre-pandemic individual-level social cohesion (odds ratioÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.79, 95% confidence interval: 0.73 to 0.86) and reciprocity (0.89, 0.82 to 0.96) and community-level reciprocity (0.93, 0.88 to 0.98) were negatively associated with the odds of depressive symptoms. Even after adjusting for declines in social capital during the pandemic, the observed associations of pre-pandemic social capital remained. Fostering social cohesion and reciprocity may increase resilience to mental disorders during a pandemic of infectious disease.","Sato, Kondo, Kondo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2022.102772","20220301","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Japanese older adults; Reciprocity; Social cohesion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27784,""
"Medication Adherence in Medicare Enrolled Older Adults with Asthma Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Data regarding medication adherence in older adults with asthma before and during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. To evaluate medication adherence and determine factors associated with adherence in Medicare enrolled older adults with asthma before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a retrospective cohort analysis of Medicare enrolled patients with asthma. Medication adherence was measured using proportion of days covered (PDC) rates for dates January-July 2019 and January-July 2020. Patients &lt;65 years of age, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cystic fibrosis were excluded. Paired t-tests assessed change in adherence between 2019 and 2020. Logistic regression evaluated association of age, sex, depression, moderate/severe asthma, use of a 90-days' supply, having Ã¢â€°Â¥3 albuterol fills, and number of medications, medication-related problems, prescribers, pharmacies, controller medication classes, and systemic corticosteroid fills with high adherence (PDC Ã¢â€°Â¥80%). Mean adherence to asthma controller medications ranged from 75-90%, in 2019. Adherence significantly decreased (p&lt;0.001) to 51-70% for all controller medications, except theophylline in 2020. Similar results were observed among patients with moderate/severe asthma. In 2019 and 2020, number of controller medications, Ã¢â€°Â¥3 albuterol fills, and having a 90 days' supply were associated with high adherence (p&lt;0.001). Adherence to asthma controller medications significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic among Medicare enrolled patients with asthma. Patients with markers for more severe asthma, overuse of albuterol, and a 90-day supply of controller medications were more likely to have high adherence. These findings can be used to identify opportunities to improve adherence and prescribing among adult patients with asthma.","Ramey, Silva AlmodÃƒÂ³var, Nahata","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2022.02.010","20220301","Asthma; COVID-19; Controller Medication; Medicare, Medication Therapy Management; Medication adherence; Older Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27785,""

"How did Japanese college freshman survive the Covid-19 pandemic at 2020?: A qualitative study of female college students","Although previous studies have reported that the mental health of college students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened, few studies have examined the process of adjustment of college students in the same context. The results of a preliminary survey suggested that university freshman students in 2020 had a worse adjustment to university life than other year-level students. This study examined studentsâ€™ adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic by interviewing college freshmen about their adjustment to college life between April 2020 and January 2021.The interview protocol was based on the Trajectory Equifinality Model. In order for university students to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was suggested that they should actively collect information on social networking sites, register for courses smoothly, become familiar with online classes, make effective use of their free time, and turn to their high school friends when they cannot make new friends at university","Daichi Sugawara et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E018E-240-3FB","20220303","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; trajectory equifinality model; adaptation; mental health; university student","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","",27790,""
