"Love and emotions at the time of COVID-19","COVID-19 has already swept millions of lives and created the deep black cloud made up of negative emotions. Analysis of origin of negative emotions from previous experiences indicates diversity in thinking, reasoning, self-centeredness and lack of empathy give rise to human vices which are difficult but not impossible to overcome by resurrection of positive emotions like love, empathy, motivation for good deeds and philanthropic activities. Complex interplay of positive and negative emotions orchestrated by intricately associated neuronal circuits, neurotransmitters coupled with endocrinal influence holds responsible for human behavior, considered as the root of human civilization, is currently facing existential crisis during COVID-19 pandemic. Human civilization is experiencing unique psychosocial problems through emerging COVID-19 pandemic. Depression, panic buying, herd behavior, infodemic, immense sufferings of marginalized people, surge of addictive behavior, racism, domestic violence, rape, divorce, financial constraints, stigmatization, all stem from negative emotions and lack of positive vibes amidst the rally of death and sorrows. COVID-19 and surge of negative emotions are the two pandemics which conjointly causing major mental health threat. Cultivations and practice of positive emotions and triumph of optimistic octet over sinister septet are desirable to save Mother Nature and her habitats from the cruel claws of this pandemic.","Ghosh, R.; Biswas, P.; Chatterjee, S.; Sengupta, S.; Dubey, M.

"The relationship between pre-COVID prevalence of common mental disorders and the impact of COVID-19","BACKGROUND: The pandemic of respiratory illness (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus has affected 8 million people and caused over 440, 000 deaths to date. COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rates have varied widely across nations. Psychosocial factors, such as common mental disorders, may influence the risk of disease spread and death during outbreaks, and these factors are in turn influenced by the prevailing environmental conditions. This study examined the correlation between the prepandemic prevalence of anxiety and depression and indices of the impact of COVID-19. METHODS: Data from 94 countries reporting at least 1000 cases of COVID-19 to date was included. The impact of COVID-19 was assessed using the prevalence and mortality rates per 1 million population and the case fatality rate. The prevalence rates of depression and anxiety were obtained from World Health Organization statistics. The correlations between these variables were examined after correcting for the confounding effects of population, median age and urbanization. RESULTS: The pre-COVID prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders were both positively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence (Spearman's <U+03C1>=0.433, P&lt;0.001 for depression, <U+03C1>=0.387, P&lt;0.001 for anxiety) and mortality rates (<U+03C1>=0.497, P&lt;0.001 for depression, <U+03C1>=0.486, P&lt;0.001 for anxiety). The association between anxiety disorder prevalence and COVID-19 mortality and case fatality rates remained significant after correcting for population, median age and degree of urbanization. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide preliminary evidence of a link between the pre-COVID prevalence of common mental disorders and COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rates. Alarge proportion of this relationship may be due to shared environmental vulnerability. However, in the case of anxiety disorders, more specific behavioral or biological mechanisms may also need to be considered.","Rajkumar, R.

"What pandemic teaches us about the patient of a pain center","Although pain treatment has been described as a fundamental human right, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced healthcare systems worldwide to redistribute healthcare resources toward intensive care units and other COVID-19 dedicated sites. As most chronic pain services were subsequently deemed non-urgent, all outpatient and elective interventional procedures have been reduced or interrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to reduce the risk of viral spread. The shutdown of pain services jointly to the home lockdown imposed by governments has affected chronic pain management worldwide with additional impact on patients' psychological health. Chronic pain is a complex multidimensional experience severely compromising the QoL, often limited ability to work, sleep, and affected social interactions with friends and family. Because of compromised health care services and their limited accessibility during the pandemic, socioeconomic disadvantages, and exposure to enhanced phychological stressors, patients with chronic pain may experience an exacerbation of symptoms. Telehealth and telemedicine have been suggested as a means for treating chronic pain patients at home in nonemergent conditions, as well as to assure continuity of care of patients after hospital discharge. Many technical solutions, with different costs and benefits, have been utilized for remote assessment and treatment of chronic pain. Telephone consultation is the first and low-cost example of telemedicine for remote treatment of pain. As a matter of fact, the evidence on telemedicine efficacy in chronic pain is lacking according to some published systematic reviews [MartorellaG, 2017 and SlatteryBW, 2019], including a Cochrane review [EcclestonC, 2014]. The effects of psychological therapies delivered via the Internet on pain, disability, depression, and anxiety are promising but come from a small number of trials so that the estimate of the effects remains to be assessed.","Papageorgiou, E.","https://doi.org/10.22514/sv.2021.188","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Signa Vitae; 17(SUPPL 1):S43, 2021.; Publication details: Signa Vitae; 17(SUPPL 1):S43, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19862,""
"The role of family support in the recovery of corona virus disease-19 patients","BACKGROUND: Families have an important role in prevention for patients who are positive for coronavirus diseases (COVID)-19 with mild symptoms and without symptoms to recover. Support such as providing positive information, moral reinforcement, and special time given by the family is thought to strengthen mental health and can increase the immunity of the patient. AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine the role of family support in the recovery of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Used was observational analytic with a cross-sectional approach. The subjects were 30 people who had family members diagnosed with COVID-19 and lived in one house and 30 patients recovered from COVID-19 in the islands of Java and Kalimantan. Data analysis used Fisherâ€™s exact test and calculated the prevalence ratio to determine the most dominant role. RESULTS: The results showed that the p-value of the relationship between family support and the recovery of COVID-19 patients was 0.023, and the p-value of the relationship between components and the recovery of COVID-19 patients was emotional support (0.048), appreciation or appraisal support (0.007), informational support (0.023), and instrumental support (0.034). The prevalence ratio for each of these components was emotional support (PR = 0.714), followed by instrumental support (0.667), informational support (0.600), and appreciation or appraisal support (PR = 0.333). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant role between family supports in the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Emotional support is the strongest component that plays a role in recovery of COVID-19 patients.","Wardani, D.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the neuropsychiatric status of Wilson's disease","We have read with interest the Letter to the Editor by Drs. Zhuang and Zhong, who presented the clinical data of 68 patients with Wilson's disease (WD) who were admitted to the hospital before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and appreciated their findings on hepatic and some extrahepatic manifestations. Nevertheless, given the strong impact of the pandemic on patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, we would have expected a worsening of the psychiatric and/or neurological impairments in these patients. In contrast, according to the authors, these manifestations remained, somewhat unexpectedly, unchanged. This finding is in contrast with most of the current literature that highlights not only an increased incidence of mental health disorders in the general population but also an exacerbation of neurological and psychiatric symptoms in patients with chronic diseases, especially in those with pre-existing neuropsychiatric disorders, such as WD. Although the study was mainly focused on the hepatic features of WD patients taking anti-copper treatment, a generic and cumulative definition of neurological and psychiatric manifestations, as in this study, does not allow for further considerations. Future studies during and after the pandemic are necessary to clarify the real impact, either direct or indirect, of the COVID-19 pandemic on the neurological and psychiatric symptoms of WD patients.","Lanza, G.; Godani, M.; Ferri, R.; Raggi, A.","https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i39.6733","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: World Journal of Gastroenterology; 27(39):6733-6736, 2021.; Publication details: World Journal of Gastroenterology; 27(39):6733-6736, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19864,""
"Mental Health and Substance Use Associated with Hospitalization among People with COVID-19: A Population-Based Cohort Study","This study identified factors associated with hospital admission among people with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases in British Columbia. The study used data from the BC COVID-19 Cohort, which integrates data on all COVID-19 cases with data on hospitalizations, medical visits, emergency room visits, prescription drugs, chronic conditions and deaths. The analysis included all laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases in British Columbia to 15 January 2021. We evaluated factors associated with hospital admission using multivariable Poisson regression analysis with robust error variance. Of the 56,874 COVID-19 cases included in the analysis, 2298 were hospitalized. Factors associated with increased hospitalization risk were as follows: male sex (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.27;95%CI = 1.17â€“1.37), older age (p-trend &lt;0.0001 across age groups increasing hospitalization risk with increasing age [aRR 30â€“39 years = 3.06;95%CI = 2.32â€“4.03, to aRR 80+ years = 43.68;95%CI = 33.41â€“57.10 compared to 20â€“29 years-old]), asthma (aRR = 1.15;95%CI = 1.04â€“1.26), cancer (aRR = 1.19;95%CI = 1.09â€“1.29), chronic kidney disease (aRR = 1.32;95%CI = 1.19â€“1.47), diabetes (treated without insulin aRR = 1.13;95%CI = 1.03â€“1.25, requiring insulin aRR = 5.05;95%CI = 4.43â€“5.76), hypertension (aRR = 1.19;95%CI = 1.08â€“1.31), injection drug use (aRR = 2.51;95%CI = 2.14â€“2.95), intellectual and developmental disabilities (aRR = 1.67;95%CI = 1.05â€“2.66), problematic alcohol use (aRR = 1.63;95%CI = 1.43â€“1.85), immunosuppression (aRR = 1.29;95%CI = 1.09â€“1.53), and schizophrenia and psychotic disorders (aRR = 1.49;95%CI = 1.23â€“1.82). In an analysis restricted to women of reproductive age, pregnancy (aRR = 2.69;95%CI = 1.42â€“5.07) was associated with increased risk of hospital admission. Older age, male sex, substance use, intellectual and developmental disability, chronic comorbidities, and pregnancy increase the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization.","VelÃ¡squez GarcÃ­a, HÃ©ctor Alexander, Wilton, James, Smolina, Kate, Chong, Mei, Rasali, Drona, Otterstatter, Michael, Rose, Caren, Prystajecky, Natalie, David, Samara, Galanis, Eleni, McKee, Geoffrey, Krajden, Mel, Janjua, Naveed Zafar","https://doi.org/10.3390/v13112196","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Viruses; 13(11):2196, 2021.; Publication details: Viruses; 13(11):2196, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19865,""
"Trajectories and Determinants of Physical Activity during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Population-Based Study of Middle-Aged and Elderly Individuals in The Netherlands","Physical inactivity is a major public health problem, and there are concerns this might have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to identify distinct trajectories of physical activity over a 6-week period after the first restrictive measures and to explore determinants of these trajectories in a population-based cohort of middle-aged and elderly in the Netherlands (n = 5777). We observed that at least 59% of participants did not meet the World Health Organization recommendations for physical activity. Using latent class trajectory analyses over three time points, we identified five distinct trajectories, including four steady trajectories at different levels (very low, low, medium and high) and one increasing trajectory. Using multinomial logistic regression analyses, we observed that, compared to the â€˜steadily highâ€™ trajectory, participants in the â€˜steadily very lowâ€™ trajectory were more often older, lower educated, reporting poorer physical health, more depressive symptoms, consuming a less healthy diet, smoking, and lower alcohol use, and were less often retired. A similar pattern of determinants was seen for those in the increasing trajectory, albeit with smaller effect sizes. Concluding, we observed low levels of physical activity that generally remained during the pandemic. The determinants we described can help identify groups that require additional preventive interventions.","Hofman, Amy, Limpens, Marlou A. M.; de Crom, Tosca O.

"Adjustments in Food Choices and Physical Activity during Lockdown by Flemish Adults","Background: On Wednesday 18/03/2020 Belgium was placed in lockdown in order to curb the spread of COVID-19. Lockdown can lead to loneliness, boredom, anger, anxiety and depression, which in turn have an influence on food choices and physical activity (PA). This study aims to map the adjustments in food choices and PA by Flemish adults during lockdown. Methods: Chi square tests were performed to investigate the relationship between adjustments in food choices, PA and demographic variables. Results: A total of 1.129 respondents filled in the online questionnaire, aged between 18 and 81 years. The healthiest food choices were made by respondents living alone during lockdown, whilst people cohabiting with others increased their PA significantly. Moreover, the dietary adjustments of adults living with children evolved more favourably to healthier choices then those cohousing with other adults. However, respondents living with other adults showed a more favourable pattern regarding adjustments in PA. The strongest increase in sedentary behaviour was observed in students. Conclusions: This study shows the impact of lockdown on both PA and food choices, where healthier adjustments were observed in PA and respondents were prone to consume unhealthier food.","Mertens, Evelien, Deriemaeker, Peter, Beneden, Katrien Van","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13113794","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Nutrients; 13(11):3794, 2021.; Publication details: Nutrients; 13(11):3794, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19867,""
"Factors Related to Psychological Distress during the First Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Chilean Population","The health effects of COVID-19 continue to raise doubts today. In some areas, such as mental health, these doubts have scarcely been addressed. The present study analyses the effects on psychological distress during the first phase of the pandemic in Chile. A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed by using a questionnaire validated in Spain and adapted for Chile. Between 22 April and 16 December 2020, 3227 questionnaires were collected from the 16 regions of Chile, using non-probabilistic snowball sampling. Bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression were performed. The variables that could predict psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile were: having a poor self-perception of health OR = 4.038, 95% CI = (2.831, 5.758);being younger than 29 OR = 2.287, 95% CI = (1.893, 2.762);having diarrhea OR = 2.093, 95% CI = (1.414, 3.098);having headache OR = 2.019, 95% CI = (1.662, 2.453);being a woman OR = 1.638, 95% CI = (1.363, 1.967);having muscle pain OR = 1.439, 95% CI = (1.114, 1.859);and having had casual contact with an infected person OR = 1.410, 95% CI = (1.138, 1.747). In Chile, with a better social, economic, cultural, and health environment compared to neighboring countries, there has been a high percentage of psychological distress. It is time to prioritize measures to safeguard the mental health of Chileans, especially focused on the most vulnerable population according to our results, i.e., young women with poorer health status.","Ruiz-Frutos, Carlos, Delgado-GarcÃ­a, Diemen, Ortega-Moreno, MÃ³nica, Duclos-BastÃ­as, Daniel, Escobar-GÃ³mez, DÃ¡nica, GarcÃ­a-Iglesias, Juan JesÃºs, GÃ³mez-Salgado, Juan","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10215137","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):5137, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):5137, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19868,""
"Lockdown Effect on Elderly Nutritional Health","Pandemics and lockdowns may be associated with unpremeditated consequences, such as bodyweight changes, isolation, as well as sedentarity. Reports have been published on malnutrition among patients suffering from COVID-19. This study aimed to highlight the short-term effects of the lockdown on the nutritional health of elderly people living at home and benefiting from home care services, yet without any COVID-19 pathology. In 50 subjects displaying weight, body mass index, and MNA score stability two months earlier, we observed significant alterations in these parameters following the lockdown. Thus, malnutrition rose from 28â€“34% to 58%. Furthermore, trigger factors for malnutrition changed, with social isolation accounting for 64% of the confinementâ€™s deleterious effects among the elderly. In conclusion, despite the elderly being not directly affected by SARS-CoV2, the nutritional status of elderly subjects living at home with no or only mild autonomy loss was greatly and rapidly affected by the lockdown. Moreover, the main trigger factors for malnutrition were essentially related to social isolation and depressive syndromes. Knowing the impact of confinement on the elderlyâ€™s health, these results may help further modulate ongoing public health interventions in case of future lockdowns.","Ghanem, Jeyniver, Colicchio, Bruno, AndrÃ¨s, Emmanuel, Geny, Bernard, Dieterlen, Alain","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10215052","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):5052, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):5052, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19869,""
"Resilience and Mental Health in the Polish Population during the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Mediation Analysis","The aim of this paper was to assess the state of resilience and well-being in the Polish population during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also assessed the relationship between resilience and mental health. Finally, we tested the mediating role of COVID-19 anxiety, persistent thinking, and the stress burden in the relationship between mental health and resilience. This research perspective can provide important insights into how individuals can become mentally stronger during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study included 1758 people (73% women) aged 18â€“80 years. The procedure consisted of completing a questionnaire measuring well-being, COVID-19 anxiety, obsession with COVID-19, stress over COVID-19, and resilience. Results: Bootstrap sampling analysis showed significant partial mediators for the relationship between resilience and well-being. Important mediators were coronavirus anxiety, persistent thinking, and perceived stress. Conclusions: The results of the present study clearly indicate that resilience as a protective factor is associated with reduced anxiety about COVID-19, perceived stress burden, obsessive thoughts about the pandemic, and increased well-being of individuals. Resilience plays an important role in minimizing negative and enhancing positive health indicators in the face of challenging life events.","Surzykiewicz, Janusz, Konaszewski, Karol, Skalski, Sebastian, Dobrakowski, Pawel Piotr, Muszynska, Jolanta","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10214974","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):4974, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):4974, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19870,""
"How Do Polish Students Manage Emotional Distress during the COVID-19 Lockdown? A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Study","Choices regarding coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak may imply the development as well as the severity of emotional disorders. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study was to: (1) assess the coping strategies for stress in a population of Polish students and (2) evaluate the impact of those strategies on the severity of depression, stress, and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. To evaluate emotional distress, we used the DASS-21 scale and coping strategies Brief-COPE Inventory. The study included 2172 respondents (73% female, 27% male) with a mean age of 22.1 Â± 2.2. Students more frequently chose stress coping strategies belonging to the â€˜approachâ€™ coping strategies (M = 29.60 Â± 6.89) compared to â€˜avoidantâ€™ coping strategies (M = 22.82 Â± 5.78). The intensification of distress in women caused a turn to religion (p = 0.001), while men used substances (p &lt;0.001) and a sense of humor (p &lt;0.001). Medical students coped best with emotional distress, which is very encouraging for their future profession. The highest level of DASS total score was associated with the usage of avoidant coping strategies, prior use of psychiatric or psychological support, and loneliness. Planning interventions to prevent emotional disorders in students requires the identification of factors contributing to increased emotional distress.","Sitarz, Elzbieta, Forma, Alicja, Karakula, Kaja, Juchnowicz, Dariusz, Baj, Jacek, Bogucki, Jacek, Karakula-Juchnowicz, Hanna","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10214964","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):4964, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):4964, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19871,""
"The Association of Cardiometabolic Disease with Psychological Factors in Colombian People during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological disorders have been documented in the population, and their exacerbation in vulnerable populations such as those with Cardiometabolic Diseases (CD) might challenge health systems. This study determined psychological factors associated with CD in Colombian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, 284 persons were evaluated, 142 without CD and 142 with CD. Sociodemographic data were collected, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the SF-12v2, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS), which were integrated into an online form, were used. Through a simple and multiple logistic regression model, it was shown that CD was associated with low sleeping quality (LSQ) (OR = 3.51) and with depressive symptoms (DS) (OR = 1.98). In addition, in the group with CD, the presence of DS was related to BMI (OR = 2.45), and LSQ was related to living with persons at risk for COVID-19 (OR = 3.64) and BMI (OR = 5.88). In conclusion, this study showed that people with CD have a higher chance of presenting DS and LSQ.

The model of two phenotypes, set out by Professor Gattinoni and colleagues, suggests that adequate monitoring of respiratory effort may play a key role in the treatment of respiratory failure due to COVID-19. An insufficient control of the patientâ€™s respiratory efforts could lead to an aggravation of lung damage, mainly due to the possibility of generating Patient Self-Inflicted Lung Injury (PSILI) with a consequent aggravation of the pathological picture. Nevertheless, effectively monitoring the patientâ€™s respiratory work, especially in nonintensive settings, is not easy. This article briefly describes some methods that allow the assessment of respiratory effort, such as the use of ultrasound and respiratory tests, which can be performed in nonintensive settings.","Giustivi, Davide, Bottazzini, Francesco, Belliato, Mirko","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10214943","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):4943, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):4943, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19873,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Impact on Familiesâ€™Mental Health: The Role Played by Parenting Stress,Parentsâ€™ Past Trauma, and Resilience","International research has evidenced the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families, and the key role played by parenting stress levels. Although significant associations with parentsâ€™ past trauma and resilience have been shown, this study aimed to explore their complex interplay on the relationship between parentsâ€™ peritraumatic distress due to COVID-19, parenting stress, and childrenâ€™s psychopathological difficulties. We recruited 353 parents with children aged two to 16 years via an online survey during the Italian second wave of COVID-19. Parentsâ€™ peritraumatic distress due to COVID-19, parenting stress, past trauma and resilience, and childrenâ€™s psychological difficulties were assessed through self-report and report-form questionnaires. Parentsâ€™ past traumas significantly predicted peritraumatic distress due to COVID-19 and childrenâ€™s psychological difficulties. The relationship between past traumas and childrenâ€™s psychological difficulties was serial mediated by parentsâ€™ peritraumatic distress and parenting stress. Direct and total effects of parentâ€™s resilience on parentâ€™s peritraumatic distress were not significant, but there were significant indirect effects via parenting stress and via parentsâ€™ peritraumatic distress and parenting stress, indicating inconsistent mediation. This study evidenced the key risk and protective role played by, respectively, parentsâ€™ past traumas exposure and resilience on the relationship between parentsâ€™ psychological difficulties due to COVID-19, parenting stress, and childrenâ€™s psychological difficulties, with important clinical implications.","Marzilli, Eleonora, Cerniglia, Luca, Tambelli, Renata, Trombini, Elena, De Pascalis, Leonardo, Babore, Alessandra, Trumello, Carmen, Cimino, Silvia","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111450","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11450, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11450, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19874,""
"Behavioral Correlates of COVID-19 Worry: Stigma, Knowledge, and News Source","Non-adherence to COVID-19 guidelines may be attributable to low levels of worry. This study assessed whether endorsing COVID-19-stigmatizing restrictions, COVID-19 knowledge, and preferred news source were associated with being â€˜very worriedâ€™ versus â€˜not at allâ€™ or â€˜somewhatâ€™ worried about contracting COVID-19. Survey data were collected in Julyâ€“August 2020 from N = 547 New York State (NYS) and N = 504 national Amazon MTurk workers. Respondents who endorsed COVID-19 stigmatizing restrictions (NYS OR 1.96;95% CI 1.31, 2.92;national OR 1.80;95% CI 1.06, 3.08) and consumed commercial news (NYS OR 1.89;95% CI 1.21, 2.96;national OR 1.93;95% CI 1.24, 3.00) were more likely to be very worried. National respondents who consumed The New York Times (OR 1.52;95% CI 1.00, 2.29) were more likely to be very worried, while those with little knowledge (OR 0.24;95% CI 0.13, 0.43) were less likely to be very worried. NYS (OR 2.66;95% CI 1.77, 4.00) and national (OR 3.17;95% CI 1.95, 5.16) respondents with probable depression were also more likely to be very worried. These characteristics can help identify those requiring intervention to maximize perceived threat to COVID-19 and encourage uptake of protective behaviors while protecting psychological wellbeing.","Meltzer, Gabriella Y.; Chang, Virginia W.; Lieff, Sarah A.; Grivel, Margaux M.; Yang, Lawrence H.; Jarlais, Don C.

"Occupational Health of Frontline Healthcare Workers in The United Arab Emirates during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Snapshot of Summer 2020","The study aim was to understand the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study was an online-based, cross-sectional survey during July and August 2020. Participants were eligible from the entire country, and 1290 agreed to participate. The majority of HCWs were females aged 30â€“39 years old, working as nurses, and 80% considered PPE to be available. Twelve percent of respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Half of HCWs considered themselves physically tired (52.2%), reported musculoskeletal pain or discomfort (54.2%), and perceived moderate-to-high levels of burnout on at least one of three burnout domains (52.8%). A quarter of HCWs reported anxiety (26.3%) or depression (28.1%). HCWs reporting not having musculoskeletal pain, having performed physical activity, and higher scores of available PPE reported lower scores of anxiety, depression, and burnout. UAE HCWs experienced more access to PPE and less anxiety, depression, and burnout compared with HCWs in other countries. Study findings can be used by healthcare organizations and policymakers to ensure adequate measures are implemented to maximize the health and wellbeing of HCWs during the current COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Ajab, Suad, Ãdam, BalÃ¡zs, Al Hammadi, Muna, Al Bastaki, Najwa, Al Junaibi, Mohamed, Al Zubaidi, Abdulmajeed, Hegazi, Mona, Grivna, Michal, Kady, Suhail, Koornneef, Erik, Neves, Raquel, Uva, AntÃ³nio Sousa, Sheek-Hussein, Mohamud, Loney, Tom, Serranheira, Florentino, Paulo, MarÃ­lia Silva","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111410","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11410, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11410, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19876,""
"Factors Associated with Mental Health among International Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Korea","The purpose of this study was to investigate mental health problems among international students in South Korean universities during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify the factors that affect their mental health. A total of 488 international students living in South Korea participated in a web-based survey. The questionnaire was created using the Google Forms platform, and a link to the questionnaire was shared through social media. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze the data. The prevalence rates of sleep problems, anxiety, and depression among international students were 47.1%, 39.6%, and 49%, respectively. The prevalence of mental health problems was higher among participants who were male, living with someone, residents of a rural area, and earning a higher income. The following variables were found to contribute to the prevalence of mental health problems: undergraduate student status, good understanding of the Korean language, longer hours of media usage, and experiences related to COVID-19 infection. A collaborative effort between the government and universities to manage the mental health of international students could promote the mental health of these students.","Kim, Hae Ran, Kim, Eun Jung","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111381","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11381, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11381, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19877,""
"Access to Mental Health and Substance Use Resources for 2SLGBTQ+ Youth during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Previous research has established that gender and sexual minority (2SLGBTQ+) youth experience worse mental health and substance use outcomes than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. Research suggests that mental health and substance use concerns have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study used self-reported online survey responses from 1404 Canadian 2SLGBTQ+ youth which included, but were not limited to, questions regarding previous mental health experiences, diagnoses, and substance use. Additional questions assessed whether participants had expressed a need for mental health and/or substance use resources since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) and whether they had experienced barriers when accessing this care. Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between variables and expressing a need for resources as well as experiencing barriers to accessing these resources. Bivariate analyses revealed multiple sociodemographic, mental health, and substance use variables significantly associated with both expressing a need for and experiencing barriers to care. Multinomial regression analysis revealed gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and level of educational attainment to be significantly correlated with both cases. This study supports growing research on the mental health-related harms that have been experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be used to inform tailored intervention plans for the 2SLGBTQ+ youth population.","Chaiton, Michael, Musani, Iman, Pullman, Mari, Logie, Carmen H.; Abramovich, Alex, Grace, Daniel, Schwartz, Robert, Baskerville, Bruce","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111315","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11315, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11315, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19878,""
"Lessons of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict for Public Health: The Case of the COVID-19 Vaccination Gap","In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed a faceless, non-adversarial threat that endangered Israelis and Palestinians with the same ferocity. However, the capacities of the health systems to address it were not equal, with Israel more equipped for the outbreak with infrastructure, resources, manpower and later, vaccines. The pandemic demonstrated the life-saving benefits of cooperation and the self-defeating harms brought by non-cooperation. These trends are explored here by an international team of public health and environmental scholars, including those from different sides of the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict. This article explores the importance of recognizing the Israeli and Palestinian jurisdictions as a single epidemiological unit, and illustrates how doing so is a pragmatic positioning that can serve self-interest. We demonstrate how despite political shocks precipitating non-cooperation, there has been a recurrent tendency towards limited cooperation. The paper concludes with lessons over the need for reframing public health as a potential bridge, the need for structural changes creating sustainable platforms for accelerated transboundary cooperation to enable the steady management of current and future public and environmental health crises regardless of dynamic political crises, and the importance of civil society and international organizations in forging collaboration in advance of governmental engagement.","Dahdal, Yara, Davidovitch, Nadav, Gilmont, Michael, Lezaun, Javier, Negev, Maya, Sandler, Deborah, Shaheen, Mohammed","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111292","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11292, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11292, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19879,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Sedentary Time and Behaviour in Children and Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantify the change in sedentary time during the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on health outcomes in the general population. One thousand six hundred and one articles published after 2019 were retrieved from five databases, of which 64 and 40 were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Studies were grouped according to population: children (&lt;18 years), adults (18â€“64 years) and older adults (&gt;65 years). Average sedentary time was calculated, with sub-analyses performed by country, behaviour type and health outcomes. Children were most affected, increasing their sedentary time by 159.5 Â± 142.6 min day-1, followed by adults (+126.9 Â± 42.2 min day-1) and older adults (+46.9 Â± 22.0 min day-1). There were no sex differences in any age group. Screen time was the only consistently measured behaviour and accounted for 46.8% and 57.2% of total sedentary time in children and adults, respectively. Increases in sedentary time were negatively correlated with global mental health, depression, anxiety and quality of life, irrespective of age. Whilst lockdown negatively affected all age groups, children were more negatively affected than adults or older adults, highlighting this population as a key intervention target. As lockdowns ease worldwide, strategies should be employed to reduce time spent sedentary.

"A One-Year Longitudinal Study: Changes in Depression and Anxiety in Frontline Emergency Department Healthcare Workers in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) fighting COVID-19 have been associated with depression and anxiety, but there is limited data to illustrate these changes over time. We aim to quantify the changes in depression and anxiety amongst Emergency Department (ED) HCWs over one year and examine the factors associated with these changes. In this longitudinal single-centre study in Singapore, all ED HCWs were prospectively recruited face-to-face. Paper-based surveys were administered in June 2020 and June 2021. Depression and anxiety were measured using DASS-21. The results of 241 HCWs who had completed both surveys were matched. There was significant improvement in anxiety amongst all HCWs (Mean: 2020: 2.85 (Â±3.19) vs. 2021: 2.54 (Â±3.11);Median: 2020: 2 (0â€“4) vs. 2021: 2 (0â€“4), p = 0.045). HCWs living with elderly and with concerns about infection risk had higher odds of anxiety;those living with young children had lower odds of anxiety. There was significant worsening depression amongst doctors (Mean: 2020: 2.71 (Â±4.18) vs. 2021: 3.60 (Â±4.50);Median: 2020: 1 (0â€“3) vs. 2021: 3 (0â€“5), p = 0.018). HCWs = 41 years, living with elderly and with greater concerns about workload had higher odds of depression. HCWs who perceived better workplace support and better social connectedness had lower odds of depression. In summary, our study showed significant improvement in anxiety amongst ED HCWs and significant worsening depression amongst ED doctors over one year. Age, living with elderly, and concerns about workload and infection risk were associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety.","Thâ€™ng, Francesca, Rao, Kailing Adriel, Ge, Lixia, Mao, Desmond, Neo, Hwee Nah, Molina, Joseph Antonio De, Seow, Eillyne","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111228","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11228, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11228, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19881,""
"Nursing Studentsâ€™ Experiences of Gratitude Journaling during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Gratitude journaling has been used to improve grateful disposition. However, there is only limited data available on its application experience. This study aimed to: (1) explore the experiences of nursing students who have participated in gratitude journaling;and (2) assess studentsâ€™ views of gratitude journaling as a nursing intervention. This study implemented an eight-week program of gratitude journaling with fourth-year nursing students who took a mental health psychiatric nursing course at a South Korean university. Following the eight weeks, students reflected on their gratitude journaling experience in a reflective essay. Using content analysis, 53 essays were analyzed. Five categories were identified from the reflective essay, as follows: â€œA new beginningâ€, â€œThe engine that motivates continued participation: gratitude sharingâ€, â€œThe process driving changeâ€, â€œChanges brought about by gratitudeâ€, and â€œSelf-reflectionâ€. Based on this experience, nursing students believed that it is important to promote steady participation when administering gratitude journaling as a nursing intervention. The study findings suggest that the gratitude journaling not only helped with nursing studentsâ€™ perspective, emotional, and behavioral aspects and stress management, but also provided an opportunity to advance a step further based on self-reflection.","Ko, Heesung, Kim, Seryeong, Kim, Eunjeong","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111473","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1473, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1473, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19882,""
"Learnings from User Digital Trail Post-Occupancy Evaluation before COVID-19 for Future Workplace Analysis and Design","Data are required for optimizing workplace design, assessing user experience, and ensuring wellbeing. This research focuses on the benefits of incorporating post-occupancy evaluation (POE) data analysis by studying the digital trail of employees generated by the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure of the office. The objective is to enable a safe return to offices through compliance with COVID-19 space-capacity regulations and in consideration of the health and wellbeing of employees. Workplaces, teams, and people have become more digitalized and therefore more mobile due to the globalization of knowledge and cutting-edge technological innovations, a process that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis. Now, hybrid work and fully remote working routines are increasing in a significant number of companies. Nevertheless, with the return to the office, understanding how to calibrate spatial capacity is now key for workplaces and companies. Traditional assessment methods are obsolete;new methods that respond to mobility, changing occupancy rates, and comfort are essential. This paper analyzes, through the case study of a pre-COVID-19 activity-based office, the advantages of using digital indoor-location techniques (such as Wi-Fi networks, which additionally have the advantage of being previously installed in the majority of these spaces). The paper demonstrates that the incorporation of digital POE of user trends enabled a more seamless, accurate, and scalable return to a new normal office work scenario and an improved post-COVID-19 design of workplaces.","RegodÃ³n, Alicia, GarcÃ­a-NavalÃ³n, Enrique, Santiso-Hernandez, Juvenal, Delgado-Rodriguez, Enrique, Garcia-Santos, Alfonso","https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings11110513","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Buildings; 11(11):513, 2021.; Publication details: Buildings; 11(11):513, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19883,""
"Measuring the Effects of Social Isolation and Dissatisfaction on Depressive Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Moderating Role of Sleep and Physical Activity","Social distancing was universally implemented to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Long-term social distancing can lead to increased feelings of social isolation or dissatisfaction with oneâ€™s daily interpersonal interactions, which can subsequently result in reduced psychological health (e.g., greater depression). The present study quantified this association, and the extent to which it was moderated by measures of sleep and physical activity, by surveying 3658 adults (mean age = 46.0 years) from across the United States. Participants answered questions related to their social experiences, sleep, physical activity, and depressive symptoms during the early stages of the pandemic (Marchâ€“June 2020). Results showed that social isolation and social dissatisfaction were associated with greater depressive symptoms. As predicted, self-reported sleep quality and physical activity moderated these associations, such that lower sleep quality and physical activity exacerbated their effect on depressive symptoms.","Vargas, Ivan, Howie, Erin Kaye, Muench, Alexandria, Perlis, Michael L.","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11111449","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1449, 2021.; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1449, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19884,""
"Access to Mental Health Care during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy: Results from the COMET Multicentric Study","The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented public health emergency, with consequences at the political, social, and economic levels. Mental health services have been called to play a key role in facing the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of the general population. In the period Marchâ€“May 2020, an online survey was implemented as part of the Covid Mental Health Trial (COMET), a multicentric collaborative study carried out in Italy, one of the Western countries most severely hit by the pandemic. The present study aims to investigate the use of mental health resources during the first wave of the pandemic. The final sample consisted of 20,712 participants, mainly females (N = 14,712, 71%) with a mean age of 40.4 Â± 14.3 years. Access to mental health services was reported in 7.7% of cases. Among those referred to mental health services, in 93.9% of cases (N = 1503 subjects) a psychological assessment was requested and in 15.7% of cases (N = 252) a psychiatric consultation.

"Mental Health and Prenatal Bonding in Pregnant Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence for Heightened Risk Compared With a Prepandemic Sample","We compared 572 pregnant women (319 first-time mothers) surveyed in spring 2020, during the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns in the United States, with 99 pregnant women (all first-time mothers) surveyed before the pandemic (2014?2020). Compared with the prepandemic sample, women assessed during the pandemic showed elevated depression, anxiety, and stress and weaker prenatal bonding to their infants. These findings remained significant when restricting the pandemic sample to first-time mothers only and held after controlling for race/ethnicity, education, and pregnancy stage. Average levels of depression and anxiety within the pandemic group exceeded clinically significant thresholds, and women who estimated that the pandemic had more negatively affected their social relationships reported higher distress. However, pandemic-related changes to social contact outside the household were inconsistently associated with mental health and with some positive outcomes (fewer depressive symptoms, stronger prenatal bonding). Given that prenatal stress may compromise maternal and child well-being, the pandemic may have long-term implications for population health.","Morris, Alyssa R.; Saxbe, Darby E.","https://doi.org/10.1177/21677026211049430","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Clinical Psychological Science;: 21677026211049430, 2021.; Publication details: Clinical Psychological Science;: 21677026211049430, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19886,""
"Emerging Adults and Social Distancing During COVID-19: Who Was More Likely to Follow Guidelines and What Were the Correlates With Well-Being and Weight-Related Behaviors?","The aim of this study is to identify the prevalence, predictors, and psychosocial well-being (depressive symptoms, stress) and weight-related behavior (eating behaviors, physical activity, and sedentary behavior) correlates of social distancing during COVID-19 among emerging adults. A rapid-response survey was sent to participants (n=720;mean age=24.7 Â± 2.0Â years, 62% female) in a population-based cohort study in Minnesota during April?October 2020. Half of emerging adults reported fully social distancing. Emerging adults from White backgrounds were least likely to social distance while those from Asian backgrounds were most likely to social distance, in addition to those living with a parent. Females who partially/did not social distance reported less healthy eating behaviors, while males and ?essential workers? reported higher levels of psychosocial distress. Public health messaging and practical supports for social distancing may need to be made more relevant to emerging adults during public health crises. Resources may need to differ depending on sex of emerging adult.","Berge, Jerica M.; Larson, Nicole, Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne","https://doi.org/10.1177/21676968211051482","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Emerging Adulthood;: 21676968211051482, 2021.; Publication details: Emerging Adulthood;: 21676968211051482, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19887,""
"COVID-19â€™s Impact on Substance Use and Well-Being of Younger Adult Cannabis Users in California: A Mixed Methods Inquiry","Few qualitative studies have examined the impact of COVID-19 on cannabis and alcohol use, and overall well-being among cannabis users. Cannabis users (aged 26-32) were surveyed quantitatively (n=158) and interviewed qualitatively (n=29) in April 2020?May 2021 in Los Angeles. 63.3% of the quantitative sample reported increasing use of either cannabis (29.1%) or alcohol (15.2%) or both (19.0%) following the COVID-19 outbreak. Qualitative data revealed that increases in cannabis and alcohol use were largely attributed to changes in employment and staying at home resulting in fewer impediments and boredom. Themes of loneliness and utilization of various coping strategies were more pronounced among those who increased cannabis and/or alcohol use. For some, increases in cannabis/alcohol use were temporary until participants adjusted to ?a new normal? or embraced more adaptive coping strategies. Results suggest monitoring cannabis/alcohol use trends and identifying coping strategies to reduce the pandemic?s impact on substance use and mental health.","Fedorova, Ekaterina V.; Wong, Carolyn F.; Conn, Bridgid M.; Ataiants, Janna, Iverson, Ellen, Lankenau, Stephen E.","https://doi.org/10.1177/00220426211052673","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Journal of Drug Issues;: 00220426211052673, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Drug Issues;: 00220426211052673, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19888,""
"Pandemic rage: Everyday frustrations in times of the COVID-19 crisis","In this study, the authors use data from qualitative research to examine the phenomenon of pandemic rage in everyday life. They define pandemic rage as an emotional reaction to feelings of anger, frustration and helplessness resulting from the conviction that fundamental rules have been violated during a pandemic, which is perceived (by the person experiencing pandemic rage) as provocation, impertinence, insolence, and crossing boundaries. The article takes a closer look at the relations between space, normative order, behaviours and pandemic rage. It first introduces the linkages between the occurrence of pandemic rage and the experience of spatial compression in the private and public spheres, situations of feeling ?condensed? and ?condemned? in the presence of others, and proxemic disturbances. Then the article discusses endogenous and exogenous catalysts of pandemic rage.

"Emotions During the COVID-19 Crisis: A Health Versus Economy Analysis of Public Responses","People all over the world were under severe stress and were concerned about their health after a devastating pandemic struck the world in the form of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late December 2019. Many nations imposed strict lockdowns and quarantines, causing citizens to maintain social isolation, throwing many companies to a halt. Thousands of people took to Twitter during these challenging circumstances to express their feelings about being caught in the middle of a storm. Twitter witnessed an outpouring of emotions ranging from fear, anger, and sadness associated with the spread of a novel virus that has no known cure, to voices of support and trust for nations? official response to the pandemic. In studying the emotional response (anger, fear, and sadness) on Twitter about the COVID-19 crisis, we thus see a tale of two crises unfold?choosing health or economy. We capture collective emotions on social media and investigate the patterns and impact of these negative emotions during various stages of the disease outbreak. It also provides crucial insights to health officials and government agencies on communicating crisis information to the public via social media.","Vemprala, Naga, Bhatt, Paras, Valecha, Rohit, Rao, H.

"Psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among frontline doctors of Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 3;peer review: 2 approved]","Background: Frontline doctors are the most vulnerable and high-risk population to get the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. Methods: In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, twoitem version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01;moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000;mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03;moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03).Conclusions: The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Inadequate resources are contributing to the poor mental health of Bangladeshi doctors. The supply of sufficient resources in workplaces and mental health counseling may help to mitigate the burden of the psychological symptoms identified among the respondents","Barua, L.; Zaman, M.

"Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated with Anxiety and Depression Among the General Population in Africa During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (preprint)","Background: Medical and socio-economic uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have had a substantial impact on the mental health. This study aimed to systematically review the existing literature reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general populace in Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine associated risk factors.Methods: The study adopted a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. African Journal Online, CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched from database inception until August 2021 for primary studies reporting the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among the general populace in African settings. Published systematic reviews, review protocols and conference abstracts were excluded. Two authors independently conducted the methodological quality assessment using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Summary data on the prevalence of anxiety and depression were also independently extracted by two authors. Meta-analyses on prevalence rates were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. The review protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021228023). Findings: Seventy-eight primary studies (62,380 participants) were identified from 2,325 studies via electronic and manual searches. Pooled prevalence rates for anxiety (47%, 95% CI:40-54%, I2 =99Â·19%) and depression (48%, 95% CI:39-57%, I2 =99Â·45%) were reported across Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sex (female) and history of existing medical/chronic conditions were identified as major risk factors for anxiety and depression.Interpretation: To our knowledge, this is the first review to examinevalee prnce rates and risk factors associated with anxiety and depression among the general African populace during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence put forth in this synthesis demonstrates the substantial impact of the pandemic on the pervasiveness of these psychological symptoms among the general population.

"Lockdown experiences and views on future research participation of autistic adults in the UK during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","The COVID-19 lockdown was a set of nationwide public health restrictions in force on the UK from March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Co-occurring anxiety and depression in autistic people placed them at heightened risk of potential adverse mental health due to the lockdown. Furthermore, the impact of current and future public health measures on autistic peopleâ€™s willingness to take part in autism research was unknown. We carried out in-depth interviews with 31 autistic adults exploring their experiences of the COVID-19 lockdown and how the pandemic may affect future research participation. Transcripts were analysed thematically within a critical realism framework. Participants identified positive aspects of lockdown such as enjoying the lack of social pressures and using their well-developed skills for dealing with uncertainty. Autistic people also shared challenges of adjusting to lockdown, e.g., rapid change in daily routines. While hopeful about the freedom gained from easing restrictions, participants were concerned about the inconsistent communication and application of rules during the transition out of lockdown which may exacerbate already rising mental health issues among autistic people. The participants viewed research participation and engagement with increased relevance during the pandemic and welcomed efforts to conduct research using online methods of communication. The COVID-19 lockdown had a varied effect in the lives and routines of autistic people. However, healthcare providers and researchers need to be mindful of rising mental health issues during the pandemic, especially for people who were already vulnerable. The response to the pandemic may have offered opportunities for innovation in research processes enabling more autistic people to engage with research and making studies more inclusive.","Rojas, Alba Realpe, Mills, Nicola, Beasant, Lucy, Douglas, Sarah, Kenny, Lorcan, Rai, Dheeraj","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ncbem","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19895,""
"Investigation of In-hospital COVID-19 Mortality and One-year Follow-up of Lung Function and Health Status with Respect to the Initial Disease Severity (preprint)","Background:  Globally, thousands of patients suffer from long-term COVID-19 symptoms, often referred to as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, a condition that already affects our health systems. Although there is a growing literature upon the long-term effects of SARS - CoV - 2 infection, there are up to date only a few reports on long-term follow up of pulmonary function after severe COVID-19. Methods: : The study is an observational cohort of patients who were admitted to hospital care with confirmed COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave and those who required some form of supplementary oxygen delivery. Baseline characteristics, demographic data and information about hospital stay including mortality were obtained by medical charts. Patients were divided in to 3 groups: group 1 (intensive care unit (ICU)-invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), group 2 (high-flow nasal-cannula (HFNC) and/or none-invasive ventilation (NIV) and group 3 (regular oxygen delivery treatment). All patients were required to answer questionnaires (mMRC scale, Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale (PCFS), Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HAD) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)) at one year after acute infection, while patients in groups 1 and 2 performed also dynamic spirometry. The R-language of statistics was used for all calculations and visualisations. Results: : The study population consisted of 130 patients. Forty five (35%) patients died at the hospital. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality were age, hypertension, ischemic heart disease and renal disease. Patients who survived had, on average, a longer period from symptoms onset to hospital admission. No significant difference in all health scales between the 3 patient groups were found. Mean values of both FEV1% and FVC% in the groups 1 and 2 were detected within the lower normal limits while no difference was found between the two groups who were examined with spirometry. Conclusions: : The main result of the study is lung function values in the lower limit of normal evaluated with dynamic spirometry at one-year follow-up. There were no significant differences related to initial disease severity in lung function and long-term health status at 12 months, which suggests that more generous lung function testing even in less severe individuals with lingering symptoms could be indicated.","Agholme, Jonas, Cederquist, Karin, Vougas, Konstantinos, Schimanke, Mirjam, Eldh, Tove, Effraimidis, Petros, Triantafyllidou, Christina","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-951451/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19896,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Indiaâ€™s Internal Migration (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic left Indiaâ€™s social and economic identity trembling with the majority of its brunt being borne by the downtrodden and migrant populations of India. Experts have reported that the sheer scale of the problem at hand could easily be one the largest migration crises India has ever faced with estimates of up to 400 million workers being unable to afford basic necessities (Nair & Verma, 2020). This research study aims to investigate and outline the contributing factors of this crisis by analyzing the overarching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indian society since the pandemicâ€™s inception. This will be done by specializing data sources and analysis in three foundational aspects: (a) mental health, (b) gender gap, and (c) caste & socioeconomic barriers. The methodology will consist of primary and secondary data sources which when implemented effectively will paint a holistic picture of the adversities and obstacles faced by the migrant laborers. The studyâ€™s ultimate aim is to provide comprehensive analysis of the effects of government policies on migrants in India and to suggest detailed reforms in order to create an improved environment for the internal migrants in the country. Utilizing the results of the data analysis and its inferences, we suggest both short-term, and long-term solutions to this rapidly deteriorating migration crisis including: government distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations, providing wage support for migrant workers, and the building of a stronger framework to allow for safer migration throughout the country. Considering the implications and limitations of this research as universal inapplicability of potential solutions continue to persist in political scenarios due to corruption and politicize agendas, the paper discusses how current foundational elements within India can be strengthened in order to better favor the lives of the migrant workers therefore increasing the overall sustainability of the entire Indian workforce and economy.","Wankhede, Pravartika, Mukherjea, Shagnik, Banuana, Vanshita, Subramaniam, Raghav, Basha, Mohid, Sainarayan, Akshith, Harlalka, Leher, Savio, Sarah, Prakash, Vijay, Rajuskar, Chitra, Kadlak, Hemangi","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+COVID-19+on+Indiaâ€™s+Internal+Migration+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19897,""
"Factors Associated with Anxiety-Related Disorders in Children and Adolescents during COVID-19 in Oman: A Cross-Sectional Study (preprint)","BACKGROUND: Reports from different parts of the world suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown and social distancing measures have heralded unprecedented mental health challenges among children and adolescents. To date, there is a dearth of studies emerging from the Arabian Gulf, where the majority of its population are children and adolescents. The study aims to examine the prevalence of anxiety-related disorders and their covariates among children and adolescents in an Arabian Gulf country, Oman. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analytic study carried out over two weeks (1st to 15th of August 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic across Oman. Parents were asked to complete the online survey, which consisted of the parent version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED-41) scale and questions regarding basic socio-demographic information. Logistic regression was used to identify the contributing variables associated with anxiety-related disorders. RESULTS: A total of 790 children, 33.3% (n=263) fulfilled the criteria for anxiety-related disorders. Logistic regression analysis suggested that anxiety-related disorders in children were significantly associated with three demographic variables. The model shows that children with divorced or separated parents were 1.9 times more likely to have anxiety-related disorders than children of married couples (OR=1.93, p=0.035). Children living in families with an income below USD 1,000/month, were 1.8 times more likely to have anxiety-related disorders than a family with an income of USD 4,000/month (OR=1.833, p=0.018). Children in grades 3-6 were 1.8 times more likely to have anxiety-related disorders than those in grades 1-2 (OR=1.79, p=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety-related disorders are common among Arabic-speaking Omani children and adolescents. They are more likely to be reported in middle scholastic grade levels and children from families with marital discord and low socioeconomic status. It is not clear whether the presently observed rates of anxiety exceed the prevalence that would have been observed pre-COVID-19 era.

"Digital screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic: a public health concern","Due to the restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, different population groups have adapted to varying screen time levels, which may have profound implications on their physical and mental wellbeing. Several empirical studies included in this review reported a sudden upward change in screen time across different population groups. A higher number of people with increased screen time compared to their pre-pandemic state and prolonged duration of total screen time substantiates such assertions. The available evidence suggests that screen time is associated with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, myopia, depression, sleep disorders, and several non-communicable diseases. This elevated burden of diseases is more prevalent among individuals who have sedentary lifestyles and other unhealthy behaviors that are likely to increase during quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. Hence, it is critical to assess the adverse health outcomes that may appear as long-term consequences of such behavior. Researchers and practitioners need to revisit the available guidelines and incorporate evidence-based interventions for preventing unhealthy screen time among the affected individuals. Such interventions may address harmful behaviors associated with screen time and promote active lifestyles that may improve health across populations during and after this pandemic.","Sultana, A.; Tasnim, S.; Hossain, M.

Methods: This instrument development research subjects were 142 caregivers of persons with schizophrenia and co-occurring methamphetamine use. Sample size adequacy was tested by Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO), and Bartlett's test of sphericity tested the adequacy of the item correlation matrix. The second-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the theoretical model. Results The 32-item TIBSCSM showed convergent validity correlations with two quality-of-life measures. Additionally, KMO=0.9, Bartlett's Test of Sphericity x2=5248.5, df=496, p&lt;0.001, and internal consistency reliability was high (a=0.9). The CFA has shown that the findings are supported by the theoretical models (x2=325.2, df=287, p&lt;0.001, RMSEA=0.0, CFI =0.9). Conclusion: The TIBSCSM scale has potential benefits for psychiatric nurses and psychiatric care teams to measure the impact and care burden of caregivers of persons with schizophrenia and methamphetamine use in the areas of nursing, research, education, and clinical determination. The test results suggested that The TIBSCSM scale has potential benefits for psychiatric and mental health care team to assess the impact and burden care of schizophrenic caregiver for both research and clinical purposes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic for providing care to relieve the impact and burden of care.","Imkome, E.

"A Cross-sectional Analysis of the Impact of COVID-19 Related Stressors on Canadian University Studentsâ€™ Mental Health and Wellbeing (preprint)","Background:  National, cross-sectional data suggests that over one third of young, post-secondary aged adults are endorsing moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of pandemic-related stressors on university studentsâ€™ levels of psychological distress, using a large sample of students attending schools across Canada.MethodsThis study analyzed the first data time point of a cross-sectional, repeated measures study of university student stress completed during the 2020-2021 academic year. Participants ( n = 4954) were students attending fourteen universities across Canada. Participants completed an online survey that included questions about demographics, stress, COVID-19 diagnosis history, psychological distress, history of mental illness, and resilience.ResultsParticipants reported the highest mean severity of stress ratings for the following COVID-19 related stressors: the pandemicâ€™s effect on academics ( XÂ¯ = 2.76, SD = 1.06) and uncertainty around how long the pandemic will last ( XÂ¯ = 2.68, SD = 0.95). Average psychological distress score was high in this sample ( XÂ¯ = 28.67, SD= 9.53) with nearly half the sample scoring in the â€˜severe distressâ€™ category. Modified log poisson regression models were stratified by high/low resiliency. Within the low resilience stratum, the strongest associations were observed for: COVID-19â€™s effect on academics (RR= 1.14 [95% CI 1.08, 1.20]);difficulties accessing health care during the pandemic (RR= 1.12 [95% CI 1.07, 1.18]);and loneliness as a result of quarantine/self-isolation (R= 1.11 [95% CI 1.06, 1.16]). Within the high resilience stratum, the strongest associations were observed for: COVID-19â€™s effect on academics (RR= 1.32 [95% CI 1.25, 1.41]);difficulties accessing healthcare during the pandemic (RR= 1.25 [95% CI 1.18, 1.33]));and uncertainty around how long the pandemic will last (RR= 1.24 [95% CI 1.16, 1.32]). Notably, larger effects were observed for those in the high resilience stratum, contrary to expectations.ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that studentsâ€™ psychological distress has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to effectively support studentsâ€™ wellbeing throughout the pandemic and beyond, improved understanding of stress related to COVID-19 is needed. Implications of this study and areas for future research are discussed.","Linden, Brooke, Monaghan, Caitlin, Zheng, Sally, Rose, Jake, Mahar, Alyson","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-971271/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19902,""
"COVID-19 and Neurosurgery: A Comprehensive Review of Literature (preprint)","The 2019 Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19) first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has disseminated rapidly to almost every region of the world to become a pandemic. COVID-19 is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2. The principal signs and symptoms are related to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems;however, the nervous system is another primary target of this devastating disease, according to numerous case reports and some reviews that have been published. Moreover, neurosurgical issues have also been dramatically affected. This comprehensive review aims to summarize the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical issues. In addition, we aim to serve as a reference for neurosurgeons dealing with neurosurgical cases of the disease. The article emphasized neurological display of COVID-19, neurosurgical practice, contagion control and precautions, residency, and education in neurosurgery, neurosurgeons' mental health.

"Coughing Customer: Karen vs the Frontline (preprint)","This paper explores the context of a coughing customer for frontline workers during their job duties within the timeframe of the Covid-19 pandemic. With a sample of 38 participants, we utilized semi-structured interviews to enhance understanding of cognitive, emotional, and vocational challenges present when a frontline worker perceived a health risk (coughing) while working. Employing qualitative content analysis and text mining, the findings indicate both contexts of the actual cough and the environment in which the cough takes place to encourage the cognitive process to trigger the behavioral immune system for frontline workers. Furthermore, the findings suggest the behavioral immune system may be similar to the actual biological immune system with its adaptability. Beyond traditional qualitative content analysis, we utilized multiple regression with quantified values for emotional content derived from text mining efforts to create a model to predict the percentage of emotional words likely to be used by a participant from the percentage of words associated with other emotional content. Through regression analysis, we found when prompted by a coughing customer, the amount of expressed disgust will be moderated by the emotions: anticipation, fear, and sadness. Along with propositions, we suggest implications and directions for future research.","Aplin-Houtz, Matthew, Sanders, Mark, Lane, Emily, Clark Jeffries, Tracey","https://www.google.com/search?q=Coughing+Customer:+Karen+vs.+the+Frontline+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19904,""
"California Wildfire Exposure, Vulnerability, and Mental Health: Who gets to recover and who does not? (preprint)","One of the various aftereffects of persistent climate change is an upsurge in the frequency, severity, and effect of wildfires on the wellbeing of suffering communities. The destruction and wreckage of one's home, properties, and the surrounding neighborhood, as well as the threat to one's psychological safety and the safety of loved ones, can have long-term effects on survivors' mental health. The central goal of this study, therefore, is threefold. Firstly, identify the significant qualitative and quantitative studies that examine the impacts of wildfire on mental health. This study mainly focuses on studies that capture the effects of wildfire, smoke, and air quality in California and how that affected the local communities based on their vulnerability determinants. Secondly, the study examines both types of studies to find common grounds regarding the most vulnerable population and their mental health, their ability to seek professional help, and barriers to the road to recovery. Finally, this study provides evidence-based strategies for including more vulnerable members of society in receiving sufficient and timely psychological care to recover from PTSD, trauma, distress, and hopelessness. Migrant farmworkers, particularly younger female Hispanic and indigenous workers, suffer from the wildfire's long-term stress, PTSD, depression, and emotional distress. Furthermore, the continued COVID-19 deepens the gap, social stigma, and barriers to receiving sufficient mental health care to recover and rehabilitate traumatic wildfire exposure. A localized mental healthcare support system based on equity, with flexible infrastructure and greater accessibility, promises to be more efficient and advantageous for underrepresented and vulnerable individuals seeking mental health treatment and quick recovery.","Afzal, Muhammad Hassan Bin","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qs2a8","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19905,""
"â€œAny advice for a pre-dad who is freaking out?â€: A qualitative analysis of paternal perinatal experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic using the reddit forum predaddit (preprint)","During the COVID-19 pandemic, new parents were disproportionately affected due to public health restrictions that changed service accessibility and increased stressors. Yet, minimal research to date has examined specific pandemic-related stressors and experiences of perinatal fathers in naturalistic anonymous settings. An important and relatively novel way parents seek connection and information is through online forum use, which increased during the social isolation of the pandemic. The current study qualitatively analyzed the experiences of perinatal fathers from September to December 2020 (792 posts, 8011 comments) through Framework Analytic Approach to identify unmet support needs during COVID-19 using the online subforum, predaddit. Five main themes emergent in the thematic framework included forum use, COVID-19, psychosocial distress, family functioning, and child health and development, each of which contained related subthemes. Findings highlight the utility of predaddit as a source of information for and interactions of fathers to inform mental health services.","Cameron, Emily, Simpson, Kaeley, Pierce, Shayna, Penner, Kailey, Beyak, Alanna, Gomez, Irlanda, Bowes, John-Michael, Reynolds, Kristin, Tomfohr-Madsen, Lianne, Roos, Leslie","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fdh7k","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19906,""
"15-Month Health Outcomes of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients from Onset: A Cohort Study (preprint)","Background: The long-term impact of COVID-19 on patient health has been a recent focus. This study aims to determine the persistent symptoms and psychological conditions of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 15 months after onset. The potential risk factors were also explored.Methods: A cohort of COVID-19 patients discharged from February 20, 2020 to March 31, 2020 was recruited. Follow-ups were conducted using validated questionnaires and psychological screening scales at 15 months after onset to evaluate the patientsâ€™ health status. The risk factors for long-term health impacts and their associations with disease severity was analyzed.Findings: 534 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The median age of the patients was 62.0 years old (IQR 52.0-70.0) and 295 were female (55.2%). The median time from onset to follow-up was 460.0 (451.0-467.0) days. Sleep disturbance (18.5%, 99/534) and fatigue (17.2%, 92/534) were the most common persistent symptoms. 6.4% (34/534) of the patients had depression, 9.2% (49/534) were anxious, 13.0% (70/534) had insomnia and 4.7% (25/534) suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Multivariate adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that glucocorticoid use during hospitalization (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.12-11.44) was significantly associated with an increased risk of fatigue. The OR values for anxiety and sleep disorders were 2.36 (95% CI 1.07-5.20) and 2.16 (95% CI 1.13-4.14) in females compared with males. The OR value of PTSD was 25.6 (95% CI 3.3-198.4) in patients with persistent symptoms to those without persistent symptoms. No significant associations were observed between fatigue syndrome or adverse mental outcomes and disease severity.Interpretation: 15-month follow-up in this study aroused the need of extended rehabilitation intervention for complete recovery in COVID-19 patients.

"Translating Personal Tragedy into Action: Starting the Dr Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation (preprint)","In 2020, Jennifer and Corey Feist started the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Fund in memory of Jennifer's sister. As the head of the emergency department at a Manhattan hospital, Lorna Breen had treated patients at hospitals overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, contracted the disease herself, and then tragically taken her own life. The Feists hoped the fund would bring new attention to the desperate need for improved support for health care workers' mental well-being. Now in late summer, it is garnering significant, and increasing, support. The Feists plan to turn the fund into a foundation, but they face decisions about how to accept donations, follow up with donors, and avoid duplicating the efforts of other organizations. Their challenge is to crystallize a long-term mission while maintaining the current fundraising momentum stemming from the media attention surrounding Breen's death.Through this case, students will grapple with difficult issues, including mental health challenges, burnout among health care providers, and suicide. Students also will learn about the challenges of starting a nonprofit and its lifecycle. Finally, they will be able to put practice into action and flesh out the mission for a nonprofit. Excerpt Rev.

"A social media-based study on the psychological impact of COVID-19 infections in recovered and recovering patients (preprint)","Objective:  The WHO has stressed to regularly monitor the mental health of populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we conducted this study to examine anxiety and depression among recovered and recovering COVID-19 patients. Subjects and Methods : An online survey was conducted using social media platforms. The study participants were COVID-19 infected individuals who had recovered or still were in the recovery phase from COVID-19. We collected information on demographics, clinical characteristics and physical complications of COVID-19. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using previously validated tools. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were applied to analyze the data. Results:  53.4% of respondents reported that they had a fear of getting COVID-19 again. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were present in 71.7% and 97.6% of respondents respectively. Both disorders were present in 71.3% of respondents. The respondents with shorter durations of physical symptoms (&lt; 2 weeks) demonstrated less anxiety (OR = 0.19;95% CI: 0.05 - 0.67) and depression (OR = 0.03;95% CI: 0.01 - 0.37).

"Remote Assessment of Executive Function in Preschool-Aged Children: Feasibility and Associations with Cardiac Measures (preprint)","Assessment of executive function in young children is amongst the most commonly used cognitive assessments;however, there is a paucity of childhood executive function assessment methods which can be used remotely. Here, we present a novel adaptation of two child-friendly variants of the Stroop task (i.e., â€œDay-Nightâ€;â€œHappy-Sadâ€), which were conducted remotely with a small (N=40) sample of 3-to 5-year-old children of mothers with depression, taking part of a larger clinical trial. During the assessment, childrenâ€™s heart rate at baseline and during each task was measured using wrist-worn heart rate monitors. The tasks showed good feasibility in this sample, as the majority of children (80%) completed both tasks, with wide variability in task performance and completion time observed across children. Correlation analyses showed that older age and slower resting heart rate were related to better performance and faster completion time on each task. Follow-up regression analyses including age, household income, baseline heart rate, and heart rate reactivity as predictors accounted for significant variability in task performance and completion time for the Day-Night and Happy-Sad tasks. In the final models, age was a significant predictor of task performance and completion time across both tasks. Resting heart rate was not a significant predictor of task performance for either task, but was a significant predictor of completion time across tasks;children with slower resting heart rate completed the tasks faster. Despite limitations, our findings support the feasibility of online, remote assessment of executive function in young children with implications for researchers and clinicians during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.","Penner-Goeke, Lara, Hatherly, Kathryn, Roos, Leslie, Giuliano, Ryan Jeffrey","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/9djh4","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19910,""
"Health and financial costs of adverse childhood experiences in 28 European countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Summary Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with increased health risks across the life course. We aimed to estimate the annual health and financial burden of ACEs for 28 European countries. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Criminal Justice Databases, and Education Resources Information Center for quantitative studies (published Jan 1, 1990, to Sept 8, 2020) that reported prevalence of ACEs and risks of health outcomes associated with ACEs. Pooled relative risks were calculated for associations between ACEs and harmful alcohol use, smoking, illicit drug use, high body-mass index, depression, anxiety, interpersonal violence, cancer, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and respiratory disease. Country-level ACE prevalence was calculated using available data. Country-level population attributable fractions (PAFs) due to ACEs were generated and applied to 2019 estimates of disability-adjusted life-years. Financial costs (US$ in 2019) were estimated using an adapted human capital approach. Findings In most countries, interpersonal violence had the largest PAFs due to ACEs (range 14Â·7â€“53Â·5%), followed by harmful alcohol use (15Â·7â€“45Â·0%), illicit drug use (15Â·2â€“44Â·9%), and anxiety (13Â·9%â€“44Â·8%). Harmful alcohol use, smoking, and cancer had the highest ACE-attributable costs in many countries. Total ACE-attributable costs ranged from $0Â·1 billion (Montenegro) to $129Â·4 billion (Germany) and were equivalent to between 1Â·1% (Sweden and Turkey) and 6Â·0% (Ukraine) of nationsâ€™ gross domestic products. Interpretation Availability of ACE data varies widely between countries and country-level estimates cannot be directly compared. However, findings suggest ACEs are associated with major health and financial costs across European countries. The cost of not investing to prevent ACEs must be recognised, particularly as countries look to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted services and education, and potentially increased risk factors for ACEs.

"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress in epilepsy patients during COVID-19: A systematic review","Objective COVID-19 pandemic disease has profound consequences for physical and mental health. In this regard, health care for chronic diseases, especially epilepsy is neglected The purpose of this systematic review study is to investigate the epidemic effect of COVID-19 on increasing the prevalence of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and sleep disorders in people with epilepsy (PWE). Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, Web of science, Scopus, and Psych info databases for studies that estimate the prevalence of mental disorders in people with epilepsy during the COVID-19 until December 2020. Inclusion criteria included samples of population, with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy. Results whether PWE or people without epilepsy (PWOE), experienced stress and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the studies showed that PWE and even PWOE during the pandemic, suffer from depression. The highest rate of depression was attributed to female PWE with financial problems (66.7%) and the lowest rate of depression in PWE was reported in 8.6%. 7.1â€“71.2% and 28.2% of patients reported sleep disorders and insomnia respectively. Less than 2% experienced a sleep improvement. Limitations: due to a large amount of heterogeneities across the results, we could not evaluate the exact rate of prevalence in spite of using effective measures. Conclusions PWE were considered as a susceptible group to the impact of the pandemic. Therefore, it should be paid great attention to PWE and provided adequate psychological supports in this period to relieve or inhibit risks to mental health in PWE.","Tashakori-Miyanroudi, Mahsa, Souresrafil, Aghdas, Hashemi, Paria, Jafar Ehsanzadeh, Seyed, Farrahizadeh, Maryam, Behroozi, Zahra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108410","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Epilepsy & Behavior;: 108410, 2021.; Publication details: Epilepsy & Behavior;: 108410, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19912,""
"Conceptualization and Implementation of an interdisciplinary clinic for children with drug-resistant epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective To describe the rapid conceptualization and implementation of an interdisciplinary epilepsy clinic for children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) at Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) during the COVID 19 pandemic. Methods Focusing on care design and care coordination for children with DRE, multiple stakeholder groups decided to implement a clinic after the systematic rating of constructs present in a theoretical meta-analytic framework. Based on the projected success, the new interdisciplinary clinic (composed of an epileptologist, a neurosurgeon, and a neuropsychologist and coordinated by a full-time nurse) was established. Clinic operations were further refined through discussions with patients, families, and care providers. We collected data retrospectively (August 2020 to June 2021) to determine referral patterns, clinic scheduling metrics, patient characteristics, clinical recommendations, and epilepsy quality metrics. Results Of the 32 Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs assessed, 24 were positively rated to predict a high probability of successful implementation of the clinic. For approximately 100 patient visits, appearance and usage rates were &gt;75%, yielding a clinic utilization rate of approximately 60%. Among 76 unique patients (average age of 12 years, 60% focal epilepsy), 39 patients (51.3%) were deemed eligible for epilepsy surgery evaluation. The majority of the patients (53.9%) were advised for additional diagnostic testing, and 31.6% of patients were scheduled for vagus nerve stimulation. More patients (33%) had changes in their existing anti-seizure medication (ASM) regimen rather than an addition of a new ASM (7.9%). Standardized epilepsy quality measures showed &gt;80% to 90% adherence in 3 (reproductive counseling, depression and anxiety screening, documentation of seizure frequency) out of 4 metrics. Significance This is the first study to show that an interdisciplinary clinic can be a valuable attribute of care models in high-need children with DRE by enabling comprehensive one-stop service for diagnostic evaluation, surgical consideration, and brief assessment of psychiatric comorbidities without compromising consensus-based best practices.","Samanta, Debopam, Elumalai, Vimala, Desai, Vidya C.; Leigh Hoyt, Megan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108403","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Epilepsy & Behavior;: 108403, 2021.; Publication details: Epilepsy & Behavior;: 108403, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19913,""
"COVID-19 and gender differences in mental health in low- and middle-income countries: Young working women are more vulnerable","This study examines gender differences in the relationship between COVID-19-triggered economic hardship and mental health complaints, defined by self-reported anxiety/depression, of young people (17â€“29) in four low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To do this, we use two waves of the Young Lives (YL) phone survey. Logistic regression results show that young women, on average, were more likely to report anxiety than men in Peru and Vietnam in the first survey wave (Juneâ€“July 2020). However, this disparity continued to persist in all four countries in the second wave (Augustâ€“October 2020) as the pandemic prolonged. Notably, we find that young women that faced economic hardship by losing job or income were more likely to report anxiety than their male counterparts. As COVID-19 cases are skyrocketing in many LMICs while shutting down economic activities, the vulnerability of young women may likely increase. This issue requires urgent policy attention by awareness-raising campaigns, more hotline services for emergency help, social security programs for women, and available women's sexual and reproductive health services at a specific section in hospitals.","Hossain, Mobarak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2021.100039","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100039, 2021.; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100039, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19914,""
"Early psychological health outcomes among United States healthcare professionals, essential workers, and the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic: The influence of occupational status","The primary purpose of this study was to determine variations in psychological experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic among US healthcare workers, non-healthcare essential workers, and the general population. A cross-sectional survey was conducted online from June 22, 2020 to July 5, 2020, with 5,023 participants aged 18 years and older. The prevalence of fear of COVID-19 and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder were evaluated, using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-8, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to explore sociodemographic and COVID-19-related risk factors. Using models unadjusted for working status, it was found healthcare workers endorsed less fear of COVID-19, depression, and PTSD symptoms, than the general public. After adjusting for working status, no further significant differences were found between occupational groups. Across all psychological distress outcomes, those who were not working or were unemployed due to COVID-19 reported more symptoms than did individuals who continued to work from their normal location or remotely. A similar trend was found for nurses and physicians, with members of both groups reporting symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD less when working from their normal location than when unemployed due to COVID-19.","Warren, Ann Marie, Bennett, Monica, Danesh, Valerie, Waddimba, Anthony, Tovar, Mario, Gottlieb, Robert L.; Powers, Mark B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycom.2021.100005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Psychiatry Research Communications;: 100005, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry Research Communications;: 100005, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19915,""
"Initial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on College Student Mental Health: A Longitudinal Examination of Risk and Protective Factors","The spread of the novel coronavirus has led to unprecedented changes in daily living. College students (NÂ =Â 205) completed a battery of questionnaires in April of 2020, after having completed similar measures 8, 5, and 2 months prior as part of a larger study. A repeated measures ANOVA suggested significantly greater depression and anxiety symptom severity during the pandemic than any other time during the 2019-2020 academic year. Two-thirds reported a level of distress above clinical cutoffs on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Pre-existing depression and anxiety symptom severity was associated with grater psychological distress during the pandemic. One quarter of students reported using substances to cope and denied help-seeking from any source. Static and modifiable factors associated with psychological distress and controlling for pre-existing psychological distress were examined. Cognitive and behavioral avoidance, online social engagement and problematic Internet use conferred greater risk. Women and Latinx participants were more likely to experience elevated distress during the pandemic, even when controlling for distress prior to the pandemic.","Zimmermann, Martha, Bledsoe, Casandra, Papa, Anthony","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114254","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114254, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114254, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19916,""
"Prevalence and associated factors of anxiety among 538500 Chinese students during the outbreak of COVID-19: A web-based cross-sectional study","This study was conducted on elementary school students in Henan Province, China, from February 4th to 11th, 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. The purpose of the study was to examine the prevalence of anxiety among students and identify the related risk factors contributing to anxiety. Demographic information and psychological status were assessed by using self-reported measures. The generalized anxiety disorder tool (GAD-7) and a multiple logistic regression model were used to assess anxiety and identify potential influencing factors. Cross-sectional data indicated that the overall anxiety prevalence was 13.4%. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was highest among rural primary school students and lowest among city students. Three groups of students in different regions were surveyed, and the prevalence of anxiety symptoms was significantly higher among students with poor knowledge of COVID-19 than among students with good knowledge of COVID-19. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, it was found that location, knowledge, and practice were related to anxiety. This study showed that the prevalence of anxiety symptoms was higher among Chinese primary school students. The influencing factors found in this study may help relevant staff improve the mental health of children during the epidemic.","Wang, Juan, Mao, Zhenxing, Wei, Dandan, Liu, Pengling, Fan, Keliang, Xu, Qingqing, Wang, Lulu, Wang, Xian, Lou, Xiaomin, Lin, Hualiang, Sun, Chunyang, Wang, Chongjian, Wu, Cuiping","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114251","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114251, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114251, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19917,""
"Revisiting the sigma-1 receptor as a biological target to treat affective and cognitive disorders","Depression and cognitive disorders are severe conditions with complex and not-fully understood etiology. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically increased the prevalence of both conditions. Since the current treatments are inadequate in many patients, there is a constant need for discovering new compounds, which will be more effective in ameliorating depressive symptoms and treating cognitive decline. Proteins attracting much attention as potential targets for drugs treating these conditions are sigma-1 receptors. Sigma-1 receptors are multi-functional proteins localized in endoplasmic reticulum membranes, which play a crucial role in cellular signal transduction by interacting with receptors, ion channels, lipids, and kinases. Changes in their functions and expression may lead to various diseases, including depression or memory impairments. Thus, sigma-1 receptor modulation might be useful in treating these central nervous system diseases. Importantly, two sigma-1 receptor ligands entered clinical trials, showing that this compound group possesses therapeutic potential. Therefore, based on preclinical studies, this review discusses whether the sigma-1 receptor could be a promising target for drugs treating affective and cognitive disorders.","Salaciak, Kinga, Pytka, Karolina","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.10.037","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews;2021.; Publication details: Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19918,""
"Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived mastery in older adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam","Objective Governmental measures to protect older adults from COVID-19 are hypothesized to cause anxiety and depression. Previous studies are heterogeneous and showed small effects. This study aims to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms and perceived mastery just after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous years in community-dwelling older adults and to identify potential risk groups according to the comprehensive geriatric assessment framework. Methods Data were used from 1068 Dutch older adults (aged 55â€“93 at baseline in 2011â€“2013) participating in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, including 4 follow-ups spanning 9Â years. Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and feelings of mastery were assessed with the short Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale- Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and the Pearlin Mastery Scale. Linear mixed regression was used to compare outcomes in June-August 2020 to previous years and to examine predictors to identify risk groups. Results Slight increases in CES-D-10 (1.37, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 1.12;1.62), HADS-A (0.74, 95% CI 0.56;0.94) and mastery (1.10, 95% CI 0.88;1.31) occurred during the COVID year compared to previous years. Older adults with functional limitations or with frailty showed a smaller increase in feelings of mastery in the COVID-year. Conclusion Our results suggest limited mental health effects on older adults from the first COVID-19 wave. Older adults have perhaps better coping strategies than younger adults, or preventive measures did not have extensive consequences for the daily life of older adults. Further monitoring of depression, anxiety and perceived mastery is recommended.","van den Besselaar, Judith H.; MacNeil Vroomen, Janet L.; Buurman, Bianca M.; Hertogh, Cees M. P.

"The impact of coronavirus on individuals with problematic hoarding behaviours","We aimed at investigating the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on individuals with problematic hoarding behaviors. One hundred seventeen subjects with hoarding problems responded to the Coronavirus Stressful and Traumatic Rating Scale, an instrument that quantified the number of coronavirus-related events, whether they were experienced as stressful, and the range of emotions resulting from them. The research subjects also answered self-report tools to evaluate the severity of hoarding, hoarding beliefs/motivations, social support, self-efficacy, internalized stigma, and other psychopathological symptoms. The number of stressful coronavirus-related events was predicted by lower age at onset of hoarding, decreased social support, greater severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and lower intensity of concerns over memory as drivers of hoarding. Two emotional states experienced in the aftermath of trauma, namely greater helplessness and lower sadness, and higher depression, anxiety and distress, predicted greater severity of hoarding. There were significant associations between the coronavirus pandemic and hoarding disorder phenotypes, including greater severity of hoarding symptoms.","Fontenelle, Leonardo F.; Muhlbauer, Julia E.; Albertella, Lucy, Eppingstall, Jan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.10.042","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19920,""
"Social carrying capacity and emotion dynamics in urban national parks during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the mobility, accessibility, and behaviors of visitors dramatically. Under the impact of COVID-19, the social carrying capacity and emotion dynamics in parks and recreation areas are expected to change due to the uncertainty of health risks associated with visitorsâ€™ behaviors. This study conducted an on-site visitor survey at Leiqiong Global Geological Park, a national park located in urban-proximate areas in Haikou, China. This study aims to examine factors impacting visitorsâ€™ perceived crowding and emotions under varying levels of visitor use in urban national parks in the context of COVID-19. Study results suggest that visitors have the highest level of motivation for scenery and culture viewing and are generally satisfied with the environmental quality and design, COVID-19 prevention strategies and implementation efforts within the park. Moreover, this study suggests that the level of crowding, COVID-19 prevention strategies and implementation can affect visitorsâ€™ emotions in nature-based parks significantly. These findings highlight the importance of enforcing the social carrying capacity limits and COVID-19 prevention strategies for urban parks and protected areas to mitigate physical and mental health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xiao, Xiao, Gao, Jie, Lu, Junyu, Li, Peizhe, Zhang, Yuling","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jort.2021.100451","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism;: 100451, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism;: 100451, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19921,""
"The uptake and outcomes of Internet cognitive behavioural therapy for health anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Internet cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for health anxiety has demonstrated efficacy but has not been evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study presents the first evaluation of the uptake and outcomes of iCBT for health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods THIS WAY UP is an Australian digital mental health service which delivers iCBT interventions to community members. We compared the uptake of THIS WAY UPâ€™s iCBT course for health anxiety in an Australian adult sample who started the course before the pandemic (12th September 2019 to 11th March 2020) to during the pandemic (12th March to 11th June 2020). The course was accessible to Australian adults over 18 years old, with no inclusion criteria. Outcomes included course registrations and commencements, lesson and course completion, and self-reported health anxiety (Short Health Anxiety Inventory), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item) and distress (Kessler-10). Results From March to June 2020, we observed significant increases in course registrations (N=238 vs N=1057);and course commencements (N=126 vs. N= 778). Large, significant improvements in health anxiety (g= 0.89), and distress (K10: g=0.91), and medium improvements in depression (g=0.55) were found. Course completion during COVID was 30.5%. Conclusions iCBT improved health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provides scalable intervention that can address increased demands for mental health services in the community.","Sharrock, Maria J.; Mahoney, Alison E.

"When a nightmare comes true: Change in obsessive-compulsive disorder over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has particularly affected people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) has been suspected for those with contamination-related OCD (C-OCD). However, the course of OCS over the ongoing pandemic remains unclear. We assessed 268 participants with OCD (n = 184 with C-OCD) in an online survey at the beginning of the pandemic in Germany, reassessing 179 participants (66.8%, 104 C-OCD) three months later. We assessed severity of OCD (OCI-R), depression (PHQ-9), experiential avoidance, as well as functional and dysfunctional beliefs. Overall, OCS and depressive symptoms did not substantially change over time. However, when people with and without C-OCD were compared, symptoms improved in patients without C-OCD (nC-OCD) but remained stable in patients with C-OCD over time. Symptom improvement was associated with male gender, higher initial OCI-R, and nC-OCD. Experiential avoidance and beliefs at the beginning of the pandemic did not generally predict change in OCS. People with OCD, particularly those with nC-OCD, showed tentative signs for signs of adapting, whereas distress in those with C-OCD remained at a high level, underlining the burden for these patients. Clinicians should be informed about how to maintain effective treatment for C-OCD during a pandemic.","Jelinek, Lena, Voderholzer, Ulrich, Moritz, Steffen, Carsten, Hannes Per, Riesel, Anja, Miegel, Franziska","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102493","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Anxiety Disorders;: 102493, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Anxiety Disorders;: 102493, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19923,""
"Mental health among medical, healthcare, and other university students during the first COVID-19 lockdown in France","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns regarding its psychological effect on university students, especially healthcare students. We aimed at assessing the risk of mental health problems according to the type of university studies, by adjusting for potential confounders. Methods We used data from the COSAMe study, a national cross-sectional survey including 69,054 French university students during the first quarantine. The mental health outcomes evaluated were suicidal thoughts, severe self-reported distress (as assessed by the Impact of Events Scaleâ€“Revised), stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State subscale), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to test the association between the type of university studies (healthcare studies: medical and non-medical, and non-healthcare studies) and poor mental health outcomes, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, precariousness indicators, health-related data, quality of social relationships, and data about media consumption. Results Compared to non-healthcare students (N=59,404), non-medical healthcare (N=5,431) and medical students (N=4,193) showed a lower risk of presenting at least one poor mental health outcome (adjusted OR [95%CI]=0.86[0.81-0.92] and 0.87[0.81-0.93], respectively). Compared to nonhealthcare students, medical students were at lower risk of suicidal thoughts(0.83[0.74-0.93]), severe self-reported distress (0.75[0.69-0.82]) and depression (0.83[0.75-0.92]). Non-medical healthcare students were at lower risk of severe selfreported distress (0.79[0.73-0.85]), stress (0.92[0.85-0.98]), depression (0.83[0.76-0.91]), and anxiety (0.86[0.80-0.92]).

"THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN ITALY: DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE FIRST LOCKDOWN","ABSTRACT Background Italy was one of the first countries to be heavily hit by the spread of the new Coronavirus. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the real effect of COVID-19 on adult mental health. The Italian Twin Registry carried out a study to investigate, over time, the course of depressive symptoms in the general population. Methods : The study relies on data collected just before the beginning (February 2020) and the end (June 2020) of the first lockdown. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire, and total scores or categorized depression scores were considered in the analyses. Results A total of 1,690 adult twins were recruited.Â The study showed a mean depression score of 1.11 immediately before lockdown and 1.20 immediately after, with an overall prevalence of depressive symptoms increasing from 33.6% to 38.9%. Depressive symptoms immediately after the restriction period were associated with Covid-19 symptoms affecting households, financial problems due to the pandemic and poor social support. Independently of the baseline risk of depressive symptoms, we observed an increased risk among younger and less educated people. Compared to the pre-lockdown period, women and middle-aged people also were found to be at greater risk of developing depressive symptoms. Limitations Possible participation bias and residual selection bias. Conclusions The study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased depressive symptomatology and that, in such health emergency times, the most vulnerable persons are young adults, women, and those living in a socially, culturally, or economically disadvantaged environment.","Medda, Emanuela, Toccaceli, Virgilia, Gigantesco, Antonella, Picardi, Angelo, Fagnani, Corrado, Stazi, Maria Antonietta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.129","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19925,""
"Predictors and patterns of gambling behaviour across the COVID-19 lockdown: findings from a UK cohort study","The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy has raised concerns about negative coping behaviours to offset financial losses. We used a subset of a longitudinal study of UK adults (N=19,963) to examine a range of predictors of (i) gambling during the first strict lockdown, (ii) gambling more frequently during this strict lockdown compared to before lockdown, and (iii) continued increased frequency of gambling during the relaxation of restrictions. Results from logistic regressions indicated that among other factors, those with progressively lower levels of education, were stressed due to boredom, frequently drank alcohol, and had high risk-taking tendencies were more likely to gamble during strict lockdown. Individuals who were more likely to have increased their frequency of gambling during strict lockdown compared to before the lockdown were stressed by boredom, employed, frequently drank alcohol, and had depression and anxiety, whilst men and current smokers were less likely. As lockdown restrictions eased, individuals of ethnic minority backgrounds, who were current smokers, and with lower educational attainment were more likely to continue gambling more than usual. Findings contribute to knowledge of who is most at risk for increasing their gambling during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fluharty, Meg, Paul, Elise, Fancourt, Dr Daisy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.117","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19926,""
"The Effectiveness of Motivational Messages to ICU Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objectives To examine the effect of motivational messages on optimism, hopelessness, and life satisfaction of intensive care nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design This is a multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label study. Research Methodology/Design The study was conducted with a total of 87 nurses working in the COVID-19 intensive care units of three hospitals in Istanbul. Motivational messages were sent via SMS to the participants in the motivational group (n=41) for 21 days. The data were obtained using a Personal Information Form, the Life Orientation Test, Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Results The nursesâ€™ mean age in the motivational and control groups was 28.4Â±7.6 and 26.9Â±3.7 years, respectively. Before the messages, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of life orientation (p=0.059), hopelessness (p=0.214), and satisfaction with life (p=0.898) scores. After the messages, life orientation (p=0.042) and life satisfaction (p=0.040) scores were significantly higher in the motivational group compared with the control group, and the hopelessness score was significantly lower (p=0.005).

"The impact of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic on stress resilience and mental health: a critical review across waves","The global public health crisis caused by COVID-19 has lasted longer than many of us would have hoped and expected. With its high uncertainty and limited control, the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly asked a lot from all of us. One important central question is: how resilient have we proved in face of the unprecedented and prolonged coronavirus pandemic? There is a vast and rapidly growing literature that has examined the impact of the pandemic on mental health both on the shorter (2020) and longer (2021) term. This not only concerns pandemic-related effects on resilience in the general population, but also how the pandemic has challenged stress resilience and mental health outcomes across more specific vulnerable population groups: patients with a psychiatric disorder, COVID-19 diagnosed patients, health care workers, children and adolescents, pregnant women, and elderly people. It is challenging to keep up to date with, and interpret this rapidly increasing scientific literature. In this review, we provide a critical overview on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health and how human stress resilience has been shaped by the pandemic on the shorter and longer term. The vast literature is dominated by a wealth of data which are, however, not always of the highest quality and heavily depend on online and self-report surveys. Nevertheless, it appears that we have proven surprisingly resilient over time, with fast recovery from COVID-19 measures. Still, vulnerable groups such as adolescents and health care personnel that have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic do exist. Large interindividual differences exist, and for future pandemics there is a clear need to comprehensively and integratively assess resilience from the start to provide personalized help and interventions tailored to the specific needs for vulnerable groups.â€¢The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were often associated with increased levels of distress and depressive and anxiety symptoms in the general population.â€¢A substantial group of individuals has been either largely unaffected or is even doing better during the pandemic.â€¢Longitudinal follow up showed remarkable signs of resilience.â€¢Health care workers appear to be at an increased risk of stress-related psychological symptoms.â€¢The mental health of children, adolescents, and students has been particularly affected by the pandemic.â€¢Elderly people are more vulnerable to the physical effects of COVID-19, but also report lower psychopathology during the pandemic.â€¢Individuals with an existing psychiatric disorder are experiencing detrimental impact on their mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, but do not seem to have further increased symptom severity compared with their pre-pandemic levels.â€¢A high risk exists for psychiatric sequelae following a COVID-19 infection.â€¢Many methodological shortcomings occur in the current literature which is often cross-sectional and relies on self-report, and it is moreover hard to directly compare results across many of the studies.â€¢There is an urgent need for a personalized approach when it comes to identifying individuals at risk or resilient for the stressful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.â€¢The effects of stress and the resilience capacity are dependent on (neuro)biological, psychological, and environmental factors and also are heavily dependent on an individual's unique context.","Manchia, Mirko, Gathier, Anouk, Eser, Hale Yapici, Schmidt, Mathias V.; de Quervain, Dominique, van Amelsvoort, Therese, Bisson, Jonathan I.; Cryan, John F.; Howes, Oliver D.; Pinto, Luisa, van der Wee, Nic, Domschke, Katharina, Branchi, Igor, Vinkers, D.

There is little evidence beyond the initial months following the onset of the pandemic, despite national and regional restrictions persisting to mid-2021. Methods Descriptive time series analysis utilizing de-identified, primary care health records of 2.8 million patients from the Greater Manchester Care Record. Frequencies of self-harm episodes between 1st January 2019 and 31st May 2021 were examined, including stratification by sex, age group, ethnicity, and index of multiple deprivation quintile. Findings There were 33,444 episodes of self-harm by 13,148 individuals recorded during the study period. Frequency ratios of incident and all episodes of self-harm were 0.59 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.69) and 0.69 (CI 0.63 to 0.75) respectively in April 2020 compared to February 2020. Between August 2020 and May 2021 frequency ratios were 0.92 (CI 0.88 to 0.96) for incident episodes and 0.86 (CI 0.84 to 0.88) for all episodes compared to the same months in 2019. Reductions were largest among men and people living in the most deprived neighbourhoods, while an increase in all-episode self-harm was observed for adolescents aged 10â€“17. Interpretation Reductions in primary care-recorded self-harm persisted to May 2021, though they were less marked than in April 2020 during the first national lockdown. The observed reductions could represent longer term reluctance to seek help from health services. Our findings have implications for the ability for services to offer recommended care for patients who have harmed themselves.","Steeg, Sarah, Bojanic, Lana, Tilston, George, Williams, Richard, Jenkins, David A.; Carr, Matthew J.; Peek, Niels, Ashcroft, Darren M.; Kapur, Nav, Voorhees, Jennifer, Webb, Roger T.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101175","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: EClinicalMedicine; 41:101175, 2021.; Publication details: EClinicalMedicine; 41:101175, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19930,""
"Trends in cannabis use among US adults amid the COVID-19 pandemic","ABSTRACT Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on mental health and alcohol use in the US, however there is little research on its impacts on cannabis use. Considering the role of cannabis as a coping strategy or self-medicating behavior, there is a need to understand how individuals who use cannabis have adapted their use amid the pandemic. Therefore, this study examined changes in self-reported cannabis use among US adults in the context of COVID-19 pandemic by (1) describing trends of use during the first 8 months of the pandemic among adults who used cannabis in this period;and (2) characterizing trends of use within sociodemographic subgroups and by state cannabis policy status. Methods The sample consisted of 1,761 US adults who used cannabis at least once during the 8-month study period from the nationally representative Understanding America Study. Linear mixed-effect models were used to model changes in the number of days of past-week cannabis use across 16 waves from March 10, 2020, to November 11, 2020. Results Compared to early March, the number of days cannabis was used per week was significantly higher at the start of April (ÃŸ=0.11, 95% CI=0.03, 0.18) and May (ÃŸ=0.21,95% CI=0.05, 0.36). In subsequent months (June - November), the number of days of cannabis use attenuated to levels comparable to March. Trends of cannabis use across the study period generally did not differ across sociodemographic characteristics and state cannabis policy status. Conclusion Though increases in use were marginal among many groups, the evolving pandemic and the growing concern for the mental health of segments of the U.S. population warrant close monitoring of coping behaviors, including substance use.","Brenneke, Savannah G.; Nordeck, Courtney D.; Riehm, Kira E.; Schmid, Ian, Tormohlen, Kayla N.; Smail, Emily J.; Johnson, Renee M.; Kalb, Luther G.; Stuart, Elizabeth A.; Thrul, Johannes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103517","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy;: 103517, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy;: 103517, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19931,""
"Australian and Danish nursesâ€™ and midwivesâ€™ wellbeing during COVID-19: a comparison study","Background Most investigations of nursesâ€™ and midwivesâ€™ psychological wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic have been conducted in a single setting. Aim To assess and compare the psychological wellbeing of nurses and midwives in Australia and Denmark during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Nurses and midwives employed at four metropolitan health services in Australia and one in Denmark completed an anonymous online survey, which assessed depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21)), and sociodemographic and employment factors. Findings Completed surveys were received from 3001 nurses and midwives (1611 Australian and 1390 Danish). Overall, approximately one in seven of the nurses and midwives surveyed reported moderate to extremely severe levels of depression (n=399, 13.5%), anxiety (n=381, 12.9%) and stress (n=394, 13.4%). Australian nursesâ€™ and midwivesâ€™ scores on all DASS-21 subscales were significantly higher (representing higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress) than the scores for the Danish nurses and midwives. Fewer years of clinical experience, living in Australia and being employed on a part-time basis were significantly associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Discussion A considerable proportion of nurses and midwives experienced distress during the COVID-19 pandemic;however, the proportion and severity varied by country. Australian nurses and midwives experienced higher levels of distress than their Danish colleagues. Conclusion Nurses and midwives working in countries with relatively low numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths are also likely to experience psychological distress. Nurses and midwives would benefit from targeted country-specific support and wellbeing initiatives.","Holton, Sara, Wynter, Karen, Rothmann, Mette Juel, Skjoeth, Mette Maria, Considine, Julie, Street, Maryann, Hutchinson, Ana, Khaw, Damien, Hutchinson, Alison M.; Ockerby, Cherene, Crowe, Shane, Trueman, Melody, Sweeney, Susan, Bruce, Suellen, Rasmussen, Bodil","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colegn.2021.10.010","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Collegian;2021.; Publication details: Collegian;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19932,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Australian hospital-based nursing and midwifery educators","Background : The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted health services and their staff, including nursing and midwifery educators. Nursing and midwifery educators were tasked with meeting nursesâ€™ and midwivesâ€™ rapidly-changing educational requirements, and supporting the nursing and midwifery workforce through the pandemic. Thus, nursing and midwifery educators were pivotal to the pandemic response. Aim : To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing and midwifery educators across four large, multi-site Australian health services. Methods : Qualitative descriptive study. All nursing and midwifery educators from public health services in Melbourne, Victoria (n=3) and Adelaide, South Australia (n=1) were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview (July â€“ November 2020). Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed thematically. Findings : Forty-six nursing and midwifery educators participated in interviews. Across the health services, two similar themes and six sub-themes were identified. In the first theme, â€˜Occupational impacts of COVID-19â€™, participants described adjusting to providing education during the pandemic, managing increased workloads, concerns about not being able to carry out their usual education activities and the importance of support at work. The second theme, â€˜Psychological impacts of COVID-19â€™, included two sub-themes: the negative impact on participantsâ€™ own mental health and difficulties supporting the mental health of other staff members. Participants from all health services identified unexpected positive impacts;online education, virtual meetings and working at home were perceived as practices to be continued post-pandemic. Conclusions : Hospital-based nursing and midwifery educators demonstrated agility in adjusting to the fast-changing requirements of providing education during the pandemic. Educators would benefit from continued occupational and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and inclusion in discussions to inform hospitalsâ€™ preparedness for managing the education of nurses and midwives during future pandemics.","Wynter, Karen, Holton, Sara, Considine, Julie, Hutchinson, Alison, Munt, Rebecca, Williams, Ruth, Balson, Jessica, Dibella, Val, McDonald, Elisa, Trueman, Melody, Crowe, Shane, Schutte, Sandy, Rasmussen, Bodil","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colegn.2021.10.007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Collegian;2021.; Publication details: Collegian;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19933,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic â€“ A focus on Nurse Managersâ€™ mental health, coping behaviours and organisational commitment","Background : The emergence of COVID-19 has substantially impacted frontline health care workers, including nurse managers. To date, no studies have been conducted to examine the impact COVID-19 has had on Nurse Managersâ€™ mental health, coping strategies and organisational commitment. Aim : To investigate the mental health, coping behaviours and organisational commitment among Nurse Managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods : Cross-sectional study involving 59 Nursing Managers from one Local Health District in Sydney Australia during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected relating to demographics, anxiety, coping strategies and organisational commitment. Results : Overall, approximately three quarters of the Nurse Managers had high anxiety scores. Managers who had worked longer as a nurse had higher scores for adaptive coping strategies and 41% of Nurse Managers considered leaving their job. Conclusions : Strategies to minimise anxiety and enable coping as part of organisational disaster, emergency or crisis planning for Nurse Managers may result in decreased anxiety and stress levels, increased use of adaptive coping strategies and lower intent to leave the organisation and the nursing profession.","Middleton, Dr Rebekkah, Loveday, Ms Clare, Hobbs, Ms Cassandra, Almasi, Ms Elham, Moxham, Lorna, Lord, Ms Heidi, Fernandez, Ritin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colegn.2021.10.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Collegian;2021.; Publication details: Collegian;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19934,""
"The impact of lofexidine on stress-related opioid craving and relapse: Design and methodology of a randomized clinical trial","Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) and drug overdose deaths are increasing at alarmingly high rates in the United States. Stress and dysregulation in biologic stress response systems such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and noradrenergic system appear to play an important role in the pathophysiology of substance use disorders and relapse to drug use, particularly for women. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist medications effectively decrease noradrenergic activity and have demonstrated benefit in preventing relapse to substance use and decreasing stress-reactivity and craving in cocaine- and nicotine-dependent women, compared to men. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may help decrease stress reactivity in individuals with OUDs and prevent relapse to drug use, but gender differences have yet to be systematically explored. We describe the rationale, study design and methodology of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining gender differences in stress, craving and drug use among adult men and women with OUD taking methadone or buprenorphine and randomly assigned to an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, lofexidine, compared to placebo. In addition, we describe methods for measuring daily stress, craving and drug use in participant's natural environment as well as participant's physiological (i.e., heart rate, cortisol) and psychological (i.e., stress, craving) response to laboratory social and drug cue stressors. Lastly, we detail methods adopted to sustain research activity while following guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Pfizer-BNT162b2 mRNA-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for awakening the latency of herpes varicella-zoster virus","Background To prevent the invasion and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, mRNA-based vaccines, non-replicating viral vector vaccines, and inactivated vaccines have been developed. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorized the use of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in January 2021, the date on which the vaccination program began in Spain and across Europe. The aim of this study is to monitor the safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and report any cases of undesirable effects that have occurred, that are not included in the health profile of mRNA-based vaccines for commercialisation in humans. Furthermore, a brief review is given of the mechanism of action of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on the host's immune system in triggering the reactivation of the herpes varicella-zoster infection. Methods Follow-up of patients under the care of the southern health district of Seville of the SAS (Andalusian Health Service) during the Spanish state of alarm over the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Two patients, a 79-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman, are reported who, after 4 and 16 days respectively of receiving the Pfizer-BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, presented a state of reactivation of herpes varicella-zoster virus (VZV).

"Association of Poor Mental Health Days With COVID-19 Infection Rates in the US","Introduction Limited evidence exists about the association between prior prevalence of poor mental health at the area level and subsequent rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. This association was tested using area-level nationwide population data in the U.S. Methods A nationwide study including 2,839 U.S. counties was conducted. Poor mental health was the age-adjusted average number of days within the past 30 days that adults reported poor mental health, including depression, stress, and problems with emotions, from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. COVID-19 infection rates were cumulative confirmed cases between January 22 and October 7, 2020 per 100,000 people in the general population. Bayesian spatial mixed-effects regression estimated the relationship between COVID-19 infection and poor mental health days at the county level in 2019 and change in poor mental health between 2010 and 2019, adjusted for several covariates. Results Poor mental health days in 2019 were positively associated with higher COVID-19 infection rates (relative risk ratio=1.059, 95% credible interval=1.003, 1.117). Change in mental health was not significantly associated with COVID-19. Conclusions Prior rates of poor mental health in a county were associated with a higher burden of COVID-19 infection. Interventions that improve well-being and strengthen mental health systems at the community and other geographic levels are needed to address post-COVID mental health problems.","Ransome, Yusuf, Luan, Hui, Song, Insang, Fiellin, David A.; Galea, Sandro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.08.032","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: American Journal of Preventive Medicine;2021.; Publication details: American Journal of Preventive Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19938,""
"American Indian/Alaska Native Child Health and Poverty","One in three American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children live in poverty. This rate is higher in some reservation communities. The alarming rates of physical, mental, and social health inequities (eg, poverty) experienced by AI/AN children are symptoms of genocide, a legacy of inhumane Federal Indian policy, and ongoing structural violence. The chronically underfunded Indian Health Service (IHS) is just one example where AI/AN children are not universally guaranteed equitable health care or opportunity to thrive. Poverty is highly predictive of educational achievement, employment opportunities, violence, and ultimately health outcomes. COVID-19 has not only exacerbated physical and mental health inequities experienced by AI/AN communities, but has also intensified the economic consequences of inequity. Thus, it is vital to advocate for programs and policies that are evidence based, incorporate cultural ways of knowing, and dismantle structurally racist policies.","Empey, A.; Garcia, A.; Bell, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2021.07.026","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Academic Pediatrics; 21(8):S134-S139, 2021.; Publication details: Academic Pediatrics; 21(8):S134-S139, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19939,""
"Pharmacists and Opioid Use Disorder Care During COVID-19: Call for Action","Abstract Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by problematic opioid use causing significant impairment in daily life. Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) using buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone with behavioral therapy reduces illicit opioid use and risk of overdose death. Despite evidence and decades of experience, barriers limit access to treatment and care for individuals with OUD. Barriers include a lack of treatment centers particularly in rural areas, regulations on buprenorphine prescribing, and stigma from the community and health care professionals. While many barriers are longstanding, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-forced isolation and associated stress has exacerbated challenges for individuals with mental health conditions such as OUD. Pharmacists are well-positioned to bridge existing gaps in OUD care, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roles for pharmacists include OUD risk identification and screening, referral of patients to treatment and support programs, ensuring medication access, expanding naloxone access, and advocacy initiatives. This review article identifies barriers to care for patients with OUD during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores opportunities and resources for pharmacists to improve OUD care during the pandemic and beyond.

"A qualitative investigation of the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on emergency physiciansâ€™ emotional experiences and coping strategies","Abstract Study objective Throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, emergency physicians in the United States have faced unprecedented challenges, risks, and uncertainty while caring for patients in an already vulnerable healthcare system. As such, the pandemic has exacerbated high levels of negative emotions and burnout among emergency physicians, but little systematic qualitative work has documented these phenomena. The purpose of this qualitative investigation was to study emergency physicians? emotional experiences in response to COVID-19 and the coping strategies that they employed to navigate the pandemic. Methods From September 2020 to February 2021, we conducted semistructured interviews with 26 emergency physicians recruited from 2 early COVID-19 epicenters: New York City and the Metro Boston region. Interviews, coding, and analyses were conducted using a grounded theory approach. Results Emergency physicians reported heightened anxiety, empathy, sadness, frustration, and anger during the pandemic. Physicians frequently attributed feelings of anxiety to medical uncertainty around the COVID-19 virus, personal risk of contracting the virus and transmitting it to family members, the emergency environment, and resource availability. Emergency physicians also discussed the emotional effects of policies prohibiting patients? family members from entering the emergency department (ED), both on themselves and patients. Sources of physician anger and frustration included changing policies and rules, hospital leadership and administration, and pay cuts. Some physicians described an evolving, ongoing coping process in response to the pandemic, and most identified collective discussion and processing within the emergency medicine community as an effective coping strategy. Conclusions Our findings underscore the need to investigate the effects of physicians? pandemic-related emotional stress and burnout on patient care. Evidence-based interventions to support emergency physicians in coping with pandemic-related trauma are needed.","Welsh, Margaux, Chimowitz, Hannah, Nanavati, Janvi D.; Huff, Nathan R.; Isbell, Linda M.","https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12578","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians Open; 2(5):e12578, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians Open; 2(5):e12578, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19941,""
"Psychological helpline in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Dominican Republic","Abstract The global health emergency due to COVID-19 is a disruptive event that has had various effects on mental health. Given this emergency, the Dominican Republic intervened to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic, considering the physical isolation decreed in the country. In this context, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo and the School of Psychology designed the UASD COVID-19 Psychological Helpline. The objective of this article is to describe the development, implementation and evaluation of a programme of psychological first aid. The programme aimed to attenuate the impact of morbidity and mortality due to mental health issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic through mobile technology. There were 62 psychologists involved and trained to provide care, and a protocol was developed, implemented, monitored and evaluated. Over the course of fourÂ months, the programme assisted 497 people. The average age of the participants was 32Â years, and 73% were women. The reasons for contacting the helpline included anxiety, stress, depression, domestic violence, suicidal behaviours and other behavioural problems. Following the intervention, most users reported feeling satisfied and having improved emotions. The first psychological aid in the country developed through telephone and chat messaging was an optimal resource since face-to-face interaction was not possible. It also reached more people and reduced the attention gap.","Sosa Lovera, Angelina, UreÃ±a, Ana Jacqueline, Arias, Josefina, Araujo RodrÃ­guez, Amarilis, Canario GuzmÃ¡n, Julio Arturo","https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12482","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Counselling and Psychotherapy Research; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Counselling and Psychotherapy Research; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19942,""
"An EQ-5D-5L value set for Italy using videoconferencing interviews and feasibility of a new mode of administration","Objectives To test the feasibility of using videoconferencing (VC) administered interviews and to derive an EQ-5D-5L value set for Italy. Methods Preferences were collected using the EuroQol standardized valuation protocol (EQ-VT) administered via VC. Two valuation methods were employed, composite time trade-off (cTTO) and discrete choice experiment (DCE). Technical, organizational and protocol feasibility were tested in a pilot of 198 interviews. Upon positive assessment, data collection continued with a target sample of 1000â€“1200 participants including the pilot. Quality control (QC) procedures were employed to monitor interviewersâ€™ performance during the pilot and the data collection. Data were modelled using GLS, Tobit, Logit and Hybrid models with different error specifications. Monotonicity of coefficients, statistical significance, and theoretical considerations informed the model choice. Results Dropouts and technical problems occurred in less than 5% of the 198 pilot interviews. Protocol compliance was demonstrated with significant improvements in QC parameters and limited interviewersâ€™ effects, for all interviewers. Overall, interviewers were satisfied with this mode of administration, highlighting it allows flexibility and efficient scheduling. Based on these results, VC was deemed as a feasible mode of administration. The study collected preferences for 1182 responders, including the pilot interviews. The demographic characteristics of the sample were representative of the Italian general population for age, gender and geographical macro-areas. The hybrid Tobit heteroscedastic model without constant estimated on the full sample (including pilot) was selected for the derivation of the value set. Values ranged from -0.571 for the worst health state (55555) to 1 for the best health state (11111).

"THE PSYCHO-EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 INFECTION ON MEDICAL STAFF IN THE FIRST-LINE MEDICAL INSTITUTION IN MOLDOVA","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected the lives of people around the world, especially after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic in the second week of March 2020. The research and the clinical observations in this field show that, during the pandemic, many people display stress, anxiety or depression, which are fuelled by fear and the pathological worry of infection, of coming into contact with possibly contaminated objects or surfaces. It exacerbates the fear of strangers who might have an infection, the fear of socioeconomic consequences and the symptoms of the traumatic stress associated to the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical population proved to be susceptible to burnout syndrome - physical and emotional exhaustion, poor performance, indecision, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression, all due to the increased work requirements, prolonged work, frustration in case of failure to save the patients' lives, pandemic-related uncertainty, fear of getting sick and infecting the family members. The frontline workers may face additional stressors during the COVID-19 outbreak: stigmatization of those working with COVID-19 patients;strict bio-security measures;physical pressure by the protective equipment;physical isolation which makes it difficult to ensure the comfort of a sick or suffering person;constant awareness and vigilance;strict procedures to be followed in order to prevent spontaneity and autonomy.","Chihai, J.","https://doi.org/10.35630/2199-885x/2021/11/4.4","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Archiv Euromedica; 11(4):17-19, 2021.; Publication details: Archiv Euromedica; 11(4):17-19, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19948,""
"Anxiety to COVID-19 pandemic amongst university students is related with gastrointestinal symptoms","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread throughout the world, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that affects the respiratory system. The emergence and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused confusion, anxiety and fear among the community, including university students. Anxiety to the COVID-19 pandemic causes various psychological manifestations, including fear of disease transmission, loss of loved ones, and decline in future socio-economic aspects. Anxiety can also lead to physical responses like gastrointestinal symptoms. This study aimed to determine the relationship between anxiety to COVID-19 pandemic and gastrointestinal symptoms complained by university students. Methods: This observational analytic study using cross-sectional approaches involved 311 university students of Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Anxiety to COVID-19 pandemic was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale questionnaire, while gastrointestinal symptoms were measured using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. Result: Of the 311 respondents, 157 (50.5%) of them felt anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic, with 28 (9%) and 13 (4.2%) students experienced severe and very severe anxiety, respectively. Besides, 264 (84.9%) university students complained of gastrointestinal symptoms, both upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts. There was a significant relationship between the level of anxiety to COVID-19 pandemic and gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusion: In conclusion, anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic can cause gastrointestinal symptoms amongst university students. Therefore psychological assistance is needed to reduce psychological and physical disorders during the pandemic.","Abubakar, A.; Ma'ruf, M.

"Comparison of the Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Saudi Nationals Arriving from Abroad During Institutional Quarantine and a Year Later: An Analytical Cross-Sectional and Follow-Up Study","Aim: To assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic and estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress on individuals during institutional quarantined in 2020 and reassess a year later to compare outcomes and investigates different associated factors. Study Design: An analytical cross-sectional and a follow-up study Place and Duration of Study: An institutional COVID-19 quarantine center, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between May 2020 and July 2021 Methodology: A sample of 138 participants were recruited. After obtaining the participants demographics date and consent, an electronic questionnaire was distributed to assess participants psychological well-being using the 42-item depression, anxiety, and stress scales (DASS) twice, at the end of quarantine period and one year later, to compare outcomes and associated factors. Results: Out of all the sample (n=138), male represented 64.5% while female accounted for 35.5%. Half the participants (50.7%) were married comparing to 40.6% single and bachelor's or higher degrees holders accounted for 61.6% while 26.8% had high school degree. The psychological health was assessed for all participants twice, resulting with prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress during quarantine period of 34%, 33%, and 22% respectively and a decreased prevalence a year late (20%, 13%, and 9, respectively). The differences between the two psychological assessments were significant (depression: P = .02, anxiety: P&lt;.001, stress: P=.005). Educational level was associated with stress at time of quarantine (P=.03). Marital status and employment status were significantly associated with participants depression levels a year after quarantine (P=.03, P=.04, respectively). Conclusion and Recommendations: The psychological well-being of quarantined participants was negatively impacted during this unlikable experience. Numerous demographic factors were significantly associated with the undesirable effects. We propose implementing a psychological assessment program in future quarantine centers to prevent further mental health impacts.","Alaujan, F.

"USER PROFILE IN AN UNIVERSITY CLINIC DURING THE COVID- 19 HEALTH ALARM","This study aims to analyze the profile of users in an university clinic (SPA-UNED) during the first COVID-19 19 health alarm. The sample was composed of 124 participants (70.4 % women) with an average age of 41.49 years and four instruments were used: Symptom Assessment-45 Questionnaire (SA-45), Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE-28) and the Scale Connor-Davidson Resilience (CD-RISC). The results showed a sociodemographic profile formed mainly by single Spanish women from the service sector. Consistent with the reasons for consultation, participants predominantly showed symptoms of depression, anxiety, and somatization, poor use of coping strategies, and low levels of resilience. These variables may be a possible risk profile in the clinical population that outlines a vulnerable group for which psychological prevention and intervention measures are required.","Sierra-Garcia, P.; Saul, L.

"EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DURING THE SPANISH NATIONAL LOCKDOWN: PROTECTIVE AND RISK/VULNERABILITY FACTORS","The objective of this work was to study the psychological impact of the pandemic COVID-19 and the national lock-down that took place in Spain during March and April 2020. We examined the prevalence of emotional distress, as well as protective and risk/vulnerability factors. A sample of 1,561 participants (aged 19 to 84 years) completed online the Coronavirus Psychological Impact Questionnaire (CIPC), the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Results show that many participants experienced high levels of emotional distress reflected through a 10-symptom distress profile in which worry, stress, hopelessness, sadness/depression and sleep problems predominated. We found some protective (age, income level, home garden, working outside the home), risk (media exposure, living with chronically ill and/or dependent persons, health worker) and vulnerability (sex, negative affect, intolerance of uncertainty) factors that significantly predicted the levels of distress. Negative affect and intolerance of uncertainty demonstrated to be strong predictors of distress. In addition, empirical evidence is provided on the validation of the Distress Emotional Scale of the CIPC.","Sandin, B.; Chorot, P.; Garcia-Escalera, J.; Valiente, R.

"LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON PERCEPTION OF LONELINESS DURING CONFINEMENT DERIVED FROM COVID-19 IN A SPANISH POPULATION SAMPLE","The aim of the study is to longitudinally analyse the effects of confinement derived from COVID-19 on the loneliness of the general Spanish population. It was assessed by an online survey at three points in time: two weeks after the start of confinement (N = 3480), one month after (N = 1041) and two months after the return to normal (N = 569). Measures were taken of sociodemographic variables, loneliness, social support, depressive and anxious symptoms. To analyse the effect of the longitudinal measures, a mixed linear model (GLMM) was calculated for the solitude variable. Posthoc comparisons for the time variable were calculated using the marginal means estimated with Tuckey's correction. The analyses have been carried out using the R software (v3.5.6) and the lme4 and emmeans packages. The trend in loneliness scores is downward throughout the longitudinal study, decreasing the scores in the third evaluation significantly (Z((T1-T2)) = 0.13, p =.045). The main predictors for loneliness are depressive symptomatology and social support. Greater attention needs to be paid to loneliness in these situations, in addition to presenting attention to associated depressive symptomatology and measures to strengthen social support networks in these circumstances.","Ausin, B.; Gonzalez-Sanguino, C.; Castellanos, M.

"Stay Home or Not? Modeling Individuals' Decisions During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, staying home proved to be an effective way to mitigate the spread of the virus. Stay-at-home orders and guidelines were issued by governments across the globe and were followed by a large portion of the population in the early stages of the outbreak when there was a lack of COVID-specific medical knowledge. The decision of whether to stay home came with many trade-offs, such as risking personal exposure to the virus when leaving home or facing financial and mental health burdens when remaining home. In this research, we study how individuals make strategic decisions to balance these conflicting outcomes. We present a model to study individuals' decision making based on decision and prospect theory, and we conduct sensitivity analysis to study the fluctuations in optimal strategies when there are changes made to the model's parameters. A Monte Carlo simulation is implemented to further study the performance of our model, and we compare our simulation results with real data that captures individuals' stay-at-home decisions. Overall, this research models and analyzes the behaviors of individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic and can help support decision making regarding control measures and policy development when public health emergencies appear in the future.","Wan, Q.

"Automatic Depression Prediction using Screen Lock/Unlock Data on the Smartphone","As COVID-19 continues for a long time, more and more people feel psychologically anxious beyond stuffy. However, as people have high resistance to mental health treatment, there are many cases in which the treatment period with depression is missed and the symptoms are getting worse. In this paper, we study a technology to diagnose users' depression by using a smartphone that has become an indispensable item carried by the mass of modern people in everyday life. Most of the existing studies diagnosed depression by using the questionnaire responses from smartphone users directly, but this study intends to replace the questionnaire responses from only the mobile phone sensing data without the user's annoyingness. In particular in this paper, it shows that we can predict the user's sleep time using only lock/unlock data and detect changes in sleep patterns to predict the likelihood of depression in smartphone users.","Kim, J.; Hong, J.; Choi, Y.; Ieee","https://doi.org/10.1109/ur52253.2021.9494673","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: 18th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots (UR);: 511-514, 2021.; Publication details: 18th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots (UR);: 511-514, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19957,""
"Supporting Persons Who Use Drugs During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Review of International Guidelines","Background: Persons who use drugs (PWUD) are facing an epidemic during the global COVID-19 pandemic. In recent months, many medical institutions have released guidance documents to inform the management of PWUD as it pertains to COVID-19. Given the flurry of increasing guidance documents, we sought to synthesize the recommendations and identify consensus strategies to support PWUD during the pandemic. Aim: To review existing COVID-19 guidelines for PWUD to synthesize evidence and identify consensus and disagreement areas. Methods: We rapidly reviewed the grey literature (documents produced by organizations, including reports, working papers, government documents, white papers, and clinical guidelines) and published peer-reviewed articles using the World Health Organization guidelines. We organized recommendations by the substance use disorder considered (eg, opioid, stimulant, and alcohol), recommendation type (eg, pharmacotherapy and psychosocial), nature (eg, harm-reduction and abstinence), and score the responsibility (eg, physicians and allied health practitioners). Results: We identified 85 representative articles spanning alcohol, opioid, tobacco, stimulant, and cannabis use disorders. Most reports involved opioid use disorder, generated by Canadian institutions, such as the British Columbia Centre for Substance Use, the Canadian Centre for Substance Use and Addiction, and the Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse. An overview of the problem typically prefaced guideline documents (eg, increasing numbers of opioid overdose deaths), followed by a structured approach to management (eg, addressing intoxication and withdrawal) using multiple forms of interventions (eg, harm-reduction, pharmacotherapy, and psychosocial services). Across guidelines, there was consensus regarding the importance of maintaining access to evidence-based treatment through various creative means, such as virtual platforms, take-home medications, and home delivery services. However, there was controversy regarding safe-supply, supervised consumption sites, and alcohol retailers' designation as ""essential services"" during the pandemic. Conclusions: With these challenges and insights in mind, the critical issue facing PWUD and their providers during the pandemic is maintaining access to evidence-based treatment and securing food, housing, and income. Along those lines, appropriate care should continue to be patient-centred, collaborative, and mindful of resources. Above all, we must continue to consider a biopsychosocial framework while providing evidence-based care. While these recommendations are helpful, we must apply our clinical judgment individually to weigh the risks and benefits to the patient and the public and destigmatize PWUD.","Bahji, A.; Danilewitz, M.; Crockford, D.","https://doi.org/10.1097/cxa.0000000000000110","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Canadian Journal of Addiction; 12(2):6-18, 2021.; Publication details: Canadian Journal of Addiction; 12(2):6-18, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19958,""
"Association of national COVID-19 cases with objectively and subjectively measured mental health proxies in the Austrian Football league - an epidemiological study","We aimed to explore the association of national COVID-19 data with the objective and subjective mental health proxies (i.e. location variance, self-reported sleep quality, level of recovery, perceived risk of infection) in team and staff members of five professional Austrian Football clubs. Data were conveniently collected during the implementation of a novel monitoring concept. The concept was designed to enable safe continuation of professional Football during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data were matched with Austrian COVID-19 data and smartphone collected location data. Multivariable linear regression models explored the association of COVID-19, defined as daily novel or active Austrian cases of COVID-19, with the mental health proxies. An increasing number of novel Austrian COVID-19 cases was significantly associated with deteriorating sleep quality (B 0.48, 95% CI 0.05;1.00). An increasing number of active Austrian COVID-19 cases was significantly associated with an increase in perceived infection risk (B 0.04, 95% CI 0.00;0.07) and location variance (B 0.28, 95% CI 0.06;0.49). An increasing Austrian COVID-19 incidence is adversely associated with mental health in professional Footballers and staff members. During the ongoing pandemic, targeted mental care should be included in the daily routines of this population.","van der Zee-Neuena, A.; Seymer, A.; Schaffler-Schaden, D.; Herfert, J.; Obrien, J.; Johansson, T.; Kutschar, P.; Ludwig, S.; Stoggl, T.; Keeley, D.; Flamm, M.; Osterbrink, J.","https://doi.org/10.1080/26895293.2021.1994473","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: All Life; 14(1):1011-1021, 2021.; Publication details: All Life; 14(1):1011-1021, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19959,""

"Use of hydroxychloroquine in outpatient COVID-19 patients: evaluation of interactions and cardiac risk","Purpose: Hydroxychloroquine was widely used at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic with little evidence and off-label use. The objective of our work was to identify in non-hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 interactions of hydroxy-chloroquine and other drugs with known risk of prolonging the QT interval, as well as risk factors associated with the onset of Torsade de Pointes. Methods: The studied population included patients at home and in nursing homes centers in two health areas. All medications prescribed were considered. The MedSafety Scan (R) tool was used to analyze interactions. A survey was conducted to all the doctors. Statistical analysis was performed with the IBM (R) SPSS (R) statistics version 20 program. Results: The average number of drugs with the capacity to prolong the QT interval in each patient including hydroxychloroquine was 2.8. We found interactions in 93.2% of the patients. Most were affected by, at least, 2 interactions although in institutionalized patients a high percentage had up to 4. The most repeated was hydroxycholoroquine-antibiotics interaction (in 85% of them) mainly due to use of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine-antiacids (38%) and hydroxychloroquine-antidepressants (23%). The survey shows that 15.3% of the patients had some adverse effect associated with hydroxychloroquine. Conclusions: Non-hospitalized patients were exposed to a high percentage of interactions between hydroxychloroquine and other drugs with the ability to prolong the QT interval. Faced with a possible efficacy not clearly demonstrated for hydroxychloroquine, patients were exposed to a possible unnecessary risk.","Ortega, M. A. M.; Aguero, L. F.; Martinez, M. T. B.; Arroyo, M.

"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL EXERCISE LEVELS AND ANXIETY OF COLLEGE STUDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background: Subjective anxiety is one of hot spots in the field of positive psychology. It can not only evaluate a person's quality of life, but also measure a person's mental health and psychological development level. Therefore, it has important theoretical significance to study the relationship between physical exercise and subjective anxiety. Subjects and methods: In order to examine the relationship between physical exercise and the subjective anxiety among college students, a questionnaire survey method was completed by 1,000 college students in Zhengzhou University. After psychological construction and empirical exploration, the psychological construction model of the subjective anxiety of college students is proposed, and the method of structural equation modeling is used to verify the model. Results: There is a significant correlation between the duration of exercise and the subjective anxiety among college students. Duration of exercise and body satisfaction have the highest correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.331, which has a significant negative correlation with negative emotions. Exercise intensity is significantly correlated with positive emotions and physical satisfaction. There is a significant positive correlation between exercise intensity and duration of exercise and the various levels of physical self-esteem, but the correlation with the coping style is not significant. The duration of exercise is significantly negatively correlated with conversational disturbances and social barrier. The exercise intensity is significantly negatively correlated with social barrier. The duration of exercise is significantly negatively correlated with neuroticism, and the amount of exercise is significantly positive with introverted personality. Related. The various levels of subjective anxiety among college students are significantly related to physical self-esteem, positive coping, interpersonal relationships and personality characteristics. Conclusions: The subjective anxiety among college students who participate in physical exercise is stronger than that of college students who do not exercise. This difference is manifested in the emotional component and special life satisfaction between the two. Short-term physical exercise has no effect on the subjective anxiety of college students. Light and moderate exercise intensity have a deeper impact on the subjective anxiety among college students with the increase of exercise duration. Physical exercise can not only directly affect subjective anxiety among college students, and but also affect college students' subjective anxiety through intermediary variables such as physical self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and personality characteristics.","Liu, Y.; Meng, T.; Li, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=THE+RELATIONSHIP+BETWEEN+PHYSICAL+EXERCISE+LEVELS+AND+ANXIETY+OF+COLLEGE+STUDENTS+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Psychiatria Danubina; 33:S390-S394, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatria Danubina; 33:S390-S394, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19964,""

"Gender Differences in Satisfaction With a Text Messaging Program (Text4Hope) and Anticipated Receptivity to Technology-Based Health Support During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: In March 2020, Text4Hope-a community health service-was provided to Alberta residents. This free service aims to promote psychological resilience and alleviate pandemic-associated stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feedback, satisfaction, experience, and perceptions of Text4Hope subscribers and to examine any differences based on gender after subscribers received 6 weeks of daily supportive text messages. Additionally, this study examined subscribers' anticipated receptivity to technology-based medical services that could be offered during major crises, emergencies, or pandemics. METHODS: Individuals self-subscribed to Text4Hope to receive daily supportive text messages for 3 months. Subscribers were invited to complete a web-based survey at 6 weeks postintervention to provide service satisfaction-related information. Overall satisfaction was assessed on a scale of 0-10, and satisfaction scores were analyzed using a related-measures t test. Likert scale satisfaction responses were used to assess various aspects of the Text4Hope program. Gender differences were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-square analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2032 subscribers completed the baseline and 6-week surveys; 1788 (88%) were female, 219 (10.8%) were male, and 25 (1.2%) were other gender. The mean age of study participants was 44.58 years (SD 13.45 years). The mean overall satisfaction score was 8.55 (SD 1.78), suggesting high overall satisfaction with Text4Hope. The ANOVA analysis, which was conducted using the Welch test (n=1716), demonstrated that females had significantly higher mean satisfaction scores than males (8.65 vs 8.11, respectively; mean difference=0.546; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.91; P<.001) and nonsignificantly lower satisfaction scores than other gender respondents (mean difference=-0.938; 95% CI -0.37 to 2.25; P=.15). More than 70% of subscribers agreed that Text4Hope helped them cope with stress (1334/1731, 77.1%) and anxiety (1309/1728, 75.8%), feel connected to a support system (1400/1729, 81%), manage COVID-19-related issues (1279/1728, 74%), and improve mental well-being (1308/1731, 75.6%). Similarly, subscribers agreed that messages were positive, affirmative, and succinct. Messages were always or often read by 97.9% (1681/1716) of respondents, and more than 20% (401/1716, 23.4%) always or often returned to messages. The majority of subscribers (1471/1666, 88.3%) read the messages and either reflected upon them or took a positive action. Subscribers welcomed almost all technology-based services as part of their health care during crisis or emergency situations. Text4Hope was perceived to be effective by many female subscribers, who reported higher satisfaction and improved coping after receiving text messages for 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents affirmed the high quality of the text messages with their positive feedback. Technology-based services can provide remotely accessible and population-level interventions that align with the recommended physical distancing practices for pandemics. Text4Hope subscriber feedback revealed high satisfaction and acceptance at 6 weeks postintervention.

"Mental health and online learning among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a Saudi national study","Purpose: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has multiple consequences, including social distancing and the shift of education from in-person to online learning, which may have a psychological impact on students, especially those in medical colleges. This study aims to explore the effect of online learning on medical studentsâ€™ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic across Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive, nationwide, cross-sectional survey was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, after students in medical colleges moved to online learning. It included socio-demographic characteristics, online learning-related questions, perceived stress scale and generalized anxiety disorder-7. Findings: The participants represented various academic levels within the basic science phase (44.9%) and clinical phase (55.1%) and various regions, including the central (55.3%), western (18.8%), northern (13.4%), southern (8.8%) and eastern (3.7%) regions. Moderate to high perceived stress was reported by 94.4% of students. Two-thirds of the students reported generalized anxiety symptoms, ranging from moderate to severe in 47% of them. A significant positive correlation was found between stress and anxiety. Women, age &gt; 25, first-year students, students facing oral and objective structured clinical examinations, students with excellent and pass grades and those facing difficulties had higher levels of stress and anxiety. In addition, being non-Saudi, married or having a history of psychiatric illness was associated with higher levels of anxiety.

"Empirical examination of societal, financial and technology-related challenges amid COVID-19 in service supply chains: evidence from emerging market","Purpose: This paper reports an empirical examination of the societal, financial and technology-related challenges amid the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19) in the service supply chain network. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of qualitative approach (for items generation pertinent to the constructs involved) and quantitative approach (self-administered questionnaires from the top and middle management of the sampled companies) was used for data collection. In total, 272 complete responses were received and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Findings: The results provided empirical evidence that social and physical distancing, travel restrictions, work from home and lockdown practices have two conflicting effects: On one hand, these practices have contributed to the reduction of economic activities, including the low economic outlook, low productivity, high unemployment, poverty, fall in customer demands, dissatisfaction and mental health, that ultimately impacts rise financial and societal issues. On the other hand, the results revealed an insignificant influence of COVID-19 on creating technology-related challenges in the service sector. It shows that the organizations are doing well in combating the technology-related challenges amidst the current pandemic. Research limitations/implications: Findings of the inquiry recommend implications for the services industry to harmonize a comprehensive strategy and revisit the global norms in sustainable supply chain management activities that have been the backdrop in their operations for a long time. Practical implications: Findings of the inquiry recommend implications for the services industry to harmonize a comprehensive strategy and revisit the global norms in supply chain management activities that have been the backdrop in their operations for a long time. Originality/value: Prior studies in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and its implications have given more attention to the exploratory and theoretical discussion than to empirical evidence. This paper contributes to filling this knowledge gap by empirically exploring the societal, financial and technology-related challenges created by COVID-19. The analysis in this paper covers three dimensions of the PEST model, namely economic, societal and technological factors. This study also helps in laying out a platform for investigating the PEST (political, economic, social and technological) model for guiding the services industry in strategic decision-making in a new era due to COVID-19.

"The impact of covid-19 on clinic volume in a new jersey covid-hotspot at an academic urology practice","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has been a disruptive pandemic that has transformed the landscape of the health care system. The pandemic disproportionately affects patients from a racial diverse and economic depressed demographic, highly represented in Newark (Essex County, NJ). We seek to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the flow of patients to an inner-city health care system, specifically a major academic urology clinic in Newark, NJ. METHODS: We collected de-identified data for clinic volume and appointment no-show rates from the electronic medical record from September 16, 2019 to January 26, 2021. Publicly available data on COVID cases and death rates in Essex county was collected from public data reporting on March 4, 2020 to January 31, 2021. Data analysis and statistical analysis was performed with Jupyter Notebooks and Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: The number of patients who were no-shows was significantly correlated with daily COVID cases (-0.49, p=0.004). The total number of clinic patients was also less when there were higher COVID cases (-0.41, p=0.02). We found that the rate of no-shows and the daily reported COVID cases was weakly correlated (-0.33, p=0.06). The number of daily deaths from COVID-19 was not statistically correlated with clinic flow. Overall, we found that during the COVID pandemic our no-show rate averaged 25.4Â±0.093% compared to 25.9Â±0.065% prior to March 4, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The total clinic volume and total number of no-show patients was significantly decreased on days with higher reported COVID-19 cases in Essex county. Reported COVID-19 deaths did not correlate with clinic flow. Future research is planned for looking at specific patient demographic data such as race/ ethnicity, language, socioeconomic status, and diagnosis. We will also evaluate whether the no show rate significantly delayed health care for these patients and affected their prognosis.","Jain, K.; Nguyen, A.; Williams, S.; Karajgikar, R.; Gandhi, A.; Weiss, R.

"Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the burnout rates of graduating Canadian urology residents","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Burnout is a work-related psychologic syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion decreased sense of personal accomplishment, and depersonalization.1 Burnout among surgeons is increasing with prevalence rates exceeding 50%.2COVID-19 has affected the medical system with evidence of increased stress and levels of depression in our medical trainees. This study aims to assess the influence COVID-19 is having on burnout rates in Canadian Urology trainees. METHODS: Thirty-seven chief residents among the Canadian Urology residency programs attended the Queen's Urology Exam Skills Test (QUEST) on December, 2019 pre-pandemic and thirty-nine chief residents attended virtually on November, 2020 during the pandemic. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) questionnaire was administered anonymously. The MBI covers emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment.4 Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: There was 100% response rate in the convenience sample (n=37) in 2019 and 64.1% response rate (n=25) in 2020. 70% of chief residents in Canadian Urology programs showed evidence of burnout in 2019 compared to 88% in 2020. There was a statistically significant difference between the two cohorts in emotional exhaustion (45.9% in 2019 and 68% in 2020, p=0.005) and depersonalization scores (62.2% in 2019 and 80% in 2020, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to examine the impact of the pandemic on burnout rates in urology trainees. Burnout rates are high in trainees at baseline, and the pandemic appears to have exacerbated this problem. Vigilance and proactive steps need to be implemented to alleviate this crisis.","Johnstone, J.; Gabara, A.; Touma, N.","https://doi.org/10.1097/JU.0000000000002005.17","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Urology; 206(SUPPL 3):e343-e344, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Urology; 206(SUPPL 3):e343-e344, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19971,""

"The effects of COVID-19 continuous traumatic stress on mental health: The case of Syrian refugees in Turkey","COVID-19 presents continuous cumulative multilayered traumatic stressors that have a significant mental health impact on refugees and especially Syrian refugees. A sample of 417 Syrian refugees in Turkey participated in an online survey that included measures for COVID-19 traumatic stress (COVID-19TS), cumulative stressors and traumas, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, generalized anxiety, and existential death and status anxieties. We conducted an independent samples t test between those hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection (N = 47) and the others. Further, we conducted path analysis supplemented by PROCESS macro to identify the mediators. The path model included cumulative stressors and traumas and COVID-19TS as independent variables, existential status and death anxieties as mediating variables, and PTSD, depression, and anxiety as outcome variables. We conducted multigroup invariance to test the path model equivalence across genders and tortured and nontortured groups. Results indicated that the participants are highly traumatized and include a relatively high number of torture survivors (N = 102). Being tortured was a decisive risk factor for being hospitalized for COVID-19, with over 75% of the hospitalized been torture survivors. The sample participants have high rates of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, especially among those hospitalized due to COVID-19 and those with a history of torture. COVID-19TS has the highest association with its economic trauma. COVID-19TS is directly associated with elevated PTSD, depression, and anxiety comorbid symptoms and indirectly via existential death and status anxieties as mediators. The path model was strictly invariant across genders and tortured and nontortured groups.

"Discrimination and psychosocial engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic","Emerging evidence suggests that the effects of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have disproportionately impacted minoritized populations, including rising rates of hate crimes directed at Asian Americans. Asian and White students (N = 1,261) at a large public university completed a survey of their experiences during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures included anxiety, depression, academic engagement, and experienced discrimination. Using structural equation modeling, we found that Asian participants reported experiencing higher discrimination during the first month of the pandemic (e.g., being treated as if you have a disease) compared to White participants. Experienced discrimination was associated with significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety and significantly lower levels of academic engagement. In addition to the physical and economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic, racism and discrimination may pose unique challenges for Asian Americans in particular.

"Economic and social consequences of COVID-19 and mental health burden among Latinx young adults during the 2020 pandemic","Latinx young adults 18-25 years old face unique challenges that disproportionately put them at high risk of experiencing health as well as economic and social burden due to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The present study examined how economic and psychosocial consequences as a result of the pandemic were associated with mental health issues among a community sample of Latinx young adults (N = 83) from Central Texas. Participants completed an online survey of COVID-related experiences and mental health needs. The survey asked about personal and family experiences of COVID-19 in two significant areas: (a) economic strain (e.g., economic hardship, food insecurity) and (b) psychosocial burden (e.g., losing relationships, substance use). Regression analyses examined the association of COVID-19 consequences on level of mental health symptoms and clinically significant outcomes. Relative to economic consequences, psychosocial consequences due to the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with higher levels of mental health symptoms. In contrast, in few cases, economic strain resultant from the pandemic was correlated with clinically significant outcomes among this sample. Collectively, findings suggest that the costs of the pandemic do not only pertain to mortality from illness but also to morbidity as it relates to deteriorating social circumstances and mental health. Findings from this study call for immediate attention to implement policies and programs to help mitigate the economic and social-emotional consequences of COVID-19 such as easy access to low-cost virtual mental health resources to Latinx young adults. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Spanish) Los adultos jovenes latinos de 18 a 25 anos enfrentan desafios unicos que los ponen de manera desproporcionada en un alto riesgo de sufrir consecuencias de salud, economicas y sociales debido a la pandemia del COVID-19. El estudio presente examino como las consecuencias economicas y psicosociales a raiz de la pandemia se asociaron con problemas de salud mental en una muestra comunitaria de adultos jovenes latinos (N = 83) del centro de Texas. Los participantes completaron una encuesta en linea sobre experiencias relacionadas con el COVID-19 y necesidades de salud mental. La encuesta incluyo preguntas sobre las experiencias personales y familiares del COVID-19 en dos areas importantes: (a) tension economica (por ejemplo, dificultades economicas, inseguridad alimentaria) y (b) carga psicosocial (por ejemplo, perdida de relaciones, consumo de sustancias). Los analisis de regresion examinaron la asociacion de las consecuencias del COVID-19 en el nivel de los sintomas de salud mental y los resultados clinicamente significativos. En comparacion a las consecuencias economicas, las consecuencias psicosociales debido a la pandemia de COVID-19 se asociaron con niveles mas altos de sintomas de salud mental. Por el contrario, en unos pocos casos, la tension economica resultante de la pandemia se correlaciono con resultados clinicamente significativos en esta muestra. En conjunto, los hallazgos sugieren que los costos de la pandemia no solo se refieren a la mortalidad por enfermedad, sino tambien a la al deterioro de las circunstancias sociales y la salud mental. Los hallazgos de este estudio exigen atencion inmediata para implementar politicas y programas que ayuden a mitigar las consecuencias economicas y socioemocionales del COVID-19, como el facil acceso a recursos virtuales de salud mental de bajo costo para adultos jovenes latinos.

"Mental Health and Social Connectedness across the Adult Lifespan in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had profound consequences on collective mental health and well-being, and yet, older adults appear better off than younger adults. The current study examined mental health impacts of the pandemic across adult age groups in a large sample (n = 5,320) of Canadians using multiple hierarchical regression analyses. Results suggest older adults are experiencing better mental health and more social connectedness relative to younger adults. Loneliness predicted negative mental health outcomes across all age groups, while the negative association between social support and mental health was only significant at average and high levels of loneliness in the 65-69 age group. Results point towards differential mental health impacts of the pandemic across adult age groups and indicate that loneliness and social support may be key intervention targets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should further examine mechanisms of resiliency among older Canadian adults during the pandemic. Â© Canadian Association on Gerontology 2021.","Gregory, M. A.; Legg, N.

"The effect of passion for activities on fear of COVID-19 and mental health among the Japanese population","As the ongoing pandemic limited the lives of the general population, people engaged in their favorite activities;either in alternative ways or while disregarding the restrictions. These activities and people's engagement in such activities are considered to have a significant impact on mental health. Thus, this study aimed to examine the relationship between two types of passion (harmonious passion and obsessive passion), fear of COVID-19, and mental distress. Thus, a total of 322 Japanese participants completed an online questionnaire. The results showed that harmonious passion (HP) was negatively related to mental distress. Conversely, obsessive passion (OP) was positively related to fear of COVID-19 and mental distress. The fear of COVID-19 had a positive relationship with mental distress. This study evidenced that HP is a protective factor against pandemics as it improves mental health during a pandemic. However, OP is a risk factor as it amplifies fear of COVID-19. Focusing on distinct types of passion may prove effective in improving mental health amidst the pandemic.","Kubo, Takahiro, Sugawara, Daichi, Masuyama, Akihiro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111358","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Personality and Individual Differences;: 111358, 2021.; Publication details: Personality and Individual Differences;: 111358, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19979,""

OBJECTIVE: To determine the psycho-affective impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of health professionals in Tunisia and to estimate the associated factors. METHODS: This is a multicenter, cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study of health professionals carried out from May 2, 2020 to June 30, 2020 in Tunisia. Healthcare professionals included doctors, nurses, dentists and pharmacists. The participants answered a pre-established questionnaire using an electronic ""Google Form"". This questionnaire gathered demographic data and medical history. It included two psychometric scales, the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) to assess the prevalence and intensity of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms respectively. RESULTS: The study included 203 healthcare professionals. The professionals had a mean age of 30.74 Â± 6.33 years, 69.5 % were women, and the majority were doctors (77.8 %). Among professionals, 9.4 % were nurses, 7.4 % were dentists, and 5.4 % were pharmacists. A third of the participants 34.3 % worked in departments with Covid-19 patients. Among all participants, 52.2 % said their mental health had been altered after the Covid-19 pandemic, and only 4.4 % of participants said their mental health had become severely unbearable. Among all workers, 37.5 % reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms on the GAD-7 scale, and 35.5 % (72) reported moderate to severe depression symptoms on the PHQ-9 scale. A positive and significant correlation was found between the two scores of the psychometric scales, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 (r = 0.70;p &lt;0.0001. Women expressed significantly more severe anxiety symptoms (p = 0.009). According to multivariate analyses, being female was a risk factor for developing moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Having a history of depressive disorder or anxiety disorder was a risk factor for developing moderate to severe depression symptoms. The profession of nurse was the factor the most associated with developing moderate to severe anxiety symptoms and moderate to severe depression symptoms. The medical profession, too, was a risk factor for the emergence of severe depression symptoms with tendencies to have moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. The profession of dentist was a risk factor for the development of severe depression symptoms. Working in Covid-19 departments was a risk factor for having moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: In order to ensure better patient care, early detection of psychiatric disorders and the implementation of specific strategies to ensure better mental health among healthcare professionals are priorities not only during the current pandemic but also in the event of a future similar pandemic.","Aoun, Mohamed Habib, Soussia, Rim Ben, Brahim, Syrine, Betbout, Imen, Bouali, Walid, Mohamed, Ahmed Hadj, Younes, Samira, Zarrouk, Lazhar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2021.08.012","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: L'EncÃ©phale;2021.; Publication details: L'EncÃ©phale;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19980,""
"Psychological Responses of Hospital-Based Nurses Working During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: A Cross-sectional Study","Studies show decreased well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for healthcare providers from Asia. Less is known about the psychological responses of working during the pandemic on hospital-based registered nurses (RNs) in the United States (US). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to report the well-being of U.S.-based hospital RNs working during the initial acute phase of COVID-19 and compare it with well-being among healthcare workers described in two global meta-analyses. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in May-June 2020 (N=467). Well-being was measured using the following tools: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-2 for depressive symptoms, Impact of Events Scale-Revised for traumatic stress, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Compared with global rates from two meta-analyses, US-based RNs reported significantly more traumatic stress (54.6% vs. 11.4% and 21.5%;p&lt;.001) and depressive symptoms (54.6% vs. 31.8% and 21.7%;p&lt;.001). Rates of insomnia were also higher in U.S.-based RNs than in the meta-analysis that reported insomnia (32.4% vs 27.8%;p&lt;.033). Rates of anxiety symptoms among US-based RNs did not differ from that reported in one meta-analysis (37.3% vs. 34.4%), while it was significantly higher in the other (37.3% vs. 22.1%;p&lt;.001). Hospital-based RNs from the US exhibited over twice the rates of trauma and nearly double the rates of depressive symptoms than shown in reports from hospital workers globally during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Antidepressant use in pregnancy","Depression affects twice as many women as men with the highest rates in the reproductive years. Depression is common during pregnancy, affecting up to 20% of pregnancies (Bennett et al., 2004, Obstetrics & Gynecology 103,Â 698â€“709) [M], and it is estimated that more than 500000 pregnancies in the United States each year involve women who have psychiatric illnesses that require the use of medication during pregnancy. The decision to medically manage depression in pregnant women comes with many layers of challenges regarding the decision to treat depression in pregnancy and weighing the risk of potential adverse effects and teratogenic risks of antidepressant use. With a varying and limited knowledge of risks to the fetus, health care providers need to weigh the clinical consequences to the use of antidepressants and the long term sequalae of untreated maternal depression in pregnancy and during breastfeeding in the postpartum period. Of note, the most commonly used antidepressants are the selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, which overall are considered to have a low risk of teratogenicity. Based on what is known about the risks, efficacy and safety of antidepressants and the stability of the mood disorder, we must continually balance the risk-benefit profile of starting or continuing antidepressants in pregnancy vs non-medical management. When considering the risks of antidepressant use in pregnancy, it is important to consider the risk of untreated depression to both the mother and fetus. Untreated depression has been linked to pre-term labor, low birth weight or fetal growth restriction, and pre-eclampsia (Orr and James, 2002, American Journal of Epidemiology 156(9), 797â€“802 [M];Dayan, 2002, American Journal of EpidemiologyÂ 155(4),Â 293â€“301 [M];Bennett et al., 2004, Clinical Drug InvestigationÂ 24,Â 157â€“179 [M]). Expectantly, patients are at an increased risk of exacerbation of depressive symptoms and poor compliance with prenatal care and nutrition. Untreated depression may result in suicidal ideations, postpartum depression, and high-risk health behaviours (i.e., substance abuse) leading to limited bonding and self-care deficits (Andersson et al., 2004, Obstetrics & GynecologyÂ 104(3),Â 467â€“476 [C];Zuckerman et al., 1989, American Journal of Obstetrics and GynecologyÂ 160(5 Pt. 1),Â 1107â€“1111 [M];Bennett et al., 2004, Clinical Drug InvestigationÂ 24,Â 157â€“179 [M]). These outcomes can be detrimental to fetal and child development. Babies born to untreated depressed mothers tend to cry more and have an increased lifetime risk of mental health disorders, including higher rates of cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and maladaptive social disorders due to unhealthy maternal behaviors (Bennett et al., 2004, Clinical Drug InvestigationÂ 24,Â 157â€“179 [M];Bonari et al., 2004, Canadian Journal of PsychiatryÂ 49(11),Â 726â€“735 [M]). Furthermore, studies have found that depressed mothers underutilize pediatric care following birth (Kogan et al., 1998, PediatricsÂ 102(1),Â 25â€“30) [M]. Therefore, it is important to consider not just the antidepressant side effects, of which there are few, but the many consequences of untreated pre- and postpartum depression. Antidepressants are known to cross the placenta, can be found in amniotic fluid and can enter breast milk, albeit in low levels. Therefore, prenatal exposure from the treatment of depression in pregnancy must take into consideration the teratogenic effects on growth and development of the baby, birth defects, pregnancy complications, perinatal morbidity and mortality, and long-term sequalae. Medication exposure during lactation has been found to be lower than transplacental exposure to SSRIs during pregnancy. Exposure to SSRIs may lead to neonatal complications mimicking withdrawal. Breastfeeding advocates recommend breastfeeding;however, it should be stopped if the nursing infant exhibits any abnormal symptoms such as irritability, poor feeding and sleep or respiratory distress.","Zeszutek, Stephanie","https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.seda.2021.09.009","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Side Effects of Drugs Annual;2021.; Publication details: Side Effects of Drugs Annual;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19982,""
"Does Coronavirus Disease Affect Sleep Disorders in the Third Trimester of Pregnancy in Women With Low Back Pain?","Objectives: Many factors such as stress and psychological tension affect the mental and physical health of pregnant women in the third trimester during the coronavirus pandemic. These factors can cause severe complications such as sleep disorders and low back pain. Therefore, this study focused on investigating sleep disorders in women by diagnosing low back pain in pregnant women with coronavirus and the affecting factors. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was performed during the four months ending July 5, 2020 with the participation of 40 pregnant women (with coronavirus disease detected in the last trimester of pregnancy) with a diagnosis of low back pain in Tabriz (Iran) using a random sampling technique. Demographic data, anxiety and depression, Petersburg's sleep quality, factors affecting sleep quality, and the severity of back pain (visual analog scale) were electronically collected and analyzed using SPSS 20 by ANOVA and multivariate regression. Results: All participants were at a weak level. The majority of participants had a score of ""serious sleep problem"", and nausea and vomiting (P = 0.041), low back pain (P = 0.003), frequent urination (P = 0.011), leg cramps (P = 0.031), and constipation (P = 0.018) caused severe sleep disturbance in pregnant women during coronavirus pandemic. Conclusions: In general, having coronavirus disease causes severe pain in pregnant women, leading to severe back pain in pregnancy, eventually worsening sleep disorders.","Dargahi, R.; Nazari, B.; Dorosti, A.; Charsouei, S.","https://doi.org/10.15296/ijwhr.2021.49","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: International Journal of Womens Health and Reproduction Sciences; 9(4):268-273, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Womens Health and Reproduction Sciences; 9(4):268-273, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",19983,""
"On the consequences of the corona crisis for occupational insecurity, political powerlessness and beliefs in a conspiracy","This study explores whether the corona crisis had an impact on the perception of job insecurity, operationalised as occupational insecurity. At the same time, we examine the association between occupational insecurity and two societal attitudes: political powerlessness and beliefs in a corona conspiracy. Finally, the literature on conspiracies suggests that the association between occupational insecurity and beliefs in a conspiracy are an attempt to give meaning to a crisis situation, like the corona pandemic. This hypothesis is tested by analysing whether political powerlessness mediates the association between occupational insecurity and the belief in a corona conspiracy. Data were gathered in December 2020 via an online survey among 1324 respondents in Flanders (Belgium). All hypotheses were corroborated by the analyses. The results suggest that the corona crisis did not only affect our health and health care system, but also might have â€˜infectedâ€™ work related and societal and political attitudes.

"Stress and coping: On being well in yourself","This chapter was first published in The Psychology of Wellbeing and cross referencing relates to chapters in the original volume. Please visit www. routledge.com/9780367898083 for more information about the book. A grafto on a wall in Hong Kong during the coronavirus pandemic read, 'We can't return to normal because the normal we had was precisely the problem'. Burnout due to overwork is a universal problem. But legislation, when it exists, more often applies to physical hazards, rather than psychological ones. In 2019, a survey on work-related stress, published by the Health and Safety Executive, found there were 602,000 workers in the UK suffering from anxiety and depression. This led to 12.8 million working days lost, and the main causes cited-which are consistent over time-were workload, lack of support, and coping with change. In the US, stress related to discrimination and poverty costs the US economy around $300 billion every year, in accidents, absenteeism, employee turnover, reduced productivity, and medical, legal, and insurance costs. When the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health is 'complete physical, mental and social wellbeing', any deviation from perfection could be 'abnormal', and so needs to be fixed. But are any of us, ever, completely 'well in ourselves'? Whatever the 'new normal' will look like, we can start by examining the old one. And part of that is asking, is stress always a bad thing? In this chapter, we consider the question 'what is normal?' We explore the tension between survival and growth and consider differ models of defining and coping with stress.

"Evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on mental health of the public in Jordan: A cross-sectional study","Context: Although the COVID-19 pandemic was expected to have a significant impact on the mental health of the Jordanian population, there have been few studies to investigate the nature and magnitude of the impact. Aims: To assess the potential psychiatric disorders induced by the current pandemic and evaluate the relevant risk factors. Methods: A cross-sectional national survey-based study was conducted over 3 months (August to October, 2020) in 12 governorates in Jordan using random proportionate sampling;the questionnaire being answered in face-to-face interviews with a randomly selected sample of the adult population aged 18 years and older, to collect data from 1820 individuals. The modified Kessler scale was validated by a multidisciplinary committee. SPSS V26 was used for data analysis. Results: Findings indicated that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 11.4% (207/1820) of participants had severe mental disorders, 25.4% (462/1820) moderate mental disorders, while 34.7% (632/1820) were without any mental issues. Predictors for severe mental disorder were: monthly income (&lt;500 JOD) {OR: 3.6, 95%CI: 3.12-7.68, p = 0.01}, Employment status (unemployed) {OR: 2.4, 95%CI: 1.45-4.96, p = 0.001}, and those diagnosed with diabetes {OR: 1.9, 95%CI: 1.13-3.63, p = 0.03}. Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic had a notable impact on the mental health of people living in Jordan. People who had low monthly income (&lt;500 JOD) or were unemployed were mostly affected as well as diabetes patients. These cases were recognized as significant risk factors for moderate and severe mental disorders. Appropriate psychiatric and economic interventions were recommended to improve the mental preparedness for pandemics among the population in Jordan.","Suleiman, Y. A.; Abdel-Qader, D.

"Perceived stress among ambulatory patients with depression and anxiety during covid-19 pandemic","The objective of the study is to evaluate the indirect influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the manifestation of anxiety and depression, and the burden of perceived stress among out-patients. Methods: The study is pilot, cross-sectional, non-interventional, and includes out-patients with depressive and anxiety disorder and controls, recruited from July 2020 to October 2020. Self-assessment scales are used for the evaluation of anxiety and depression (HADS), perceived stress (PSS-10) and loneliness (UCLA-LS3). The severity of the illness is assessed by the scale for clinical global impression (CGI-S). Results: The study includes 110 individuals, forming the following groups: exacerbated anxiety disorder (n = 23), anxiety disorder in remission (n = 17), exacerbated depressive disorder (n = 18), depressive disorder in remission (n = 24), and healthy controls (n = 28). The patients with exacerbated depression have the highest results on scales HADS-<U+0410> ( X = 12.39 Â± 4.16);HADS-D ( X = 10.39 Â± 4.07);PSS-10 ( X = 24,72 Â± 3,68);UCLA-LS3 ( X = 5.78 Â± 1.86), which differs them significantly (<U+0440> &lt; 0,05) from the control group, from the groups in remission, and from the patients with exacerbated anxiety according to HADS-D ( X = 6,00 Â± 4,54). The perceived stress in the control group, assessed by PSS-10 ( X = 16,43 Â± 4,07), differs significantly only from the group of patients with exacerbated depression (<U+0440> &lt; 0,05). In terms of this scale, the rest of the groups do not differ significantly from the controls. The loneliness, assessed by UCLA-LS3, is significantly more pronounced (<U+0440> &lt; 0,05) in the groups of exacerbated anxiety and depression compared with patients in remission and the control group, which do not differ significantly from each other. Conclusions: The exacerbation of anxiety and depressive disorders during the time of COVID-19 pandemic depends on complex factors, but the stability of the remission is an important protective concerning perceived stress and loneliness in these patients. Patients with exacerbated depression demonstrate the highest level of stress. Â© 2021, Bulgarian Psychiatric Association (BPA).

"Meeting the unmet mental health needs during COVID-19: Where does telemedicine stands during these times in India?","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a major public health concern worldwide. Starting from Wuhan in China, this disease has spread to nearly each and every corner of this planet that led WHO to officially declare it as a pandemic on 11th March 2020. This pandemic has posed threat at multiple levels viz medical, social, political, economic, religious, cultural and civilizational which also narrowed down to our household, work, our way of living and has unearthed a never-ending question of existentiality. Issues like infection fears, maladaptive cognitive schemas with faulty attributions to the infection fear, possibility of infecting near ones, quarantine, frustration, boredom, lockdown and its effect on stagnating our physical and mental processes, dissatisfaction with control measures, a surge ofmisinformation, conspiracy theories, inadequate supplies, financial loss, stigma about the infection and a feeling that this pandemic is not going to end soon, all have taken their toll on mental health globally. These led to emergence of depression, panic disorders, phobia, stress and sleep related disorders and even suicide. While infection control and case management have taken priority, there is always a need to look for these mental health issues amongst both the common people and those who are directly and indirectly fighting this pandemic. A similar need is also true for people who are at high risk for decompensation because of their preexisting mental illness.

"Mental health crisis in pregnant women during current COVID-19 pandemic","Even though for majority of women pregnancy period is a blessed period of their life but a few expecting women encountered a range of negative emotions in those ninth months which lead to depression and anxiety. Maternal mental health issues are interlinked with both short- and long-term health risks for the affected female parent and as well as for the child. The entire health and functional performance of the mother along with the children's mental, physiological and cognitive development is affected by the disrupting mental health situation of the mother. The risks of morbidities which are caused by the psychological problems such as intense stress, natural disasters and accidents and conflict situation could be increased among the perinatal mothers. As a result, it is possible that obstetric women are more exposed to mental health related issues during the pandemic of COVID-19. It is concluded that development of appropriate strategies is important to reduce stress by diagnosing and managing mental health diseases in new mothers without delay at the time of pandemic. Screening techniques based on internet, online counseling and web-related psychological assistance and therapeutic interventions might produce a significant role in this regard.

"Intervention effect of the video health education model based on solution-focused theory on adolescentsâ€™ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Given the long-term impact of public health emergencies on adolescentsâ€™ mental health, exten-sive effort should be exerted in the psychological intervention of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study combined solution-focused theory and video health education to explore the intervention effect of this model on adolescentsâ€™ mental health. Methods: Overall, 126 volunteers with anxiety symptoms from four communities in 2021 in Anhui Province, China were randomly divided into the intervention and control groups (63 members in each group). The control group only received health education popularized in the community. By contrast, the intervention group was given the same health education and provided with solution-focused psychological counseling and short video health education related to the pandemic. Results: Results after the intervention were as follows: 1) The Self-rating Anxiety Scale scores of both groups were low, but the effect on the intervention group was better than the control group (P &lt; 0.05). 2) Both groupsâ€™ positive and negative affect scores were higher and lower than those before the intervention were, but changes in the scores of the intervention group were greater than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05).

"Mental health situation in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic","November 2019 marked the eruption of a novel virus in the city of Wuhan (China) which was named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to rapid airborne transmission, the virus has now spread across 213 countries, infecting millions of people with a mortality rate of 3.15% worldwide. Initially the major topic of concern was the mortality risk and the clinical outcomes of the disease, however the pandemic has now resulted into global mental health crisis, largely because the only solution currently available against the novel coronavirus is the social distancing and isolation of suspect cases. As COVID-19 has led to an uncertain future, the mental health of Pakistanis is at stake. Therefore, it is essential for the government and health institutions to start mental health initiatives. Mental health services should be made more accessible to the general public while the taboos regarding mental health, and the new stigma against COVID-19 patients and their relatives, should be destigmatized. The government should invest in expanding free health care centers and providing ration bags to relieve the financial burden on the public. On the other hand, healthcare professionals and students should be provided with screening and mental health counselling by their respective institutions as well as security and adequate PPE. Lastly, it is also essential to ensure that the media and news provide authentic information to avoid situations of panic.

These are the real challenges facing Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). However, these are also some of the same issues they have had to be aware of throughout the past 30 years. Administrators at these institutions have been meeting and writing and discussing possible solutions, as a group, to be able to move HBCUs forward toward a more certain future. Due to the nature of most HBCUs, philanthropic dollars are not matching tuition or even federal student aid dollars. As recently as 2018, the Trump administration education officials were carefully pushing HBCUs that are on the financial edge to consider merging or taking other bold cost-cutting steps, knowledgeable higher education administrators say. The topic is said to be at the centerpiece of several HBCU meetings set to be held this fall in Washington, D.C. (Stuart, 2018). It is important to remember, however, that these topics have been being discussed in previous administrations â€“ from both major political parties. Â© 2021.

"The post-traumatic stress disorder impact of the COVID-19 pandemic","On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak had become a global pandemic. The symptoms of COVID-19 are well known, and a range of treatments have been used to save lives. However, those who have recovered from COVID-19 may be struggling to mentally cope with what they have experienced physically. They may even develop signs and symptoms of an acute stress response, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A question we face in the coming months is how to help survivors of severe COVID-19 recover. Although patients with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, health care workers, and other people are showing signs of psychological problems related to the disease, survivors of previous diseases, health care workers, and front-line employees face a higher risk of infection and are more likely to be depressed, anxious, or even diagnosed with PTSD. Exposure, fear, isolation, loss of income, reduced autonomy, and the inability of health care professionals to cure coronavirus infections contribute to this increased stress. As everyone is vulnerable to COVID-19, providing mental health support will help people maintain their mental health and return to a heathy life more quickly. The objective of this paper is to explore the research progress of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to COVID-19.

"Equipping parents to support their children's education: The effects of Charlotte bilingual preschool's family program","Charlotte Bilingual Preschool's Family Program aims to equip parents to support their children's education at home and at school by increasing parents' educational engagement, promoting parenting best practices, developing families' social capital, and supporting families' mental health and well-being. This study aimed to evaluate 1) how the Family Program promotes growth in these areas for the families at the preschool, 2) the interconnections among parents' attitudes, behaviors, and supports, and 3) how parents' attitudes, behaviors, and supports relate to their children's functioning in preschool. The analysis of survey data collected at the beginning and end of the 2019-20 school year uncovered little evidence that attendance at Family Program events (i.e., Family Cafes and Workshops) led to improvements in family or child outcomes, other than increased parent friendships and more connections in the preschool family network. The disruption of programming caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to remote instruction in March 2020, likely relate to the lack of findings in this area. Nonetheless, correlational and regression analyses did identify relationships among mothers' attitudes, perceptions of social support and social capital, and educational involvement behaviors. For instance, findings suggest that common good social capital (i.e., a positive, collaborative community atmosphere) may promote positive interactions with teachers and other parents, which could in turn, promote more positive educational involvement behaviors, including home-based involvement, ethnic identity parenting, and more positive behavior management practices. Additionally, analyses indicated that the positive relationship between maternal stress and negative behavior management practices was attenuated when mothers perceive strong social support and social capital. While these positive outcomes did not relate to parents' attendance at Family Cafes and Workshops, they were associated with parents' self-reported school involvement, suggesting that parents' broader interactions with the Family Program (i.e., beyond attendance at Family Cafes and Workshops) may yield positive outcomes. This study's findings support the approach of Charlotte Bilingual Preschool's Family Program, by connecting caregivers' attitudes, sense of support, and social capital (which are intermediate goals of the Family Program) to their educational involvement behaviors (the Family Program's primary goal). Theoretically, promoting positive family involvement should yield more positive developmental outcomes for children in the short- and long-term as well. This study provided some support for this hypothesis, by connecting parents' bonding and bridging social capital and their efforts to promote children's appreciation of their ethnic and cultural identities to children's social-emotional functioning and language skills. Furthermore, results suggested that when parents reported greater increases or improvements in several family-level variables, their children tended to show larger improvements in social-emotional protective factors and behavior. These findings indicate that the Family Program can have an important impact on children and families, especially by connecting socially isolated families with greater social support and social capital. The COVID-19 pandemic and the preschool's shift to remote programming in March 2020 was a major limitation that disrupted programming and reduced this study's capacity to draw strong conclusions. However, the pandemic also provided an opportunity to examine the links between various forms of remote engagement and outcomes for children and families.

"Impact of COVID-19 on patients from FACT or autism teams","Background: Most research focuses on the impact of COVID-19 for the general population. People with mental health problems may suffer even more from its consequences. Aim: Measuring mental health, experiences with outpatient care and government measures of 105 people in mental health care in the Northern Netherlands during the first wave of COVID-19. Method: Anonymous, online survey among people in care with autism- or FACT-teams in the Northern Netherlands between July-September 2020. Results: Few participants reported recent COVID-19-related symptoms (n = 2);no participant had lab-confirmed COVID-19. Both positive (clear world, tranquility, few stimuli: 28%) and negative experiences (missing face-to-face contact with mental health care professionals: 22%) were reported. Although there was some fluctuation in happiness, the average happiness score did not change due to the first wave. Three-quarters were satisfied with their mental health care. Although in-person contact with mental health care professionals was missed, the continuation of care through (video)calling was appreciated. One third reported an increased or new care need in mental health symptoms or daily functioning. The 'physical' government measures were considered pleasant and doable, but 'social' measures were harder. Newsletters with practical information about the consequences of the measures for personal healthcare were appreciated. Conclusion: The results show a nuanced picture of how outpatients experienced the first wave of COVID-19. Continued monitoring is important, as long-term impact of COVID-19 cannot be predicted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Dutch) Achtergrond: Veel onderzoek richt zich op de gevolgen van COVID-19 voor de algemene bevolking. Mensen met een psychische kwetsbaarheid lijden mogelijk meer onder deze gevolgen. Doel: Meten van psychische gezondheid, ervaringen met ambulante zorg en overheidsmaatregelen bij mensen (n = 105) in ggz-zorg in Noord-Nederland tijdens de eerste COVID-19-golf. Methode: Anonieme, online-enquete bij mensen in zorg bij FACT- of autismeteams in Noord-Nederland, juli-september 2020. Resultaten: Weinig deelnemers rapporteerden recente coronagerelateerde klachten (n = 2);bij niemand was infectie met het virus vastgesteld. Zowel positieve (overzichtelijke wereld, rust en weinig prikkels: 28%) als negatieve ervaringen (missen face-to-facecontact met behandelaars: 22%) werden gerapporteerd. Hoewel er enige fluctuatie was in de mate van geluk, veranderde het gemiddelde gelukcijfer niet door de eerste golf. Driekwart was tevreden over de geboden ggz-zorg. Ondanks het gemis van persoonlijk contact met behandelaars werd het voortzetten van zorg met (beeld)bellen positief gewaardeerd. Een derde rapporteerde een toename of nieuwe zorgvraag in psychische klachten of dagelijks functioneren. De 'fysieke' overheidsmaatregelen werden vooral als prettig en goed te doen ervaren, maar de 'sociale' maatregelen vielen zwaarder. Nieuwsbrieven met daarin concrete informatie over wat de maatregelen voor de persoonlijke zorg betekende, werden gewaardeerd. Conclusie: De resultaten laten een genuanceerd beeld zien hoe de eerste golf is ervaren door mensen in ggz-zorg. Wel is het van belang dit te blijven monitoren, want niemand kan voorzien hoe de impact van COVID-19 op de langere termijn zal zijn.

"Escalating progression of mental health disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from a nationwide survey","Background: Identifying pain-related response patterns and understanding functional mechanisms of symptom formation and recovery are important for improving treatment. Objectives: We aimed to replicate pain-related avoidance-endurance response patterns associated with the Fear-Avoidance Model, and its extension, the Avoidance-Endurance Model, and examined their differences in secondary measures of stress, action control (i.e., dispositional action vs. state orientation), coping, and health. Methods: Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted on self-report data from 536 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain at the beginning of an inpatient rehabilitation program. Measures of stress (i.e., pain, life stress) and action control were analyzed as covariates regarding their influence on the formation of different pain response profiles. Measures of coping and health were examined as dependent variables. Results: Partially in line with our assumptions, we found three pain response profiles of distress-avoidance, eustress-endurance, and low-endurance responses that are depending on the level of perceived stress and action control. Distress-avoidance responders emerged as the most burdened, dysfunctional patient group concerning measures of stress, action control, maladaptive coping, and health. Eustress-endurance responders showed one of the highest levels of action versus state orientation, as well as the highest levels of adaptive coping and physical activity. Low-endurance responders reported lower levels of stress as well as equa levels of action versus state orientation, maladaptive coping, and health compared to eustress- endurance responders;however, equally low levels of adaptive coping and physical activity compared to distress-avoidance responders. Conclusions: Apart from the partially supported assumptions of the Fear-Avoidance and Avoidance- Endurance Model, perceived stress and dispositional action versus state orientation may play a crucial role in the formation of pain-related avoidance-endurance response patterns that vary in degree of adaptiveness. Results suggest tailoring interventions based on behavioral and functional analysis of pain responses in order to more effectively improve patients quality of life.

"Quality improvement developments following pediatric resuscitation and va extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support due to a massive intentional antidepressant overdose","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant increase in suicide attempts in teenagers. Fluoxetine and Wellbutrin have been prescribed to adolescents to treat depression. Overdosing on these medications can cause seizures, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock. We report on a patient who presented to us with a normal physical assessment following a massive antidepressant drug overdose, but quickly deteriorated, and required VA Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Gaps identified in this case prompted us to assess our ECPR protocol, which led to areas for quality improvement. Case Review: A teenage male presented to our ED after intentionally ingesting Fluoxetine, Wellbutrin, and Hydroxyprogesterone. Fluid boluses, vasopressor infusions and multiple doses of epinephrine were administered, but his hemodynamic instability persisted. Concerns regarding cannulation, team activation and coordination of care during ECPR were areas identified as requiring improvement during a case review. The team was activated and cannulated the patient for VA ECMO. At hour eighty-five, he was hemodynamically stable, including normal sinus rhythm and resolved hypotension, and was removed from ECMO. He was successfully extubated, weaned to room air, and discharged with plans for outpatient therapy. Quality Improvement: An updated process for notifying team members for ECPR cannulation was implemented. Simulation scenarios, which are held quarterly, were developed, with clearly delineated roles, and emphasis on timing of chest compressions with minimal pauses during cannulation. Annual ECPR web-based education is mandatory. Improvements in the time to cannulation and team member interactions were noted during subsequent ECPR scenarios. Timing of team notification and cannulations continues to be tracked.","Berry, D.; Sichting, K.; Zachmann, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Quality+improvement+developments+following+pediatric+resuscitation+and+va+extracorporeal+membrane+oxygenation+support+due+to+a+massive+intentional+antidepressant+overdose","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: ASAIO Journal; 67(SUPPL 3):42, 2021.; Publication details: ASAIO Journal; 67(SUPPL 3):42, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20001,""

"Mental health outcomes among health care workers exposed to covid-19 in a tertiary government hospital in pangasinan","Introduction: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major health crisis that affected 32 million people to date and caused death to 990,000 individuals. The impact of this pandemic on the healthcare system took its toll especially to the healthcare workers and its effect on their physical and mental health. We aim to assess severity of generalized anxiety, depression and subjective distress among medical, allied and ancillary healthcare workers (HCWs) who handled COVID-19 patients. Methodology: This is a cross sectional, survey-based study done from July 1 to August 31, 2020 involving healthcare workers who handled COVID-19 patients in a tertiary hospital in Pangasinan. The self-administered questionnaires used were the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for generalized anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression and Impact of Events Scaleâ€“Revised (IES-R) for subjective distress. Results: A total of 417 of 450 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 92.67%. Majority were women (64.57%) and 53.24% were aged 19 to 30 years old. Sixty percent of the respondents were nurses, 25.9% were physicians and the rest were composed of medical technologists (6.47%), radiologic technologists (5.52%) and respiratory therapists (1.68%). Subjective distress was noted to be present in 253 (60.67%) healthcare workers followed by anxiety 224 (53.72%) and depression 184 (44.12%). Allied health professionals and male participants experienced anxiety the most as well as subjective distress. Depression was more severe among physicians (2 [1.85%]) and women (3 [1.1%]). Physicians and allied health professionals reported more severe degrees of mental health symptoms compared to nurses. Conclusion: In this study, the proportion of HCWs who experienced subjective distress, generalized anxiety and depression were 60.67%, 53.72% and 44.12% respectively. Generalized anxiety and subjective distress were more severe in men and allied health professionals. Meanwhile, the more severe symptoms of depression were present in women and among physicians.

"Lithium toxicity at therapeutic doses as a fallout of COVID-19 infection: a case series and possible mechanisms","OBJECTIVE: Lithium, a mood stabilizer used in the treatment of bipolar disorder is known for its anti-inflammatory properties with the discussion of its potential use in COVID-19 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19 infection is known to enter the target cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptors present in abundance in the lung and renal tissue. Recent research supports the evidence for direct renal injury by viral proteins. Here we report two patients with bipolar disorder presenting with lithium toxicity in the presence of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Two patients with bipolar disorder, maintaining remission on lithium prophylaxis, presented to the psychiatric emergency with recent-onset fever and altered sensorium. Both the patient's investigations revealed lithium toxicity, elevated serum creatinine, urea and inflammatory markers. Hypernatremia, hyperkalaemia, and hyperchloremia were seen in one patient. RESULTS: Lithium and other psychotropic medications were stopped immediately, and COVID-19 treatment was initiated. Patient with clinical signs of lithium toxicity, hypernatremia, hyperkalaemia, and hyperchloremia developed ventricular tachycardia. He survived and regained consciousness after 2 weeks of aggressive conservative management. However, another patient died of acute respiratory failure on day 3. CONCLUSION: Possible direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins can manifest with acute kidney injury and lithium toxicity among patients on long-term lithium therapy. Health professionals treating COVID-19 infection among individuals on lithium therapy should be aware of the possibility of lithium toxicity in the background of renal injury.","Pai, Naveen Manohar; Malyam, Vidhyavathi; Murugesan, Manisha; Ganjekar, Sundarnag; Moirangthem, Sydney; Desai, Geetha","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/YIC.0000000000000379","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int Clin Psychopharmacol;2021 Oct 19.; Publication details: Int Clin Psychopharmacol;2021 Oct 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20006,""
"Factors associated with changes in consumption among smokers and alcohol drinkers during the COVID-19 'lockdown' period","BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 public health social measures (PHSM) on health behaviours is poorly understood. We aimed to identify factors associated with changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption during the strictest period of PHSM 'lockdown'. METHODS: Logistic regression analysis was conducted using secondary data from the Central Statistics Office Social Impact Survey collected during the first lockdown in Ireland (23 April- 1 May 2020). RESULTS: Of the 1362 (33.8%) individuals that responded to the survey, 80.6% were current drinkers and 26.0% were smokers. The majority of smokers (60.9%) and drinkers (60.6%) reported no change in consumption. However, 30.5% of smokers and 22.2% of drinkers reported increased consumption. Being concerned about household stress from confinement [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.9, P = 0.002], working from home (aOR 2.1, 95 CI 1.4-3.3, P < 0.001) and urban living (aOR 2.0, 95 CI 1.5-2.9, P < 0.001) were associated with increases in alcohol consumption. Feeling very nervous (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.0, P = 0.009), feeling downhearted/depressed (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.4, P = 0.004), being concerned about someone else's health (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.9, P = 0.031), working from home (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.3, P = 0.046) and increases in alcohol consumption (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7-7.7, P = 0.023) were associated with increases in tobacco consumption. CONCLUSION: A mixed picture was evident in terms of changes in consumption among current smokers and drinkers. Increased consumption was more commonly reported than reductions. Increased consumption was associated with psychological distress and socio-economic factors. Policies and services should consider a response to widening inequalities in harmful consumption.","Reynolds, Ciara M E; Purdy, Joanna; Rodriguez, Lauren; McAvoy, Helen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab050","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur J Public Health;31(5): 1084-1089, 2021 10 26.; Publication details: Eur J Public Health;31(5): 1084-1089, 2021 10 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20007,""
"Distress in a Pandemic: Association of the Coronavirus Disease-2019 Pandemic with Distress and Quality of Life in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation","The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically disrupted cancer care, potentially exacerbating patients' distress levels. Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be especially vulnerable to this pandemic stress. However, the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic with distress, fatigue, and quality of life (QoL) are not well understood in this population. In a cross-sectional analysis of data from 205 patients undergoing HSCT enrolled in a supportive care trial, we compared baseline pre-HSCT distress symptoms (depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), fatigue, and QoL between enrollees before (ie, March 2019-January 2020) and during (ie, March 2020-January 2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. We used linear regression models adjusting for sociodemographics and cancer diagnosis to examine the associations between enrollment period and patient-reported outcomes. We used semistructured qualitative interviews in 20 allogeneic HSCT recipients who were &#8805;3-months post-HSCT to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their recovery post-HSCT. One hundred twenty-four participants enrolled before COVID-19, and 81 participants enrolled during the pandemic. The 2 cohorts had similar baseline demographics and disease risk factors. In multivariate regression models, enrollment during COVID-19 was not associated with pre-HSCT symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, fatigue, or QoL impairment. COVID-19-era participants reported themes of negative (eg, increased isolation) and positive (eg, engagement with meaningful activities) implications of the pandemic on HSCT recovery. We found no differences in pre-HSCT distress, fatigue, or QoL in patients undergoing HSCT before or during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, patients in early recovery post-HSCT report both negative and positive implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in their lives.","Amonoo, Hermioni L; Topping, Carlisle E W; Clay, Madison A; Reynolds, Matthew J; Rice, Julia; Harnedy, Lauren E; Longley, Regina M; LeBlanc, Thomas W; Greer, Joseph A; Chen, Yi-Bin; DeFilipp, Zachariah; Lee, Stephanie J; Temel, Jennifer S; El-Jawahri, Areej","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtct.2021.09.001","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Transplant Cell Ther;2021 Sep 15.; Publication details: Transplant Cell Ther;2021 Sep 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20008,""
"[Validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in South Africa: Three Complementary Analyses]; Validation de l'Ã‰chelle de la Peur de la COVID-19 en Afrique du Sud : trois analyses complÃ©mentaires","Fear is the most common response to disease outbreaks. Persistent and prolonged fear can elevate the levels of psychological distress and aggravate preexisting mental health problems. Therefore, prompted by the central role of fear in psychological responses to COVID-19, the Fear of COVID-19 Scalewas developed, which is the only instrument that can assess emotional fear reactions in relation to the current pandemic. In this study, we extend research on the psychometric properties of this instrument by adopting three complementary approaches: classical test theory, Rasch analysis, and Mokken analysis. Combining these methods allows for a more nuanced overview of the psychometric properties of the instrument. The sample comprised South African teachers (N = 355) who completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. All three approaches confirmed the reliability and the construct, convergent, and concurrent validity of the scale as used with South African teachers. In addition, all three approaches confirmed that the scale is sufficiently homogenous to be considered unidimensional.","Pretorius, Tyrone B; Padmanabhanunni, Anita; Stiegler, Nancy; Bouchard, Jean-Pierre","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.10.010","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2021 Oct 21.; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2021 Oct 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20009,""
"Trends in the Use of Benzodiazepines, Z-Hypnotics, and Serotonergic Drugs Among US Women and Men Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures have disrupted access to psychiatric medications, particularly for women. Objective: To assess the sex differences in trends in the prescribing of benzodiazepines, Z-hypnotics and serotonergic (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]), which are commonly prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, and depression. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from Clinformatics Data Mart, one of the largest commercial health insurance databases in the US. Enrollees 18 years or older were required to have complete enrollment in a given month during our study period, January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2021, to be included for that month. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prescription of a benzodiazepine, Z-hypnotic, or SSRI or SNRI. For each month, the percentage of patients with benzodiazepine, Z-hypnotic, or SSRI or SNRI prescriptions by sex was calculated. Results: The records of 17Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯255Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯033 adults (mean [SD] age, 51.7 [19.5] years; 51.3% female) were examined in 2018, 17Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯340Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯731 adults (mean [SD] age, 52.5 [19.7] years; 51.6% female) in 2019, 16Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯916Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯910 adults (mean [SD] age, 53.7 [19.8] years; 51.9% female) in 2020, and 15Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯135Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯998 adults (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [19.8] years; 52.5% female) in 2021. Compared with men, women had a higher rate of prescriptions for all 3 drugs classes and had larger changes in prescription rates over time. Benzodiazepine prescribing decreased from January 2018 (women: 5.61%; 95% CI, 5.60%-5.63%; men: 3.03%; 95% CI, 3.02%-3.04%) to March 2021 (women: 4.91%; 95% CI, 4.90%-4.93%; men: 2.66%; 95% CI, 2.65%-2.67%), except for a slight increase in April 2020 among women. Z-hypnotic prescribing increased from January 2020 for women (1.39%; 95% CI, 1.38%-1.40%) and February 2020 for men (0.97%; 95% CI, 0.96%-0.98%) to October 2020 (women: 1.46%; 95% CI, 1.46%-1.47%; men: 1.00%; 95% CI, 0.99%-1.01%). Prescribing of SSRIs and SNRIs increased from January 2018 (women: 12.77%; 95% CI; 12.75%-12.80%; men: 5.56%; 95% CI, 5.44%-5.58%) to April 2020 for men (6.73%; 95% CI, 6.71%-6.75%) and October 2020 for women (15.18%; 95% CI, 15.16%-15.21%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic onset was an increase in Z-hypnotic as well as SSRI and SNRI prescriptions in both men and women along with an increase in benzodiazepine prescriptions in women, findings that suggest a substantial mental health impact of COVID-19-associated mitigation measures.","Milani, Sadaf Arefi; Raji, Mukaila A; Chen, Lu; Kuo, Yong-Fang","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.31012","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(10): e2131012, 2021 10 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(10): e2131012, 2021 10 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20010,""
"Attempted suicide rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: interrupted time series analysis of a nationally representative sample","BACKGROUND: To characterize the association between the protracted biopsychosocial coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exposures and incident suicide attempt rates. METHODS: Data were from a nationally representative cohort based on electronic health records from January 2013 to February 2021 (N = 852 233), with an interrupted time series study design. For the primary analysis, the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on incident suicide attempts warranting in-patient hospital treatment was quantified by fitting a Poisson regression and modeling the relative risk (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Scenarios were forecast to predict attempted suicide rates at 10 months after social mitigation strategies. Fourteen sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Despite the increasing trend in the unexposed interval, the interval exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic was statistically significant (p < 0.001) associated with a reduced RR of incident attempted suicide (RR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.78). Consistent with the primary analysis, sensitivity analysis of sociodemographic groups and methodological factors were statistically significant (p < 0.05). No effect modification was identified for COVID-19 lockdown intervals or COVID-19 illness status. All three forecast scenarios at 10 months projected a suicide attempt rate increase from 12.49 (7.42-21.01) to 21.38 (12.71-35.99). CONCLUSIONS: The interval exposed to the protracted mass social trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a lower suicide attempt rate compared to the unexposed interval. However, this trend is likely to reverse 10 months after lifting social mitigation policies, underscoring the need for enhanced implementation of public health policy for suicide prevention.","Travis-Lumer, Yael; Kodesh, Arad; Goldberg, Yair; Frangou, Sophia; Levine, Stephen Z","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721004384","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-7, 2021 Oct 19.; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-7, 2021 Oct 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20011,""
"[Factors associated with prenatal stress and anxiety in pregnant women during COVID-19 in Spain]; Factores asociados al estrÃ©s prenatal y la ansiedad en gestantes durante el COVID-19 en EspaÃ±a","AIM OF THE STUDY: To describe prenatal stress and state anxiety levels in pregnant women living in Spain during the lockdown of the first wave of COVID-19 and its relation with obstetric factors, perception of health care, and concerns about the socio-sanitary situation. METHODS: The present study is an observational, correlational, and cross-sectional quantitative study. The participants in the study were pregnant women recruited through non-probabilistic convenience and snowball sampling during the lockdown. A web link was provided to an online questionnaire designed for this research, which collected socio-demographic and obstetric variables, perceptions of health care received during the pandemic and preoccupations associated with COVID-19. It also included the Prenatal Stress Questionnaire (PDQ) and the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S). RESULTS: Based on the responses of 695 pregnant women, the results showed a mean of 16.98 (SD=25.20) of prenatal stress and elevated levels of anxiety (M=25.20/ SD=11.07) in the first wave of the pandemic. Risk factors for prenatal stress and anxiety were the level of preoccupation associated with COVID-19 and previous mental health issues. A specific risk factor for anxiety was having more than one child and a protective factor were perceiving accessibility and availability of health care, with clear and consistent pregnancy care and follow-up protocols. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown period for COVID-19 was a stressful experience for pregnant women, highlighting the need to address their psychological well-being through clear and coherent protocols in terms of maternal-foetal health control and follow-up.","Awad-Sirhan, Natalia; SimÃ³-Teufel, Sandra; Molina-MuÃ±oz, Yerko; Cajiao-Nieto, Juanita; Izquierdo-Puchol, MarÃ­a Teresa","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2021.10.006","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Enferm Clin;2021 Oct 21.; Publication details: Enferm Clin;2021 Oct 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20012,""
"Nursing homes in Portugal during the COVID-19 outbreak: challenges for the future","OBJECTIVE: This study sought to explore the perceptions of experts about the performance of nursing homes during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: A qualitative study was developed in two stages: (1) a focus group, conducted in May 2020, with 5 experts; (2) a modified e-Delphi, implemented in September 2020 with 22 experts, both in the area of assistance in nursing homes from Northern and Center of Portugal. RESULTS: The results allowed identifying three main areas that influenced the performance of nursing homes during the COVID-19 outbreak: organization models and resources; physical and mental health of residents and; family as a support. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults residing in nursing homes are particularly vulnerable to severe disease or death from COVID-19. It is emergent that nursing homes prevent physical and mental frailty in older residents and the loneliness aggravated by the pandemic circumstances. Decision-makers need to recognize that older people living in nursing homes have several health needs, which should determine the implementation of new strategies namely the increase in the number of professionals with appropriate skills.","Araujo, Odete; Sequeira, Carlos; FerrÃ©-Grau, Carme; Sousa, Lia","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2021.09.011","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Enferm Clin;2021 Oct 20.; Publication details: Enferm Clin;2021 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20013,""

"Determinants of the mental health condition of healthcare workers during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey","Aim: Current study aimed to determine the stressors experienced by healthcare workers during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. Subject and msethods: A cross-sectional design was utilized, and an online survey was conducted in early April 2020 among 2506 healthcare workers, using snowball sampling. A questionnaire highlighting the elements pertinent to the COVID-19 outbreak and General Health Questionnaire were used to collect data. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of the early stages of the outbreak on the mental health condition of healthcare workers. Results: The mean of the General Health Questionnaire-12 was 6.03 (minÂ =Â .00, maxÂ = 12.00). Participants reported high frequency of some variables, such as favorable relationships with their teammates (90.7%, nÂ =Â 2274), striving to create a more hygienic home (84.6%, nÂ =Â 2121), anger and hopelessness due to the community's neglect of precautions (84.2%, nÂ =Â 2109) and fear of exposure to violence against healthcare workers (72.8%, nÂ =Â 1825). The final regression model contained seven variables (gender, individual preparedness, perceived level of training related to COVID-19, meeting basic needs during the pandemic, fear of being infected, fear of infecting loved ones, and family relationships). Conclusion: Our study indicates that the management of the COVID-19 pandemic has to be planned and sustained by relevant measures maintaining the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers. Psychological support should be provided for individuals and the teams; healthcare workers' families should also be involved in and benefit from sustained and intermittent psychological support.","Ãœnal, Yesim; Ã‡akir, Ekin; Tekeli-Yesil, Sidika","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01656-1","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Z Gesundh Wiss;: 1-7, 2021 Oct 12.; Publication details: Z Gesundh Wiss;: 1-7, 2021 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20018,""
"Commentary on the special issue on disproportionate exposure to trauma: Trauma, stress, and adversities and health disparities among disenfranchised groups globally during the COVID pandemic","The papers in this Journal of Traumatic Stress special issue on disproportionate adversity cover the gamut of discrimination traumas and stressors, including microaggressions, a more insidious forms of discrimination, and their often-devastating and wide-ranging mental health sequelae, in disproportionately affected disenfranchised groups. Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation commonly confers cumulative and chronic effects. In the field of traumatic stress studies, several types of identity-linked traumatic events have been identified and empirically investigated as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-producing experiences. Collectively, the 13 papers included in this special issue raise questions about the definition, conceptualization, and categorization of various forms of explicit and implicit identity-linked trauma. These papers highlight the need for acceptance of a shared nomenclature and better differentiation of both causal and correlational associations with acute and chronic PTSD, depression, suicide risk, alcohol misuse, and other mental health outcomes. In this commentary, the discussion is extended to COVID-19, a disease that has been globally devastating for many. On multiple levels (i.e., physical, mental, emotional, economic, and social), COVID-19 has magnified the prepandemic fault lines of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation.

As such, it is important to differentiate the two clinical entities as the management approach differs. Here we present a case of acute pulmonary cocaine toxicity mimicking possible pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old man with a history of depression was brought in by paramedics after being found unconscious.He was given naloxone en route with improved consciousness but was tachypneic and hypoxic, requiring oxygen. On arrival to the Emergency Department, he admitted to having smoked crack cocaine which was impure.He reported having hemoptysis and rhinorrhea but denied any chest pain, fever or any gastrointestinal symptoms.There was no personal or family history of lung or autoimmune disease. On presentation he was afebrile, tachycardic, tachypneic and persistently hypoxic requiring high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). Pertinent findings were diminished breath sounds with diffuse rales, with an otherwise unremarkable exam. Laboratory results were notable for cocaine on urine toxicology, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, elevated procalcitonin with normal CRP, BNP, serial troponins, lactic acid, COVID-19 test and HIV. Initial CXR showed bilateral extensive nodular interstitial lung pattern. He was admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to crack lung syndrome with superimposed pneumonia on HFNC and started on empiric antibiotics as well as methylprednisolone. Unfortunately, he remained persistently tachypneic and required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and transfer to the intensive care unit. On day 2, his respiratory status markedly improved and he was weaned from NIV to room air. Final blood cultures and mycoplasma antibody were negative and the rest of his hospital stay was uneventful. DISCUSSION: In 2018, approximately 5.5 million persons aged = 12 years reported cocaine use within the past year of which 757,000 used crack cocaine.2,3 With likely underreported usage, the deleterious pulmonary complications related to cocaine use including pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, eosinophilic pneumonia, pneumothorax, thromboembolic disease and AHRF,4 are clinically relevant. However, the diagnosis of cocaine-induced pulmonary diseases remains challenging for clinicians given that the clinical features and chest images are non specific and can mimic several other processes e.g. pneumonia.5 This distinction is important as mortality for pneumonia requiring ICU admission approaches 30%,6 while acute eosinophilic pneumonia portends an excellent prognosis with rapid clinical recovery. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights that ""Crack Lung"" should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with AHRF and diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. REFERENCE #1: Forrester, J.

"VAPING CAN BREAK YOUR HEART","TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is potentially life-threatening disease that has become increasingly recognized over the last years. However, the extra-pulmonary manifestations of this disease are not as well described. We present a patient who simultaneously developed acute EVALI and stress induced cardiomyopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old female with a recent heavy vaping history presented to hospital via EMS due to disorganized behavior. Her past medical history was notable for polysubstance abuse and an extensive neuropsychiatric history. Her vital signs were notable for sinus tachycardia, hypotension and hypoxia with an oxyhemoglobin saturation 65%. Her physical exam was notable for cyanosis, rales to pulmonary auscultation and use of accessory muscles. She was intubated and started on empiric antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia, and vasopressors. A computer tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPE) was negative for acute pulmonary embolism but showed scattered bilateral airspace opacities with dependent consolidations (fig 1.). Relevant laboratory on admission included procalcitonin 28.17, WBC count 12.9 and troponin 1.58. SARs-COV-2, serum blood cultures, legionella antigen, streptococci pneumoniae antigen and HIV were negative. Urine toxicology was positive for cannabinoids. Bronchoalveolar lavage later demonstrated 50,000 TNC with neutrophil predominance. EKG showed sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST depression. Echocardiogram revealed severe diffuse hypokinesis with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 13%. During her ICU course she continued on mechanical ventilation with lung protective strategy, systemic glucocorticoids and antibiotics. Vasopressors were subsequently weaned off. Repeated echocardiogram on ICU day five demonstrated a recovered LVEF at 55%. Patient's hypoxemia improved, and she was successfully extubated on ICU day eight. DISCUSSION: Pulmonary injury is the most well described clinical manifestation of EVALI, however a large majority of these patients also present with gastrointestinal symptoms and malaise, suggesting a systemic disease process. Our patient had newly reduced LVEF suggestive of stress induced cardiomyopathy which consequently improved with standard and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to maintain a high index of suspicion of secondary organ damage, as prompt diagnosis and treatment of EVALI associated cardiac dysfunction can have an impact in short- and long-term prognosis.

"MIRACLE DRUG UNDER FIRE: HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE OVERDOSE TOXICOKINETICS EXPLORED","TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a medication used in the treatment of malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The drug gained popularity during the early stage of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as an emergency use therapy. It has since been shown in numerous studies that HCQ can actually cause more harm than good. However, its media attention has led to an increase in overdose cases, which can be fatal due to cardiac complications. We present a case of a patient with access to HCQ for COVID-19 prophylaxis who overdosed in a suicide attempt with a favorable outcome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year old Asian American female with no significant history was found 4-6 hours after ingesting approximately 27 grams of oral HCQ. She was admitted to the intensive care for shock and severe hypokalemia (1.7 mmol/L). The pills were obtained from an overseas third party vendor for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Vitals on arrival were BP 60/30 mmHg, HR 66 bpm, temperature 94.9 fahrenheit. Based on previous case reports and studies on chloroquine, the patient was started on an epinephrine and versed drip, including 2 doses of 60mg diazepam. A single dose of activated charcoal was administered. Initial electrocardiogram revealed conduction abnormalities with QT interval of 549ms (629ms with Bazett's correction). The patient received 240 meq of potassium in a span of 25 hour and began to develop hyperkalemia of up to 6.4 mmol/L. After 48 hours, the patient's blood pressure and potassium levels normalized. On hospital day 4, she was successfully extubated with a favorable remaining hospital course. DISCUSSION: The most life threatening sequelae seen in HCQ overdoses are cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances, mainly potassium. Hyperkalemia after initial severe hypokalemia has been observed in numerous case reports of HCQ overdose and thought to be intracellular shifts rather than relative depletion. Thus, caution should be taken in the correction of initial hypokalemia. A review of previous cases shows an inverse relationship between potassium and HCQ levels, as with our case. Reported toxicity half-life ranges between 11.6 and 31 hours. Our case had an approximate peak concentration of 27 Âµg/ml after 4-6 hours after ingestion with an estimated observed half-life of 27 hours based on recorded concentrations over 45 hours, assuming 1st order elimination. Our patient's hypokalemia began to reverse during the 2nd half-life period which is also consistent with other reported cases. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that during the 2nd half-life, when more than 50% of the drug is eliminated, is the period when correction of hypokalemia should be taken with more caution. While these are only observations based on a few case reports, they can provide more insight on how to better manage electrolyte imbalances which can avoid fatal arrhythmias and circulatory arrest.

"39-YEAR-OLD WITH LEGIONELLA MYOCARDITIS","TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the myocardium. Legionella is a known rare infectious cause of myocarditis. Additionally, it has been implicated with pericarditis and prosthetic valve endocarditis. We present a case of a 39-year-old male with legionella pneumonia with myocarditis, acute renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old male with no known past medical history presented to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea after a viral syndrome for 3 weeks. He was intubated in the emergency department for respiratory failure. Chest x-ray showed multifocal atypical infiltrates. Electrocardiogram significant for diffuse ST depressions. Echocardiogram revealed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction of 30% with no valvular abnormalities. Lab analysis revealed hyponatremia, elevated troponins and acute renal failure with rhabdomyolysis requiring hemodialysis. Atypical serology was positive for Legionella which was treated with levofloxacin and azithromycin. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative and urine drug screen was negative. He was diagnosed with myocarditis given the legionella culture, elevated troponins, significant for electrocardiogram and echocardiogram findings. DISCUSSION: The first case of Legionella myocarditis was reported in 1981 by Gross [1]. Symptoms of myocarditis can range from a mild flu-like illness to cardiogenic shock or sudden death. Myocarditis is the cause of 12% of sudden deaths in young adults [2]. Diagnosis is typically made clinically with non-diagnostic exams, as endomyocardial biopsy is only used for special circumstances when other testing are non-diagnostic. A literature review of Legionella myocarditis as of 2017 portrayed ten patients with positive Legionella urine antigens, with eight having reduced left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiogram. Only two of those cases were based on cardiac biopsy [3]. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapulmonary manifestations of Legionella such as myocarditis have been reported even in the absence of overt pneumonia, and most often in immunocompromised patients. Clinicians should be aware of Legionella in the setting of unexplained myocarditis with findings as above. Treatment should be initiated for this reversible cause of myocarditis without delay, resulting in favorable prognosis. REFERENCE #1: Armengol, S., Domingo, C., Messales, E., (1992).

"CARDIAC TAMPONADE WITHOUT CHARACTERISTIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC FEATURES DUE TO HIGH RIGHT HEART PRESSURE FROM PULMONARY HYPERTENSION","TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Introduction: Cardiac tamponade occurs when pericardial effusion leads to equalization of intrapericardial pressure and diastolic intracardiac pressure, which reduces the systemic venous-to-right atrial pressure gradient, leading to depression in cardiac output. The lower this gradient, the greater the risk for cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade manifests clinically as shock, jugular venous distention, and muffled heart sounds, known collectively as Beck's triad. Typical findings on echocardiogram are right atrial and ventricular collapse.[2] These findings may not be seen in patients with elevated right-sided intracardiac pressure and can lead to misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.[1] We present a patient with a cardiac tamponade to highlight this point. CASE PRESENTATION: Case presentation: A 46 year old male with hypoxia and respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia supported with mechanical ventilation for several weeks developed refractory shock of multifactorial etiology. The patient was known to have pulmonary hypertension with dilated right atrial and ventricular pressure in addition to paradoxical septal motion, as seen on echocardiogram of recent past. Clinical examination revealed jugular venous distention and muffled heart sounds. Electrocardiogram detected sinus tachycardia and low cardiac voltage. Echocardiogram revealed large pericardial effusion without right atrial or ventricular collapse, and therefore cardiac tamponade was not considered as the cause of shock. As shock remained refractory to multiple vasopressors and inspiratory variation of the mitral valve inflow was noted on echocardiogram, it was decided to initiate pericardial drainage. However, the patient went into cardiac arrest before it could be performed. DISCUSSION: Discussion: A clinical diagnosis of cardiac tamponade can be made in the presence of Beck's triad. However, echocardiogram is most often relied on to make the diagnosis. The most sensitive echocardiographic findings of cardiac tamponade are right atrial and ventricular collapse.[2] Though sensitive, these changes may not be present in a patient who has preexisting elevated right sided intracardiac pressure. In such cases, the diagnosis must be based on clinical evidence and can be aided by the findings of exaggerated changes in mitral/tricuspid inflow during respiration. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusion: A hallmark finding of cardiac tamponade is right atrial or ventricular collapse on echocardiogram. However, these findings may be absent in the setting of elevated right-sided intracardiac pressure. The absence of right atrial or ventricular collapse in our patient can be attributed to the elevated right-sided intracardiac pressure due to pulmonary hypertension.[3] In such cases, the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade should be made on clinical grounds and pericardial drainage should not be delayed.

"Chinese Pride and European Prejudice: How Growing Resentment of China Cools Feelings toward Chinese in Europe","The Chinese governmentâ€™s cover-up of the origins of the new coronavirus, and its more openly prideful and aggressive foreign and human rights policies, triggered a dramatic deterioration of foreign views of China in 2020. That year also witnessed a significant increase in anti-Chinese/Asian prejudice around the world. Could the former have shaped the latter? Drawing on theories of prejudice and ideology, and using an Autumn 2020 13-nation European survey about China, this paper explores whether increasingly negative attitudes toward Chinese government policies prejudiced European views of local Chinese students, tourists, and communities. It finds substantial evidence of a spillover effect, an effect which is stronger among conservative Europeans than among progressive Europeans more motivated to avoid prejudice. The paper concludes with thoughts on the danger that Chinaâ€™s prideful â€œwolf warriorsâ€ pose for Chinese students, tourists, and local Chinese communities confronting prejudice in Europe today.","Gries, Peter, TurcsÃ¡nyi, Richard","https://doi.org/10.1525/as.2021.1397345","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Asian Survey; 61(5):742-766, 2021.; Publication details: Asian Survey; 61(5):742-766, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20025,""
"Social distancing and influenza mortality in 1918 did not increase suicide rates in the United States","Recent research has suggested that the social distancing mandates introduced in the United States during the main waves of the 1918â€“20 influenza pandemic caused an increase in suicide rates. However, that finding relies on poor-quality, temporally mismatched data and suffers from signs of omitted variable bias. Similarly, a long-standing finding that American suicide rates in 1918â€“20 were also boosted by the influenza mortality of the time has gone unquestioned in the literature, despite the original research admitting its risk of ecological fallacy. Using higher-powered mortality data, I cast doubt on both findings by analyzing the experiences of the pandemic in 43 of the largest American cities of the time. In fact, I present tentative evidence that social distancing mandates during the pandemic may have had a protective effect of decreasing suicide rates. Larger, cross-national investigations of the effects of historical pandemics and social distancing mandates on mental health and suicide are needed.","Gaddy, Hampton Gray","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100944","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: SSM - Population Health;: 100944, 2021.; Publication details: SSM - Population Health;: 100944, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20026,""
"DEVELOPMENT OF TELE-PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION PROGRAMS","Objectives: The pandemic prevented smooth running of the live groups in the child and adolescent partial hospitalization programs (PHPs), due to the social distancing guidelines. The need for mental health services for children was exacerbated due to limited peer interactions. Transitioning of the traditional partial programs to tele-PHP was a pressing need of the hour to maintain mental health services for children. This presentation highlights the various steps that were taken in the development of a successful tele-child PHP. Methods: First, the challenge was to adapt to a HIPAA-compliant virtual platform. After a trial, a HIPAA-compliant virtual platform was selected for telehealth delivery, and staff was appropriately trained. Individual email links were used to connect with patients for group therapy, individual and family therapy, and medication management. Initially, intakes were limited to inpatient unit discharges, and completed in-person and subsequent follow-up services were provided virtually. Eventually, all services were moved to virtual platforms, and community referrals were accepted. Staff was available on-site for in-person evaluation if needed. Next, electronic outcome measures were integrated to be completed by the parents/patients at home at intake and discharge. Meeting licensure requirements was important because physicians needed to be licensed in the state where the patient was. Results: Transitioning from traditional to tele-PHP was a challenging yet inspiring path. Tele-PHP was able to run smoothly within 1 to 2 weeks and was running virtual groups from March 2020 to July 2020, which moved to hybrid programming thereafter. It led to the increased access of mental health services for children including patients with social anxiety and autism spectrum disorder, who responded better to telehealth platforms, with improvement in participation and engagement in the program. Conclusions: Restrictions due to the pandemic led to the development of tele-PHP, despite various challenges and roadblocks. It helped us learn that telehealth services could be a potential long-term-care approach for the partial program and a reliable solution. Extensive research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the tele-PHP.

"The impact of COVID-19 on mental health in university students: A mini-review of the current literature","Students are some of the primary psychological victims of the global health crisis. This population is particularly sensitive to stress, and is also prone to developing substance and behavioral addictions, including food addictions, which may be exacerbated by the lockdown and health measures. Levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms among students have increased since the coronavirus crisis. Several studies show that drug use, including alcohol, has also increased since the implementation of health measures. Interestingly, the stress that was most perceived by students with addiction problems was mainly due to uncertainty about the organization of daily life and the expected consequences of the lockdown. Stress appeared to be more prevalent among female students and was associated with more anxiety disorders, more exposure to the media, and less social support. When problematic eating behaviors were already present before the lockdown, the stress of the lockdown increased them. Protective factors such as social support and regular contact with family protected against stress and the various addictive issues studied.

Cette population particulierement sensible au stress, est aussi sujette a developper des addictions aux substances ou des addictions comportementales, notamment sur le plan alimentaire;difficultes qui pourraient etre aggravees par le confinement et les mesures sanitaires. Les niveaux de stress, d'anxiete, de solitude et de symptomes depressifs des etudiants ont augmente depuis la crise du coronavirus. Concernant la consommation de drogues, dont l'alcool, plusieurs etudes montrent qu'elle a egalement augmente depuis la mise en place de mesures sanitaires. De maniere interessante, le stress qui est le plus perc u par les etudiants victimes de problematiques d'addiction etait principalement attribuable a l'incertitude liee a l'organisation de la vie quotidienne et aux consequences prevues du confinement. Le stress semble plus concerner les etudiantes et il est associe a plus de troubles anxio-depressifs, plus d'exposition aux medias et moins de soutien social. Lorsque des comportements alimentaires problematiques etaient deja presents avant le confinement, le stress du au confinement les a augmentes.

"Hiring for the Future of the Science and Technology Enterprise","Wright focuses on hiring for the future of the science and technology enterprise. The principal challenge federal agencies face in recruiting and retaining a strong science and technology (S&T) workforce is understanding their own needs and how to find people who can meet them. Many agencies require S&T talent who can help fulfill their missions by performing cutting edge research while transitioning that research to products and services that have real-world applications.

"The ""plantito/plantita"" home gardening during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every segment of life, including health, economy, education, and social ecologies. Quarantine measures have forced people to stay inside their homes, leading to the ""new normal"" of living and adaptation. One activity that has been among Filipinos during the onset of the lockdown until the present time is the increased engagement in gardening. Home gardening suddenly became a widespread activity in rural and urban areas. The use of the words ""plantito"" [male] and ""plantita"" [female] denote someone who enjoys taking care of plants. This qualitative study aims to explore and describe the rise of home gardening among Filipinos during the pandemic. A total of 104 participants answered an online survey containing open-ended questions. They described a ""plantito/plantita"" as a plant lover and nurturer and reported home gardening as a way of connecting with nature, a psychological experience, and an interest. The benefits include stress relief and improved mood. Further studies on home gardening and mental health and possible opportunities to incorporate this activity in communities are warranted.

"Impacts of COVID-19 on Health and Safety of Workforce in Construction Industry","The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has drastically impacted workers and workplaces across the globe. It has totally changed the workplace environment and increased workers' concerns about economic insecurity, mental health and physical well-being, isolation, challenges of working remotely, and returning to the workplace safely. COVID-19 has also had an impact on job-related factors that affect the diversity and dynamic nature of the workplace. This study aims to identify the challenges and recommended strategies that management can implement to positively impact the health and safety of workers who construct and maintain transportation infrastructure. A through literature search that was performed to identify the challenges revealed that in addition to the factors like wages, hours of work, and access to paid leave, field workers are also facing increased risk of exposure to the virus, heavier workloads, etc. While most office workers are working remotely, factors like isolation, working patterns, technology, home situations, and concerns about job stability often contribute to anxiety, depression, and even suicide. The outcomes of this study will help the project managers and authorities in the transportation industry adopt effective strategies that will improve the health and safety of field and office employees during the pandemic.","Pamidimukkala, A.; Kermanshachi, S.; Nipa, T.

"Pets in the pandemic: How pets can improve mental health during COVID-19","COVID-19 is a global pandemic which has resulted in a worldwide increase in negative mental health outcomes, particularly psychological distress. Given the global social distancing, quarantining, and isolation protocols, it has been challenging for some people to acquire the mental healthcare they require. Alternative forms of mental health therapy such as personal companion animal ownership and animal-assisted therapy have been shown to be efficacious in reducing psychological distress. This study examined how companion animals functioning as attachment figures can provide social support and how this support may reduce psychological distress during COVID-19. The research involved a systematic qualitative literature review of data on the ways in which companion animals function as attachment objects and provide social support during COVID-19 as well as the specific processes involved in mitigating psychological distress in humans. The data was identified, evaluated, and analyzed using the PRISMA protocol. The results indicated that companion animals can indeed reduce psychological distress in humans during COVID-19. The findings of this study imply that companion animals may be effective in reducing psychological distress during similar pandemics, disasters, and health crises as well as serve as an effective alternative option for mental health treatment when traditional therapy is unavailable.

"Staff Mental Health Self-Assessment During the COVID-19 Outbreak","In a survey in Canada about the psychosocial effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome on hospital staff, 29% of the respondents scored above the threshold point on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, indicating probable emotional distress.1 Frontline healthcare workers may experience fear of being infected and spreading the virus to their families, particularly those working in isolation wards and accident and emergency departments.

Since 14 February 2020, the Department of Psychiatry of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital has provided an online mental health self-assessment questionnaire to all hospital staff in the cluster. In China, a national guideline has been established for emergency psychological crisis intervention for the COVID-19 outbreak, and it recommends that (1) frontline staff involving in the care of COVID-19[-]infected patients should receive prior psychological crisis intervention trainings to anticipate patient's psychological reactions;(2) staff working in isolation ward should be put on rotations;(3) accommodation should be provided to frontline staff for self-isolation;(4) hotline and online psychological crisis interventions should be provided to needed staff;(5) and a psychological response team consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses should be formed in each unit to provide staff with psychological support.3 Enhancing the psychological well-being of hospital staff during the COVID-19 outbreak is equally important to the fight against the outbreak.","Joseph, P.

"US Communities Need More Accessible Data to Improve Health, Not Less","What national, regional, or state-level initiatives could the reintroduction ofthe CHSIs be aligned with? IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH In 2013, a pivotal report ofthe National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine), US Health in International Perspective: Shorter Lives, Poorer Health, comprehensively and clearly outlined the health differences and reasons for these differences between the United States and its peer high-income countries, including 16 democracies.6 Sadly, US health ranking was near the bottom as measured by life expectancy, which had improved but not as fast as in peer countries. The smaller gains in US life expectancy were actually reversed before the COVID-19 pandemic, from a peak of 78.84 years in 2014 to 78.54 years through 2018.7 And during the pandemic, the US media has shone a bright light on the US health disadvantage by highlighting greater COVID19-associated mortality in the United States than reported in peer countries.8 In the wake ofthe National Research Council and Institute of Medicine report, the American Public Health Association began an initiative to become the healthiest nation in a generation (by 2030), which included a strategy to promote the building of safe and healthy communities because the average life span across the nation is rooted in the health of communities.9 If data on community health outcomes and determinants are not widely accessible to communities, gaps in knowledge will remain about current community health and any health progress. Furthermore, the National Prevention Strategy also steers communities to implement evidence-based recommendations strategically to create healthy and safe community environments, integrate clinical and community preventive services locally, empower people, and eliminate health disparities in priority activities of tobacco-free living, preventing drug abuse and excessive alcohol use, healthy eating, active living, injury and violence-free living, and promotion of reproductive and sexual health and mental health and emotional wellbeing.14 Similarly, Healthy People 2020, and now Healthy People 2030, also calls for communities to use their goals and objectives to set local priorities.11 Setting effective community target objectives will depend on current knowledge of health outcomes and health determinants at the level of community action as well as accessible data for surveillance and monitoring ofthe targets. CONCLUSIONS Although national initiatives, such as the Federal Data Strategy and the National Committee on Vital Health Statistics, identify key health indicators to move the entire health status ofthe nation forward, local communities often need additional data, including smaller geographic areas of data for community health planning, interventions, programs, evaluation, and monitoring ultimately for advocacy and public health action.","Hutchins, Sonja S.

"Vulnerability and Resilience: Use and Misuse of These Terms in the Public Health Discourse","What are the hidden assumptions behind labeling a population as ""vulnerable,"" and what are subsequent implications for targets for intervention? [...]what are the potential public health pitfalls, particularly when referring to racial/ethnic groups experiencing health inequities as ""vulnerable communities,"" commonly in opposition to ""resilient"" (often in terms of ""building resiliency"")? [...]health inequities occurring along lines of race and ethnicity, class and socioeconomic status, sexual orientation and gender identity, immigration and documentation status, or place of residence (rural vs urban) have been well documented.4 However, labeling some groups as ""vulnerable"" may also lead to internalization of stereotypes among group members, which may unintentionally lead to increased disease risk through fatalism and diminished selfefficacy, and as such could be detrimental to health equity.5 For instance, stigmatizing public health messages may have resulted in beliefs about the inevitability of HIV infection, overestimation of risk, and fear among gay men in the United States, particularly during the 1990s, leading to internalized homophobia, worse mental health, and increased risk-taking.6 Another consequence of vulnerability labeling is masking health inequities in communities that are not considered ""vulnerable,"" making it difficult for those groups to advocate for health protective resources. [...]the greater prevalence of underlying health conditions among non-Whites likely has contributed to increased biological susceptibility to severe disease, contributing to greater hospitalization risk.11 These existing racial/ethnic inequities in health represent population-level socially induced biological susceptibility created by the unjust distribution of hazards inimical to health versus health-protective factors occurring systematically along racial/ethnic lines (social determinants of health, including structural and personally mediated racism).12 For example, hazardous air pollution, which is worse in areas with greater percentages of Black or African American residents,10 increases the population-level risk of chronic diseases that have been shown to result in greater susceptibility to severe COVID-19.13 Racism is a unique source of threat, and a social toxin that can also more directly increase biological susceptibility. Research shows that racism compromises biological systems engaged in the stress response;repeated experiences of racism accumulate and result in ""weathering,"" or premature physiological deterioration caused by the body being continually challenged.14 Racism has been shown to lead to accelerated aging at the cellular level, as indicated by the length of telomeres-repetitive sequences of DNA capping the ends of chromosomes that generallyshorten with age.14Telomere length is considered to be a marker of replicative history and cumulative biological ""wear and tear"";as an indicator of systemic aging, it has been linked to increased disease susceptibility and severity for a range of aging-related diseases, as well as mortality.14 Other research has shown that persistent exposure to racism is associated with greater allostatic load, a multisystem metric of biological dysregulation, as well as DNA methylation patterns reflective of accelerated epigenetic aging.14These studies indicate that racism becomes biologically embedded and thus plays a profound role in the creation of susceptibility.","Chae, David H.

"PACOVID, a population-based survey on the effects of the lockdown and the pandemic on the elderly: Preliminary results","Based on three ongoing epidemiological studies on aging, the PACOVID telephone survey was set up in the Bordeaux region a few days after the start of the first lockdown, with the aim of investigating the psychological and social repercussions of this pandemic on the elderly. This article presents the preliminary results. The most frequent response to the question ""What are the main difficulties you are encountering during this period?"" was ""none."" Regarding the potential consequences of the pandemic, the participants were more worried about their loved ones than about themselves. Engaging in leisure activities and maintaining daily routines and activities were the most common coping strategies. Only a small number of respondents reported ""poor"" perceived health, and the most frequent responses to the items on sadness, loneliness, and depression from the CES-D scale were ""never"" or ""very rarely."" One in four participants presented significant anxious symptomatology. Almost 90 percent felt socially supported, with around thirteen weekly phone calls, and almost 21 percent used a digital tool to communicate. The majority were aware of the causes and symptoms of COVID-19 and the protective measures, and displayed a positive attitude toward vaccination. Thus, contrasting with certain preconceived ideas, a growing number of studies, including PACOVID, have highlighted the potential resources and resilience capacities of the elderly, including those at a very advanced age, as well as demonstrating that they are well informed and aware of the pandemic threat.

"The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the demand for mental health care-The experience of a hospital centre in Portugal","Introduction: According to a survey carried out in 130 World Health Organization member countries, 93% of these countries revealed a disruption in their mental health care during the pandemic period. Our purpose was to study the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on visits to the psychiatric emergency department of a hospital centre. Methods: A retrospective study was designed to characterise the visits to the emergency department during a lockdown period of 2020 in comparison with the same period of 2019. Sociodemographic aspects, assessment orders, diagnosis, suicide attempts and post-discharge destination were assessed. Results: There was a 54.7% reduction in the total number of visits to the psychiatric emergency department in 2020. No significant variation was found in the main municipalities of origin or in the age of the patients. The number of assessment orders was higher in 2020. The most common diagnostic classification was mood disorders (F30-F39, ICD-10 classification) in both years, with a decrease in cases by 70.5% in 2020. The rate of hospitalisations was maintained, with a trend to an increase of the compulsory hospitalisations. Conclusions: Although there was a decrease in the attendance at the psychiatric emergency department associated with the pandemic, the response to serious clinical situations was guaranteed. Despite the risks associated with infection by SARS-CoV-2, it is essential to maintain the provision of mental health care.

The first part presents the foundations and principles of syndemic theory. For the purposes of this essay, syndemic was defined as a process of synergic interaction between two or more diseases, in which the effects are mutually enhanced. We discussed the three principal typologies of syndemic interaction: mutually causal epidemics; epidemics interacting synergically; and serial causal epidemics. In the second part, COVID-19 is analyzed as a syndemic resulting from the interaction between various groups of diseases and the socioeconomic context. The theoretical model considered the interaction between COVID-19 and chronic noncommunicable diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, and mental health problems. The essay addressed how social iniquities and conditions of vulnerability act at various levels to increase the effect of COVID-19 and other pandemics. The last section discusses the need for comprehensive, multisector, and integrated responses to COVID-19. A model for intervention was presented that involves the patient care and socioeconomic dimensions. In the sphere of patient care, the authors defend the structuring of strong and responsive health systems, accessible to the entire population. The economic and social dimension addressed the issue of reclaiming the ideals of solidarity, the health promotion strategy, and emphasis on social determinants of health. In conclusion, the lessons learned from the syndemic approach to COVID-19 call on government and society to develop policies that link clinical, sanitary, socioeconomic, and environmental interventions.; Este ensayo tiene como objetivo presentar y discutir el cuadro teÃ³rico de la sindemia de la COVID-19.

"Revisiting Candidacy: What Might It Offer Cancer Prevention?","The notion of candidacy emerged three decades ago through Davison and colleagues' exploration of people's understanding of the causes of coronary heart disease. Candidacy was a mechanism to estimate one's own or others risk of disease informed by their lay epidemiology. It could predict who would develop illness or explain why someone succumbed to it. Candidacy's predictive ability, however, was fallible, and it was from this perspective that the public's reticence to adhere to prevention messages could be explained, as ultimately anybody could be 'at-risk'. This work continues to resonate in health research, with over 700 citations of Davison's Candidacy paper. Less explored however, is the candidacy framework in its entirety in other illness spheres, where prevention efforts could potentially impact health outcomes. This paper revisits the candidacy framework to reconsider it use within prevention. In doing so, candidacy within coronary heart disease, suicide prevention, diabetes, and cancer will be examined, and key components of candidacy and how people negotiate their candidacy within differing disease contexts will be uncovered. The applicability of candidacy to address modifiable breast cancer risk factors or cancer prevention more broadly will be considered, as will the implications for public health policy.","Batchelor, Samantha; Miller, Emma R; Lunnay, Belinda; Macdonald, Sara; Ward, Paul R","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910157","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 27.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 27.; Neoplasms; Suicide; Humans; Neoplasms/epidemiology; Neoplasms/prevention & control; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20056,""
"Health and Wellbeing Benefits from Nature Experiences in Tropical Settings Depend on Strength of Connection to Nature","A growing number of policies and programmes in cities aim to increase the time people spend in nature for the health and wellbeing benefits delivered by such interactions. Yet, there is little research investigating the extent to which, and for whom, nature experiences deliver such benefits outside Europe, North America, and Australia. Here, we assessed the relationships between nature dose (frequency, duration, and intensity) and three mental wellbeing (depression, stress, and anxiety) and two physical health (high blood pressure, diabetes) outcomes in Singapore, an intensely urbanised tropical city. Our analyses accounted for individual factors, including socio-economic status, nature connection (nature relatedness), and whether people with poor health are prevented by their condition from visiting green spaces. Our results show that the association between nature dose (specifically duration) and mental wellbeing is moderated by a nature connection. Specifically, people with a stronger nature connection were less likely to be depressed, stressed, and anxious, regardless of the duration of their nature dose. For those with a weaker connection to nature, spending longer in nature was associated with being more depressed, stressed, and anxious. We did not find a relationship between nature dose and high blood pressure or diabetes. Our results highlight that the relationship between nature dose and wellbeing might vary substantially among cities.","Oh, Rachel R Y; Fielding, Kelly S; Chang, Chia-Chen; Nghiem, Le T P; Tan, Claudia L Y; Quazi, Shimona A; Shanahan, Danielle F; Gaston, Kevin J; Carrasco, Roman L; Fuller, Richard A","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910149","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 27.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 27.; Family; Parks, Recreational; Australia; Cities; Europe; Humans; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20057,""
"Ecuadorian Journalists Mental Health Influence on Changing Job Desire: A Cross Sectional Study","Journalist's mental health could predict their job change. This study aims at determining the prevalence of mental health issues and their association with perception of aptitude for covering emergencies and difficulty in seeing a corpse, and also to determine the mental health factors associated with job change. An ad hoc survey, GHQ-28 (Somatization, Anxiety-Insomnia, Social Dysfunction, Depression), MBI-P (Burnout, Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, personal accomplishment) and Brief scale to diagnose Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Suicide Risk were applied to 196 journalists (female = 51.6%). Descriptive analysis, correlations (Pearson and Spearman), T-test and binary logistic regression were performed. It was found that one third part of journalists perceive themselves as having low aptitude to cover emergencies and difficulty in seeing a corpse, 17.3% would consider changing jobs and 42.1% could only access free mental health services. The most frequent mental health problems are: low personal accomplishment, emotional exhaustion and post-traumatic stress disorder (11.2 to 17.3%). People who want to change jobs present more: social dysfunction, depression, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, low personal accomplishment, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide risk. The two mental health factors associated with desire of changing jobs are high emotional exhaustion, and low personal accomplishment. These results guide the psychosocial risk prevention processes for journalists, as well as the training needs that universities could consider to protect the mental health of this vulnerable group.","Bustamante-Granda, Byron Fernando; RodrÃ­guez-Hidalgo, Claudia; Cisneros-Vidal, MarÃ­a Aranzazu; Rivera-Rogel, Diana; Torres-Montesinos, Claudia","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910139","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 27.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 27.; Burnout, Professional; Mental Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ecuador; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20058,""

Using a biobehavioral lens, this paper provides a narrative overview of the literature on perinatal mental health and human-animal interaction (HAI). We focus on the role of social relationships, stress, and stress reduction in relation to perinatal mental health; the role of HAI in perceptions of social support, stressors, and stress reduction; and gaps in empirical knowledge concerning the role of HAI in perinatal mental health. Finally, we integrate contemporary biobehavioral models of perinatal mental health and HAI (i.e., Comprehensive Model of Mental Health during the Perinatal Period and the HAI-HPA Transactional Model) to propose a new conceptual framework that depicts ways in which HAI during the perinatal period may influence maternal and child health and wellbeing. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to consider the role of HAI in biobehavioral responses and mental health during the perinatal period. We conclude with recommendations for future research and improved perinatal care.","McDonald, Shelby E; Tomlinson, Camie A; Applebaum, Jennifer W; Moyer, Sara W; Brown, Samantha M; Carter, Sue; Kinser, Patricia A","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910114","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 26.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 26.; Human-Animal Interaction; Mental Health; Animals; Child; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Parturition; Perinatal Care; Pregnancy; Social Support; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20059,""
"Emotional Labor, Burnout, Medical Error, and Turnover Intention among South Korean Nursing Staff in a University Hospital Setting","Nurses are vulnerable to mental health challenges, including burnout, as they are exposed to adverse job conditions such as high workload. The mental health of this population can relate not only to individual well-being but also to patient safety outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for a mental health improvement strategy that targets this population. This cross-sectional survey study investigates emotional labor, burnout, turnover intention, and medical error levels among 117 nursing staff members in a South Korean university hospital; it also analyzes correlations among outcomes and conduct correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis to determine relationships among these factors. The participants had moderate to high levels of emotional labor and burnout, and 23% had experienced medical errors within the last six months. Save for medical errors, all outcomes significantly and positively correlated with each other. These results can be used to improve the mental health outcomes of nurses working in the hospital and their consequences. Specifically, the job positions of nursing personnel may be a major consideration in such a strategy, and job-focused emotional labor and employee-focused emotional labor may be promising targets in ameliorating turnover intention and client-related burnout, respectively.","Kwon, Chan-Young; Lee, Boram; Kwon, O-Jin; Kim, Myo-Sung; Sim, Kyo-Lin; Choi, Yung-Hyun","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910111","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 26.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 26.; Burnout, Professional; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Burnout, Professional/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals, University; Humans; Intention; Job Satisfaction; Medical Errors; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workplace; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20060,""
"Public Health Impacts of Underemployment and Unemployment in the United States: Exploring Perceptions, Gaps and Opportunities","BACKGROUND: Unemployment, underemployment, and the quality of work are national occupational health risk factors that drive critical national problems; however, to date, there have been no systematic efforts to document the public health impact of this situation. METHODS: An environmental scan was conducted to explore the root causes and health impacts of underemployment and unemployment and highlight multilevel perspectives and factors in the landscape of underemployment and unemployment. METHODS: included a review of gray literature and research literature, followed by key informant interviews with nine organizational representatives in employment research and policy, workforce development, and industry to assess perceived needs and gaps in practice. RESULTS: Evidence highlights the complex nature of underemployment and unemployment, with multiple macro-level underlying drivers, including the changing nature of work, a dynamic labor market, inadequate enforcement of labor protection standards, declining unions, wage depression, and weak political will interacting with multiple social determinants of health. Empirical literature on unemployment and physical, mental, and psychological well-being, substance abuse, depression in young adults, and suicides is quite extensive; however, there are limited data on the impacts of underemployment on worker health and well-being. Additionally, organizations do not routinely consider health outcomes as they relate to their work in workforce or policy development. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Several gaps in data and research will need to be addressed in order to assess the full magnitude of the public health burden of underemployment and unemployment. Public health needs to champion a research and practice agenda in partnership with multisector stakeholders to illuminate the role of employment quality and status in closing the gap on health inequities, and to integrate workforce health and well-being into labor and economic development agendas across government agencies and industry.","Pratap, Preethi; Dickson, Alison; Love, Marsha; Zanoni, Joe; Donato, Caitlin; Flynn, Michael A; Schulte, Paul A","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910021","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 23.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 23.; Suicide; Unemployment; Employment; Humans; Perception; Public Health; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20061,""
"Access to Daylight at Home Improves Circadian Alignment, Sleep, and Mental Health in Healthy Adults: A Crossover Study","As the primary environmental cue for the body's master biological clock, light-dark patterns are key for circadian alignment and are ultimately fundamental to multiple dimensions of health including sleep and mental health. Although daylight provides the proper qualities of light for promoting circadian alignment, our modern indoor lifestyles offer fewer opportunities for adequate daylight exposure. This field study explores how increasing circadian-effective light in residences affects circadian phase, sleep, vitality, and mental health. In this crossover study, 20 residents spent one week in their apartments with electrochromic glass windows and another week with functionally standard windows with blinds. Calibrated light sensors revealed higher daytime circadian-effective light levels with the electrochromic glass windows, and participants exhibited consistent melatonin onset, a 22-min earlier sleep onset, and higher sleep regularity. In the blinds condition, participants exhibited a 15-min delay in dim light melatonin onset, a delay in subjective vitality throughout the day, and an overall lower positive affect. This study demonstrates the impact of daytime lighting on the physiological, behavioral, and subjective measures of circadian health in a real-world environment and stresses the importance of designing buildings that optimize daylight for human health and wellbeing.","Nagare, Rohan; Woo, May; MacNaughton, Piers; Plitnick, Barbara; Tinianov, Brandon; Figueiro, Mariana","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18199980","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 23.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 23.; Melatonin; Mental Health; Adult; Circadian Rhythm; Cross-Over Studies; Humans; Sleep; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20062,""
"Italians do it <U+0085> less COVID-19 lockdown impact on sexual activity: Evidence from a large representative sample of Italian adults","BACKGROUND: To explore how sexual activity was impacted by COVID-19 lockdown measures in the general adult population. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 6,003 Italian adults aged 18-74 years, representative of the Italian general population. Study subjects were recruited at the time of the Nation-wide stay-at-home order (from April 27 to May 3, 2020). We identified characteristics associated to decreased frequency of sex during lockdown, differentiating between cohabiting and non-cohabiting subjects. RESULTS: Over one third (35.3%) of Italians reported to have changed (8.4% increased and 26.9% decreased) their sexual activity during lockdown. When focusing on cohabitants (N=3,949, 65.8%), decreased sexual activity (20.7%) was more frequently reported by men (22.3%; compared to women, multivariable odds ratio=1.23; 95% confidence interval=1.05-1.44), younger (p for trend <0.001), more educated subjects (p for trend=0.004), subjects living in smaller houses (p for trend=0.003), and those reporting longer time spent outdoor before the lockdown (p for trend <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown drastically altered people's day-to-day life and is likely to have impacted on lifestyle habits and behavioral risk factors, including sexual attitudes and practice. This is the first national population-level study exploring changes in sexual life in this COVID-19 era. As we report sexual practice to have been affected by lockdown restrictions, we suggest these changes are to be explored beyond imposed social distancing, into mental health, social, and other determinants.","Amerio, Andrea; Lugo, Alessandra; Bosetti, Cristina; Fanucchi, Tiziana; Gorini, Giuseppe; Pacifici, Roberta; Odone, Anna; Gallus, Silvano","https://dx.doi.org/10.2188/jea.JE20210055","","Country: JP; JAPÃƒO; JAPAN; JAPON; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Epidemiol;2021 Oct 09.; Publication details: J Epidemiol;2021 Oct 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20063,""

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(41): 1637-1642. Summary. The COVID-19 pandemic forced prolonged social distancing between people. This, among other mental disorders and mental health consequences, highlights a specific psychiatric phenomenon: the hikikomori condition. The hikikomori is a phenomenon of persistent and extreme social withdrawal. The condition's established diagnostic set of criteria is not yet to be found in diagnostic manuals classifying mental disorders. Little is known about the exact mechanism of its development, but some authors see a close link between its emergence and the rise of the internet. Typically, the individual gradually withdraws into a voluntary isolation as a result of a socially humiliating or unfavourable situation. Although the outside world is not completely irrelevant to them, they tend to follow online the events of the world and they also keep in touch with others mostly online in order to avoid retraumatization. The COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in relation to the rise of online lifestyles as a consequence of lockdowns, has contributed significantly to the more and more frequent use of the internet, while real social contact has been inevitably reduced. This constellation can be seen as a major risk factor for hikikomori, which in the long term could be an unanticipated complication of the pandemic, especially in adolescents and young adults.

INTRODUCTION: Psychiatric disorders are the main risk factors for suicide. COVID-19 may result in the appearance of neuropsychiatric syndromes. Moreover, other corollaries of the pandemic (e.g., isolation, job loss) may lead to increasing stress and, ultimately, psychiatric disorders even among the non-infected population. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the theory of whether the pandemic, due to the aforementioned factors, was associated with the reversal of the declining suicide rate trend in Hungary. METHOD: To compare the observed number of suicides during the COVID-19 months (March-December 2020) with the expected numbers, we used an interrupted time series model and, for the estimations, quasi-Poisson regression. Expected numbers were calculated based on trends derived from monthly data between 2010 and 2020. RESULTS: During the months of the pandemic, the number of suicides among males rose significantly by 18% compared to the hypothetical trend that would have occurred in the absence of COVID-19. A significant increase (16%) was also observed in the total population. By contrast, the number of female suicides did not differ significantly from the number expected based on the pre-COVID-19 trend. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: After the outbreak of the epidemic, Hungarian males committed significantly more suicides, while no relevant changes were observed among females. Interestingly, studies from other countries found either no change or decrease when comparing suicide numbers from the COVID-19 period with the corresponding numbers from the pre-COVID-19 period. The explanation for this discrepancy is still lacking, so further investigations are needed.

"Prognostic factors of depression and depressive symptoms after hip fracture surgery: systematic review","BACKGROUND: Patients with hip fracture and depression are less likely to recover functional ability. This review sought to identify prognostic factors of depression or depressive symptoms up to 1 year after hip fracture surgery in adults. This review also sought to describe proposed underlying mechanisms for their association with depression or depressive symptoms. METHODS: We searched for published (MEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Web of Science Core Collection) and unpublished (OpenGrey, Greynet, BASE, conference proceedings) studies. We did not impose any date, geographical, or language limitations. Screening (Covidence), extraction (Checklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies, adapted for use with prognostic factors studies Checklist), and quality appraisal (Quality in Prognosis Studies tool) were completed in duplicate. Results were summarised narratively. RESULTS: In total, 37 prognostic factors were identified from 12 studies included in this review. The quality of the underlying evidence was poor, with all studies at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Most factors did not have a proposed mechanism for the association. Where factors were investigated by more than one study, the evidence was often conflicting. CONCLUSION: Due to conflicting and low quality of available evidence it is not possible to make clinical recommendations based on factors prognostic of depression or depressive symptoms after hip fracture. Further high-quality research investigating prognostic factors is warranted to inform future intervention and/or stratified approaches to care after hip fracture.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases: insights from patient-generated data on social media","OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, much communication occurred online, through social media. This study aimed to provide patient perspective data on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), using Twitter-based patient-generated health data (PGHD). METHODS: A convenience sample of Twitter messages in English posted by people with RMDs was extracted between 1 March and 12 July 2020 and examined using thematic analysis. Included were Twitter messages that mentioned keywords and hashtags related to both COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) and select RMDs. The RMDs monitored included inflammatory-driven (joint) conditions (ankylosing spondylitis, RA, PsA, lupus/SLE and gout). RESULTS: The analysis included 569 tweets by 375 Twitter users with RMDs across several countries. Eight themes emerged regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs: (i) lack of understanding of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19; (ii) critical changes in health behaviour; (iii) challenges in healthcare practice and communication with healthcare professionals; (iv) difficulties with access to medical care; (v) negative impact on physical and mental health, coping strategies; (vi) issues around work participation; (vii) negative effects of the media; and (viii) awareness-raising. CONCLUSION: The findings show that Twitter serves as a real-time data source to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs. The platform provided 'early signals' of potentially critical health behaviour changes. Future epidemics might benefit from the real-time use of Twitter-based PGHD to identify emerging health needs, facilitate communication and inform clinical practice decisions.","Reuter, Katja; Deodhar, Atul; Makri, Souzi; Zimmer, Michael; Berenbaum, Francis; Nikiphorou, Elena","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab174","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rheumatology (Oxford);60(SI): SI77-SI84, 2021 10 09.; Publication details: Rheumatology (Oxford);60(SI): SI77-SI84, 2021 10 09.; COVID-19/prevention & control; Musculoskeletal Diseases/psychology; Quarantine/psychology; Rheumatic Diseases/psychology; Social Media; Adaptation, Psychological; Communication; Health Behavior; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20068,""
"Care Challenges Due to COVID-19 and Mental Health Among Caregivers of US Adults With a Chronic or Disabling Condition","Background and Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses new challenges for caregivers of adults with chronic or disabling conditions. This study uses nationally representative data to examine the prevalence of pandemic care challenges and supports and their associations with caregiver mental health and interpersonal well-being. Research Design and Methods: Participants include 311 caregivers aged 50-80 in the United States who were providing care for an adult with a chronic or disabling condition from the June 2020 National Poll on Healthy Aging. Five care challenges (e.g., confusion on public health guidelines) and 2 supports (e.g., physician offered information on care during COVID-19) are treated as predictors of caregiver mental health (care-related stress, self-reported mental health, and depressive symptoms) and interpersonal well-being (interpersonal conflicts, lack of companionship, and isolation). Results: Each care challenge/support was endorsed by 13%-23% of caregivers. In adjusted models, difficulty getting needed medical care was associated with greater caregiver stress, depressive symptoms, and lower interpersonal well-being. All care challenges universally predicted greater caregiver stress. Caregiving supports were not independently associated with caregiver' mental health and interpersonal well-being. Discussion and Implications: Care challenges were associated with caregivers' mental health and interpersonal well-being during the early months of the pandemic. Some of these challenges may be attributed to changing public health guidelines and practices as the pandemic unfolded, whereas others are relevant to all care contexts (e.g., less support from family). Tools and supports for caregivers must consider both changing policies and care needs.","Leggett, Amanda N; Carmichael, Alicia; Leonard, Natalie; Jackson, Jeannette; Kirch, Matthias; Solway, Erica; Kullgren, Jeffrey T; Singer, Dianne; Malani, Preeti N; Gonzalez, Richard","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igab031","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Innov Aging;5(3): igab031, 2021.; Publication details: Innov Aging;5(3): igab031, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20069,""
"Understanding the Influence of Personality Traits on Risk of Suicidal Behaviour in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: A Systematic Review","Risk of suicidal behaviour (SB) in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) is a major concern, particularly in early stages of the illness, when suicide accounts for a high number of premature deaths. Although some risk factors for SB in SSD are well understood, the extent to which personality traits may affect this risk remains unclear, which may have implications for prevention. We conducted a systematic review of previous studies indexed in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase examining the relationship between personality traits and SB in samples of patients with SSD. Seven studies fulfilled predetermined selection criteria. Harm avoidance, passive-dependent, schizoid and schizotypal personality traits increased the risk of SB, while self-directedness, cooperativeness, excluding persistence and self-transcendence acted as protective factors. Although only seven studies were retrieved from three major databases after applying predetermined selection criteria, we found some evidence to support that personality issues may contribute to SB in patients with SSD. Personality traits may therefore become part of routine suicide risk assessment and interventions targeting these personality-related factors may contribute to prevention of SB in SSD.","Canal-Rivero, Manuel; Ayesa-Arriola, Rosa; SetiÃ©n-Suero, Esther; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto; Arango, Celso; Dutta, Rina; Lopez-Morinigo, Javier-David","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194604","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Clin Med;10(19)2021 Oct 08.; Publication details: J Clin Med;10(19)2021 Oct 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20070,""
"PPAR-&#945; Hypermethylation in the Hippocampus of Mice Exposed to Social Isolation Stress Is Associated with Enhanced Neuroinflammation and Aggressive Behavior","Social behavioral changes, including social isolation or loneliness, increase the risk for stress-related disorders, such as major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicide, which share a strong neuroinflammatory etiopathogenetic component. The peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-&#945;, a newly discovered target involved in emotional behavior regulation, is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor and a transcription factor that, following stimulation by endogenous or synthetic ligands, may induce neuroprotective effects by modulating neuroinflammation, and improve anxiety and depression-like behaviors by enhancing neurosteroid biosynthesis. How stress affects epigenetic mechanisms with downstream effects on inflammation and emotional behavior remains poorly understood. We studied the effects of 4-week social isolation, using a mouse model of PTSD/suicide-like behavior, on hippocampal PPAR-&#945; epigenetic modification. Decreased PPAR-&#945; expression in the hippocampus of socially isolated mice was associated with increased levels of methylated cytosines of PPAR-&#945; gene CpG-rich fragments and deficient neurosteroid biosynthesis. This effect was associated with increased histone deacetylases (HDAC)1, methyl-cytosine binding protein (MeCP)2 and decreased ten-eleven translocator (TET)2 expression, which favor hypermethylation. These alterations were associated with increased TLR-4 and pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-&#945;,), mediated by NF-&#954;B signaling in the hippocampus of aggressive mice. This study contributes the first evidence of stress-induced brain PPAR-&#945; epigenetic regulation. Social isolation stress may constitute a risk factor for inflammatory-based psychiatric disorders associated with neurosteroid deficits, and targeting epigenetic marks linked to PPAR-&#945; downregulation may offer a valid therapeutic approach.","Matrisciano, Francesco; Pinna, Graziano","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms221910678","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Mol Sci;22(19)2021 Oct 01.; Publication details: Int J Mol Sci;22(19)2021 Oct 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20071,""
"Persistence of Lipoproteins and Cholesterol Alterations after Sepsis: Implication for Atherosclerosis Progression","(1) Background: Sepsis is one of the most common critical care illnesses with increasing survivorship. The quality of life in sepsis survivors is adversely affected by several co-morbidities, including increased incidence of dementia, stroke, cardiac disease and at least temporary deterioration in cognitive dysfunction. One of the potential explanations for their progression is the persistence of lipid profile abnormalities induced during acute sepsis into recovery, resulting in acceleration of atherosclerosis. (2) Methods: This is a targeted review of the abnormalities in the long-term lipid profile abnormalities after sepsis; (3) Results: There is a well-established body of evidence demonstrating acute alteration in lipid profile (HDL-c &#8595;&#8595;, LDL-C -c &#8595;&#8595;). In contrast, a limited number of studies demonstrated depression of HDL-c levels with a concomitant increase in LDL-C -c in the wake of sepsis. VLDL-C -c and Lp(a) remained unaltered in few studies as well. Apolipoprotein A1 was altered in survivors suggesting abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism concomitant to overall lipoprotein abnormalities. However, most of the studies were limited to a four-month follow-up and patient groups were relatively small. Only one study looked at the atherosclerosis progression in sepsis survivors using clinical correlates, demonstrating an acceleration of plaque formation in the aorta, and a large metanalysis suggested an increase in the risk of stroke or acute coronary event between 3% to 9% in sepsis survivors. (4) Conclusions: The limited evidence suggests an emergence and persistence of the proatherogenic lipid profile in sepsis survivors that potentially contributes, along with other factors, to the clinical sequel of atherosclerosis.","Laudanski, Krzysztof","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms221910517","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Mol Sci;22(19)2021 Sep 29.; Publication details: Int J Mol Sci;22(19)2021 Sep 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20072,""
"Loneliness and Depression among Women in Poland during the COVID-19 Pandemic","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many changes in the functioning of people all over the world in a short period of time. According to a WHO report (2020), it is women who are at a particular risk of the negative effects of the pandemic, especially in terms of mental health. AIM OF STUDY: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression, irritability, and loneliness among adult women during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on a representative sample of women in Poland (n = 452). The data were collected using the HADS-M scale and the R-UCLA scale. RESULTS: A low level of loneliness was found in 37.3% of the women, moderate in 38.9%, moderately high in 22.3% and very high in 1.3% of women. Self-rating of physical and mental health was significantly positively correlated with anxiety, depression, and irritability in HADS-M, and loneliness in R-UCLA. As the severity of loneliness increased, so did Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores on all subscales (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study group presented with mental well-being disorders in the form of anxiety and depression. Two in three women experienced loneliness.","Idzik, Anna; Lenczuk-Gruba, Anna; Kobos, Ewa; Pietrzak, Mariola; Dziedzic, Beata","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010698","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(20)2021 10 12.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(20)2021 10 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20073,""
"Mental Health during the COVID-19 Crisis in Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","We aim to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms among major African populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We include articles from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and medRxiv between 1 February 2020 and 6 February 2021, and pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses. We identify 28 studies and 32 independent samples from 12 African countries with a total of 15,071 participants. The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% in 27 studies, of depression was 45% in 24 studies, and of insomnia was 28% in 9 studies. The pooled prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in North Africa (44%, 55%, and 31%, respectively) are higher than those in Sub-Saharan Africa (31%, 30%, and 24%, respectively). We find (a) a scarcity of studies in several African countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases; (b) high heterogeneity among the studies; (c) the extent and pattern of prevalence of mental health symptoms in Africa is high and differs from elsewhere-more African adults suffer from depression rather than anxiety and insomnia during COVID 19 compared to adult populations in other countries/regions. Hence, our findings carry crucial implications and impact future research to enable evidence-based medicine in Africa.","Chen, Jiyao; Farah, Nusrat; Dong, Rebecca Kechen; Chen, Richard Z; Xu, Wen; Yin, Jin; Chen, Bryan Z; Delios, Andrew Yilong; Miller, Saylor; Wan, Xue; Ye, Wenping; Zhang, Stephen X","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010604","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(20)2021 10 10.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(20)2021 10 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20074,""
"Age and Cultural Differences in Recognitions of Emotions from Masked Faces among Koreans and Americans","This study investigates age and cultural differences in the negative effects of senders' wearing masks on receivers' readabilities of senders' facially expressed emotions in interpersonal interactions. An online experiment was thus conducted with Koreans and Americans aged over 20 years. Based on sampling quotas by nationality, age group and gender, Korean (n = 240) and American (n = 273) participants were recruited from panel members of a Korean research company and Amazon's Mechanical Turk via email and the website, respectively. The participants played receiver roles to infer senders' facially expressed emotions presented in photos in the experiment. They judged emotions facially expressed by the senders without masks and with masks are shown in photos. The results revealed that the senders' wearing masks reduced the readabilities of the senders' facially expressed anger among participants aged 30-49 years more than among participants aged 20-29 years. The senders' wearing masks decreased the readabilities of the senders' facially expressed fear for participants in their 50's more than for participants in their 20's. When the senders wore masks, the readabilities of the senders' facially expressed happiness dropped among participants aged over 60 years more than among participants aged 20-49 years. When senders wore masks, American participants' readabilities of disgust, fear, sadness and happiness expressed in the senders' faces declined more than Korean participants' readabilities of those emotions. The implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.","Kang, Jungsuk; Kang, Seonwoo; Jeong, Eunbyeol; Kim, Eun-Ho","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910555","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 10 08.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 10 08.; Emotions; Facial Expression; Anger; Humans; Recognition, Psychology; Republic of Korea; United States; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20075,""
"Epidemiology Features and Effectiveness of Vaccination and Non-pharmaceutical Interventions of Delta and Lambda SARS-CoV-2 Variants","As the epidemic time of COVID-19 outbreaks worldwide has extended and the range of prevalence has expanded, SARS-CoV-2 viruses have continuously evolved and mutated, and multiple virus variants have successively emerged. Recently, the Delta and Lambda variants have attracted considerable attention in China for their transmissibility, infective incubation period, and pathogenicity. In this review, we describe the epidemic characteristics and prevention and control measures for Delta and Lambda. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was discovered in Wuhan in late December 2019, is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1-4). On March 13, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic (5). As of September 21, 2021, more than 228 million people have been infected globally and nearly 4.6 million people have died (6). As the COVID-19 pandemic continued and spread more widely, a variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged. These variants have the characteristics of faster replication and transmission, higher pathogenicity and potential immune escape, which led to a rebound of the epidemic recently (7). The WHO has classified several variants into variants of concern (VOC) and variant of interest (VOI) based on differences in transmissibility and pathogenicity, and the rest of the descendent lineages are designated as variants under monitoring (8). Currently, there has four VOCs, among which, the Delta variant has gradually become the dominant strain in many countries. The recent domestic outbreaks in China associated with the imported cases were mainly caused by the Delta variant (9-10). Among the two VOIs, the Lambda variant has recently appeared in South America and even in a few countries, and had a tendency to replace the Delta variant as the dominant strain (11). Currently, four types of COVID-19 vaccines available globally including mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer), AZD1222 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), Janssen Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson & Johnson), etc. (12). Four types of COVID-19 vaccines including BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), WIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), CanSinoBIO (Ad5-nCoV), and CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech) have been approved in China (13). As of September 21, 2021, 2.48 billion people worldwide have completed the whole course of vaccination, of which, the top 3 countries are China, European Union, USA, and China ranked the first at 1,022 million people (14). The effect of vaccination on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially the current predominant strain of Delta variant, has become the focus of global concern. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) primarily refer to effective measures that can be taken to slow the spread of a virus in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine, treatment, or other prophylactic measures (15). Evidence has shown that social distancing, personal hygiene, mask wearing, case isolation, schools and businesses closure, transportation banning, gatherings cancelation, and other NPIs have played an important role in stopping the virus transmission and depressing the peak of the epidemic during the first COVID-19 event in Wuhan, China (15-16). However, the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain has mutated significantly since, raising questions of what are the differences between the variants and whether the NPIs are still effective for the variants, especially the current predominant Delta variant and the emergent Lambda variant. To be prepared in advance and to provide a basis for the control of infection (17), the pathogenicity, prevalence, transmissibility of Delta and Lambda variants, as well as the efficacy of vaccine and NPIs are reviewed in this article.","Wenqing, Bai, Yue, Gu, Haoliang, Liu, Lei, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2021.216","","Database: China CDC Weekly; Publication details: China CDC Weekly; 3(41):863-868, 2021.; Publication details: China CDC Weekly; 3(41):863-868, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20076,""
"Patient Satisfaction With Teleconsultation During Covid-19 Pandemic: A Descriptive Study For Mental Health Care In Malaysia","The recent novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led health care providers to shift rapidly from on-site consultation towards teleconsultation. However, knowledge about patient satisfaction with teleconsultation, particularly for mental health care, is limited and demands further investigation. This study aimed to evaluate patient satisfaction with teleconsultation in mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also aimed to identify the leading contributing factors to patient satisfaction with teleconsultation. A convenience sampling method was employed. An online survey was conducted between June 8 and August 3, 2020. A 14-item questionnaire was used to assess the patient's level of satisfaction in four domains of satisfaction. A total of 106 questionnaires were received. Respondents reported a high level of satisfaction with teleconsultation. The convenience of not having to travel to the health center for consultation was the leading contributing factor to patient satisfaction with teleconsultation. However, patients reported that they were least satisfied with teleconsultation because they could not express their feelings deeply to the provider. The current study provides preliminary evidence that teleconsultation may be a satisfactory mode of communication during the COVID-19 pandemic for mental health care in Malaysia. Most importantly, consultation in mental health care should carry on to be performed remotely to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Future research is warranted to provide a better understanding of other factors contributing to patient satisfaction with teleconsultation and ways to improve them.

"Review of sleep problems related to social distancing and home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic","Since the first outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in December 2019, we have experienced many changes that we have never experienced before. Governments around the world have instituted various forms of social isolation measures to prevent the spread of COV-ID-19. These measures include social distancing, home confinement, quarantine, and lockdown. Unfortunately, these measures have increased the ambiguity of the economic situation and the uncertainty regarding the future. For many individuals, these actions resulted in changes in routines at home, school, and work;changes in roles at home, mental health, and physical activity;and changes in circadian cues. All of these alterations resulted in disruptions in sleep patterns and sleep difficulties. In this paper, the alterations in sleep patterns and the sleep difficulties related to social isolation policies would be reviewed. These include social distancing and home confinement. Finally, methods to improve sleep problems also reviewed. Copyright Â© 2021 Korean Academy of Sleep Medicine","Seo, W.

"Impact of covid-19 pandemic on psychological health of college students in india","Uncertainty arose by the unprecedented spread of COVID-19 throughout the world, imposing a great challenge on students' psychological resilience. The current study aimed to do a nationwide survey on college students to understand the level of mental impact, stress, and anxiety among them amidst the coronavirus outbreak. We prepared a questionnaire packet having three sections viz. demographic information, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and possible stressors to collect the responses of students. Out of 414 responses, 32% of students unveiled mild anxiety symptoms, 16.7% moderate level anxiety, and 12% reported severe level anxiety. Demographic factors like age, marital status, degree and year had no significant impact on the anxiety level, whereas COVID-19 stressors such as the impact on academic activities worry about academic delays, and change in daily routine life had a remarkable positive impact on the anxiety level. Residing in an urban area and relative or acquaintance diagnosed with COVID-19 also noticeably triggered the mental sound health of the students. Our finding suggests that looking at the severity of the forthcoming situation, there is an urgent need to develop psychological interventions as a coping mechanism against anxiety to nurture the mental health of these vulnerable college students.

"A Systematic Review of Library Services Provision in Response to COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective - Libraries have had to temporarily shut their doors because of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the provision of online and remote services. This review analyzed services offered by libraries, the technological tools used, and the challenges facing libraries during the pandemic. Methods - This study employed a systematic literature review, following the PRISMA checklist (Moher at al., 2009). The Building Blocks search strategy was employed to search for keywords of concepts in Library and Information Science Abstract (LISA), Library and Information Science Technology Abstract (LISTA), Library Science Database, Web of Science (WoS) core collections, and Google Scholar. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria was pre-determined by the authors prior to database searching. Quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (Hong et al., 2018). A tabular approach was used to provide a summary of each article allowing the synthesis of results, which led to the identification of eight broad categories of services provided by libraries in included studies. Results - The first set of searches from the 5 databases produced 3,499 results. After we removed duplicates and applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria based on titles and abstracts, 37 potentially relevant articles were identified. Further screening of the full- text led to the final inclusion of 23 articles used for the qualitative synthesis. The majority of the studies were conducted in the United States of America (n= 6, 26.1%), followed by India (n=4, 17%), and China (n=2, 8.7%). The remaining studies were carried out in United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Mexico, Romania, Czech Republic, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe. The most common method used in selected studies was the case study ( n= 11, 48%), followed by survey (n=7, 30.4%), content analysis (n=4, 17.4%), and mixed methods (n=1, 4.3%). The majority of the studies were carried out in academic libraries (74%), while the rest were based on medical, public, and special libraries. Findings show that the majority of academic libraries in the included studies are providing and expanding access to electronic resources (n=16, 69.6%) and increasing open access resources and services (n= 11, 47.8%). More so, most academic libraries are assisting in virtual education and teaching endeavors of faculty and students (n=13, 56.5%). In addition, some medical and public libraries are bolstering public health safety through health literacy (n=12, 52.2%), supporting research efforts, and engaging in virtual reference services, among others. In order to carry out these services, libraries are harnessing several educational, social networking, communication, and makerspaces technologies. Most of the libraries in the included studies reported budgetary challenges, and the need for new ICT infrastructure and Internet service as they move their services online. Conclusion - This review found that libraries are adapting in a number of ways to continue their roles in meeting patrons' needs in spite of the growing challenges posed by COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown. For libraries to thrive in these trying times, there must be a wellstructured approach to ensuring continuity of services. Libraries should prioritize the acquisition of electronic resources as well as increase their efforts to digitize resources that are only available in printed copies. As library services have predominantly shifted online, there should be concerted effort and support from government and funding agencies to equip libraries with the technological facilities needed to provide cutting-edge services. The quality assessment of the included studies shows that there is need for rigor and transparency in the methodological description of studies investigating library services provision in a pandemic. This review provides an overview of the ways libraries have responded to the challenges posed by a global pandemic, and hence will be of use and interest to all librarians especially those in health and academic sectors.","Ayeni, P.

"The relationship between the service type change of community mental health centers and the anxiety levels in schizophrenia patients in the Covid-19 pandemic","Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the service style of Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) and anxiety levels in patients with schizophrenia in the Covid-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six patients with schizophrenia in remission between the ages of 22-68, who regularly attended the Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital TRSM, were included in the study. A form was used to evaluate the sociodemographic characteristics of the patients. The Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which were applied to the patients before the pandemic, were administered for the second time during the period when the post-pandemic interviews were minimized, and administered for the third time, when regular face-to-face meetings resumed. Results: The highest STAI scores were found in the second interview and the lowest in the first interview. The scores in all 3 interviews are statistically significantly different from each other. Although the CGI values seem to be statistically significantly different from each other in all 3 interviews;this difference was not found statistically significant in post-hoc analysis. Conclusion: The results we have obtained from our study show that the Covid-19 pandemic may have negative effects on the psychological state of schizophrenia patients, and community mental health services can contribute to reducing this effect.","Tozoglu, E.

"The impact and contribution of family in the care of hospitalized patients","The role of family, relatives and friends is vital to maintaining the quality of life of hospitalized patients. During hospitalization, constant interaction between family and nurses is necessary to achieve comprehensive care.1 The family greatly helps to reduce the stress caused by disease and hospitalization.2 The closest ones guide the patient to effectively cope with all complications of the disease and participate in self-help activities.3 Some of the activities that a family can carry out during hospitalization are communication, psychological and emotional support, encouragement, patient representation and information on topics related to it, participation in planning, cooperation during the therapeutic process and participation in providing care such as meal assistance, body massage, individual hygiene, etc.4 One of the major problems that significantly affects psychological status during a coronavirus pandemic is the ban on visiting hospitalized patients. While there is no doubt that such restrictions are designed to reduce the spread of the virus, they pose a threat to the family community. The family cares more and more for their loved ones, there is a fear of loneliness, sadness, and the possibility of losing motivation.5 Family involvement in the care of hospitalized patients is of great importance. The presence of families and regular communication of health professionals with patients and their families should become part of regular care. Family participation in the hospital will be effective if the family is informed of the patientâ€™s condition and adequately educated by the medical staff to provide effective psychological support to loved ones. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Uloga obitelji, rodbine i prijatelja od vitalne je vaÅ¾nosti za odrÅ¾avanje kvalitete Å¾ivota hospitaliziranih bolesnika. Tijekom hospitalizacije nuÅ¾na je stalna interakcija izmedu obitelji i medicinskih sestara, radi postizanja cjelovite skrbi.1 Obitelj u velikoj mjeri pomaÅ¾e u smanjenju stresa uzrokovanog bolesti i hospitalizacijom.2 NajbliÅ¾i usmjeravaju bolesnika kako bi se ucinkovito suocio sa svim komplikacijama bolesti te sudjelovao u aktivnostima samopomoci.3 Neke od aktivnosti koje obitelj moÅ¾e provoditi tijekom hospitalizacije jesu odrÅ¾avanje komunikacije, psiholoÅ¡ka i emocionalna podrÅ¡ka, poticaj, zastupanje bolesnika i informiranje o temama koje ga se ticu, sudjelovanje u planiranju, suradnja tijekom terapijskog procesa te sudjelovanje u pruÅ¾anju brige poput pomoci tijekom obroka, masaÅ¾a tijela, individualna higijena i dr.4 Jedan od velikih problema koji tijekom pandemije koronavirusa znatno utjece na psihu je zabrana posjeta hospitaliziranim bolesnicima. Iako nema sumnje da su takva ogranicenja osmiÅ¡ljena kako bi se smanjilo Å¡irenje virusa, ona predstavljaju prijetnju obiteljskoj zajednici. Obitelj sve viÅ¡e brine za svoje bliÅ¾nje, dolazi do straha od usamljenosti, tuge i mogucnosti gubitka motivacije.5 Sudjelovanje obitelji u skrbi za hospitalizirane bolesnike od velike je vaÅ¾nosti. Prisutnost obitelji te redovita komunikacija zdravstvenih djelatnika s bolesnicima i njihovim obiteljima trebaju postati dio redovne skrbi. Sudjelovanje obitelji u bolnici bit ce ucinkovito ako je obitelj obavijeÅ¡tena o stanju bolesnika i odgovarajuce educirana od strane medicinskog osoblja kako bi bliÅ¾njima pruÅ¾ili ucinkovitu psiholoÅ¡ku podrÅ¡ku.

"Quarantine COVID-19 compliance in families with an allergic and immunological diseased child and its psychological impact in KSA","Background: With the onset of the spread of the Coronavirus around the world, the Saudi Ministry of Health has taken protective measures early to prevent the spread of the disease in the region, and the most effective of these measures is Quarantine and home isolation, which can have an impact on the individual's mental health. The purpose of this study is to assess the compliance of Quarantine in a family with an allergic and immunologically diseased child and its psychological impact on them. Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted between June-August 2020 was conducted via a selfreported online questionnaire that includes fear of COVID-19 scale for parents, Revised children's anxiety and depression scale to assess Quarantine's psychological effect, fear of getting the infection and also to know the family's attitude towards COVID-19 and public health measures. Results: This study included 4,436 participants, and the findings revealed that (13.3%) of participants had a child with allergies or immune diseases, (30.2%) had children between 6-10 years of age, the mean fear score was 18.74 Â± 6.48 (7-35) which is nearly moderate;the mean values of the Child Anxiety and Depression Sub-Scale for Parents (RCADS) were 4.81 5.61 and 18.74 Â± 6.48, respectively. This study showed a highly statistically significant positive relationship between the mean values for fear of COVID-19 Score scale and mean scores for child anxiety and depression (P = &lt;0.001), and also showed that 73.8% of the families thought that quarantine is a necessary action that should continue until the end of the Pandemic. Conclusion: The Quarantine impacted psychologically and financially on some parents. Children are also more vulnerable to psychological effects resulting from the commitment of families to Quarantine, so we see that special attention and care is needed to prevent these effects on them, especially children with allergic or immune diseases.

"The Fear of Covid-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in Spain: Adaptation and Confirmatory Evidence of Construct and Concurrent Validity","Fear of the coronavirus has important implications on mental health. In western countries, a significant degree of vaccination has been achieved, but in Spain, less than 75% of the population has received both doses. The current situation is still seen as a threat by many people. Therefore, it is important to have reliable and valid measurement instruments to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the population. In this study, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale has been adapted to Spain, and its psychometric properties have been studied in a Spanish sample using Structural Equation Modeling. This methodology allows obtaining more reliable estimates, regardless of the measurement scale of the variables. The unifactorial structure was confirmed. The correlations with Neuroticism were statistically significant, and the concurrent validity structural equation model yielded good fit indices. However, neither age nor belonging to a risk group directly predict fear of the coronavirus in this sample, but gender and neuroticism are direct predictors. Likewise, neuroticism mediates the relationship between age and fear of COVID-19, and between gender and fear of COVID-19. So being young and being a woman show high scores on neuroticism, leading to their most intense fear of COVID-19. With this reliable and valid measurement instrument, it will be possible to assess the degree of fear of the coronavirus in the Spanish population and improve psychological interventions.","Espejo, BegoÃ±a, Checa, Irene","https://doi.org/10.3390/math9192512","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Mathematics; 9(19):2512, 2021.; Publication details: Mathematics; 9(19):2512, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20087,""
"A Test Platform for Managing School Stress Using a Virtual Reality Group Chatbot Counseling System","Student life causes many sources of stress due to the requirements of managing schoolwork, family, friends, health and wellbeing, and future career planning. Some students are overwhelmed and lack resilience to overcome stress, especially if they are inexperienced in managing setbacks, fail to achieve expectations, or lack skills to independently manage social skills, recreation, and study time. The long-term accumulation of stress has a negative impact on studentsâ€™ physical and mental health, and may lead to a range of symptoms such as depression, anxiety, headache, insomnia, and eating disorders. Although most universities provide psychological counseling services, there is often a shortage of professional psychologists, which leads to students suffering from stress for longer than necessary without immediate assistance. The build-up of stress can lead to tragic consequences including abnormal reasoning, anti-social behavior, and suicide. There should never be a need for a student to wait more than a month to make an appointment for counseling services and every request for help should be immediately addressed and assessed. In this research, we designed a unique test platform for an immersive virtual reality group chatbot counseling system so students can receive psychological help and stress management counseling anytime and anywhere. First, the research used questionnaires to measure the stress levels and identifies how stress affects their lives. An immersive virtual reality chatbot was developed using professional psychological counseling knowledge that can provide answers during individual or group counseling sessions. Students can log in to the platform as avatars and ask the chatbot questions or interact with other students on the platform. This research provides college students with a new technology-based counseling environment designed to help relieve stress and learn new ways to improve student life quality from others. The platform provides a test base for future clinical trials to evaluate and improve the automated virtual reality chatbot counseling system.","Lin, Aislyn P.

In particular, the study analyses how COVID-19 affects the lives of the transgender community in terms of their interaction with the government policymaking and identity negotiation, livelihoods, access to health resources, availability of gender transition services and status of mental health. The analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic and the government strategies to curb the spread of infection have exacerbated the challenges faced by the transgender community in India and threatened their survival. As disease outbreaks traditionally perpetuate gender inequities and increase vulnerabilities borne by marginalised groups, the analysis has implications for purposefully creating appropriate platforms for participation of the transgender community and designing and delivering suitable programs and services to enhance their welling and human dignity.","Dasgupta, Satarupa, Sinha, Sunny, Roy, Raina","https://doi.org/10.1177/25166026211050743","","Database: Sage; Publication details: The International Journal of Community and Social Development;: 25166026211050743, 2021.; Publication details: The International Journal of Community and Social Development;: 25166026211050743, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20090,""

This article uses longitudinal panel data from Germany (N = 625) to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affects emerging adults? mental health and life satisfaction. Specifically, we investigate risk and protective factors for within-person changes in life satisfaction and mental health using change score models. Our analysis reveals three main findings. First, we find a significant decline in emerging adults? life satisfaction and mental health compared to pre-pandemic levels. Second, results show heterogeneity in life satisfaction and mental health trajectories. Third, limited peer contacts, financial strain, and returning to the parental home act as risk factors for longitudinal changes. Social integration, having an intimate partner, and self-efficacy act as protective factors.

"The Impact of COVID-19 Disruptions and Perceived Discrimination on Well-Being and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms: Testing the Moderating Role of Exercise Among African American and Asian American Emerging Adults","The current study tested whether COVID-19 disruptions and perceived discrimination were related to mental health (i.e., posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms and emotional, psychological, and social well-being), and whether exercise moderated relations. Additionally, we tested whether findings varied by ethnicity/race. Participants were 368 African American and Asian American emerging adults (Mage = 19.92, SD = .34). Findings did not vary by ethnicity/race. COVID-19 disruptions predicted poorer emotional, psychological, and social well-being, and more PTSD symptoms. Discrimination predicted more PTSD symptoms. Exercise was associated with better emotional, psychological, and social well-being, and moderated the relation between COVID-19 disruptions and emotional well-being. At low levels of exercise, COVID-19 disruptions predicted poorer emotional well-being, but this relation was not significant at high levels of exercise. Findings highlight that discrimination and disruptions during the pandemic negatively affect African American and Asian American emerging adults? mental health, but that exercise plays an important protective role.","Williams, Chelsea Derlan, Hood, Kristina B.; Moreno, Oswaldo, Chartier, Karen G.; Johnson, Kaprea F.; Townsend, Tiffany G.; Kuo, Sally I.

"A primary care approach to paediatric mental health disorders in Ireland","To review the literature of increasing mental health issues and waiting times for treatment in the paediatric population To establish the most useful resources for preventing and treating mental health issues To create a toolkit that can be used to improve mental health in children The enforced isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in mental health issues and severity of presentations to emergency departments. Prolonged waiting times for referral to psychiatry and psychology services have resulted in regression and many children are left untreated. We proposed the creation of a â€˜Happiness Toolkitâ€™ that can be given to children upon presentation to their primary care provider with a mental health issue. A literature review revealed six key resources that have been proven to boost self-esteem, develop resilience and promote positive mental health practices. This resource would provide immediate treatment to those children who would otherwise be forced to endure long waiting periods for referral. A leaflet detailing the practices along with a physical â€˜boxâ€™ that the children must make were created.A trial period of the resource took place in Mullingar Regional Hospital, Ireland, with a marked improvement in outcomes. Children reattending for clinic reported increased happiness and an unforeseen two-and-three-generational benefit was also observed as parents, grandparents and caregivers alike took part in the â€˜Happiness Toolkitâ€™ activities.Although children presenting with severe mental health issues are treated immediately, those with mild to moderate conditions are placed onto waiting lists and may have to wait over a year and a half to be seen by a specialist. Our toolkit allows children and their families to engage in positive mental health practices that can not only prevent regression during this waiting period, but also lead to improved mental health or cessation of symptoms. This resource, provided free to children and parents, can play a vital role in preventing increased mental health presentations as a result of the pandemic.","Power, Edmond, Sharif, Farhana","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-europaediatrics.76","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 2):A32-A33, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 2):A32-A33, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20094,""
"â€˜We are unlikely to return to the same world, and I do not want it to destroy my futureâ€™ Young people's worries through the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic","Abstract This study aims to explore what worries youth were having during the seventh to ninth week of the COVID-19 lockdown. Our findings build on the responses to an open-ended survey question from 1314 youths. The worries covered three main themes: ?That my mom dies, then I am left all alone?: worries related to COVID-19 virus infection;?To me, this is lost youth?: worries about the consequences of measures for the present life and near future;and ?I will face a very difficult life in the future?: worries about the consequences of measures for the outlook on life. Young people worried that the measures would have a huge impact on their present life and outlook on life. The costs of restriction measures were unevenly distributed and indicated that the measures affected their mental health. Listening to youth voices during the pandemic is important for practitioners, educators and policymakers. The results indicate that the threshold for closing schools also including the provision of distance learning should be kept high. Social and health services for youth should offer early intervention and be prepared for an escalation in mental health problems in the imminent future.","BjÃ¸rknes, Ragnhild, Sandal, Gro Mjeldheim, MÃ¦land, Silje, Haug, Ellen, Lehmann, Stine","https://doi.org/10.1111/cfs.12878","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Child & Family Social Work; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Child & Family Social Work; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20095,""
"Prediction of Emotional Tendency of COVID-19 Speech Based on Pre-training Model","In 2020, the World Health Organization confirmed the new coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic infectious disease. This virus affects the lives of tens of millions of people. Many countries have adopted compulsory measures to require residents to work and live at home and avoid unnecessary contact with the outside world. During this period, people expressed their feelings about the epidemic through various online platforms. In this article, we conducted an effective sentiment analysis on Weibo. These Weibo data are from January 1, 2020 to February 20, 2020, all related to COVID-19. The sentiment analysis of epidemic speech is to analyze people's views on COVID-19 during the epidemic.

"Tree-based Ensemble Learning for Stress Detection by Typing Behavior on Smartphones","Stress is an emotional feeling that arises in a person in response to unpleasant external pressures or demands. Stress can be obtained from environmental, work, academic, economic, and other problems. The COVID-19 pandemic, which is changing people's lifestyles, has a major impact on people's mental health. The experiments used 1522 respondents that related to stress problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic from the Indonesian Association of Mental Medicine Specialists (PSDKJI), the prevalence reached 64.3%. There are many different ways to detect stress, but most of them require special tools to identify it. This paper presents a prediction based on machine learning for identifying the stress levels by typing behavior data on a smartphone keyboard. This study uses tree-based ensemble learning to make predictions. Based on the experimental results, the Random Forest model produces the best accuracy with a value of 94.77%. The most influential feature of the model is the standard deviation feature of the gravity sensor on the Z-axis.

"Consultant psychiatrists' experience of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health services","OBJECTIVES: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide threatening human health. To reduce transmission, a 'lockdown' was introduced in Ireland between March and May 2020. The aim of this study is to capture the experiences of consultant psychiatrists during lockdown and their perception of it's impact on mental health services. METHODS: A questionnaire designed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists was adapted and circulated to consultant members of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland following the easing of restrictions. The questionnaire assessed the perceived impact on referral rates, mental health act provision, availability of information technology (IT), consultant well-being and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Thematic analysis was employed to analyse free-text sections. RESULTS: Response rate was 32% (n = 197/623). Consultants reported an initial decrease/significant decrease in referrals in the first month of lockdown (68%, n = 95/140) followed by an increase/significant increase in the second month for both new (83%, n = 100/137) and previously attending patients (65%, n = 88/136). Social isolation and reduced face-to-face mental health supports were among the main reasons identified. The needs of children and older adults were highlighted. Most consultants (76%, n = 98/129) felt their working day was affected and their well-being reduced (52%, n = 61/119). The majority felt IT equipment availability was inadequate (67%, n = 88/132). Main themes identified from free-text sections were service management, relationship between patients and healthcare service and effects on consultants' lives. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed increased pressure on service provision and consultant wellness. This further supports the longstanding need to increase mental health service investment.","Kelleher, E; Geary, E H; Tawfik, M; NÃ­ Mhuircheartaigh, E; Gavin, B; Wall, M; Lyne, J P; Doherty, A M; McNicholas, F","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2021.41","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ir J Psychol Med;: 1-13, 2021 Apr 29.; Publication details: Ir J Psychol Med;: 1-13, 2021 Apr 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20103,""
"Response of tertiary addictions services to opioid dependence during the COVID-19 pandemic","The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has presented the addiction services with an unprecedented set of challenges. Opioid users are particularly vulnerable because of their high level of pre-existing health problems and lifestyle factors. In order to minimise their risks to self and to others in the current Covid-19 crisis, addiction services sought to urgently identify vulnerable individuals, and induct them into opioid substitution treatment (OST) promptly. Additionally, several guidelines were created and regularly updated by the health and safety executive (HSE) for any healthcare staff working with opioid users. These include guidance documents, to facilitate prompt induction of patients onto the OST programme, the prescribing of naloxone to all patients at risk of overdose, eConsultation, medication management for those in self-isolation, and the delivery of injecting equipment. The guidance documents and resources will provide a template for a new way of working for the sector during these challenging times and into the future.","Hennigan, K; Corrigan, N; Killeen, N; Scully, M; Keenan, E","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2021.8","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ir J Psychol Med;: 1-6, 2021 Feb 04.; Publication details: Ir J Psychol Med;: 1-6, 2021 Feb 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20104,""
"Frequency and characteristics of advanced cancer patients with COVID + ve status among inpatient supportive care consults during the pandemic: experience from a tertiary cancer center","PURPOSE: There is limited literature available regards the frequency and characteristics of COVID-19 + ve status among advanced cancer patients referred to an inpatient supportive care consultation(PC) at a tertiary cancer center. Our study aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of COVID-19 + ve cancer patients seen by PC. METHODS: Advanced cancer patients seen as a consult by PC between June 15 and September 25, 2020, at MD Anderson Cancer Center were eligible for the study. We evaluated the patient demographics, clinical characteristics including symptoms(ESAS), delirium(MDAS), COVID + status prior to, and after PC referral(converters), and type of PC delivery(in person or virtual care). RESULTS: Sixty-six out of 1380 (4.8%) PC consults were COVID-19 + ve: 42 prior to PC (79%), and 14 (21%) were COVID-19 + ve after the PC (converters). COVID-19 + PC patients had lower depression (P = .035), spiritual distress (P = .003), and were more seen frequently virtually (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between COVID-19-ve patients and converters. Converters had higher symptom distress (P = 0.007), lower delirium (P = 0.014), and were referred earlier (P = .011) compared to COVID + PC patients diagnosed prior to PC consult. Overall, patients seen virtually compared in-person by PC were younger (P = 0.02) and had lower delirium (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: The burden of COVID-19 + status among patients referred to PC was low. COVID-19 + ve patients had more frequent virtual visits, lower depression, and spiritual distress scores. Patient seen virtually were significantly younger and had lower delirium. During a new pandemic, universal virtual care might be emphasized especially at initial encounters after admission and further research is needed on the potential efficacy of this intervention.","Yennurajalingam, Sriram; Lu, Zhanni; Chen, Minxing; Bruera, Eduardo","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06525-x","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Support Care Cancer;2021 Oct 12.; Publication details: Support Care Cancer;2021 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20105,""
"[Transgender health and healthcare during the COVIDÂ­19 pandemic: aÂ cross-sectional online survey in German-speaking countries]; Gesundheit und Gesundheitsversorgung von trans Personen wÃ¤hrend der COVIDÂ­19-Pandemie: Eine Online-Querschnittstudie in deutschsprachigen LÃ¤ndern","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Since spring of 2020, the COVIDÂ­19 pandemic has disrupted our day-to-day lives and led to negative consequences in various areas of life, including mental and physical wellbeing. In this article, we take aÂ closer look at the situation of trans people, who - due to experiences with discrimination and marginalization as well as their specific health-related interests - could be characterized by aÂ particular vulnerability. METHODS: Using an online cross-sectional survey, which we designed collaboratively with experts from the trans community, we investigated the mental and physical health of trans people from German-speaking countries and their access to trans-related healthcare during the COVIDÂ­19 pandemic in the period from 1 May 2020 to 31 JanuaryÂ 2021. RESULTS: Since the beginning of the COVIDÂ­19 pandemic, trans people have experienced barriers in access to gender-affirming treatments, mental health services, and COVIDÂ­19-related medical care. At the same time, trans people reported being affected by chronic diseases disproportionately more often than the general population, including those leading to aÂ higher risk for poorer outcomes of aÂ COVIDÂ­19 infection. Moreover, the participants reported being exposed to many risk factors associated with higher mental distress (e.g., having aÂ chronic illness, belonging to aÂ minority based on aÂ non-heterosexual orientation, or having aÂ low income). DISCUSSION: The results of this survey indicate that prior vulnerabilities with regards to health problems and the restricted access to an informed and qualified transgender healthcare were exacerbated by the COVIDÂ­19 pandemic.","SzÃ¼cs, Daria; KÃ¶hler, Andreas; Holthaus, Mika M; GÃ¼ldenring, Annette; Balk, Lena; Motmans, Joz; Nieder, Timo O","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00103-021-03432-8","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz;64(11): 1452-1462, 2021 Nov.; Publication details: Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz;64(11): 1452-1462, 2021 Nov.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20106,""
"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on brain metabolism","This study aims to evaluate the impact of French national lockdown of 55 days on brain metabolism of patients with neurological disorders. Whole-brain voxel-based PET analysis was used to correlate 18 F-FDG metabolism to the number of days after March 17, 2020 (in 95 patients; mean age: 54.3 years Â± 15.7; 59 men), in comparison to the same period in 2019 before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (in 212 patients; mean age: 59.5 years Â± 15.8; 114 men), and to the first 55 days of deconfinement (in 188 patients; mean age: 57.5 years Â± 16.5; 93 men). Lockdown duration was negatively correlated to the metabolism of the sensory-motor cortex with a prevailing effect on the left dominant pyramidal tract and on younger patients, also including the left amygdala, with only partial reversibility after 55 days of deconfinement. Weak overlap was found with the reported pattern of hypometabolism in long COVID (<9%). Restriction of physical activities, and possible related deconditioning, and social isolation may lead to functional disturbances of sensorimotor and emotional brain networks. Of note, this metabolic pattern seems distinct to those reported in long COVID. Further longitudinal studies with longer follow-up are needed to evaluate clinical consequences and relationships on cognitive and mental health against functional deactivation hypothesis, and to extend these findings to healthy subjects in the context of lockdown.","Guedj, Eric; Campion, Jacques-Yves; Horowitz, Tatiana; Barthelemy, Fanny; Cammilleri, Serge; Ceccaldi, Mathieu","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25673","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Hum Brain Mapp;2021 Oct 12.; Publication details: Hum Brain Mapp;2021 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20107,""
"Structural Relationship between Korean Adolescent's Sports Participation, Optimism, Pessimism, Self-Regulation, and Coronavirus-Related Stress in the Pandemic Situation","This study aimed to examine the relationships between sports participation, optimism/pessimism, self-regulation, and coronavirus-related stress in Korean adolescents during the pandemic situation. Specifically, we attempted to offer valuable information that could help to alleviate coronavirus-related stress in adolescents by promoting participation in sports and the development of optimism and self-regulation. To achieve this aim, we conducted an online survey of 836 Korean adolescents in the pilot and main studies. Confirmatory factor, frequency, path, reliability, descriptive statistical, and multimedia analyses were performed. Our findings indicated several differences for each variable according to demographic characteristics. Sports participation exerted a positive effect on optimism (p < 0.001) and self-regulation (p < 0.01) and negative effects on coronavirus-related stress (p < 0.05) and pessimism (p < 0.001). In addition, optimism exerted a positive effect on self-regulation (p < 0.001) and a negative effect on coronavirus-related stress (p < 0.001), while pessimism exerted a negative effect on self-regulation (p < 0.01) and a positive effect on coronavirus-related stress (p < 0.001). Further analysis indicated that self-regulation had a negative effect on coronavirus-related stress (p < 0.05). These findings highlight the need for youth educational institutions to encourage adolescents to participate in sports and for organizing bodies to suggest various policies and provide education that can assist them in properly coping with and overcoming coronavirus-related stress by strengthening their optimistic attitude and self-regulation ability.","Song, Ho-Hyun; Lee, Dae-Jung","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010645","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(20)2021 10 11.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(20)2021 10 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20108,""

"Sleep disorders in emergencies and disasters","Sleep disorders are common in the population and are major cause of morbidity. The objective of this review is to assess sleep disturbances in times of emergency and disasters. Throughout history, the biopsychosocial field and sleep have been affected by multiple large-scale events, such as natural disasters, man-caused tragedies, armed conflicts, social crises and pandemics, the experience of which can lead to short, medium and / or long term health problems. In several studies, the negative impact of emergencies and disasters on sleep have been analyzed, emphasizing the importance of the diffusion and promotion of measures that encourage good sleep. The arrival of COVID-19 and consequent home confinement for prolonged periods caused important social consequences. Certain occupational factors and characteristics of disasters are associated with greater comorbidity: a high risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, psychological disorders and insomnia, especially in highly vulnerable groups, such as health professionals, rescuers and first aids-responders. Insomnia is the most frequent sleep disorder in the general population and its worsening in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, represents a new public health problem. It is essential to promote physical and mental health prevention campaigns, aimed at early screening and management of pathologies in the psychosocial sphere, within socioeconomic possibilities.","Molt, F.; Torres, P.; Flores, V.; Valladares, C.; Ibanez, J.

"The Efficacy of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention for College Students Under Extremely Stressful Conditions","&lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt; This study evaluates the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI), called Koru mindfulness, among college students. &lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt; Undergraduate students (N = 34) participated in a 4-week mindfulness curriculum embedded within a college course, while a control group (N = 35) taking a different course did not. Notably, the intervention coincided with the start of a state-wide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt; Despite the additional external stress, there was a significant main effect and a significant interaction between the intervention and time for state mindfulness, (the treatment group experienced increased state mindfulness). There was a significant main effect (higher for the control group) on coronavirus worry and a significant interaction between the intervention and time for perceived stress, with the treatment/control group experiencing decreased/increased stress over time. There was also a significant interaction between the intervention and time for sleep problems with the intervention group experiencing declines in sleep problems over time and also being more likely to experience optimal amounts of sleep over time. &lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt; The Koru intervention effectively increased state mindfulness, decreased stress, and improved sleep, suggesting that it is robust even under extremely stressful conditions.

"Determining the Optimal Duration of a Single Lecture in Distance Education Using Facial Analysis of Instructors","The COVID-19 Pandemic, which has affected the entire world profoundly, has given rise to changes in many areas. The change in the education system appears as a compulsory transition to distance education, which raises the question as to how long the lectures in distance education should last. This study examined the emotional changes of the instructors who teach in the distance education environment by analyzing their faces with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Through the software developed by the researchers, the emotions of the instructors were evaluated in terms of feelings of disgust, sadness, happiness, fear, contempt, anger, and surprise. For evaluation, 53,923 photographs were obtained from 149.8 hours of videos recorded in 288 sessions of 29 different courses provided by 9 instructors and 47,883 of them were analyzed. Based on the changes in emotions, the optimum lecture time in the distance education environment was examined. In addition, the study determined the effects of instructors, courses, programs, weeks of the course, students' attendance, lecture type, session information on emotional changes. The study revealed that instructors' negative emotions generally increased between the 11th and 20th minutes, whereas the negative emotions of the instructors who preferred to have a longer session decreased after the 25th and 35th minutes. The study revealed that all of the emotions mentioned varied according to instructors, courses and programs that some emotions differed significantly according to students' attendance and lecture type, and that week of the course and session information did not cause any emotional changes.","Ã–zkara, BetÃ¼l Ã–zaydin","https://www.google.com/search?q=Determining+the+Optimal+Duration+of+a+Single+Lecture+in+Distance+Education+Using+Facial+Analysis+of+Instructors","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology - TOJET; 20(2):35-43, 2021.; Publication details: Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology - TOJET; 20(2):35-43, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20136,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the Learning Processes of Typically Developing and Special Needs Students in Pakistan","Due to the quick spread of the COVID-19 disease, education institutions across the world had to be closed, and there was an overnight shift to online distance teaching and learning. Majority of the teachers in Pakistan are used to the traditional way of face-to-face teaching and online teaching came as a challenge. Like most of the countries, Pakistan too was not prepared for the sudden shift from face-to-face to online distance learning. Although COVID-19 impacts almost everyone in society, students with disabilities, both physical and mental, are one of the most vulnerable groups due to the restrictions in their activities. Furthermore, studying online devoid of the human touch has induced mental stress among these students. Hence this study focused on the online teaching and learning processes in Pakistan, its challenges and modern pedagogies for emergency situations particularly mental health for students with and without learning disabilities, teachers. The study includes some suggestions for the target group to cope with the sudden catastrophe of COVID-19.","Nasir, Shazia, Hameed, Mehwish","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+on+the+Learning+Processes+of+Typically+Developing+and+Special+Needs+Students+in+Pakistan","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Asian Journal of University Education; 17(3):67-75, 2021.; Publication details: Asian Journal of University Education; 17(3):67-75, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20137,""
"Association between Students' Inattentiveness to Study and Their Psychological Conditions during the COVID-19 Pandemic","While the COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on the state of mental health of the individuals, no attention has been paid so far in the academia whether there is an association between students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the study was intended to find out the association between students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions during this pandemic. Primary data for this study were collected from a total of 157 samples chosen from the undergraduate students of 18 academic departments of the Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh on the basis of snowball sampling. The study reveals that most of the respondents were much inattentive to study during the COVID-19 pandemic and they were much anxious, depressed, tensed, restless, bored and frightened, and thereby their mental health and well-being were affected. The study shows that there is a strong positive association between the students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions which involve anxiety, depression, tension, restlessness, boredom and fear/panic. The study indicates that the association between the students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions is statistically significant. Finally, the study suggests that the Government and the authority concerned should undertake proper measures to mitigate the adverse psychological conditions of the NSTU students by means of motivations and psychosocial counselling, and thereby keeping up their attentiveness to study during the pandemic or any other critical situation. As such, there is a crying need for establishing a psychosocial counselling centre or an educational counselling centre in all universities of Bangladesh including the NSTU.","Muniruzzaman, Md, Siddiky, Md Roknuzzaman","https://www.google.com/search?q=Association+between+Students'+Inattentiveness+to+Study+and+Their+Psychological+Conditions+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Asian Journal of University Education; 17(2):27-38, 2021.; Publication details: Asian Journal of University Education; 17(2):27-38, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20138,""
"Distance Lectures in University Studies: Advantages, Disadvantages, Improvement","Distance learning is not a new subject in university study practice. It is clear that a significant number of universities practiced this way of learning before the pandemic. In the case of distance learning, the emphasis is always not so much on the means used for teaching and learning, as on the very fact of the physical separation of the lecturer and the student. There is a reasonable concern about the quality of studies, their efficiency, the quality of the qualifications acquired by future specialists, etc. The new context creates the need to analyse and assess the distance learning situation that arose during the pandemic. In January-February 2021, a qualitative study was conducted, in which 158 students from three Lithuanian universities participated. Most of the respondents were students of social and humanitarian study programmes. Qualitative data obtained on the basis of open-ended questions were analysed using the method of quantitative content analysis, i.e., semantic subcategories and categories according to four main variables were distinguished: advantages of distance lectures, disadvantages of distance lectures, and distance lecture improvement. It has been established that the main advantages are the convenience of studying and the flexibility of the study process. Meanwhile, the most obvious shortcomings are deterioration of physical and mental health and non-realisation of social needs, deterioration of the quality of academic activities. Improving the design of lectures and improving their planning and organisation are considered the key areas of improvement.","Lamanauskas, Vincentas, Makarskaite-Petkeviciene, Rita","https://www.google.com/search?q=Distance+Lectures+in+University+Studies:+Advantages,+Disadvantages,+Improvement","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Contemporary Educational Technology; 13(3), 2021.; Publication details: Contemporary Educational Technology; 13(3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20139,""
"The promotion of physical activity and health-related factors during pandemic for children and adolescents: A review article","Background: Regularly performed physical activity promote proper development and prevent health risk factors in children and adolescents. Pandemic crisis has been limiting the scope of movement with social distancing for participation of physical activity for health promotion. This study aimed to review studies on promoting physical activity to prevent health risks for children and adolescents since the onset of COVID-19. Methods: Three major online databases (PubMed, Medline, and Scopus) were searched for â€˜physical activity,â€™ â€˜interventionâ€™ for children and adolescents. Seven articles were selected from 1,761 articles through the inclusion and exclusion processes. Results: All studies were conducted through online. One study showed that streaming services and online apps majorly promoted MVPA (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity), MSE (muscle-strengthening exercise), or combined (MVPA, MSE) by 2.4, 3.1, and 4.3 folds, respectively. Another study showed that greater duration of physical activity (PA) prevented depressive symptoms during exposure to outbreak. Five intervention studies which used digital platforms to promote PA significantly encouraged PA along with the physiological, psycho-social, and academic achievement outcomes. Conclusion: Internet-based digital platforms may assist to promote physical activity for improved psychosocial and academic achievement in children and adolescents during the untack period. Structured PA promotion platforms with various health outcomes for children and adolescents should be developed and scientifically evaluated.

"Assessing the impact of outdoor activities on mental wellbeing;focusing on the walking path in urban area","Background: Provided that COVID-19 pandemic has led to mental wellbeing disorders for city dwellers, and given that there is a significant association between outdoor activities and mental health, this paper investigated how the frequency of walking during the pandemic contributes to the immediate and subsequent â€˜moodâ€™. Methods: A longitudinal data collection method was adopted to verify the â€˜moodâ€™ of the participants before and after walking. The survey was conducted with 100 participants in a walking path in Shiraz, Iran, on Jan 2021. The quantitative analysis methods were performed in SPSS to examine the mental wellbeing outcomes of walking in the outdoor walking path when considering the psychological impacts of the pandemic and the quan-tity. Results: The result affirms the positive contribution of walking in the improvement of mental-wellbeing-mood during the pandemic;though, such a mood boost is in a direct relationship with the quantity of the activity with-in a week. Moreover, other factors can play a significant role, including the â€˜mood before walkingâ€™, and the age of the participants. Conclusion: It is likely that encouraging people to consider walking as their routine activity can lead to several positive consequences on mental wellbeing since walking as a basic outdoor activity during the pandemic can contribute on the mood. .

"Computer Adaptive Language Testing According to NATO STANAG 6001 Requirements","The article deals with the innovative, cutting age solution within the language testing realm, namely computer adaptive language testing (CALT) in accordance with the NATO Standardization Agreement 6001 (NATO STANAG 6001) requirements for further implementation in foreign language training of personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AF of Ukraine) in order to increase the quality of foreign language testing. The research provides the CALT method developed according to NATO STANAG 6001 requirements and the CALT algorithm that contains three blocks: ""Starting point"", ""Item selection algorithm"", ""Scoring algorithm"" and ""Termination criterion"". The CALT algorithm has an adaptive ability, changing a complexity level, sequence and the number of items according to the answers of a test taker. The comparative analysis of the results of the CALT method piloting and the paper-and-pencil testing (PPT) in reading and listening according to the NATO STANAG 6001 requirements justifies the effectiveness of the three-level CALT method. It allows us to determine the following important benefits of CALT: test length reduction, control of measurement accuracy, objective assessment, improved test security, generation of a unique set of items, adaptive ability of the CALT algorithm, high motivation of the test takers, immediate score reporting and test results management. CALT is a qualitative and effective tool to determine test takers' foreign language proficiency level in accordance with NATO STANAG 6001 requirements within the NATO Defence Educational Enhancement Programme.

"A Peer-Observation Initiative to Enhance Student Engagement in the Synchronous Virtual Classroom: A Case Study of a COVID-19 Mandated Move to Online Learning","The global COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid shift to online delivery in higher education. This learning and teaching environment is associated with reduced student engagement, a crucial prerequisite of student satisfaction, retention and success. This paper presents a case study that explored student engagement in the synchronous virtual learning environment, during the mandatory move to exclusive online learning in Australian higher education in April to June 2020. Three university instructors used the Teaching and Learning Circles Model to observe a series of their peers' synchronous virtual classrooms, from which they reflected on ways to enhance their own practice. The findings demonstrate how student engagement in these classrooms can be strengthened across the four constructs of Kahu and Nelson's (2018) engagement conceptual framework: belonging;emotional response;wellbeing and self-efficacy. The case study also reveals limitations of the synchronous virtual environment as a means of supporting student engagement in the online learning and teaching environment, and proposes ways to address them. Against emerging reports of increased mental health issues among isolated university students during the current pandemic, the case study's recommendations to improve student wellbeing and belonging are particularly salient. This article also highlights the usefulness of the Teaching and Learning Circles Model of peer observation as a way to guide its participants' reflections on their own practice, support their collegiality with academic peers and build their confidence and competence in the synchronous virtual learning environment.","Andrew, Lesley, Wallace, Ruth, Sambell, Ros","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Peer-Observation+Initiative+to+Enhance+Student+Engagement+in+the+Synchronous+Virtual+Classroom:+A+Case+Study+of+a+COVID-19+Mandated+Move+to+Online+Learning","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice; 18(4), 2021.; Publication details: Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice; 18(4), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20146,""

"Resilience and mental health in children and adolescents: an update of the recent literature and future directions","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In order to promote optimal development of children and adolescents at risk for psychiatric disorders, a better understanding of the concept resilience is crucial. Here, we provide an overview of recent work on clinical and epidemiological correlates of resilience and mental health in children and adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: Our systematic literature search revealed 25 studies that unanimously show that higher levels of resilience are related to fewer mental health problems, despite the heterogeneity of study populations and instruments. Correlates of resilience included multisystem factors, such as social, cultural, family and individual aspects, which is in line with the multisystem approach as described by recent resilience theories. Longitudinal studies are scarce but confirm the dynamical character of resilience and mental health. The application of longitudinal studies and innovative measurement techniques will improve our understanding on the cascade effects of stressors on resilience and mental health outcomes. SUMMARY: Resilience is strongly associated with mental health in children and adolescents and deserves a more prominent role in research, prevention programs and routine clinical care. Including social, cultural and family context in the evaluation of resilience is of great value, as this can identify targets for early and preventive interventions.","Mesman, Esther; Vreeker, Annabel; Hillegers, Manon","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000741","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Curr Opin Psychiatry;34(6): 586-592, 2021 11 01.; Publication details: Curr Opin Psychiatry;34(6): 586-592, 2021 11 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20148,""
"Interventions against Social Isolation of Older Adults: A Systematic Review of Existing Literature and Interventions","Social isolation is widespread among older adults, especially those confined to living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. We completed a systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of 20 interventions used to combat social isolation in older adults. A scoring mechanism based on the Joanna Briggs Appraisal Checklist was utilized to determine the quality of the studies. Searches were conducted in ""MedLine"", ""PubMed"", ""PsycINFO"" and ""Aging and Mental Health"". Studies completed on group and person-centered interventions against social isolation were the highest quality as the social isolation experienced by older adults decreased after the intervention, and this effect continued in follow-up studies. Other interventions such as volunteering-based interventions also alleviated isolation; however, follow-up studies were not completed to determine long-term efficacy. Given the increase in social isolation faced by older persons during the pandemic, our review can be utilized to create effective interventions to reduce social isolation.","Manjunath, Jaya; Manoj, Nandita; Alchalabi, Tania","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geriatrics6030082","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Geriatrics (Basel);6(3)2021 Aug 25.; Publication details: Geriatrics (Basel);6(3)2021 Aug 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20149,""
"[Emotional and psychological status of nursing staff attacked during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America]; Estado emocional y psicolÃ³gico del personal de enfermerÃ­a agredido durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en LatinoamÃ©rica","INTRODUCTION: The new COVID-19 disease is worldwide. During the pandemic, attacks on healthcare staff have increased. The objective of the study was to know the incidence of aggression towards nursing staff and to evaluate the main emotional and psychological symptoms experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was applied to nursing staff of Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Sociodemographic information was obtained concerning aggression, psychological symptoms, and emotional state. Descriptive statistics were applied in frequencies and percentages, means and standard deviation. RESULTS: 310 people from Mexico (65.2%), Argentina (5.8%), Colombia (5.2%), Honduras (5.2%), Costa Rica (4.5%) and other Latin American countries (14.1%) participated. 78.1% were women, with an average age of 35.2 years. 79.6% of the sample reported being attacked or discriminated against. The most common emotions were fear of getting sick (73.7%), sleep disturbances (33.4%), fear of infecting their relatives (33.4%). The mental health disorders reported were anxiety (29.2%), sadness (10.4%) and increased appetite (8.8%). The most frequent locations of aggression were the street and public transport. Our results suggest a high incidence of aggression against nursing staff during the pandemic; in any case, the staff present emotional and mental disturbances. It is necessary to develop safety and security policies for nursing staff and provide mental health care to staff who are on the first line of defence against COVID-19.","De La Cruz, Juan Pablo SÃ¡nchez; GonzÃ¡lez-Castro, Thelma Beatriz; Pool-GarcÃ­a, Sherezada; LÃ³pez-NarvÃ¡ez, Maria Lilia; Tovilla-ZÃ¡rate, Carolos Alfonso","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.08.006","","Country: CO; COLÃ”MBIA; COLOMBIA; COLOMBIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Colomb Psiquiatr;2021 Oct 08.; Publication details: Rev Colomb Psiquiatr;2021 Oct 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20150,""
"The Abbreviated Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) and the Abbreviated Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS): Psychometric Properties and Evaluation of the Czech Versions","Short and effective tools for measuring depression, anxiety and their resulting impairments are lacking in the Czech language. The abbreviated versions of the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) and the Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS) show very good psychometric properties in English and other languages, and can be used in different settings for research or clinical purposes. The aim of this study was the psychometric evaluation and validation of the Czech versions of the abbreviated forms of both tools in the general population. A nationally representative sample of 2912 participants (age = 48.88, SD = 15.56; 55% female) was used. The non-parametric testing of the differences between sociodemographic groups revealed a higher level of anxiety and depression in students, females and religious respondents. Confirmatory Factor Analysis suggested a good fit for the unidimensional model of the OASIS: x2(4) = 38.28; p < 0.001; TLI = 0.999; CFI = 0.997; RMSEA = 0.078; SRMR = 0.027 and the ODSIS: x2(4) = 36.54; p < 0.001; TLI = 0.999; CFI = 0.999; RMSEA = 0.076; SRMR = 0.021 with the data. Both scales had an excellent internal consistency (OASIS: Cronbach's alpha = 0.95, McDonald's omega = 0.95 and ODSIS: Cronbach's alpha = 0.95, McDonald's omega = 0.95). A clinical cut-off of 15 was identified for the OASIS and a cut-off of 12 for the ODSIS. The study showed good validity for both scales. The Czech versions of the abbreviated OASIS and ODSIS were short and valid instruments for measuring anxiety and depression.","Sandora, Jan; Novak, Lukas; Brnka, Robert; van Dijk, Jitse P; Tavel, Peter; Malinakova, Klara","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910337","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 30.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 30.; Depression; Language; Anxiety/diagnosis; Anxiety/epidemiology; Czech Republic/epidemiology; Depression/diagnosis; Depression/epidemiology; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20151,""
"AN EMPIRICAL STUDY ON THE IMPACT OF GREEN SPACES IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF RESIDENTS UNDER COVID-19","As one of the frequently used green spaces of urban residents, residential green spaces have a positive effect on people's mental health status. In order to understand the impact of residential green spaces on citizens' mental health during the COVID-19 epidemic, this study collected the sociodemographic data of 556 residents from 15 residential communities in Hefei New Municipal and Culture District, Anhui Province, China in March, 2020 through online questionnaires, then adopted the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10 Scale) to evaluate the residents' mental health status, and used GIMP Grid to quantify the green view index of residential green spaces outside the windows. Besides, a multiple linear regression model was used to explore the correlations between residential green spaces and residents' mental health status. The findings show that green coverage ratio, satisfaction of the landscapes of green space, green view index outside the window, and green viewing duration of the residential green spaces have positive effects on residents' mental health status. The study verifies the benefits of residential green spaces to promoting resident's mental health status under COVID-19, providing a scientific guidance for the future practice of urban construction.","Wang, Z.

"Depression, Anxiety, and Stress During Times of COVID-19: An Analysis of Youngsters Studying in Higher Education in India","This study addressed the critical problems of depression, anxiety, and stress, which are prevalent among students pursuing higher education. Specifically, this article aimed to study the level of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic experienced by young people studying in higher education institutions in India. The study also attempted to identify various coping strategies students adopted to overcome this difficult time. Following a descriptive research design, this study used surveys to collect primary data from 235 students in graduate and undergraduate programs in India. The DASS-21 scale was used to check the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress students experienced. Furthermore, a four-point COPE scale was used to identify coping strategies students adopted. The results showed that students experienced high levels of stress and anxiety during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although depression levels were not alarming, most students were worried about several aspects of their lives and careers. However, because the data were collected from a relatively small sample, the study is likely not generalisable. Furthermore, most of the data were collected online, which has its limitations. This research likely has significant implications for various stakeholders, such as students, parents, institutions, counsellors, and government and non-government bodies, because it may help them take appropriate actions. These research contributions are original and novel, because the COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges and inspired new solutions to the problems of students and society.","Verma, H.; Verma, G.; Kumar, P.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12626-021-00089-2","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Rev.

"THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND LOCKDOWN MEASURES ON EATING DISORDER RISK AND EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN SPAIN","This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on emotional distress and disordered eating in a community sample of Spanish youngsters. A total of 2847 participants (95% women;aged 14-35) completed depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, and disordered eating measures. Given the small proportion of men and as significant differences were found between genders in several variables, most results were only reported for women. Severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress were found in 30.8%, 25.4% and 20.5% of the sample, respectively. Sleep quality, eating habits, appearance concerns, preoccupation about one's future, health concerns and other life domains were also affected by lockdown. Younger age, being single, being unemployed, not having contracted COVID-19 or not being sure about it, having a loved one infected or deceased due to coronavirus, and not having a place to relax at home were significantly associated with psychological distress and disordered eating. A structural equation model confirmed the direct influence of lockdown-related variables into psychopathology symptoms. The findings of this study suggest that COVID-19 and its associated lockdown might have a significant effect on psychological wellbeing and eating disturbances.","Vall-Roque, H.; Andres, A.; Saldana, C.","https://doi.org/10.51668/bp.8321208n","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Behav.

The better food or agricultural products are preserved for a long time, the more it ensures social stability for state management related to food security for people. This paper introduces one kind of biopolymer films with investigation on effect of plasticizers to its characteristics. In order to produce biopolymers, the most popular types of plasticizers were polyols. On that basis, this research used Glycerol (G), Propylene Glycol (PG), and Polyethylene Glycerol (G), Propylene Glycol (PG), and Polyethylene Glycol 400 (PEG400) with a content of 1% to 3% to study their impact on Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose/Beeswax (HPMC/BW) biopolymer films. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra assess changes in composite films structures of HPMC/BW when combined with different plasticizers, the amplitudes of these major vibrations were different compared among the HPMC and BW spectra due to the interaction among the components in the polymer networks and the formation of intramolecular bonds. Cutting surface observations of scanning electron microscopy images (SEM) show the degree of uniform dispersion, the appearance of defects in the membrane structure, influence on the change of water vapor permeability (WVP) values through the membrane from 68.2 to 28.6 g.mm/day.m2.kPa. Differential scanning calorimetric graphs (DSC) analysis showed that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the composite film created was within the Tg range of HPMC and BW, it indicated the relative match between the ratio of crystal and amorphous in the film formula, formed a stable composite emulsion and better dispersion. Plasticizers have been used to improve flexibility and processability of polymers, changing in plasticizers types and concentration significantly affect the film properties.","Tung, N. T.; Ha, P. T.

"""Never in my life have I heard such a load of absolute nonsense Wtf"" Political satire on the handling of the COVID-19 crisis","This paper problematises political satire in a time when the COVID-19 virus has provoked numerous deaths worldwide, and had dramatic effects on social behaviour, on a scale unknown in western nations since World War II. Most populations have endured `lockdown', periods of enforced domestic imprisonment, which led to images of the empty streets of big cities appearing in media, symbols of the drastic changes that the health emergency was making necessary. Yet, from the outset, comic memes began to circulate across (social) media, while in mainstream print media political satirists continued to lampoon official responses to the ongoing crisis. The paper thus aims to explore the connection of political satire and humour, asking two principle research questions: firstly, how to explain the humorous effects of these multimodal artefacts in such depressing circumstances;secondly, from a pragmatic perspective, to account for their overall socio-political function.The study uses memes taken from various online sources (Facebook, Twitter, Google) during the crisis, analysed according to a mixed approach that blends notions from Humour studies, especially incongruity (Morreall 2016), with insights from linguistic pragmatics (e.g. Kecskes 2014). The findings emphasise the emotional dimension of this form of satire, as the memes work against the backdrop of a range of feelings (anger, bitterness, disappointment, frustration, despair, etc.), many of which have been widely generated by the COVID-19 crisis and political responses to it. In short, to paraphrase Walter Benjamin (2008: 378), man may `run out of tears but not of laughter'. The findings contribute to our understanding of online satire as an emergent genre, one that uses the affordances of new media to extend the social potentialities of a traditional subversive discourse form.","Ponton, D.

"COVID-19 PANDEMIC LOCKDOWN RESPONSES FROM AN EMOTIONAL PERSPECTIVE: FAMILY FUNCTION AS A DIFFERENTIAL PATTERN AMONG OLDER ADULTS","Family can be an essential resource at times of loss or vital crisis. Loneliness and isolation in older adults might have serious negative consequences for their mental health. For this reason, this research aims to analyze the role of family function in the anxiety and depression experienced by older adults during the pandemic caused by COVID-19. Participants were 882 Spanish community-dwelling adults over 60 years of age. Sociodemographic characteristics, characteristics related to the coronavirus, self-perceived health, family function, avoidance, depression and anxiety were analyzed. Data suggest a buffering effect of family function on anxiety and depression during the pandemic. Furthermore, being unmarried or a female, greater fear of COVID-19, worse self-perceived health, greater avoidance, and worse family function were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Likewise, greater fear of COVID-19, poorer self-perceived health, greater avoidance, and poorer family function, were associated with greater depression. These results point out that family dysfunction is a predisposing factor for the development of the emotional problems of anxiety and depression in older people in potentially stressful and loss situations.","Lopez, J.; Perez-Rojo, G.; Noriega, C.; Velasco, C.; Carretero, I.; Lopez-Frutos, P.; Galarraga, L.","https://doi.org/10.51668/bp.8321207n","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Behav.

"NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF PANDEMIC BY COVID-19 ON HEALTH TEAMS","Objective: to identify negative repercussions and the psychological impact on health professionals who work in the care of patients with coronavirus and strategies to minimize its effects. Method: integrative review of publications from 2010 to 2020, in the Public Medline databases, Journal Portal of the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and TRIP DATABASE. Results: the analysis of 12 studies related to psychological impacts on workers resulted in three categories: perceived stressors;negative repercussions and psychological implications;and supporting factors for reducing stressors. Conclusion: the coronavirus pandemic can cause psychological distress and the results indicate the need for attention to the mental health of health workers. Assessing psychic overload, offering psychological support and implementing protocols for a safe environment make up the complex network of actions that determine success in coping with COVID-19.","Garcia, A.

"Medical students and the response to COVID-19: Educational preparedness and psychological impact of their involvement in communicating with patientsâ€™ relatives","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged without precedent both healthcare and educational systems worldwide. How medical students could and should be engaged in the response remains unclear. Medical students were asked to help with communicating with patientsâ€™ relatives in our institution. Authors aimed: to (i) present the rapid implementation and assessment of a teaching/e-teaching lesson in the COVID-19 era;(ii) report an early evaluation of preparedness, mental health and well-being of students involved. Methods: The lesson was elaborated at lockdown in France. The clinical guidance consisted of a voluntary lesson entitled: â€œHow to communicate with relatives of hospitalized COVID-19 patients?â€. Students received an anonymous online questionnaire after two weeks. Results: Sixty-six medical students were trained (32% face-to-face). The response rate was 64%. Most students informed relatives about the routine care of the patient (95%). Concerning the lesson, students assured to have had one (95%), considered it relevant (86%), and had used the educational content (81%). 33% were charged with unexpected missions (only 36% felt prepared). Most of them did not report any psychological impact, but some reported anxiety or sleep disorders with no difference between face-to-face/distance training. Conclusions: This pandemic may last. Communication ability is a key competence in medical curriculum and is more than ever essential. Distance learning technologies may provide a useful and accepted tool for medical students. We report on a rapid feedback on what can be expected or not from students in terms of mission and short-term psychological consequences. Resume Objectifs: La pandÃ©mie de COVID-19 a posÃ© des dÃ©fis sans prÃ©cÃ©dent aux systÃ¨mes de santÃ© et d'Ã©ducation du monde entier. La maniÃ¨re dont les Ã©tudiants en mÃ©decine pourraient et devraient participer Ã  la rÃ©ponse Ã  cette crise reste incertaine. Pendant la premiÃ¨re vague Ã©pidÃ©mique, les Ã©tudiants en mÃ©decine de notre hÃ´pital ont Ã©tÃ© invitÃ©s Ã  aider Ã  communiquer avec les proches des patients hospitalisÃ©s en unitÃ©s COVID, dans le contexte de lâ€™interdiction des visites. Les auteurs souhaitent : (i) prÃ©senter la mise en Å“uvre et l'Ã©valuation rapides d'un enseignement / e-enseignement facilitant les capacitÃ©s de communication avec les familles, Ã  l'Ã¨re du COVID-19;(ii) fournir les rÃ©sultats d'une Ã©valuation prÃ©coce du sentiment de prÃ©paration de ces Ã©tudiants Ã  ce type de mission, de leur santÃ© mentale et leur bien-Ãªtre des Ã©lÃ¨ves concernÃ©s. MÃ©thode: Le cours a Ã©tÃ© Ã©laborÃ© lors du premier confinement en France, Ã  destination des Ã©tudiants volontaires pour la mission dâ€™information aux familles (par tÃ©lÃ©phone uniquement). Lâ€™enseignement Ã©tait proposÃ© en distanciel ou en prÃ©sentiel, et sâ€™intitulait : Â«Comment communiquer avec les proches des patients hospitalisÃ©s COVID-19?Â». Les Ã©tudiants ont reÃ§u un questionnaire en ligne anonyme deux semaines aprÃ¨s le dÃ©but de leur mission, Ã©valuant leur sentiment de prÃ©paration pour cette mission, leur santÃ© mentale et leur bien-Ãªtre. RÃ©sultats: Soixante-six Ã©tudiants en mÃ©decine ont Ã©tÃ© formÃ©s (32% en prÃ©sentiel). Le taux de rÃ©ponse Ã©tait de 64%. La plupart des Ã©tudiants ont informÃ© leurs proches des soins de routine du patient (95%). Concernant lâ€™Ã©valuation de lâ€™enseignement, les Ã©lÃ¨ves ont Ã©tÃ© rassurÃ©s dâ€™avoir bÃ©nÃ©ficiÃ© de ce cours (95%), lâ€™ont jugÃ© pertinent (86%) et ont utilisÃ© son contenu pÃ©dagogique (81%). 33% ont Ã©tÃ© chargÃ©s de missions imprÃ©vues (seulement 36% se sont sentis prÃ©parÃ©s), dont des annonces dâ€™aggravation clinique. La plupart d'entre eux n'ont signalÃ© aucun impact psychologique, mais certains ont signalÃ© des troubles anxieux ou du sommeil sans diffÃ©rence entre la formation en prÃ©sentiel / Ã  distance. Conclusions: Cette pandÃ©mie peut durer encore plusieurs mois. Les compÃ©tences communicationnelles sont Ã  acquÃ©rir dans le cursus mÃ©dical et plus que nÃ©cessaires dans ce contexte.

"Estimating Influences of Unemployment and Underemployment on Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Who Suffers the Most?","Objectives The study aim was to evaluate whether unemployment and underemployment are associated with mental distress and whether employment insecurity and its mental health consequences are disproportionately concentrated among specific social groups in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design This is a population-based longitudinal study. Methods Data came from the Understanding America Study (UAS), a population-based panel in the United States. Between April and May 2020, 3,548 adults who were not out of the labor force were surveyed. Analyses using targeted maximum likelihood estimation examined the association of employment insecurity with depression, assessed using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and anxiety, measured with the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale. Stratified models were evaluated to examine whether employment insecurity and its mental health consequences are disproportionately concentrated among specific social groups. Results Being unemployed or underemployed was associated with increased odds of having depression (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.36, 2.02) and anxiety (AOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.26, 1.79), relative to having a full-time job. Employment insecurity was disproportionately concentrated among Hispanics (54.3%), Blacks (60.6%), women (55.9%), young adults (aged 18â€“29;57.0%), and those without a college degree (62.7%). Further, Hispanic workers, subsequent to employment insecurity, experienced worse effects on depression (AOR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.28, 3.40) and anxiety (AOR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.24, 3.09). Those who completed high school or less reported worse depression subsequent to employment insecurity (AOR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.55, 3.85). Conclusions Both unemployment and underemployment threaten mental health during the pandemic, and the mental health repercussions are not felt equally across the population. Employment insecurity during the pandemic should be considered an important public health concern that may exacerbate pre-existing mental health disparities during and after the pandemic.","Lee, Jungeun Olivia, Kapteyn, Arie, Clomax, Adriane, Jin, Haomiao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.09.038","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Public Health;2021.; Publication details: Public Health;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20162,""
"Postpartum womenâ€™s experiences of social and healthcare professional support during the COVID-19 pandemic: A recurrent cross-sectional thematic analysis","Problem Disrupted access to social and healthcare professional support during the COVID-19 pandemic have had an adverse effect on maternal mental health. Background Motherhood is a key life transition which increases vulnerability to experience negative affect. Aim Explore UK womenâ€™s postnatal experiences of social and healthcare professional support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 women, approximately 30 days after initial social distancing guidelines were imposed (T1), and a separate 12 women were interviewed approximately 30 days after the initial easing of social distancing restrictions (T2). Recurrent cross-sectional thematic analysis was conducted in NVivo 12. Findings T1 themes were, â€˜Motherhood has been an isolating experienceâ€™ (exacerbated loneliness due to diminished support accessibility) and â€˜Everything is under lock and keyâ€™ (confusion, alienation, and anxiety regarding disrupted face-to-face healthcare checks). T2 themes were, â€˜Disrupted healthcare professional supportâ€™ (feeling burdensome, abandoned, and frustrated by virtual healthcare) and â€˜Easing restrictions are bittersweetâ€™ (conflict between enhanced emotional wellbeing, and sadness regarding lost postnatal time). Discussion Respondents at both timepoints were adversely affected by restricted access to informal (family and friends) and formal (healthcare professional) support, which were not sufficiently bridged virtually. Additionally, the prospect of attending face-to-face appointments was anxiety-provoking and perceived as being contradictory to social distancing guidance. Prohibition of family from maternity wards was also salient and distressing for T2, but not T1 respondents. Conclusion Healthcare professionals should encourage maternal help-seeking and provide timely access to mental health services. Improving access to informal and formal face-to-face support are essential in protecting maternal and infant wellbeing.","Jackson, Leanne, De Pascalis, Leonardo, Harrold, Joanne A.; Fallon, Victoria, Silverio, Sergio A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2021.10.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Women and Birth;2021.; Publication details: Women and Birth;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20163,""
"All-cause and cause-specific mortality in people with mental disorders and intellectual disabilities, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: cohort study","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND People with mental disorders and intellectual disabilities experience excess mortality compared with the general population. The impact of COVID-19 on exacerbating this, and in widening ethnic inequalities, is unclear. METHODS Prospective data (N=167,122) from a large mental healthcare provider in London, UK, with deaths from 2019 to 2020, used to assess age- and gender-standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) across nine psychiatric conditions (schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, affective disorders, somatoform/ neurotic disorders, personality disorders, learning disabilities, eating disorders, substance use disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, dementia) and by ethnicity. FINDINGS Prior to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring COVID-19 a public health emergency on 30th January 2020, all-cause SMRs across all psychiatric cohorts were more than double the general population. By the second quarter of 2020, when the UK experienced substantial peaks in COVID-19 deaths, all-cause SMRs increased further, with COVID-19 SMRs elevated across all conditions (notably: learning disabilities: SMR: 9.24 (95% CI: 5.98-13.64), pervasive developmental disorders: 5.01 (95% CI: 2.40-9.20), eating disorders: 4.81 (95% CI: 1.56-11.22), schizophrenia-spectrum disorders: 3.26 (95% CI: 2.55-4.10), dementia: 3.82 (95% CI: 3.42, 4.25) personality disorders 4.58 (95% CI: 3.09-6.53)). Deaths from other causes remained at least double the population average over the whole year. Increased SMRs were similar across ethnic groups. INTERPRETATION People with mental disorders and intellectual disabilities were at a greater risk of deaths relative to the general population before, during and after the first peak of COVID-19 deaths, with similar risks by ethnicity. Mortality from non-COVID-19/ other causes was elevated before/ during the pandemic, with higher COVID-19 mortality during the pandemic.

"Nursesâ€™ feelings and perspectives of the covid-19 pandemic: A qualitative study in a developing country","BACKGROUND: Nursesâ€™ duties and responsibilities related to the risk of transmitting COVID-19. Studies that explore nursesâ€™ feelings and perspectives in providing health services at COVID-19 referral hospitals, especially in developing countries like Indonesia, are limited. AIM: This study aims to explore nursesâ€™ feelings, perceptions, and expectations of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This qualitative study applied the qualitative descriptive design that involved 17 nurses from different hospitals in Indonesia. The semi-structured interview gathered their views of COVID-19, and the comparative analysis for interviews technique was chosen to analyze the data. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the data analysis. The themes were nursesâ€™ express psychological responses in facing the COVID-19 pandemic such as fear, surrender, panic, and calmness. Other two themes included the COVID 19 pandemic enhances nursesâ€™ health awareness and behavior, and the government protect nurses from the COVID-19 transmission and social stigma. CONCLUSION: The feelings reported dominantly by the nurse, in addition to information about health awareness, behavior, the governmentâ€™s actions, and their expectations. Mental health assistance would be useful to prevent depression in nurses, and the governmentâ€™s comprehensive approaches in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic would increase the protection and productivity of health workers, including nurses.","Widiasih, R.; Ermiati, E.; Emaliyawati, E.; Hendrawati, S.; Susanti, R.

"A review of severe acute respiratory syndrome - Coronavirus 2","The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and still raging in 2021 is a global emergency where no country was spared from its high morbidity and mortality. Life changed in innumerable ways, from lock downs to job losses, isolation and mental health crisis. All countries suffered. If it were not for the quick development of medications and vaccines, coupled with preventive measures like facial masks, social distancing and frequent washing of hands, we will be in a worse chaos. Some countries like India and many in Latin America have been devastated and its consequences will be long felt even after the pandemic is controlled. Understanding the cause, its epidemiology and controlled measures is important. Although it took 100 years to encounter a global pandemic of this magnitude, scientists warn of almost inevitable future global pandemics. This review will explore some salient aspects of SARS-CoV-2 impact and measures to control the infection. The worldâ€™s death toll caused by SARS-CoV-2 exceeds 3 million and close to 200 million people have been infected. The available vaccines used in more than 400 million individuals, still fall short of producing herd immunity despite the high efficacy rate of most of them. There is a pressing need to immunize 80% or more. Some side effects to vaccine were reported, the majority of minor impact, although some rare ones are more serious such as thrombotic thrombocytopenia or myocarditis. Still the protection afforded from the vaccine vastly outweighs the risks and its wide use is encouraged.","Sjogren, M.

"Unlocking growth options in surgical education and training during the pandemic","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic brought widespread disruption to structured surgical education and training. The knee-jerk reaction is often pessimism about surgical training's future, particularly in the Improved Surgical Training (IST) pilot's context. However, Einstein famously once said, â€œIn the midst of every crises lies great opportunityâ€. Unlocking growth during periods of high uncertainty is a premise of real options theory;one utilised by supply chain managers and decision scientists, but novel to medical education. This study explores the growth options that have resulted from new operational models during the pandemic. Methods: Using a qualitative case study approach, data were obtained from interviews with core surgical trainees across Scotland. Data coding and inductive thematic analysis were undertaken. Results: Forty-six trainees participated. Analysis from trainees' perspective revealed: unexpected fulfilment from redeployment to non-surgical specialties, benefits to personal development from the unintended broad-based training across surgical specialties, improved collaborative teamworking between specialties and allied healthcare professionals, and enhanced supervised learning opportunities. Institutional growth options reported by trainees included: rapid uptake of telemedicine and digital technology, implementation of single hospital episode encounters for minor conditions, streamlined processes in theatre and acute admissions, and changes in working culture towards rationalising and teamworking. Conclusion: Growth options have been deliberately and unintentionally unlocked due to individual and institutional adaptions and innovations in response to the exogenous disruption. While some changes may be temporary, hopefully structured reflection on these changes and responders to them will drive surgical education and training into a new sustainable and resilient post-pandemic era.","Shah, A.

"COVID-19 neurological manifestations: correlation of cerebral MRI imaging and lung imagingâ€”Observational study","Background: During the current pandemic, there is an increased incidence of neurologic/neuropsychiatric manifestations in patients with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Neurologic manifestations may be coincident or result of disease and its therapy. In the emergency department, orientation of the clinician with this issue is crucial for accurate decision making to limit the spread of infection during neurologic treatment. This study aimed to be familiar with MRI findings in patients with Neuro-COVID. Seventy patients presented with neurologic/neuropsychiatric manifestation either post COVID or during hospitalization underwent cerebral MRI from April 2020 to June 2021 (39 men and 31women;mean age 43.27, age range from 16 to 69Â years). Results: Headache (80%), is the most prevalent neurological manifestations followed by smell and taste impairment (62.9%) and stroke symptoms (45.7%). Low mood and anxiety (17.1%), prolonged fatigue (14.3%) and depression (7.1%) are the most common psychiatric symptoms. Infarctions, hematoma and demyelinating disease are the most prevalent findings. There is a week positive correlation between MRI findings and CT chest finding but without statistical significance (P-value 0.2). Conclusions: Cerebrovascular disease and demyelinating lesions are common manifestations of COVID 19. Familiarity of neurologists and radiologist in the emergency department and in-patient with this issue is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis and the spread of infection.","Saleh, R.

"BRASH SYNDROME: A DOWNWARD SPIRAL","TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: BRASH Syndrome is a phenomenon characterized by bradycardia, renal failure, AV nodal blockade, shock, and hyperkalemia. Literature on this syndrome is limited given its under-recognition. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) III presented with dyspnea. Her home medications included furosemide, metoprolol, spironolactone, warfarin, and rosuvastatin. Comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for an elevated creatinine from baseline. Cardiac BNP was elevated, chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly, and physical exam was significant for jugular venous distention. Electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Image 1). Diltiazem was added for rate control however the patient was ultimately electrically cardioverted. Post procedure EKG revealed a junctional rhythm (Image 2). Hypotension persisted however. The patient soon developed oliguric renal failure and hyperkalemia, prompting upgrade to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) for shock. The patient had persistent bradycardia with heart rates as low as 32 beats per minute (bpm). Hemodialysis was initiated the following morning and the patient's shock, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia resolved. DISCUSSION: Transient abnormal rhythms have been reported post cardioversion, however the persistence of bradycardia with our patient's other abnormal lab findings raised concerns for different etiologies. BRASH syndrome is an under recognized pathophysiological phenomenon. Patients with congestive heart failure and CKD are at risk when in an inpatient setting. Different triggers are noted in recent reports, including medications such as Ranolazine and Bactrim, anaphylaxis, and even COVID-19. These cases varied in clinical severity, ranging from asymptomatic bradycardia to multiorgan failure. The hallmark mechanism of BRASH syndrome is a synergistic effect of AV nodal blocking medications and hyperkalemia promoting bradycardia. This, in conjunction with renal injury, produces the cycle of objective findings that define BRASH syndrome. Acute kidney injury caused by renal hypoperfusion can exacerbate the effects of AV nodal blocking medications as well as worsen hyperkalemia. Profound hyperkalemia and AV nodal blockade will in turn synergistically promote and prolong bradycardia. Bradycardia can depress cardiac output and further worsen renal hypoperfusion, continuing this viscous cycle. CONCLUSIONS: We believe electrical cardioversion into a junctional rhythm caused BRASH syndrome in our patient. Treatment is tailored to correcting the individual abnormalities. Many of these case reports had favorable outcomes. This case suggests that BRASH syndrome can often go undiagnosed yet still successfully be managed with supportive care.

"Well-being and its relationship with sports and physical activity of students during the coronavirus pandemic","The main goal of this correlational study is to examine the changes in the amount and type of physical activity of students of various study programs during the coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, the motives for these changes as well as their relationship with general well-being are investigated. Therefore, 243Â students (sport science, humanities, natural sciences) answered questions concerning (a)Â the amount and type of their physical activity before and during the pandemic, (b)Â their well-being and (c)Â their optimism/pessimism. The main result of the study is that the type and the motives for sports and physical activity changed for the study participants during the coronavirus pandemic: Team sports and swimming decreased, while individual sports and physical activity not associated with aÂ sports club/business and with digital media increased. In this study the difference in sports and physical activity seemed to be related to well-being, especially for the students of sport science and humanities. To conclude the study indicated that aÂ change occurred in the type of sports and physical activity as well as change in the motives for physical exercise in students during the pandemic.

"Transdisciplinary research and clinical priorities for better health","Modern medicine makes it possible for many people to live with multiple chronic diseases for decades, but this has enormous social, financial, and environmental consequences. Preclinical, epidemiological, and clinical trial data have shown that many of the most common chronic diseases are largely preventable with nutritional and lifestyle interventions that are targeting well-characterized signaling pathways and the symbiotic relationship with our microbiome. Most of the research priorities and spending for health are focused on finding new molecular targets for the development of biotech and pharmaceutical products. Very little is invested in mechanism-based preventive science, medicine, and education. We believe that overly enthusiastic expectations regarding the benefits of pharmacological research for disease treatment have the potential to impact and distort not only medical research and practice but also environmental health and sustainable economic growth. Transitioning from a primarily disease-centered medical system to a balanced preventive and personalized treatment healthcare system is key to reduce social disparities in health and achieve financially sustainable, universal health coverage for all. In this Perspective article, we discuss a range of science-based strategies, policies, and structural reforms to design an entire new disease prevention-centered science, educational, and healthcare system that maximizes both human and environmental health.","Fontana, Luigi; Fasano, Alessio; Chong, Yap Seng; Vineis, Paolo; Willett, Walter C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003699","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS Med;18(7): e1003699, 2021 07.; Publication details: PLoS Med;18(7): e1003699, 2021 07.; Chronic Disease/prevention & control; Health Promotion; Interdisciplinary Research; Life Style; Delivery of Health Care; Environmental Pollution; Farms; Humans; Investments; Science/economics; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20172,""
"Efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: A subgroup analysis of the Measure Up 1, Measure Up 2 and AD Up phase III clinical trials","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, recurrent, highly pruritic immune-mediated inflammatory disease, with an unmet need for additional effective therapies. Results from phase IIb and phase III clinical trials demonstrated that upadacitinib (UPA) was efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile vs. placebo (PBO) in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Here, we analyse the efficacy and safety of UPA in adolescent and adult subgroups using data from three phase III studies. Data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase III studies [Measure Up 1 (NCT03569293), Measure Up 2 (NCT03607422) and AD Up (NCT03568318)] were used to assess the efficacy and safety of UPA in adolescents and adults. Across the three studies, adolescents (aged 12 to &lt; 18years) and adults (aged 18-75years) with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 1: 1: 1 to UPA 15mg (UPA15), UPA 30mg (UPA30) or PBO orally once daily, either alone (Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2) or with concomitant topical corticosteroids (AD Up). This analysis includes prespecified efficacy endpoints in adolescents and adults at week 16: achievement of 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75), validated Investigator's Global Assessment-Atopic Dermatitis score of clear or almost clear (vIGA-AD 0/1), Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (WP-NRS) improvement of = 4, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) or Children's DLQI score of 0 or 1 (DLQI 0/1 or CDLQI 0/1), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-Anxiety (HADS-A) &lt; 8 and HADS-Depression (HADS-D) &lt; 8. The primary approach for evaluating categorical endpoints was NRI-C (nonresponder imputation incorporating multiple imputation to handle missing data due to COVID-19). Safety was assessed as treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) in all patients who received = 1 dose of study drug and analysed as an integrated dataset for all three studies. In total, 124, 104 and 116 adolescents plus 723, 732 and 785 adults were randomized and treated in Measure Up 1, Measure Up 2 and AD Up, respectively. EASI-75 response rates at week 16 across adolescent and adult subgroups for both doses of UPA were consistent with the overall study population results;treatment with UPA30 yielded numerically better results than with UPA15. Most patients in both subgroups achieved EASI-75 with UPA15 (&gt; 55%), and numerically greater proportions of patients achieved EASI-75 for UPA30 (&gt; 72%), with response rates for both UPA doses demonstrating significantly better efficacy than PBO (= 30%). vIGA-AD 0/1 was achieved by &gt; 38% and &gt; 50% of patients receiving UPA15 and UPA30, respectively, in both subgroups, with response rates for both UPA doses demonstrating significantly better efficacy than PBO (&lt; 12%). A WP-NRS improvement of = 4 was achieved by &gt; 33% of adolescents and &gt; 42% of adults receiving UPA15 vs. &gt; 50% of adolescents and &gt; 60% of adults receiving UPA30, with response rates for both UPA doses demonstrating significantly better efficacy than PBO (&lt; 16%). CDLQI 0/1 was achieved by &gt; 13% (UPA15) and = 19% (UPA30) of adolescents aged 12 to &lt;16years, while DLQI 0/1 was achieved by = 0% (UPA15) and = 27% (UPA30) of adolescents aged 16 to &lt;18years;most adolescent rates for DLQI 0/1 and CDLQI 0/1 were not significantly greater than PBO. In the adult subgroup, DLQI 0/1 was achieved by &gt; 24% and &gt; 37% receiving UPA15 and UPA30, respectively, both significantly greater than PBO. Achievement of HADS-A&lt;8 and HADS-D&lt;8 was comparable for adolescents and adults, with response rates for both UPA doses being significantly higher than PBO: = 40% for UPA15 and &gt; 41% for UPA30 in both subgroups. Rates of serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were generally similar across treatment groups for both adolescents and adults. Rates of acne-the most common AE-were higher with UPA than PBO, and similar for adolescents and adults. Serious infections were reported infrequently (&lt; 1%) with UPA in both adolescents and adults. Opportunistic infections were reported in &lt; 1% of adults, with n ne in adolescents. Rates of herpes zoster virus infection were higher with UPA than PBO in both adolescents and adults. No adjudicated gastrointestinal perforation, major adverse cardiovascular events or venous thromboembolic events were reported in the UPA groups. No malignancies were reported in adolescents. Adolescent and adult responses to UPA15 and UPA30 treatment were consistent across clinical, quality-of-life and patient-reported outcome assessments, with similar and acceptable safety in both populations.","Paller, A.

"Asanas in prone posture and slow pranayamic breathing promote early recovery and prevent post-recovery complications in covid-19 patients: A preliminary study","Introduction and Aim: Prone positioning has been reported to facilitate oxygenation in patients suffering from COVID-19, and improvement has been observed in cardiorespiratory functions following practice of asanas and pranayamas. We investigated the effects of prone asanas and slow pranayama on recovery from COVID-19 illness. Methods: A study was conducted on six COVID-19 patients of varied age with different pre-existing comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes and hypertension, admitted to COVID-hospital. In addition to routine medical treatment, all the patients practiced the prone asanas and slow pranayamic breathing for a period of four weeks (2 weeks of hospital stay during the illness and two weeks of home quarantine following discharge from the hospital). The intensity of illness, days to recover, level of stress assessed by Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), degree of depression assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), myocardial work stress determined by rate-pressure product, and complications if any, were recorded. They were advised to continue the asana-pranayama practice for another four weeks during the entire recovery period. Results: All the patients recovered smoothly from COVID-19 illness, their hospital stay was eventless, and the psychological stress, levels of depression and myocardial work stress due to COVID illness were reduced significantly by four-weeks practice of asana-pranayama schedule. Multiple regression demonstrated the association of decreased depression to decreased level of stress following asana-pranayama practice. There were no post-recovery complications during the one-month follow-up in the recovery period. Conclusion: Practice of prone asanas and slow pranayama for four weeks facilitated the healing from COVID-19 illness, alleviated psycho-physical stress and depression, and prevented development of post-recovery complications in all the patients. The reduction in depression could be linked to the reduced stress level following asana-pranayama practice in COVID-19 patients.","Pal, G.

"FEVER-INDUCED BRUGADA SYNDROME","TOPIC: Cardiovascular Disease TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a rare cause of sudden cardiac death in asymptomatic healthy adults. We present a case of BrS unmasked by fever secondary to COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: 38-year-old male with no prior medical history presented with a two-day history of subjective fevers, chills, productive cough, dyspnea, and left-sided pleuritic chest pain. He was noted to be febrile, tachypneic, tachycardic and hypoxic to the low-90s on room air. Bloodwork revealed elevated inflammatory markers with leukocytosis. Imaging and bloodwork were consistent with severe bilateral multifocal pneumonia secondary to COVID-19 infection. EKG on admission showed evidence of sinus tachycardia and type I Brugada pattern in leads V1 and V2 without ischemic changes. He was admitted for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia with intravenous (IV) Remdesivir, IV steroids, and oxygen supplementation. Despite this, patient continued to be febrile, and interestingly, serial EKGs showed persistent type 1 Brugada pattern, which transformed into type 2 Brugada pattern after day 2 of admission, to persist for the next seven days. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction 65%) with no significant valvular abnormalities. The Brugada pattern was thought to be induced by the febrile episodes, therefore all fevers were aggressively treated, and patient was closely monitored for any ventricular arrhythmias. Patient was educated on avoiding tricyclic antidepressants and sodium channel blockers as they are contraindicated in BrS. He was discharged home with plans for outpatient electrophysiological study. DISCUSSION: BrS is a clinical entity that can lead to sudden cardiac death and is associated with ECG changes of a 2mm J-point elevation and 1mm ST-segment elevation in two or more of the right precordial leads;type 1 is characterized by coveted-ST elevation in V1 and V2 whereas type 2 involves a saddle-back appearance. Diagnosis is made after excluding all other known causes of ST-segment elevation in right precordial leads, known as phenocopies. Known triggers include fever, intoxication, vagal stimulation, electrolyte imbalances, and various medications. Fever-induced BrS is more common among men in an age group of 30 to 60 years [4], it can precipitate cardiac arrest due to increased arrhythmogenicity of cardiac sodium channels at higher temperatures. Thus, timely and aggressive control of fever is crucial in preventing fatal arrhythmias, with fever-induced BrS leading to cardiac arrest in 18-20% of patients [2,3]. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to be aware of the circumstances that can induce BrS, including fevers and medications, as BrS can be fatal, leading to cardiac arrest in many patients. Early recognition can lead to early intervention, through placement of an implantable pacemaker for documented arrhythmia, to decrease morbidity and mortality. REFERENCE #1: 1.

"ACUTE ENCEPHALOPATHY AFTER SELF MEDICATION WITH IVERMECTIN IN A PATIENT WITH COVID-19","TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Global Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Ivermectin is an FDA approved anti parasitic drug widely used and generally well tolerated. In vitro data suggests ivermectin may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2. This has generated interest for a potential role in the prevention and treatment of COVID19. We report a case of a patient who developed severe encephalopathy after an accidental overdose with ivermectin CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old female patient was brought to the ED with altered mental status. The patient initially complained of nonproductive cough for five days. After searching online for possible treatments for COVID19, her husband bought a veterinarian preparation of ivermectin for horses at the local store. After discussing with her husband, the patient took two ampules of this medication. Each ampule contained 113.75 mg of ivermectin. About five hours later, the husband noticed that she was difficult to arouse. On presentation, vital signs were normal and she was afebrile. On exam she was arousable to voice and able to follow simple commands but nonverbal. Initial lab values included a normal CBC and BMP. Aminotransferases were mildly elevated. SARS-Cov-2 RNA nasal pharyngeal swab was positive. Urine drug screen was negative. CXR and CT of the brain were normal. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close neurologic assessments. Fortunately, the patient improved slowly and was discharged home 48 hours later with no complications DISCUSSION: Ivermectin is a known anti parasitic drug, that has not been approved to treat viruses. That being said, ivermectin, in vitro, inhibits positive, single stranded RNA viruses. Ivermectin has also shown to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Several trials have been conducted to assess the efficacy of this drug for the prevention and treatment of COVID19. Results have been inconclusive. FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID19. Although mostly considered a safe drug, overdose with ivermectin can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, ataxia and rarely seizures, coma and even death. Cases of fatal encephalopathy have been described during ivermectin treatment campaigns against onchocerciasis in Africa in subjects with a high Loa loa microfilarial density. Dosing for treatment of parasitic infections are in the range 150- 400 mcg/kg/day. Our patient took ten times the recommended dose. Ivermectin is also used as an antiparasitic agent for farm animals. It can be purchased without a prescription for veterinarian use. On April 10, 2020 the FDA published an advisory warning the public not to take Ivermectin intended for animals. CONCLUSIONS: Ivermectin is an anti parasitic drug widely used and generally well tolerated. The efficacy of this drug for the prevention and treatment of COVID19 remains inconclusive and its use is not recommended.

"THE LONG HAUL: A FOLLOW UP STUDY OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19 ONE YEAR AGO AT AN URBAN MEDICAL CENTER IN NEW JERSEY","TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Many patients diagnosed with COVID-19 develop a post-viral syndrome commonly known as Long COVID-19. Long COVID is described as when a patient experiences persistent symptoms for more than 12 weeks after their initial infection. Recent studies have shown that patients may experience long covid for as many as 6 months after initial infection. We conducted a follow up study on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 one year ago at one of the worst affected tertiary hospitals in the state of New Jersey. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study consisting of patients with a confirmed positive COVID-19 test by PCR in the months of March and April of 2020 in the St. Josephâ€™s University Hospital network. Individuals who were either admitted to the hospital or tested positive in the outpatient setting with Sars- CoV2 were included in the study. Patients under 18 years of age or those with cognitive impairment or inability to complete the survey were excluded. Informed consent was taken over the telephone. The participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire including sociodemographic information and a review of systems to evaluate for persistent symptoms they have experienced over the past year directly due to COVID-19. All patient identifying information was de-identified in compliance with HIPAA rules and regulations. RESULTS: There were 91 inpatients ( 91/173 [52.6%]) and 82 outpatients (82/173 [47.4%]) with a mean age of 51.5. The most common ethnicities were Hispanic (80/173 [46.24%]) African American (48/173 [27.74%]), Caucasian (32/173 [18.49%]) and the most common comorbidities were hypertension (68/173 [39.5%]), obesity (45/173 [26.9%]) and diabetes (33/173 [19.1%]). There were 91 inpatients ( 91/173 [52.6%]) and 82 outpatients (82/173 [47.4%]), of which 85 were male (85/173 [49.42%]). Overall 83 patients (47.9%) still experienced at least one persistent symptom after initial infection. The most commonly reported symptoms were shortness of breath (44/173 [25.4%]), fatigue (43/173 [21%]), anxiety (36/173 [20.8%]), difficulty focusing/brain fog (32/173 [18.5%]), body aches (32/173 [18.5%]), headaches (29/173 [16.8%]), memory loss (25/173 [14.5%]), cough (23/173 [13.3%]), depression (22/173 [12.7%]), chest pain (19/173 [11%]), palpitations (15/173 [8.7%]), lightheadedness (15/173 [8.7%]), runny nose (12/173 [6.9%]) and loss of taste (11/173 [6.4%]). CONCLUSIONS: In our patient population nearly half of all patients (47.9%) still experienced at least one symptom 12 months after their initial infection. In both patient populations the most common persistent symptoms were shortness of breath, fatigue, anxiety and difficulty focusing/brain fog. The risk factors and pathophysiology of long covid remain unknown, highlighting the importance of further research into the topics. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Nearly half of our patient population still experienced at least one symptom from their COVID-19 infection after one year. This further suggests that infection with COVID-19 may carry a risk of developing long term and possibly permanent sequelae from the virus. As more patients continue to be infected with COVID-19 and subsequently develop long covid, a public health crisis may be looming in the future. This highlights the need for continued public education on COVID-19 as well as the critical importance of widespread vaccination across the world to end the pandemic.

"A COMMUNITY HOSPITAL EXPERIENCE OF PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED FOR COVID-19 AT 6-WEEKS POST-DISCHARGE","TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic is a growing public health concern, warranting extended social distancing as cases top 30 million in the United States. Between March and December 2020, the CDC reported up to 15% of COVID-19 cases necessitated hospitalization, entailing further social isolation. With increased acceptance of mental health's role in physical illness, the following represents a single-center study characterizing the prevalence and severity of depressive symptoms in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at discharge and 6-weeks post-discharge. METHODS: Patients (n= 66, age= 59.45 Â±1.47 years, 58% male) hospitalized for COVID-19 (8.79 Â±0.66 days) at a community hospital were administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to characterize depressive symptoms in the prior 2-weeks. Patients recalled depressive symptoms prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (PR), immediately post-discharge (PD), and 6-weeks post-discharge (PD+6). RESULTS: The mean depressive symptom number experienced more than half the days per week were 1.00 Â±0.18 (PR), 3.82 Â±0.29 (PD), and 2.30 Â±0.25 (PD+6), with a mean PHQ-9 score of 3.50 Â±0.47 (PR), 11.11 Â±0.73 (PD), and 7.30 Â±0.65 (PD+6). Compared to PR, at PD patients reported a significant increase in PHQ-9 score (Z= -6.60, p&lt;0.01) and depressive symptom number (Z= -6.11, p&lt;0.01). At PD+6, significant improvements were noted on both parameters (Z= -5.54, p&lt;0.01 and Z= -5.14, p&lt;0.01 respectively). However, this did not represent a return to PR values, with significant residual depression (Z= -4.39, p&lt;0.01 and Z= -5.38, p&lt;0.01 respectively). PHQ-9 scores were classified as possible Other Depressive Disorder (ODD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) according to interpretation guidelines. At PR, 19.67% of patients experienced substantial depression, with 15.15% characterized as ODD (Mild severity, PHQ-9= 7.50 Â±0.64) and 4.55% as MDD (Moderate severity, PHQ-9= 13 Â±2.00). At PD, 69.70% experienced substantial depression, with a significant increase in the prevalence of ODD (33.34%, Z= -2.35, p&lt;0.05) and MDD (36.37%, Z= -4.01, p&lt;0.01). Symptom severity also increased, warranting category changes in ODD (Moderate, PHQ-9= 9.74 Â±0.81) and MDD (Moderately-severe, PHQ-9= 17.77 Â±0.73). At PD+6, 36.36% of patients still experienced substantial depression, with a significant prevalence reduction in MDD (16.67%, Z= -2.95, p&lt;0.01) but not ODD (19.70%, Z= -1.51, p= 0.13). Symptom severity remained unchanged in MDD (Moderately-severe, PHQ-9= 15.55 Â±0.81) while reducing in ODD (Mild, PHQ-9= 8.85 Â±0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were found to have substantial increased prevalence and severity of depression at discharge. Whilst a moderate reduction was noted 6-weeks post-discharge, depressive symptoms were found to persist. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The present study highlights the importance of addressing and supporting the mental health of hospitalized COVID-19 patients post-discharge.

"TOLUENE-INDUCED ACUTE LUNG INJURY: CASE REPORT","TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Toluene is an aromatic hydrocarbon widely used as a solvent in industrial and commercial products including paints, adhesives, ink, and rubber. It is occasionally used as an inhalant drug for its intoxicating properties. While mostly known for producing neurologic effects, here we report a case of toluene induced acute lung injury. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a medical history of alcohol abuse, depression, congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction presented with one week of weakness and shortness of breath. She had been seen twice in the week prior having tested negative for SARS-COV2. In the emergency department, O2 saturation was 70% with respiratory distress on room air requiring high flow nasal cannula support. Labs were notable for a potassium of 2.7 mmol/L, acute kidney injury, elevated transaminases, lactate of 2.8 mmol/L and leukocyte count of 9800/nL. CT showed diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities involving the lung parenchyma concerning for atypical including viral pneumonia. Upon admission to the ICU she developed worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure requiring intubation.A discussion with the patient's husband revealed she had a history of glue sniffing. She had recently been decreasing her alcohol intake and substituting this with an increased frequency of sniffing both permanent markers and modeling glue. This raised suspicion for chemical pneumonitis secondary to toluene induced acute lung injury. DISCUSSION: Toluene is a highly lipophilic molecule readily inhaled via the lungs and distributed widely throughout the body producing side effects like ethanol intoxication via interfering mainly with GABA receptors. Neurologic manifestations range from euphoria and hallucinations to cognitive dysfunction and ataxia with chronic use. It specifically causes renal tubular acidosis typically manifesting as a normal anion gap hyperchloremic acidosis with hypokalemia. It can also cause hepatic injury and cardiac automaticity and conduction abnormalities.Acute lung injury secondary to toluene has been described but less frequently reported. Toxicity can result in Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS) from acute or chronic exposure to various chemical irritants. All hydrocarbons, including toluene, can cause chemical pneumonitis by direct contact with the pulmonary parenchyma and destroying alveolar and capillary membranes resulting in vascular permeability and edema. Symptoms may include cough, wheezing, respiratory distress, and hypoxia. Bilateral interstitial infiltrates may be delayed for several hours after the development of pneumonitis. There is no specific antidote for toluene toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for toluene and many chemical induced pneumonitides consists of supportive care, supplemental oxygen, bronchodilators, inhaled and systemic glucocorticoids and may require intubation and admission to an ICU in severe cases.

"Predictors of psychological distress in health care staff in qatar during covid-19 pandemic","Background & Objective: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused widespread psychological distress. The aims of the study were a) to assess mental health symptoms experienced by expatriate hospital staff and b) to determine the impact of staff wellbeing interventions specific to pandemic related stress. Methods: The study was conducted from June 2020 until August 2020. A 16-question survey was disseminated online via Survey Monkey to assess the mental health needs of hospital staff during the pandemic. Based on results, a virtual, tiered mental health support model was developed, and staff feedback was collected. Results: Almost 46.2% of respondents (N: 1001) reported at least one mental health symptom in the initial survey. The most common symptoms were anxiety, low mood and feelings of isolation. Being single and in poor health status were predictors of developing mental health symptoms (P &lt;0.01). Female gender was a predictor for experiencing fear of getting infected. Time constraints at work was the most common reason for not accessing mental health support. Conclusions: As in other parts of the world, hospital staff in Qatar experienced mental health symptoms and significant fear related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Being single and in poor health status were risk factors. Mental health interventions at work must take into account time constraints experienced by staff.","Latif, F.; Ahmed, S.

"MARKEDLY ELEVATED TROPONIN WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA WITHOUT ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME","TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: COVID infection can present with diverse manifestations. We present an interesting case of very high troponin elevation in patient with COVID infection without obvious reason for troponin elevation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old man with history of HTN, DM2, CAD (CABG in 2009, percutaneous vascularization of RCA with multiple DES in 2018), NSTEMI- 1 year ago, PVD, status post left BKA, ESRD on HD presented with 1 week of watery diarrhea after being tested positive for COVID. He denied chest pain, had minimal SOB. He received first dose of COVID vaccine 2 weeks prior. Vital signs: afebrile, BP 145/68 mmhg, HR 75 beats/min, RR 20/min, oxygen saturation 90% on RA and 96% on 3L of O2 via NC. PE: R- IJ permanent catheter, L- BKA, lungs clear. Labs: COVID PCR assay (+), D dimer 359 D-DU ng/ml, LDH 330 U/l, ferritin 3207 ng/ml, CRP quant 87 ml/l, SARS-CoV-2 Ig G (RBD) 1.14 S/CO, SARS-COV-2 IgM (Beckman) 2.56. troponin (AccuTnI) 13.46 ng/ml, CPK normal, Cr 7.5 (at the baseline), EKG - sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, negative T waves in lateral leads and ST depression up to 1 m in anterior leads, no changes from old EKG, CXR - Increased b/l pulmonary opacities compatible with atypical/viral pneumonia. The most recent ECHO 1 year ago â€“ mild LV dysfunction with thin and akinetic inferior and basal posterior walls, LVEF 50%. Patient was already on aspirin, plavix, statin and that treatment was continued during hospital course. COVID pneumonia was treated with dexamethasone and convalescent plasma versus placebo (VA Cures- 1 Trial). His hospital stay was uneventful, he remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic and was discharged home DISCUSSION: Our patient has known history of CAD and ESRD which are well known cause for elevated troponin. However his Cr level was at his baseline and his previous troponin levels were never this high even when he had NSTEMI, it was only 1.44 ng/ml. During this admission with Covid infection his troponin level was as high as 13.46 ng/ml and trended down to 4.15 ng/ml on discharge, his baseline level of troponin is 0.03-0.88 ng/ml. Reasons for such a high level of troponin can be due to Type II MI or myocarditis. In the settings of COVID infection it has been suggested that troponemia can be due to microvascular damage occurring in the heart with perfusion defects, vessel hyperpermeability, vasospasm and high cytokine levels may represent the key player of myocardial injury (1). Our patient did not have a very severe form of COVID pneumonia that required intubation in fact, he was saturating well on minimal oxygen requirements. He remained asymptomatic with no new interval EKG changes or any other signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). CONCLUSIONS: Serum Troponin can be significantly elevated in the setting of COVID infection and in the absence of ACS.

"Sleep quality in patients over 65 years of age in the covid-19 pandemic","Introduction: While Covid-19 affects people of all ages, elderly patients are at the highest risk. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused sleep disorders and mental health problems as well as physical symptoms. Materials and Methods: A total of 142 patients, 71 Covid-19 patients hospitalized in the quarantine service and 71 non-covid, were included in the study. Patients were divided into groups of hospitalized in the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards and by age (under 65 and over). The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep quality, the Beck Depression Index to measure the level of depressive symptoms, and the Beck Anxiety Index to measure the level of anxiety symptoms. Results: The sleep quality of those hospitalized in the COVID-19 ward was worse, and their anxiety and depression symptom scores were higher (p = 0.003, p = 0.011, and p = 0.018). The sleep quality of patients over 65 years of age was significantly worse than that of patients under 65 years of age (p &lt;0.001), and anxiety and depression symptom scores of patients over 65 years of age were significantly higher than those of patients under 65 years of age (p &lt;0.01, p &lt;0.01) Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety and depression symptoms were observed and sleep quality was deteriorated in patients aged &gt;65 years who were placed in quarantine. Hence, this group of patients should be closely monitored in terms of psychological disorders and sleep disorders. If necessary, psychological support and medical treatment should be provided.","Karaogullarindan, A.; Erkan, S.

"BUPRENORPHINE-NALOXONE-INDUCED NONCARDIOGENIC PULMONARY EDEMA","TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Buprenorphine-naloxone is used to treat chronic pain and opioid use disorder. Each medication in this combination has been associated with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Here we report the case of a 56-year-old woman treated for chronic pain with buprenorphine-naloxone, and a history of multiple hospitalizations for pulmonary edema. Her buprenorphine-naloxone was held on admission and her symptoms improved gradually with supportive care. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old woman with past history significant for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic pain treated with buprenorphine-naloxone presented to the emergency department via ambulance for altered mental status and worsening dyspnea for 3 days. Upon arrival to the ED she was tachypneic with a SpO2 of 50% on room air and required non-invasive ventilation. Physical exam revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally and no peripheral edema. Laboratory data was significant for an elevated D-dimer and BNP. Covid-19 screening was negative. Chest x-ray showed diffuse hazy opacities. CTA chest was negative for pulmonary embolism, but did show extensive parenchymal opacities and diffuse ground glass densities bilaterally. Steroids and antibiotics were initiated, and buprenorphine-naloxone was discontinued.She described several similar prior hospitalizations, but denied ever receiving a diagnosis. Echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction and grade II diastolic dysfunction. Infectious and vasculitis etiologies were ruled out. The patient declined bronchoscopy. Records from prior hospitalizations revealed non-diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage and wedge biopsies. Environmental exposure was ruled out via a peer reviewed questionnaire and negative allergen testing. With no clear etiology, the patient's hypoxia improved. We propose that the patient's presentation was secondary to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema induced by buprenorphine-naloxone. DISCUSSION: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is an acute process resulting in hypoxia secondary to an increase in capillary permeability. Major causes include ARDS, pulmonary embolism, TRALI, and opioid overdose, but many other etiologies have been implicated. Buprenorphine, like other opioids, is a known cause of pulmonary edema (1). Naloxone induced pulmonary edema, while rare, has also been described (2). A review of the literature was not able to find buprenorphine-naloxone combination as a cause of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. We believe this patient's pulmonary edema may have been secondary to this medication's opioid effects, naloxone effects, or possibly an allergic reaction. Given the wide use of this medication physicians should be made aware of this possible complication. CONCLUSIONS: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is a potential complication of buprenorphine-naloxone. REFERENCE #1: Thammakumpee G, Sumpatanukule P.

"AN ALREADY SICK HEART: A CASE OF FATAL SARS-COV-2 MYOCARDITIS","TOPIC: Cardiovascular Disease TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) myocarditis has recently been described in case reports. A systematic review in early 2021 found fourteen case reports of myocarditis or myopericarditis secondary to this viral infection. We describe an interesting case of proven non-ischemic cardiac dysfunction in the setting of acute infection. Despite steroid treatment, which has been suggested to have favorable outcomes, our patient did not survive. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 77-year-old man with extensive electrophysiologic and ischemic cardiac disease who presented to the hospital for generalized weakness, malaise, and shortness of breath. The patient's cardiac history was significant for atrial flutter s/p ablation, coronary artery disease s/p coronary artery bypass graft in the distant past, peripheral artery disease s/p right lower extremity revascularization, and carotid stenosis s/p carotid endarterectomy. SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was positive. The patient had increasing hypoxia which required non-invasive ventilation and eventually, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The hospital course was complicated by the development of persistent chest pain associated with elevated cardiac enzymes. EKG showed diffuse ST-segment depressions. An echocardiogram revealed diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and a reduced ejection fraction of 20% which was not present previously. In this setting, the patient was ruled in for acute coronary syndrome and underwent cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated patent grafts and no significant obstructive disease. A presumptive diagnosis of myocarditis was made. The patient's clinical status deteriorated despite optimal medical treatment, and he developed hemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation that did not respond to pharmacologic treatment or cardioversion and resulted in cardiogenic shock and, ultimately, his death. DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis has been described in select case reports internationally. Many of these cases are described in patients with no previously identified comorbid conditions. This case suggests that in patients with underlying electrophysiologic dysfunction, SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis is associated with poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the heart is unclear and includes myocarditis or myopericarditis. In our patient, cardiac catheterization which was performed during his hospitalization confirmed no ischemic disease and suggested the presence of myocarditis which was ultimately fatal in the setting of refractory cardiogenic shock. Further research is needed into the optimal management of myocarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2. REFERENCE #1: Sawalha K, Abozenah M, Kadado AJ, et al.

"TAKOTSUBO CARDIOMYOPATHY TRIGGERED BY CORONAVIRUS NL63 IN A COVID-19 PANDEMIC","TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Global Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Stress-induced cardiomyopathy cases have increased with COVID-19 pandemic, whether as a direct cardiac cause of SARS CoV2 infection or as a consequence of prolonged social isolation and multiple factors disrupting mental health. Among the different types of Coronaviruses, NL63 usually tends to present with mild respiratory and systemic symptoms. This case uniquely demonstrates how other members of the Coronavirus family may also afflict patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: 61-year-old male with history significant for multiple respiratory and urinary infections, CHF, CAD, CABG and recent hospitalization for bacterial pneumonia. Chest CT showed ground glass opacities on that admission though improved from 2 months prior. PCR was positive for HCoV-NL63 and was negative for SARS CoV2. He was admitted to the hospital with a fever, productive cough, shortness of breath and 10 lbs weight loss for two weeks. WBC 5,400 with subtle lymphocytopenia, Hgb 15.3 g/dL, platelets 218,000, normal renal function, PCT normal, Hgb A1C 6.0, and CXR negative for acute lung disease. Due to respiratory symptoms and the ongoing pandemic, he was retested for SARS CoV2, which was negative. EKG was negative for ischemia. CRP was elevated at 2.28 that trended down on Meropenem as prior sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas, Serratia and E. Coli. He had a normal initial Troponin that peaked to 2.94, Echocardiogram showed an EF of 20%, with apical ballooning consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as well as a mobile hyperechoic right atrial structure felt to be a thrombus extending from the SVC and no evidence of endocarditis. An echocardiogram 10 days prior showed an EF of 50-55% with mild diastolic dysfunction without any hyperechoic lesions or valvular abnormalities. On Day 4 he required pressor support while cultures grew fungi for which he was started on fluconazole. Subsequently, Cryptococcus Neoformans was isolated in the CSF and Amphotericin B was added to an increased dose of fluconazole.As he showed signs of volume overload and increased oxygen demands he was treated with loop diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta blockers.He was transferred for a TEE to a tertiary care facility and was treated for 42 days with Amphotericin B, Diflucan and Lactulose for hyperammonemia. He completed 6 month therapy with fluconazole.On return to his PCP he was mentating appropriately, is walker dependent and is undergoing B Cell Phenotype testing given his immunocompromised state and recurrent infections. DISCUSSION: This complicated case higlights the possibility of a Takotsubo due to Coronavirus NL63 in a immunosuppressive state. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a viral respiratory infection due to Coronavirus NL63 presumptively triggered stress induced cardiomyopathy which responded with supportive care during a Covid-19 pandemic in a immunosuppressed patient without evidence of SARS CoV2.

"A CASE OF COVID-19 PRESENTING WITH ENCEPHALOPATHY, POST-INFECTIOUS NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SEQUELAE, AND ACCELERATED WORSENING OF CHRONIC COMORBIDITIES","TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 infection causes a wide range of clinical manifestations. Though the exact mechanism through which COVID-19 affects each system remains poorly understood, the development of a cytokine-mediated systemic inflammatory response could explain the virus's multi-system impact. The effect of COVID-19 on the central nervous system is now well recognized. We present a case of COVID-19 with neuropsychiatric symptoms and accelerated worsening of chronic conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis and depression presented with confusion, hallucinations, and extremity stiffness. Two months ago, he was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia. Since then, he has experienced inability to walk, hallucinatory episodes, and insomnia. Episodes are recurrent with a return to baseline over 24 to 48 hours. He ultimately became non-ambulatory due to worsened joint deformities. On presentation, he was delirious with word repetition, inappropriate response to questions, and was profusely diaphoretic. Extremities were rigid and held in a semi-flexed position. Brisk reflexes were noted in lower extremities. There was no neck stiffness. Vitals and labs were stable. COVID-19 test negative. Non-contrast head CT showed subtle white matter changes. Brain MRI was unrevealing. EEG was mildly abnormal with diffuse background slowing, limited findings due to motion artifact. His symptoms considerably improved overnight, however, he continued to have episodes of disorientation and visual hallucinations with no time-of-day preference. He was managed with a low dose of Seroquel. Neurology diagnosed COVID-19 cerebritis with post-infection sequalae. Patient was referred for long-term physical therapy and rehabilitation. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic created a paradigm shift in global health practices. Initially assumed to mainly affect the respiratory system with symptoms ranging from a mild flu-like illness to an ARDS phenotype, there is now literature evidence of disseminated disease. COVID-19 related encephalopathy occurs in 8.7% hospitalized patients, who are also more likely to have underlying medical co-morbidities. Other neurologic presentations include headache, generalized weakness, motor neuron disease, neuropathy, and seizures. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as personality changes and hallucinations are commonly described in other coronavirus outbreaks. They are now seen in active COVID-19 infection and in the post infectious phase, termed Long-COVID syndrome. Also, this patient with underlying rheumatoid arthritis experienced accelerated disability, likely immune mediated. Timely evaluation, intervention and long-term rehabilitation can improve functional outcomes in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Nervous system involvement in COVID-19 infection is a neurological diagnosis of exclusion in a patient who has tested positive for COVID-19 or has had known COVID-19 exposure.

"A RARE CASE OF MYOPERICARDITIS IN POST-COVID-19 PNEUMONIA","TOPIC: Cardiovascular Disease TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Myopericarditis is inflammation of pericardium and myocardium caused by inflammatory and non-inflammatory etiologies. COVID-19 is known to cause multiple organ complications, including cardiovascular. Cases of myopericarditis have been reported, and believed to be one of the culprits of death in this disease. We present a case of myopericarditis in the setting of post-COVID-19 pneumonia CASE PRESENTATION: 56-year-old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 pneumonia (requiring hospitalization and nasal canula oxygenation one month prior, received 5 days of Remdesivir and 10 days of Dexamethasone);presented with four days of substernal pain, radiating to right neck and chest. On the day of admission, electrocardiogram (ECG) was sinus rhythm without ST changes and troponin was negative two times. During hospitalization, patient had episodes of fever with increased intensity of chest pain. Repeated ECG showed ST elevation in lead I, aVL, V3-V6 with ST depression in lead III;and significantly elevated troponin and pro-BNP. Echocardiogram showed mild diffuse hypokinesis with regional variations, slightly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and normal right ventricle size and function. Patient was started on heparin drip, and underwent emergency left heart catheterization that demonstrated non-obstructive CAD. Cardiac MRI was inconclusive for late gadolinium enhancement due to respiratory motion artifact, but biventricular global hypokinesis and small pericardial effusion were evidenced. Patient persistently had high fever and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP was 406 mg/dL) despite on antibiotics, hence empiric methylprednisolone and IVIG were started. She was planned to get endomyocardial biopsy, however she improved symptomatically with concurrent decreased of inflammatory markers and troponin. Repeat echocardiogram showed normal biventricular function. Patient was discharged from the hospital after 6 days of hospitalization with cardiology and rheumatology follow up. DISCUSSION: Manifestations of myopericarditis are varied, from fatigue and shortness of breath, to severe chest pain and chest tightness. Some patients may develop right-sided heart failure, or even fulminant myocarditis with sepsis. Interestingly, manifestations may occur weeks after recovery from COVID-19. Elevations of both troponin and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) are expected, but ECG may not show ST changes. Echocardiogram may show thickening of the wall, dilatation, and pericardial effusion. Gold standard for diagnosing myocarditis is endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), as recommended by AHA. However, practice is limited due to expertise requirement, risk of contagious spread, and false-negative rate. CONCLUSIONS: Differential diagnosis should always include myopericarditis in acute coronary syndrome, especially after viral infection. REFERENCE #1: Zeng J.-H., Liu Y.-X., Yuan J.

"A CASE OF PRIAPISM IN A MAN ADMITTED TO THE ICU FOR COVID-19 ARDS","TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Fellow Case Reports INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is thought to cause a prothrombotic state with a relatively high rate of associated thromboembolic disease. Priapism has previously been described in a single case report as a potential thrombotic complication of severe COVID-19.1 Priapism, the persistence of an erection not associated with sexual desire, mostly commonly results from ischemic (low-flow or veno-occlusive) causes. Medications and blood dyscrasias are among the most common etiologies of ischemic priapism. Here we report a case of priapism in a patient admitted to the medical ICU for ARDS caused by severe COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man with a past medical history of chronic kidney disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department for worsening dyspnea, nausea and fatigue. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 eight days prior. On arrival, the patient was profoundly hypoxemic despite being placed on high-flow nasal cannula. He was then intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. A chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient became hypotensive and was started on vasopressors. His platelet count was normal and he was maintained on heparin subcutaneously three times per day for DVT prophylaxis. On the morning of hospital day seven, it was noted that the patient had a persistent erection for &gt; 4 hours. He had not received any alpha adrenergic antagonist, antipsychotic, or antidepressant medications.Urology was consulted who subsequently performed a corporal aspiration and irrigation. Approximately 75 cc of dark blood were evacuated, which led to flaccidity of the penis. A corporal blood gas was found to be consistent with ischemia with a pH&lt;6.8, pCO2=86, and a paO2=19. Over the next three days, the patient required three additional aspiration and irrigation procedures due to recurrent priapism, and each time dark blood was drained. A combination of intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine and aspiration on hospital day 10 led to resolution of his priapism. Despite maximal medical management, the patient developed multiorgan failure and expired after a prolonged hospital course. DISCUSSION: This case is the second reported case of priapism in a patient admitted to a medical ICU for severe COVID-19. The patient's priapism was thought to be as a result of a prothrombotic state related to COVID-19. At the time of the diagnosis, the patient had not received any medications associated with priapism and was not on a propofol infusion. Per the patient's partner, he had no known prior episodes of priapism. CONCLUSIONS: Priapism may be a rare thromboembolic complication of severe COVID-19. Prompt recognition of this condition is important as a delay in diagnosis can lead to irreversible penile damage and erectile dysfunction. REFERENCE #1: Lamamri M, Chebbi A, Mamane J et al.

"Financial obstacles and disadvantages of E-Learning from the viewpoint of dammam teachers","The efforts of containing the novel virus (COVID-19) have begun to show signs of psychological impact on teachers and students across the globe. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many school districts have closed for the remainder of the academic year. These closures are unfortunate because, for many students, schools are their only source of trauma-informed care and supports. When schools reopen, they must develop a comprehensive plan to meet their studentsâ€™ the potential mental health needs as social distancing and awareness campaigns can be a double-edged sword, if handled inadequately. This paper evaluated the challenges of teachers in Dammam in e-learning during the period of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic.","Alhomos, M. A.; Sasa, T. H.; Bahtiti, N.

"A CASE OF COVID-19 MYOCARDITIS PRESENTING AS INFERIOR WALL MI","TOPIC: Cardiovascular Disease TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Myocarditis is becoming a more recognized complication of COVID-19 with a recent uptrend in cases around the world. This mostly affects individuals with comorbid conditions with a mean age of diagnosis of 50.4 years. Despite a recent increase in the number of COVID-19 related myocarditis, only a handful of cases in North America have been identified in younger individuals, especially with findings consistent with STEMI on electrocardiogram. CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with sudden onset sharp, substernal, non-radiating chest pain of 30 minutes duration. He reported no associated fever, shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection two weeks prior to presentation. Initial work-up in the ED showed sinus bradycardia with ST elevation of 2mm in the inferior leads along with elevated troponin of 52 ng/L. Chest x-ray was unremarkable. Aspirin, ticagrelor, atorvastatin and bivalirudin was started. Emergent coronary angiography showed mildly impaired left ventricle systolic function with non-occlusive coronary arteries. A cardiac MRI showed hypokinesis of the inferior wall of the left ventricle, consistent with acute myocarditis. An echocardiogram at four weeks follow-up showed mild/moderate LV systolic dysfunction with EF of 45%. Patient was started on carvedilol and captopril, with complete resolution of symptoms reported on subsequent visit. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 related myocarditis has seen recent upward trends;however, little is known about the pathophysiologic mechanisms. Likely possibilities include a combination of direct viral injury as well as cardiac damage secondary to the host's immune response. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings including changes in EKG and cardiac biomarkers with impaired cardiac performance on echocardiography and/or cardiac MRI. EKG is non-sensitive for diagnosis and can present with variable findings including bundle branch block, QT prolongation, bradyarrhythmia with advanced atrioventricular nodal block and ST elevation or depression, which can be confused as acute myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: COVID 19 related myocarditis is becoming increasingly common, however little is known about pathophysiologic mechanism. Troponin, which has been found elevated in most cases of cases of COVID related myocarditis, making it difficult to distinguish from acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, in severe patients, both ACS and acute myocarditis may present together because of procoagulant and inflammatory nature of COVID-19 infection REFERENCE #1: COVID-19 and Myocarditis: What Do We Know So Far?o Ashar Pirzada, MD, MSc, a Ahmed T.

"Digital Mental Health Services: Moving From Promise to Results","The papers in this special issue make a compelling case for the value of digital mental health services (DMHS;including technology-based interventions, assessments, and prevention programs) to help address some of the currently unmet needs in mental health care. At the same time, the papers highlight the work that needs to be accomplished for DMHS to fulfill their promise. We review the papersâ€™ contributions in terms of (a) the imperative to increase access to evidence-informed, high-quality care, especially for underserved populations, both in the United States and globally;(b) ways to use DMHS to improve the ways that clinical care is provided to make treatment provision more effective and efficient;and (c) the current state of the research on DMHS for emotional disorders. We then consider lessons learned and recommendations to move the field forward, such as increasing (and making transparent) the research base on DMHS, adopting regulatory standards for DMHS, attending carefully to training issues for DMHS and best practices for dissemination and implementation, designing specifically for digital platforms, and being intentional about efforts to reduce disparities regarding who benefits from DMHS.","Teachman, Bethany A.; Silverman, Alexandra L.; Werntz, Alexandra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.06.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Cognitive and Behavioral Practice;2021.; Publication details: Cognitive and Behavioral Practice;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20193,""

"Potential risks and pharmacological safety features of hypnotics Music therapy as a non-drug way to improve sleep quality","Sleep is critical to maintaining the immune system and contributes to physical and mental health. Covid-19 crisis has affected the habits of billions of people around the world. Compliance with quarantine restrictions and self-isolation led to an increase in the occurrence of post-traumatic stress, confusion and anger among the population, while social isolation and changes in the daily routine lead to an increased level of anxiety, panic attacks, irrational fears directly negatively affect the quality of sleep. The aim of this work was to analyze the drug and non-drug approaches that are used to improve the quality of sleep in humans. Analyze the pharmaco-safety and potential risks when taking medications intended for pharmacological correction of sleep. Materials and methods. Analysis of scientific publications on drug and non-drug approaches used to improve the quality of sleep in people over the past 10 years on the PubMed platform;analysis of pharmacological safety and potential risks of hypnotics. Results and discussion. Therefore, unfortunately, at the present time there is no ideal hypnotic that would induce sleep without changing its normal structure and side effects. All hypnotics should not be prescribed to patients snoring during sleep, since profundosomnia (deepening sleep) can increase the manifestations of sleep apnea syndrome, myocardial and brain hypoxia. The duration of the appointment of sleeping pills â€“ no more than 3 weeks. Music has been successfully used as a complementary therapy in various fields of medicine. Music can also improve the quality of sleep and reduce pain for the patient, given the subsequent reduction in the effects of sedatives, which will lead to faster weaning from medical ventilation and faster recovery. Therefore, music is a non-drug highly effective method for improving the quality of sleep on a subjective and objective level.","Kateryna, K.; Svitlana, D.; Andriy, D.; Evgeniya, S.; Viktoriia, H.; Viktoriia, V.; Dmitriy, Z.; Andriy, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Potential+risks+and+pharmacological+safety+features+of+hypnotics.+Music+therapy+as+a+non-drug+way+to+improve+sleep+quality","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Pharmacologyonline; 2:984-991, 2021.; Publication details: Pharmacologyonline; 2:984-991, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20195,""
"The effect of aerobic training versus cognitive behavioral therapy in management of anxiety, depression and stress related to COVID 19 pandemic among university students: A randomized controlled trial","Background: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress increased due to COVID 19 crises. Anxiety and depression are the most common psychiatric disorders. The goal of the current study was to compare the effects of aerobic training to cognitive behavioral therapy on university students suffering from mild to moderate anxiety and depression as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic. Methods: an online invitation to participate in the study was sent through the university system. Fifty four undergraduate students with mild to moderate anxiety and depression voluntarily participated in this study (mean age: 20.77 +/- 1.16) and assigned into two groups;aerobic training aerobic training and cognitive behavioral therapy. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale were used in an online assessment, performed before and after the treatment. For 8 weeks, an online treatment guide and follow-up were provided, with 5 days per week of AT and one session per week of CBT. Results: A significant improvement of DASS scores after treatment in both groups (p &lt;= 0.001). IPAQ scores showed a significant improvement in GA and GB with non-significance in vigorous activities;category. GA showed a significant reduction of anxiety more than GB with a non-significant difference in stress and depression (p &gt;= 0.05). Conclusions: In students with mild to moderate anxiety and depression, both AT and CBT are effective in improving manifestations of anxiety, depression, and stress following the COVID-19 pandemic. Aerobic exercise is more effective in treatment of anxiety.","Hamed, N. S.; Abdel-aziem, A. A.; Muhsen, B. A.; Eid, M. M.; Allam, H. A.; El-Gendy, A. M.; El Sayyad, L.

"Features of students mental health indicators during the academic year under pandemic conditions of COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has rapidly transitioned into a worldwide pandemic. This development has had serious implications for public institutions and raises particular questions for medical universities. The article presented the results of original study the effect of distance learning during COVID-19 pandemic period in the psychological and physical indicators of students who study in medical university. Conducting survey in the pre-session period, which is characterized by the relative stability of the psychoemotional state of students and moderate mental and physical stress, established that the physical and psychological state of the studied group is satisfactory. The study showed that during the session period and quarantine, many students faced a number of negative factors affecting their normal mental health is an increase in the level of stress, anxiety, anxiety, which in turn led to the development of sleep problems in some of the students, which also contributed to decrease in attention, memory, general performance, strengthening, emotional lability. We can assume that distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic period has led to an increase in the stress effect on the nervous system, which in the future may cause the development of diseases of various genesis.

"The psychological effect of covid-19 on pregnant women","Aims We aimed to conduct a narrative review on the direct and indirect psychological implications of COVID-19, amongst the pregnant population. Methods Two medical databases (PUBMED and EMBASE) were analysed and papers describing the psychological impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women were included. Results We identified a total of 35 papers in our study, 14% (5/35) focused on first time mothers, 71% (25 /35) on depression among pregnant persons, 83% (29/35) examined anxiety, 40% (14 /35) described the impact of stress and 43% (15/35) included a discussion on fear. The most common stressors were fear of contracting COVID-19 and uncertainty surrounding the situation Protective factors include having accurate information regarding COVID-19, a higher level of education and a secure income Conclusion COVID-19 has had significant psychological effects amongst the pregnant population including increased levels of anxiety, depression, fear and stress. Many individuals experience suicidal ideation. Social isolation and increasing rates of emotional and physical abuse may be significant factors. Consideration needs to be given to enhance social support and self-care routines. Exercise has shown to alleviate some stress, anxiety and other subjective symptoms.

"What Is Known about Community Pharmacy-Based Take-Home Naloxone Programs and Program Interventions? A Scoping Review","A variety of new sources describing community pharmacy-based take-home naloxone (THN) programs have emerged recently in the literature. There is a need to define the types of take-home naloxone programs being offered to support future research designs in implementing and evaluating standardized programs that fill pharmacist and patient knowledge gaps and lift current barriers for optimal community pharmacy naloxone provision. The objective of this paper is to summarize the literature on community pharmacy-based THN programs, including specific program interventions used to increase naloxone dispensing, naloxone availability and dispensing patterns, facilitators and barriers for the THN programs, and knowledge gaps. Online databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) and a search of the grey literature were used to identify eligible sources. Sources were screened by two reviewers for eligibility in COVIDENCE software. Both reviewers compared screening results and resolved conflicts through discussion. A data extraction form for all identified full texts was completed by both reviewers and results were compiled through reviewer discussion. Fifty-two sources met the eligibility criteria. The top three barriers identified were: cost/coverage of naloxone, stigma, and education/training for pharmacists. THN program interventions included screening tools, checklists, pocket cards, patient brochures, and utilizing the pharmacy management system to flag eligible patients. Patient knowledge gaps included naloxone misinformation and lack of awareness, while pharmacists demonstrated administrative, clinical, and counselling knowledge gaps. Naloxone availability was found to be highly variable, where independent and rural pharmacies were less likely to stock or dispense naloxone. Further, pharmacies located in districts with higher rates of opioid overdose deaths and lower household income were also less likely to have naloxone available. This review identified multiple new programs, showcasing that the implementation and evaluation of THN programs are an expanding area of research. Future research should focus on implementing and evaluating a THN program through a randomized controlled trial design that incorporates solutions for the barriers and knowledge gaps identified in this study.","Cid, Ashley; Daskalakis, George; Grindrod, Kelly; Beazely, Michael A","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9010030","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pharmacy (Basel);9(1)2021 Feb 02.; Publication details: Pharmacy (Basel);9(1)2021 Feb 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20204,""
"Use of a Guided Imagery Mobile App (See Me Serene) to Reduce COVID-19-Related Stress: Pilot Feasibility Study","BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to concerns about mental health resulting from regional and national lockdowns, social isolation, job loss, and concern about disease exposure. OBJECTIVE: We describe results of the pilot feasibility study of the See Me Serene mHealth app. The app provides users with immersive, vivid, nature experiences to reduce stress and anxiety related to COVID-19 and other isolation. The goals of the study were to develop the See Me Serene app and test the feasibility and acceptability of study procedures, and explore the potential impact of the app on stress and anxiety. METHODS: We developed and tested the See Me Serene app and our study procedures for feasibility, and gathered preliminary data with a goal of 100 participants. The research was conducted in 2 phases: (1) development and internal testing of the app; and (2) feasibility and pilot testing with participants recruited online through earned media (eg, news stories), presentations at a university campus, and social media (eg, online sharing of earned media and presentations). The feasibility study employed a mixed methods, within-subjects, pre-/posttest design. At baseline and 30-day follow-up, we assessed stress-related variables via validated self-report measures and saliva samples for determination of cortisol concentrations. RESULTS: We met or surpassed all our feasibility benchmarks for recruitment (101 participants recruited), retention (91% [90/99] of 30-day assessment completed), and data collection (99 participants completed all baseline data; 85% [84/99] of salivary cortisol samples returned). Participants adhered to the intervention. On average, participants listened to 48.2 audio files over 30 days or approximately 1.6 audio files per day. Participants were satisfied with the app, with 87% (78/90) rating the app as helpful in dealing with stress and anxiety. The app showed the potential to reduce stress, anxiety, loneliness, and worry. We did not find significant differences (P=.41) in cortisol levels over time. Our findings suggest that future research is warranted to test the efficacy of the See Me Serene app with a representative, diverse sample. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for evidence-based and easily disseminable stress-reduction interventions. See Me Serene is a feasible intervention and has the potential to reduce stress related to COVID-19 and other forms of social isolation. More research on See Me Serene is warranted.","Gordon, Judith S; Sbarra, David; Armin, Julie; Pace, Thaddeus W W; Gniady, Chris; Barraza, Yessenya","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/32353","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(10): e32353, 2021 Oct 04.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(10): e32353, 2021 Oct 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20205,""
"Supporting Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic Using a Digital Behavior Change Intervention: An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Pre-Post Intervention Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is taking a toll on people's mental health, particularly as people are advised to adhere to social distancing, self-isolation measures, and government-imposed national lockdowns. Digital health technologies have an important role to play in keeping people connected and in supporting their mental health and well-being. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health and social services were already strained. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the 12-week outcomes of the digitally delivered Gro Health intervention, a holistic digital behavior change app designed for self-management of mental well-being, sleep, activity, and nutrition. METHODS: The study used a quasi-experimental research design consisting of an open-label, single-arm, pre-post intervention engagement using a convenience sample. Adults who had joined the Gro Health app (intervention) and had a complete baseline dataset (ie, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were followed up at 12 weeks (n=273), including 33 (12.1%) app users who reported a positive COVID-19 diagnosis during the study period. User engagement with the Gro Health platform was tracked by measuring total minutes of app engagement. Paired t tests were used to compare pre-post intervention scores. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between minutes of active engagement with the Gro Health app and changes in scores across the different mental health measures. RESULTS: Of the 347 study participants, 273 (78.67%) completed both the baseline and follow-up surveys. Changes in scores for anxiety, perceived stress, and depression were predicted by app engagement, with the strongest effect observed for changes in perceived stress score (F1,271=251.397; R2=0.479; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: A digital behavior change platform that provides remote mental well-being support can be effective in managing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress during times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. The outcomes of this study may also support the implementation of remote digital health apps supporting behavior change and providing support for low levels of mental health within the community.","Summers, Charlotte; Wu, Philip; Taylor, Alisdair J G","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/31273","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(10): e31273, 2021 Oct 06.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(10): e31273, 2021 Oct 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20206,""
"A Guided Internet-Based Problem-Solving Intervention Delivered Through Smartphones for Secondary School Pupils During the COVID-19 Pandemic in India: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: ""POD Adventures"" is a gamified mental health intervention delivered via a smartphone app and supported by counsellors for a target population of secondary school students in India. This paper describes the protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial of a remotely delivered version of the intervention in the context of COVID-19 restrictions. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives are to assess the feasibility of research procedures and intervention delivery and to generate preliminary estimates of the effectiveness of the intervention to inform the sample size calculation of a full-scale trial. METHODS: We will conduct a parallel, 2-arm, individually randomized pilot controlled trial in 11 secondary schools in Goa, India. This pilot trial aims to recruit 70 participants with a felt need for psychological support. Participants will receive either the POD Adventures intervention delivered over 4 weeks or usual care comprising information about local mental health services and national helplines. Outcomes will be assessed at two timepoints: baseline and 6 weeks post randomization. RESULTS: The first participant was enrolled on January 28, 2021, and 6-week assessment completed on April 4, 2021. Owing to a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, schools in Goa were closed on April 22, 2021. Trial participants are currently receiving the intervention or completing follow-up assessments. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial will help understand the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a remotely delivered digital mental health intervention in a low-resource setting. Our findings will be used to design future trials that can address difficulties of accessing psychosocial support in-person and support wider efforts to scale up evidence-based mental health interventions for young people.

"Attitudes About COVID-19 and Health (ATTACH): Online Survey and Mixed Methods Study","BACKGROUND: Behavioral mitigation strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in sweeping lifestyle changes, with short- and long-term psychological, well-being, and quality of life implications. The Attitudes About COVID-19 and Health (ATTACH) study focuses on understanding attitudes and beliefs while considering the impact on mental and physical health and the influence of broader demographic and geographic factors on attitudes, beliefs, and mental health burden. OBJECTIVE: In this assessment of our first wave of data collection, we provide baseline cohort description of the ATTACH study participants in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Mexico. Additionally, we assess responses to daily poll questions related to COVID-19 and conduct a cross-sectional analysis of baseline assessments collected in the UK between June 26 and October 31, 2020. METHODS: The ATTACH study uses smartphone app technology and online survey data collection. Participants completed poll questions related to COVID-19 2 times daily and a monthly survey assessing mental health, social isolation, physical health, and quality of life. Poll question responses were graphed using 95% Clopper-Pearson (exact) tests with 95% CIs. Pearson correlations, hierarchical linear regression analyses, and generalized linear models assessed relationships, predictors of self-reported outcomes, and group differences, respectively. RESULTS: By October 31, 2020, 1405, 80, and 90 participants had consented to participate in the UK, United States, and Mexico, respectively. Descriptive data for the UK daily poll questions indicated that participants generally followed social distancing measures, but worry and negative impacts on families increased as the pandemic progressed. Although participants generally reported feeling that the reasons for current measures had been made clear, there was low trust that the government was doing everything in its power to meet public needs. In the UK, 1282 participants also completed a monthly survey (94.99% [1326/1396] White, 72.22% [1014/1404] female, and 20.12% [277/1377] key or essential workers); 18.88% (242/1282) of UK participants reported a preexisting mental health disorder, 31.36% (402/1282) reported a preexisting chronic medical illness, and 35.11% (493/1404) were aged over 65; 57.72% (740/1282) of participants reported being more sedentary since the pandemic began, and 41.89% (537/1282) reported reduced access to medical care. Those with poorer mental health outcomes lived in more deprived neighborhoods, in larger households (Ps<.05), had more preexisting mental health disorders and medical conditions, and were younger than 65 years (all Ps<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Communities who have been exposed to additional harm during the COVID-19 pandemic were experiencing worse mental outcomes. Factors including having a medical condition, or living in a deprived neighborhood or larger household were associated with heightened risk. Future longitudinal studies should investigate the link between COVID-19 exposure, mental health, and sociodemographic and residential characteristics.","Hood, Anna M; Stotesbury, Hanne; Murphy, Jennifer; KÃ¶lbel, Melanie; Slee, April; Springall, Charlie; Paradis, Matthew; Corral-FrÃ­as, Nadia SaraÃ­; Reyes-Aguilar, Azalea; Cuellar Barboza, Alfredo B; Noser, Amy E; Gomes, Stacey; Mitchell, Monica; Watkins, Sharon M; Butsch Kovacic, Melinda; Kirkham, Fenella J; Crosby, Lori E","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29963","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(10): e29963, 2021 Oct 07.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(10): e29963, 2021 Oct 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20208,""
"Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH): Protocol for a Prospective Observational Study","BACKGROUND: Chronic lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are characterized by exacerbations. They are unpleasant for patients and sometimes severe enough to cause hospital admission and death. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable populations with these disorders are at high risk, and their routine care cannot be done properly. Remote monitoring offers a low cost and safe solution for gaining visibility into the health of people in their daily lives, making it useful for vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring using wearables and mobile phones in patients with pulmonary diseases. The secondary objective is to provide power calculations for future studies centered around understanding the number of exacerbations according to sample size and duration. METHODS: Twenty participants will be recruited in each of three cohorts (COPD, IPF, and posthospitalization COVID). Data collection will be done remotely using the RADAR-Base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapse) mobile health (mHealth) platform for different devices, including Garmin wearable devices and smart spirometers, mobile app questionnaires, surveys, and finger pulse oximeters. Passive data include wearable-derived continuous heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, activity, and sleep. Active data include disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures, mental health questionnaires, and symptom tracking to track disease trajectory. Analyses will assess the feasibility of lung disorder remote monitoring (including data quality, data completeness, system usability, and system acceptability). We will attempt to explore disease trajectory, patient stratification, and identification of acute clinical events such as exacerbations. A key aspect is understanding the potential of real-time data collection. We will simulate an intervention to acquire responses at the time of the event to assess model performance for exacerbation identification. RESULTS: The Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH) study provides a unique opportunity to assess the use of remote monitoring in the evaluation of lung disorders. The study started in the middle of June 2021. The data collection apparatus, questionnaires, and wearable integrations were setup and tested by the clinical teams prior to the start of recruitment. While recruitment is ongoing, real-time exacerbation identification models are currently being constructed. The models will be pretrained daily on data of previous days, but the inference will be run in real time. CONCLUSIONS: The RALPMH study will provide a reference infrastructure for remote monitoring of lung diseases. It specifically involves information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring and the potential of real-time data collection and analysis in the context of chronic lung disorders. It will help plan and inform decisions in future studies in the area of respiratory health. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN16275601; https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16275601.

"Text Message Interventions in Adolescent Mental Health and Addiction Services: Scoping Review","BACKGROUND: The vast majority of adolescent mental health and substance use disorders go undiagnosed and undertreated. SMS text messaging is increasingly used as a method to deliver adolescent health services that promote psychological well-being and aim to protect adolescents from adverse experiences and risk factors critical for their current and future mental health. To date, there has been no comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature on the extent, range, and implementation contexts of these SMS text message interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to map and categorize gaps in the current body of peer-reviewed research around the use of SMS text messaging-based interventions for mental health and addiction services among adolescents. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted according to Levac's adaptation of Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for scoping reviews in six iterative stages. A search strategy was cocreated and adapted for five unique databases. Studies were screened using Covidence software. The PICO (patient, intervention, comparator, outcome) framework and input from multiple stakeholder groups were used to structure and pilot a data extraction codebook. Data were extracted on study methodology and measures, intervention design, and implementation characteristics, as well as policy, practice, and research implications. RESULTS: We screened 1142 abstracts. Of these, 31 articles published between 2013 and 2020 were eligible for inclusion. Intervention engagement was the most common type of outcome measured (18/31), followed by changes in cognitions (16/31; eg, disease knowledge, self-awareness) and acceptability (16/31). Interventions were typically delivered in less than 12 weeks, and adolescents received 1-3 messages per week. Bidirectional messaging was involved in 65% (20/31) of the studies. Limited descriptions of implementation features (eg, cost, policy implications, technology performance) were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The use of SMS text messaging interventions is a rapidly expanding area of research. However, lack of large-scale controlled trials and theoretically driven intervention designs limits generalizability. Significant gaps in the literature were observed in relation to implementation considerations, cost, clinical workflow, bidirectionality of texting, and level of personalization and tailoring of the interventions. Given the growth of mobile phone-based interventions for this population, a rigorous program of large-scale, well-designed trials is urgently required.","MacDougall, Sarah; Jerrott, Susan; Clark, Sharon; Campbell, Leslie Anne; Murphy, Andrea; Wozney, Lori","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/16508","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(1): e16508, 2021 Jan 08.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(1): e16508, 2021 Jan 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20210,""
"COVID-19 pandemic-prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia during COVID-19 lockdown and its associated factors in Karachi, Pakistan","We aimed to determine the frequency of depression, anxiety and insomnia;identify associated factors;and compare these outcomes amongst a privileged and underprivileged class of Pakistan. A cross-sectional online and face to face survey was conducted in Karachi from April 2020 to May 2020. Validated depression (World Health Organization self-reporting questionnaire), anxiety (general anxiety and depression scale) and insomnia (insomnia severity index) scales were used. Out of 447 participants, the majority were less than 30 years (63.8%) and females (57.7%);20.8% study participants belonged to poor or very poor socioeconomic status;17% respondents were from lower middle status and 38% belonged to the higher middle or rich class. Depression, anxiety and insomnia were identified in 30%, 30.63% and 8.5% of participants, respectively. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among privileged people was 37.8%, 16.6% and 11.3% respectively whereas among underprivileged were 17.8%, 16.6% and 4.1% respectively. There were significant differences in frequencies of depression (p&lt;0.001), anxiety (p&lt;0.001) and insomnia (p=0.009) among the privileged and underprivileged classes. We found a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among both the privileged and underprivileged Pakistani population and a policy needs to be devised to ensure the mental health of Pakistani population.","Palla, A.

"Domestic violence in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","Domestic violence causes a variety of adverse consequences for physical and mental health. While this kind of violence is also highly prevalent at other times, preliminary evidence suggests that it may be of particular relevance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Provisional studies and reports point to possible changes in prevalence figures and the extent of injuries inflicted. In Germany, recent statistics indicate that while there is an actual decline in prevalence, this decline contrasts starkly with the severity of the injuries observed. The data currently available are still not very reliable. The apparent decline in the number of cases should therefore be regarded with extreme caution. lt is safe to assume a high number of unreported cases and an attendant increase in the figures over time. Irrespectively of this, prevention of domestic violence and care for those affected must of course also be assured in a pandemic. Both adaptation to the exceptional circumstances and a stepping-up of information an the relevant help services are of crucial significance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (German) Hausliche Gewalt ist mit einer Vielzahl korperlicher und psychischer Gesundheitsfolgen verknupft. Wahrend hausliche Gewalt auch zu anderen Zeiten hoch pravalent ist, lassen erste Hinweise vermuten, dass sie im Kontext der COVID-19-Pa ndem ie von besonderer Relevanz ist. In der Tat deuten vorlaufige Studien und Berichte aufVeranderungen u. a. bezuglich der Pravalenzen und des Ausmases der Verletzungen hin. In Deutschland implizieren die jungsten Zahlen einen Ruckgang der Falle hauslicher Gewalt. Dieser Ruckgang steht jedoch in deutlichem Gegensatz zur Schwere der beobachteten Verletzungen. Die aktuelle Studienlage ist noch wenig belastbar. Die scheinbar sinkenden Fallzahlen sollten daher mit groster Vorsicht interpretiert werden. Es wird von einer hohen Dunkelziffer ausgegangen und ein zeitlich verzogerter Anstieg erwartet. Ungeachtet dessen mussen die Pravention von hauslicher Gewalt und die Versorgung Betroffener auch in Zeiten einer Pandemie gewahrleistet werden. Dabei sind die Anpassung an die ausergewohnlichen Umstande sowie die Bekanntmachung der entsprechenden Hilfeangebote zentral.

"Psychological state characteristics of patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia in three months after hospital discharge","COVID-19 (The 2019 Corona Virus Disease) is a highly contagious infectious disease that affects the functioning of many organs and systems. The severe cases of the disease contributes to the development of anxiety-depressive and stressful symptoms that are factors make it difficult to recover. Objective. To study the presence, prevalence of signs of anxiety, depression, stress and their relationship with cardiovascular diseases among patients who have undergone confirmed COVID-19-associated pneumonia 3 months after discharge. Material and methods. The collection of material was carried out as part of the study â€œOne-year cardiovascular observation of patients after COVID-19-associated pneumoniaâ€. The study included 103 patients aged 18 to 85 years (mean age 46.6Â±15.8 years) who had undergone confirmed COVID-19-associated pneumonia 3 monthsÂ±2 weeks after discharge from the hospital including 51 (49.1%) woman. The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales were used to assess the signs of anxiety and depression, respectively. The minimum value of anxiety and depression was considered a total score of 5 points. Signs of stress were assessed using Stress Severity Scale 10;the minimum threshold value was 30 point. Results. Signs of anxiety and depression were found in approximately the same number of patients (29.1 and 27.2%, respectively), a combination of signs of anxiety and depression â€” in 18.4% of patients, stress â€” in 8.7% of patients. In terms of clinical characteristics, no significant differences were found between the groups of men and women. The prevalence of depression signs differed significantly depending on gender: significantly more often in women (p=0.023). The value of the median scores of the PHQ-9 questionnaire in the group of women is significantly higher than in the group of men (3.00 [1.00;8.00] and 1.00 [0;3.75], respectively;p=0.006). Logistic regression analysis showed that female gender increases the likelihood of depression by 2.83 times (95% CI 1.35-7.08). Despite the fact that there were no differences in gender in assessing the prevalence of anxiety (18.4 and 10.7% for men and women, respectively;p=0.072) when comparing the values of the median scores of the GAD-7 questionnaire in groups of men and women, the difference was statistically significant (1.00 [0;4.00] and 3.00 [2.00;7.00], respectively;p=0.001). Signs of stress among married people were less common compared with unmarried (2.9% versus 5.8%;p=0.037). Conclusion. Signs of anxiety or depression are characteristic of more than a quarter of patients who have had proven COVID-19-associated pneumonia 3 months after discharge from the hospital. Women experience symptoms of depression 3 times more often than men do. Unmarried patients tend to experience more stress. It seems expedient to organize treatment and prophylactic work with patients who have undergone hospitalization for COVID-19-associated pneumonia using methods of psychological correction and psychotherapy.

"Predictors of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms from the COVID-19 outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented global crisis, with dramatic changes in people's living conditions and mental health. The aim of this study is to establish predictors of depression, anxiety and stress in people affected by the epidemiological outbreak of COVID-19. Participants comprised 2,376 individuals over 18 years old, 79.6% women, who answered the Scale of Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS-21), in addition to scales to assess subjective severity, the search for social support and data related to COVID-19. It was observed that their main predictors were younger age, sleep problems, feeling lonely, not talking about their fears and subjective severity. The conclusion is that there are population groups at risk of experiencing higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress, which evidences the need to develop prevention and intervention strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the pandemic.

"Pre-pandemic mental health and disruptions to healthcare, economic and housing outcomes during the covid-19 pandemic: Evidence from 12 uk longitudinal studies","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives and livelihoods, and people already experiencing mental ill health may have been especially vulnerable. Aims Quantify mental health inequalities in disruptions to healthcare, economic activity and housing. Method We examined data from 59 482 participants in 12 UK longitudinal studies with data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Within each study, we estimated the association between psychological distress assessed pre-pandemic and disruptions since the start of the pandemic to healthcare (medication access, procedures or appointments), economic activity (employment, income or working hours) and housing (change of address or household composition). Estimates were pooled across studies. Results Across the analysed data-sets, 28% to 77% of participants experienced at least one disruption, with 2.3-33.2% experiencing disruptions in two or more domains. We found 1 s.d. higher pre-pandemic psychological distress was associated with (a) increased odds of any healthcare disruptions (odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% CI 1.20-1.40), with fully adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.24 (95% CI 1.09-1.41) for disruption to procedures to 1.33 (95% CI 1.20-1.49) for disruptions to prescriptions or medication access;(b) loss of employment (odds ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21) and income (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 -1.19), and reductions in working hours/furlough (odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.09) and (c) increased likelihood of experiencing a disruption in at least two domains (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.18-1.32) or in one domain (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.16), relative to no disruption. There were no associations with housing disruptions (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.03). Conclusions People experiencing psychological distress pre-pandemic were more likely to experience healthcare and economic disruptions, and clusters of disruptions across multiple domains during the pandemic. Failing to address these disruptions risks further widening mental health inequalities.

"Making Sense of Emotion-Sensing: Workshop on Quantifying Human Emotions","The global pandemic and the uncertainty if and when life will return to normality have motivated a series of studies on human mental health. This research has elicited evidence for increasing numbers of anxiety, depression, and overall impaired mental well-being. But, the global COVID-19 pandemic has also created new opportunities for research into quantifying human emotions: remotely, contactless, in everyday life. The ubiquitous computing community has long been at the forefront of developing, testing, and building user-facing systems that aim at quantifying human emotion. However, rather than aiming at more accurate sensing algorithms, it is time to critically evaluate whether it is actually possible and in what ways it could be beneficial for technologies to be able to detect user emotions. In this workshop, we bring together experts from the fields of Ubiquitous Computing, Human-Computer Interaction, and Psychology to-long-overdue-merge their expertise and ask the fundamental questions: how do we make sense of emotion-sensing, can and should we quantify human emotions?

"Protective factors for mental and psychological wellbeing in australian adults: A review","There is a need to better understand protective factors for mental and psychological wellbeing beyond the absence of disease. The current review sought to synthesise empirical (qualitative and quantitative) evidence on this topic to inform the development of future mental health and wellbeing interventions for Australian adults. Systematic searches of health and behavioural science databases were conducted to identify studies on protective factors for mental and psychological wellbeing in Australian adults. A total of 38 studies were included based on the following criteria: studies conducted in Australia from 2009 to present;articles written in English;articles which reported on empirical research, articles that were peer-reviewed, and research where study participants were Australian adults (&gt;18 years). Data extraction was conducted using Covidence, and design quality was assessed according to the Levels of Evidence hierarchy. There was consistent evidence that components of social capital, physical and other lifestyle factors, individual attributes and creative arts constitute protective factors for mental and psychological wellbeing in Australian adults. The high prevalence of cross-sectional and self-report studies suggests more randomised and longitudinal research is needed. Additional qualitative research would facilitate a more detailed understanding of participants' lived experiences and perspectives. Existing evidence indicates a significant, positive relationship between social capital, physical and other lifestyle factors, individual attributes and creative arts engagement, and mental and psychological wellbeing among particular groups of Australian adults. Implications are considered for the development of interventions that promote mental health and wellbeing across a wide range of Australian regions and populations.

Findings show cross-cutting institutionalization and internalization deficits as a result of limited mastery of ICT skills and training of the personnel, insufficient ICT platforms, mainly, computers, poor internet connectivity and poor investment in digital platforms by the government institutions. An organizational culture that predisposes institutions to change resistance also constrained integration of SDG goals in public organizations.

"Leveraging Nature-based Solutions for transformation: Reconnecting people and nature","Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have rapidly been gaining traction across the research, policy and practice spheres, advocated as transformative actions to jointly address biodiversity loss and climate change. However, there are multiple, alternative ways to conceptualize NbS across those three spheres.To inform the NbS discourses in research, policy and practice, we critically reflect on the prevailing framing of NbS. Although the concept links environmental health to human well-being, we argue that its current dominant framing reinforces a dichotomy between people and nature by highlighting one, external nature working for the benefit of society. For the NbS concept to support transformation, we believe it must embody a reframing of humanâ€“nature relationships towards regenerative relationships between humans and nature.To support the transformative aspirations of NbS, we propose a novel core framing of NbS making explicit the co-dependence of people and nature, which underpins human well-being and environmental health. We highlight how such a framing can support a transformation through influencing beliefs and normative values, and second, through the communication and application of the NbS concept in research, policy and practice.We then elaborate on how such a framing is key to support inclusivity and collaboration between diverse research perspectives, policy objectives across scales and implementation practices to deliver just and successful NbS.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.","Welden, E.

"Status of contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in isolation wards of Huoshenshan hospital","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the status of contamination with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) in isolation wards of Huoshenshan Hospital so as to provide scientific basis for developing reasonable strategies of management of environmental health in isolation wards of COVID-19. METHODS: From Mar 9, 2020 to Mar 29, 2020, the samples were systematically collected from 2 common isolation wards that were randomly selected from Huoshenshan Hospital. The sampling objects included environmental samples, samples from personal protective equipment(PPE) of medical staff and samples from hands of medical staff. The samples were collected by cotton swab wiping method, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing was performed by real time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the testing results were colleted and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 244 samples were collected. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing showed that 1 sample that was collected from bedrail of a patient was tested positive among 171 environmental samples, with the positive rate 0.58%;all of the samples that were collected from PPE of 49 medical staff were tested negative;1 sample that was collected from the hands of a patient was tested positive among 24 samples that were collected from hands of patients and medical staff, with the positive rate 4.17%. CONCLUSION: It is an effective way to reasonably plan for layout of isolation ward and isolation procedure and rigidly implement the systems of environmental disinfection and hand hygiene so as to reduce the degree of contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in isolation wards, cut off the transmission routes of the virus and reduce the risk of exposure to nosocomial infection, meanwhile, it is necessary to strengthen the personal hygiene management during prevention and control of COVID-19.","Zheng, DongChun, Chen, FangYan, Li, DingChen, Zhao, JingYa, Wu, Hao, Yin, DanPing, Chen, Hong, Duan, LiPing, Li, HaiFeng, Han, Li","https://www.google.com/search?q=Status+of+contamination+with+SARS-CoV-2+in+isolation+wards+of+Huoshenshan+hospital","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication details: Chinese Journal of Nosocomiology; 31(14):2236-2240, 2021.; Publication details: Chinese Journal of Nosocomiology; 31(14):2236-2240, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20228,""
"HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS COPING RESPONSES TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN PAKISTAN","&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt; In the last two years, the infectious disease such as COVID-19 create a prodigious uncertainty not only in general population but also in health care professionals. This often leads to emotional distress in general public and particularly in health care professionals. &lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt; During COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, the health care professionals experienced unusual stressors. This study aimed to examine the coping responses, optimism, pessimism and psychiatric morbidity of health professionals serving the COVID-19 patients. &lt;h4&gt;Participants&lt;/h4&gt; Total 87, health care professionals take part in study, whom 36 were physicians and 51 nursing staff. Among these 44 were male, and 43 were female. &lt;h4&gt;Method&lt;/h4&gt; Researchers used cross sectional research design in this study. Physicians and nurses completed self-reported questionnaires. Participants provided demographics data and recorded their responses to self-administered questionnaires. Researchers administered Brief coping orientation to problems experiences (COPE) for assessing the coping strategies, while they assessed psychiatric morbidity through general health questionnaires. Similarly, future expectancy of health care professional was assessed by using life orientation scale. Participants were recruited from quarantine words in two federal government hospitals providing health care services to covid-19 patients in Pakistan. &lt;h4&gt;Result&lt;/h4&gt; The result showed a significant relationship in optimism and problem focus coping style and avoidance coping style. Moreover, male health professionals score high on optimism as compared to female health professionals. While, avoidance coping style were seen higher in female health professional as compare to male. The result revealed that optimism and psychiatric morbidity were significantly positive in health professionals having problem focus and avoidance coping style.","Zaman, Sabir, Irfan, Shahid, Khalid, Shazia, Alemzeb, Hussain, Basharat","https://www.google.com/search?q=HEALTH-CARE+PROFESSIONALS+COPING+RESPONSES+TO+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC+IN+PAKISTAN","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Applied nursing research : ANR;2021.; Publication details: Applied nursing research : ANR;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20229,""
"Social connectedness and homelessness amidst a pandemic: are the social impacts of quarantine on homeless populations being adequately addressed?","While many questions remain unanswered, the current pandemic also presents a number of implications and potential for future interventions with at-risk communities. Understanding the general impact of the pandemic and quarantine measures on homeless populations is essential for keeping the population healthy, but health, medical and social work professionals should also continue to improve their understanding of the importance, and the impact, of social networks and connectivity on homeless and other vulnerable populations. Understanding how the social network disruption caused by quarantine measures influence this and other populations will help us to tailor interventions during and after quarantine to provide the social and emotional supports needed for physical and mental health. Additionally, it is a reminder that the impact of social isolation may have lasting effects on this population, as dealing with the aftermath of these disruptions may take time and intervention for resolution. It can also inform future crises by calling attention to the need for additional supports to be put in place, as well as establishing more diverse social support networks should networks experience disruption. If nothing more, shedding light on the importance of connectivity among homeless populations during times of crisis may help both clinicians and researchers alike in assisting clients as holistic persons, focusing on the inclusion of social and emotional needs in treatment and intervention.","Yoshioka-Maxwell, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Social+connectedness+and+homelessness+amidst+a+pandemic:+are+the+social+impacts+of+quarantine+on+homeless+populations+being+adequately+addressed?","","Database: GIM; Publication details: Hawaii Journal of Medicine and Public Health; 79(11):329-331, 2020.; Publication details: Hawaii Journal of Medicine and Public Health; 79(11):329-331, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20230,""

"The COVID-19 outbreak: Impact on mental health and intervention strategies","Although the psychological and psychiatric implications seem to be a central core of health problems during an emergency, they tend to be underestimated and neglected, generating gaps in intervention strategies and increasing the burden of associated diseases. Moreover, pharmacological treatment concerns arise for psychiatrists and the other specialists who deal with psychiatric patients affected by an infectious disease or with patients with an infectious disease that may develop a number of psychiatric symptoms. The mental health consequences of a pandemic may be related to the sequelae of the disease itself or to the preventive measures aimed at containing the spread of infections. In addition, fear of death, drastic changes in family organization and work routines, closings of schools, companies and public places can play a role. Furthermore, stress derived from working activity or economic losses should not be underestimated. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, first studies have shown the presence of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia in the general population, health-care workers, and people affected by COVID-19. It appears likely that there will be substantial increases in a broad range of other mental disorders, suicide, behavioral disorders, loneliness, domestic violence and child abuse. From these considerations, the evaluation and monitoring of psychological/psychiatric conditions of involved populations, and the provision of focused aid must be part of the care intervention during the initial stage of a pandemic and beyond. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence on how mental health outcomes of COVID-19 outbreak have been measured and managed.

"Public mental health outpatient service at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: Did we have any other choice?","As of May 28, 33072 deaths and 231139 confirmed cases due to the COVID-19 epidemic make Italy one of the most affected countries in the world. Italian Departments of Mental Health (DMHs), agreed by the management of local public health care services, recommended closure of second-level outpatient programs, suggesting to implement phone calls and video conference-based visits only for emergencies or specific urgent patient requests. In this social fragmentation, the area of marginalization/abandonment may be further extended, increasing up the risk of worsening severe mental disorders. Additionally, several Italian psychiatrists asserted that during the pandemic, ""psychiatric patients largely understood the need for social distancing, collaborated on it and did not cause problems"". In this perspective, together with unplanned school closure, mental health of adolescents and children impacts the risk of loneliness, symptoms' recurrence and academic achievement gaps, in a prevention total absence. It is storngly suggested that Italian medical, educational and institutional authorities should implement as soon as possible strategic plans for a progressive re-start of mental health outpatient activities and routine therapeutic-rehabilitation interventions, especially for more vulnerable subgroups, so as not to further defer the no longer deferred.

"Italia Ti Ascolto","The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted individuals' psychological wellbeing resulting in heightened perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. However, a significant issue in accessing psychological care during a lockdown is the lack of access to in-person interventions. In this regard, research has shown the efficacy and utility of psychological app-based interventions. 'Italia Ti Ascolto' (ITA) has been developed as a population tailored internet-based intervention to offer an online professional solution for psychological support needs. The ITA app is available on iOS and Android systems. Users completed a baseline assessment on emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), psychological stress, anxiety, depression, and perceived social support. Participants could select among several one-hour long clinical groups held by expert psychotherapists. After every session, people were asked to complete a quick users' satisfaction survey. Our contribution presents ITA's intervention protocol and discusses preliminary data on psychological variables collected at baseline. Data showed significant associations between emotion regulation strategies, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and level of stress. Moreover, the role of perceived social support is considered. Future developments and implications for clinical practice and treatment are discussed.

"The relationship of different psychological factors with the level of stress, anxiety and depression in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Croatia","The aim of the study was to determine the level of stress, anxiety and depression in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, factors that predict their severity and the degree of worry due to different circumstances in work and family environment. DASS, Brief RCOPE and CD-RISC-10 were administered. The survey was conducted online during May and June 2020 on 135 participants gathered by snowball sampling. The results show slightly higher stress and anxiety levels and equal levels of depression, compared to a non-clinical sample from US research. Resilience is negatively associated with stress, anxiety, and depression, and negative religious coping is positively associated with depression. Also, women show lower levels of depression than men. Regarding circumstances in the work environment, participants express equal concern about the inadequacy of protective equipment, lack of staff and the possibility of their colleagues being infected. They express less concern about endangering their own health and inappropriate equipment use. Regarding the family environment, exposing family members to the risk of infection due to one's work is most stressful. This is followed by the worry about the possibility of self-isolation and the least concern is that behavioural adjustments would influence their close relationships. Participants who are in contact with COVID-19 patients are more concerned about the lack of staff and their health being endangered. Participants in contact with COVID-19 patients, or patients and colleagues who were later diagnosed with COVID-19, are more concerned about staff shortages and that their colleagues may get infected. Singles were more concerned about the inadequacy of protective equipment than participants living with someone else.

"Relationship between coping, anxiety and depression in a Mexican sample during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic","The coping strategies used during the COVID-19 pandemic could explain why certain individuals experience higher levels of anxiety and depression than others. A sample of 747 subjects completed an ad-hoc questionnaire on their habits during the pandemic, the Stress Coping Questionnaire (SCQ) focused on COVID-19;the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). High percentages of the sample recorded moderate and severe levels of anxiety (45.38%) and depression (32.13%), which were higher in women. The regression model explained 30.8% and 33.5% of the variance in anxiety and depression, respectively, with the predictive capacity being greater for women than men. Passive coping strategies made up the regression model, with negative self-targeting having the greatest predictive capacity for both anxiety (R2 = 0.204) and depression (R2 = 0.215). The results reveal the need to work on reinforcing the perception of control over the situation, promoting active coping strategies.

"Inside job: Examining the influence of training on mental health stigma and social distancing among psychology trainees","Mental health stigma and social distancing, the phenomena where individuals distance themselves from those with a mental illness, manifest from negative biases and create barriers to treatment. Although there is large body of published research devoted to uncovering the attitudes and beliefs that perpetuate stigma surrounding mental health within the general population, there is still little known about the pervasiveness of stigmatizing attitudes held by professionals working within the mental health field. Moreover, even less is known about the source of harmful and stigmatizing attitudes held by psychology trainees. Although stigma from any source serves as a barrier to treatment, stigmatizing attitudes and social distancing behaviors exhibited by psychology trainees is arguably more harmful than those held by the general population because trainees are the future of the field and expected to be advocates. This study examined whether psychology doctoral education and training influenced the level of social distancing behaviors and stigmatizing attitudes expressed by first year students or doctoral interns. Findings from this study revealed that training decreases mental health stigma as interns expressed significantly fewer stigmatizing attitudes. Training and education did not significantly influence social distancing behaviors as interns and entry level students expressed similar degrees of social distance. However, those who received more frequent group supervision expressed fewer social distancing behaviors. It appears the current curriculum taught during doctoral programs and internships helps decrease explicitly expressed stigmatizing attitudes by trainees and more frequent group supervision may help students increase awareness of their implicit biases and decrease social distancing behaviors.

"Pediatric obesity and the impact of COVID-19","Epidemiology Adiposity is measured using body mass index (BMI) or weight (kg)/height (m2). Because of growth and development during childhood, BMI percentiles for age and sex as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are used to estimate adiposity, with overweight defined as 85th to less than 95th percentile , obesity 95th percentile or greater, and extreme obesity, 120% of the 95th percentile or at least 35 kg/m2.4-6 Overweight and obesity disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority groups, particularly Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black youth, and obesity prevalence is also associated with poverty.7 The latest data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that from 1999-2000 to 2017-2018, obesity prevalence increased from 15.8% to 19.3% in children aged 6 to 11 years. In addition to family history, the ""thrifty gene hypothesis,"" proposed by David Barker, states that undernutrition in utero causes adaptive metabolic changes in the fetus, such as insulin resistance, that do not match the postnatal extrauterine environment, which has excess calories with decreased physical activity.13,14 This concept of fetal origins of adult disease has been implicated in the association of intrauterine growth restriction and small for gestational age, with increased later cardiometabolic risk.15 Epigenetics has also been implicated, with DNA methylation changes and posttranslational histone modifications causing heritable genetic changes, potentially programming later diseases.16 Early hypernutrition can also be a risk factor, with rapid weight gain in the first 4 to 6 months of life associated with obesity later in childhood.17 In rare cases, genetic syndromes, such as Prader-Willi, Alstrom, and Bardet-Biedl syndromes, and monogenic mutations, such as MC4R, LEP, and POMC mutations, can cause severe obesity, usually characterized by obesity onset before age 5 years. Endocrinologic causes such as hypothyroidism and Cushing Disease are also less common, and generally involve attenuated height or height velocity in addition to excess weight, in growing youth.18 Numerous environmental factors contribute to excess weight gain during childhood: dietary factors, such as consuming more sugar-sweetened beverages, eating larger portions, skipping meals, decreasing intake of fruits and vegetables (which can be related to food insecurity), and consuming more fast food. Mental health concerns, such as depression and anxiety, are also significant potential comorbidities of obesity.27 Pediatrie providers should specifically ask about symptoms of depression-hopelessness, trouble sleeping, lack of interest or motivation, and changes in appetite, as well as anxiety, spurred by loneliness, isolation, and uncertainty.28 This is especially important given the COVID-19 pandemic's exacerbation of many social stressors affecting families, such as food insecurity, poverty, and racial disparities.29 The already strained pediatric mental health infrastructure has been further challenged by the pandemic, making mental health screening by primary care providers all the more important.28 Treatment The mainstay of treatment for pediatric obesity involves behavior modification through increased physical activity, improved nutrition, and decreased sedentary activity.","Magge, Sheela N.

"Efficacy of mindfulness meditation on mental health during the times of COVID'19- A mixed-method study","The current study aims to evaluate the impact of a two-week Online Mindfulness Meditation (MM) intervention on levels of Depression, Stress, and Anxiety and gain insights into participants' motivation and experiences of the intervention. Twenty-five participants (16 females & 9 males) were recruited through web-based advertisement using a random purposive sampling technique. DAS scale was administered before and after the intervention period to identify quantitative changes over time. Further, ten participants (6 females & 4 males) who exhibited significant changes in their quantitative measures were interviewed via video conferencing to understand the particular motivators and experiences of participating;where the responses were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Change in outcome measures over time was examined using Mean, S.D., and paired t-test. Results revealed significant improvements in reducing the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms significantly (all p &gt;0.001) and improvement was sustained at three months follow- up. The qualitative analysis depicted Spiritual inclination and Experience of stress and loneliness as motivation themes for enrolling. Moreover, the lived experience of the participants exhibited three overarching themes -- a. Self- awareness, b. Insight development, c. Social cohesion. The study provides evidence in support of the effectiveness of brief, MM in a non-clinical population and suggests that low-intensity intervention can be used for modulating negative psychological states through easily accessible and non- physical contact training mode. However, more research is needed to confirm and better understand these results and to test the potential of such interventions.

"Evaluation and analysis of coping strategies of medical staff and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria","The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March 2020. The uncertainty and social isolation due to the new virus imply mobilization of personality resources. A comparison of coping strategies of people affected by COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic in Bulgaria, in relation to gender, age, nature of contact with COVID-19 (medical staff or patients) and education was conducted. Out of 113 individuals studied, 74 were medical staff and 38 patients. Three questionnaires, assessing stress level, coping strategies and anxiety were used. Three main coping strategies have been identified: (1) Emotionally focused coping strategies, (2) Proactive coping strategies, and (3) Anticipatory coping strategies. The use of each of the three strategies changed with age, with emotionally focused strategies more common for women, proactive strategies more typical for men, and anticipatory strategies without differences between both sexes, gradually decreasing with age. People between 40- and 60-years old and those with higher education showed low values of emotionally focused strategies and high values of proactive strategies. Respondents evaluated the pandemic as highly threatening and stressful which can be explained by the fact they are patients and healthcare professionals. The study is beneficial for GPs, who are an important link between the patient and inpatient facilities, as it clarifies the psycho-emotional coping strategies of first-line medical staff and patients with COVID-19. The research is a prerequisite for better and adequate primary health care. These results draw attention to the main issues related to mental health of the affected by COVID-19 and are essential for future action and decision-making.","Georgieva, M.; Dimitrova, M.; Marinova, Y.; Dimitrova, G.; Dilkov, D.; Marinov, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Evaluation+and+analysis+of+coping+strategies+of+medical+staff+and+patients+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+Bulgaria","","Database: GIM; Publication details: B'lgarski Meditsinski Zhurnal / Bulgarian Medical Journal; 15(2):49-54, 2021.; Publication details: B'lgarski Meditsinski Zhurnal / Bulgarian Medical Journal; 15(2):49-54, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20247,""
"Psychiatric aspect of infectious diseases and pandemic: A review","Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms and can be transmitted directly or indirectly from one person to another. With direct effects or complications they cause, infectious diseases such as febrile diseases, syphilis, brucellosis, malaria, Lyme Disease, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, rabies and coronavirus disease (COVID) can cause psychiatric symptoms. Medicines such as mefloquine and interferon used in the treatment of infectious diseases can also cause psychiatric symptoms. Infectious diseases such as influenza A viruses and toxoplasma gondii parasite can be present in the etiology of some psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. Psychiatric disorders can also facilitate the spread of infectious diseases. As we have seen in the COVID-19 outbreak, global spread of infectious diseases is called a pandemic. During and after the pandemic, the frequency of psychiatric symptoms increases due to the direct effects of the pandemic or, quarantine and social isolation applied due to the pandemic. These symptoms include depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, anxiety, obsessive symptoms, irritability, loneliness, helplessness, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. There is a high comorbidity between infectious diseases and psychiatric diseases, and clinicians should always consider this condition in epidemics and later periods.

"Reduction in hospitalizations and emergency psychiatric care due to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: Assess the impact of the lockdown measures on hospitalizations and emergency psychiatric care in a capital of a Brazilian state. Methods: Psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency psychiatric attendances carried out between January 7th and May 28th, 2020, were evaluated, covering the periods before and after lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Fortaleza, capital of the state of Ceara, Brazil. The data in the two periods were described and presented in time series graphs. Attendances were also described according to the severity categories. Comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U test and test for proportions. Results: The daily average of hospitalizations and of attendances decreased in the evaluated periods from 16.0 to 10.8 (p &lt; 0.001) and 67.9 to 35.0 (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. This absolute reduction was observed in all categories of severity. No difference was observed in the proportion of severe attendances (2.3% vs. 2.8%;p = 0.207). The proportion of mild cases decreased from 18.6% to 10.7% (p &lt; 0.001) and of intermediate severity cases increased from 79.1% to 86.5% (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The findings showed both a decrease in emergency psychiatric attendances and hospitalizations, which can lead to severe impacts in the absence of counterpart mitigation measures by the local mental health system.

As health-care professionals have been facing particular challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, we furthermore aimed to assess the role of COVID-19 associated burden in the interplay between ACEs and EE. &lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt; During the first lockdown in Germany, a total of 2500 medical healthcare professionals were questioned in a cross-sectional online survey. Questions targeted, among others, sociodemographics, ACEs, COVID-19-associated problems (e.g. increase of workload, worries about relatives and patients) and emotional exhaustion, measured by the respective dimension of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). &lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt; In German health-care professionals, ACEs were associated with a higher EE score. The number of experienced ACEs was associated with the majority of assessed COVID-19-associated problems. An increasing number of ACEs predicted higher EE scores, controlling for gender. The association between ACEs and EE was mediated significantly by COVID-19-associated problems. These included maladaptive coping strategies such as increased smoking, drinking and use of antidepressants/tranquilizers, feeling less protected by measures of the employee or the state, a greater feeling of being burdened by COVID-19-associated problems and greater exhaustion and sleep problems. &lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt; Our findings suggest ACEs as significant risk factor for EE in German health-care professionals. The current pandemic means a significant burden that further pronounces this risk.

"Suicide Trends Varied by Age-Subgroups During the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020 in Taiwan","&lt;h4&gt;Background/Purpose&lt;/h4&gt; The outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented impact on mental health globally. Recent empirical data however, indicated that suicide rates in many countries remained unchanged or even decreased. Existing studies assessed the overall rates and did not stratify by age-subgroups. &lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt; We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the age-stratified (&lt;25, 25-44, 45-64, = 65) trends in monthly suicide rates before (January 1st, 2017 to December 31st, 2019) and after (January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020) the outbreak of COVID-19 in Taiwan. &lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt; We found a slight decrease in overall suicide rates after the outbreak (annual average rates were 16.4 and 15.5 per 100,000 population, respectively, p=0.05). Age-stratified analysis indicated that suicide rates increased in younger (&lt;25) and decreased in the middle age group (25-64 years). In older age groups (=65), an immediate rate decrease was observed followed by a sustained upward trend during the onset of the pandemic. &lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt; Although an overall decrease in annual suicide rates was found after the outbreak, the age-specific subgroup analysis reveals a more nuanced picture.

"Mental health, substance use, and wellbeing in higher education: Supporting the whole student","The ability of students to succeed in higher education and beyond is dependent on their physical and mental wellbeing, and the nation's institutions of higher education are seeing increasing levels of mental illness, substance use, and other forms of emotional distress among their students. Some of the problematic trends have been ongoing for decades. Some have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic consequences. Some are the result of long-festering systemic racism in almost every sphere of American life that are becoming more widely acknowledged throughout society and must, at last, be addressed. Although the causal factors for each have their own idiosyncratic solutions, the increase in mental health and related problems has put tremendous pressure on the capacity of existing traditional college counseling and other support systems to handle the need for their services, leading to what some have called a ""mental health crisis"" on college campuses. Whether this constitutes a genuine crisis or not may be debated, but there is no question that new approaches and strategies are needed to deal with the increasing demand for help. This report lays out a variety of possible strategies and approaches, based on the available evidence on the nature of the issues and what works in various situations. This report presents the findings of the Committee on Supporting the Whole Student: Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Wellbeing in Higher Education and the recommendations it developed that, if followed, would improve the delivery of mental health, wellness, and substance use services by the nation's institutions of higher education. This report also contains the committee's suggestions for further research on student wellbeing and mental health and on the delivery of such services to benefit all students.

"Effectiveness of Online Health Education on Healthy Diets and Regular Exercises in Achieving a Health Related Quality of Life During This Pandemic Era","Introduction: Online health education was the norm to maintain physical distancing during this pandemic era (2020- 2021). Furthermore, the generation 5.0 in this era prefers online communication since they needed to stay at home. On account of these issues, this study aimed to investigate an online health education module on healthy diets and regular exercises in achieving a health related quality of life. Methods: A total of 301 respondents were enrolled. The RAND SF-36 survey questionnaire was used for pre- and post-testing the eight domains of the health related quality of life. The online health education on healthy diets and regular exercises as the intervention were investigated in three phases where all phases were completed in 12 months minimum. Results: The eight domains of the health related quality of life (p=0.05) was achieved. Specifically, the general health (72.700Â±41.1, p0.00915), physical functioning (82.3200Â±51.8, p0.0015), role physical (92.02Â±41.06, p0.001), role emotional (72.706Â±21.12, p0.00), social functioning (96.09Â±48.727, p0.0012), bodily pain (99.3Â±69.128, p0.015), vitality (62.7Â±31.08, p0.0104), and mental health (72.35Â±41.18, p0.00455) were achieved. Conclusion: Using an online module for healthy diets (70.56 Â± 20.93391, 210%) and regular exercises (78.44 Â± 18.85421, 188%) as a strategic intervention was effective (p=0.05) during this pandemic era.

"The challenge of virtual learning","Among adolescents who received mental health services between 2012 and 2015, 35% received these services exclusively from school settings, according to data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.6 More than 1 in 5 (22.1%) of US children have 1 or more mental, emotional, developmental, or behavioral problems.7 During the pandemic, more than 25% of high school students reported worsened emotional and cognitive health. Parents with children aged 5 to 12 years were surveyed as well, and 20% reported that their children experienced worsened mental or emotional health.8 Loneliness and isolation resulting from virtual learning, social distancing, and stay-at-home orders all negatively affected mental health and exacerbated conditions for those who already had previous diagnoses of depression and anxiety.9 As pediatricians see children and adolescents during the summer months this year, it will be of utmost importance to screen patients for developmental, behavioral, and mental health conditions. An MMWR comparing parents of children receiving in-person schooling with parents of remote learners found that parents of children receiving virtual instruction more frequently reported their own emotional distress, difficulty sleeping, loss of work, concern about job stability, childcare challenges, and conflict between working and providing child-care.10 Pediatric clinicians should address the family and provide culturally appropriate social and mental health supports and community resources as much as possible.","Chung, Sandy L.

"Effects of virtual learning environments: A scoping review of literature","The purpose of this scoping review is to isolate and investigate the existing data and research that identifies if the synchronous face-to-face visual presence of a teacher in a virtual learning environment (VLE) is a significant factor in a studentâ€™s ability to maintain good mental health. While the present research on this explicit interaction among VLE implementation and student mental health is limited, the material suggests a framework for strong utilization of VLEs. Overall, our research has shown that authentic, high quality VLEs are ones that have as their primary focus the communication between students and their teachers and between students and their peers. This communication is best generated through synchronous connections where there exists the ability to convey the studentâ€™s immediate needs in real-time. Our research results and discussion will outline how a team approach that brings together teachers, students, administration, counsellors, mental health support staff, instructional designers, and ICT specialists is necessary to create a genuinely enriching VLE where both learning and social-emotional needs can be met. The authors present a case for further study in order to reveal the nature of the interaction among VLEs and student mental health.","Caprara, Laura, Caprara, Cataldo","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effects+of+virtual+learning+environments:+A+scoping+review+of+literature","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Education and information technologies;: 1-40, 2021.; Publication details: Education and information technologies;: 1-40, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20257,""

The NYT writes that federal health officials are calling for returning children to the nation's classrooms as soon as possible, saying the â€œpreponderance of available evidenceâ€ indicates that in-person instruction can be carried out safely. But local officials also must be willing to impose limits on other settings - like indoor dining, bars or poorly ventilated gyms - in order to keep infection rates low in the community at large, researchers at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in an advisory and in a viewpoint article in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Data source: Review of the literature following the standards of PRISMA using the SciELO, LILACS and PubMed databases. The following key-words were used: ""social isolation"" and ""child development"", ""quarantine"" and ""adolescent development"" according to the Medical Subject Headings (MESH) and their translation to the Portuguese. Studies in English, Portuguese and Spanish from inception were included.  Data synthesis: 519 studies were screened and 12 were included in the systematic review. Five of those focused the psychology and social issues, two of them the effects of pandemics on these issues; four studies reported on impacts on general health and two consequences over the hypothalamus- hypophysis - adrenal axis and the cognitive and social development.  Conclusions: The review shows a strong association between social isolation and anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. Social isolation leads to higher levels of cortisol and worse cognitive development.

"GWAS-identified genetic variants associated with medication-assisted treatment outcomes in patients with opioid use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol","BACKGROUND: The burden of opioid use disorder (OUD) has been increasing in North America. Administration of medication-assisted treatments (MATs) for OUD on an individual-dose basis has been shown to affect patient responses to treatment, proving to be, on occasion, dangerous. A genetic basis has been identified for some MAT responses in a candidate gene context, but consensus has not been reached for any genome-wide significant associations. This systematic review aims to identify and assess any genetic variants associated with MAT patient outcomes at genome-wide significance. METHODS: The databases searched by the authors will be: MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL and Pre-CINAHL, GWAS Catalog, GWAS Central, and NIH Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. A title and abstract screening, full-text screening, data extraction, and quality assessment will be completed in duplicate for each study via Covidence. Treatment outcomes of interest include continued opioid use or abstinence during treatment or at follow-up, time to relapse, treatment retention rates, opioid overdose, other substance use, comorbid psychiatric disorders, risk taking behaviors, MAT plasma concentrations, and mortality rates. Analysis methods applied, if appropriate, will include random effects meta-analysis with pooled odds ratios for all outcomes. Subgroup analyses will also be implemented, when possible. DISCUSSION: This systematic review can hopefully inform the direction of future research, aiding in the development of a safer and more patient-centered treatment. It will be able to highlight genome-wide significant variants that are replicable and associated with MAT patient outcomes.

"Get the message? A scoping review of physical activity messaging","BACKGROUND: Understanding how to create and deliver effective physical activity (PA) messages for and to various population subgroups may play a role in increasing population PA levels. This scoping review aimed to provide an overview of what is known about PA messaging and highlight key research gaps. METHODS: We followed a 5-stage protocol proposed by Arksey & O'Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews checklist. Stage 1: research questions were identified. Stage 2: we identified relevant studies by searching electronic databases, contacting existing networks and hand searching reference lists. Stage 3: studies were screened in Covidence&#8482; software. Stage 4: study data were extracted and charted. Stage 5: findings from included studies were collated, summarised and reported in two ways: (1) a descriptive numerical analysis providing insight into extent, nature and distribution of the included studies, and (2) a narrative summary summarizing the evidence reviewed organised by messaging concepts and by population subgroup. RESULTS: A total of 9525 references were imported into Covidence&#8482; for screening. Of these, 123 studies were included in final analysis. We found that PA messaging evidence is complex and multidimensional in nature, with numerous concepts to consider when creating or evaluating messages. The extent to which these different PA messaging concepts have been researched is variable. Where research has accumulated and evidence is consistent, it supports the following: (1) PA messages should be framed positively and highlight short-term outcomes specifically relating to social and mental health, (2) message content should be tailored or targeted to intended recipient(s), and (3) when developing messages, formative research, psychological theory and/or social marketing principles should be used. CONCLUSION: While it is unlikely to address global inactivity on its own, PA messaging may play a valuable role improving population PA levels. However, it is a complex and multidimensional concept and greater understanding is still needed. We present a synthesis of the existing evidence, highlighting key areas where evidence has accumulated and where gaps lie, as well as recommendations for PA messaging to different population subgroups.","Williamson, ChloÃ«; Baker, Graham; Mutrie, Nanette; Niven, Ailsa; Kelly, Paul","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-020-00954-3","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act;17(1): 51, 2020 04 15.; Publication details: Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act;17(1): 51, 2020 04 15.; Exercise/psychology; Health Communication; Health Promotion/methods; Communications Media; Humans; Public Health/trends; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20262,""
"Interventions to Improve Mental Health, Well-Being, Physical Health, and Lifestyle Behaviors in Physicians and Nurses: A Systematic Review","OBJECTIVE: This systematic review focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with physicians and nurses that tested interventions designed to improve their mental health, well-being, physical health, and lifestyle behaviors. DATA SOURCE: A systematic search of electronic databases from 2008 to May 2018 included PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, and the Cochrane Library. STUDY INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria included an RCT design, samples of physicians and/or nurses, and publication year 2008 or later with outcomes targeting mental health, well-being/resiliency, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and/or physical health. Exclusion criteria included studies with a focus on burnout without measures of mood, resiliency, mindfulness, or stress; primary focus on an area other than health promotion; and non-English papers. DATA EXTRACTION: Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from each study by 2 independent researchers using a standardized template created in Covidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Although meta-analytic pooling across all studies was desired, a wide array of outcome measures made quantitative pooling unsuitable. Therefore, effect sizes were calculated and a mini meta-analysis was completed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (N = 2708 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Results indicated that mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapy-based interventions are effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Brief interventions that incorporate deep breathing and gratitude may be beneficial. Visual triggers, pedometers, and health coaching with texting increased physical activity. CONCLUSION: Healthcare systems must promote the health and well-being of physicians and nurses with evidence-based interventions to improve population health and enhance the quality and safety of the care that is delivered.","Melnyk, Bernadette Mazurek; Kelly, Stephanie A; Stephens, Janna; Dhakal, Kerry; McGovern, Colleen; Tucker, Sharon; Hoying, Jacqueline; McRae, Kenya; Ault, Samantha; Spurlock, Elizabeth; Bird, Steven B","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0890117120920451","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Health Promot;34(8): 929-941, 2020 11.; Publication details: Am J Health Promot;34(8): 929-941, 2020 11.; Mindfulness; Nurses; Physicians; Humans; Life Style; Mental Health; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20263,""
"Effective/cost effective interventions of child mental health problems in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC): Systematic review","BACKGROUND: This systematic review protocol aims to examine the evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions for children and adolescents with, or at risk of developing mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs). METHODS: We will search Medline Ovid, EMBASE Ovid, PsycINFO Ovid, CINAHL, LILACS, BDENF and IBECS. We will include randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, economic modelling studies and economic evaluations. Participants are 6 to 18 year-old children and adolescents who live in a LAMIC and who present with, or are at high risk of developing, one or more of the conditions: depression, anxiety, behavioural disorders, eating disorders, psychosis, substance abuse, autism and intellectual disabilities as defined by the DSM-V. Interventions which address suicide, self-harm will also be included, if identified during the extraction process. We will include in person or e-health interventions which have some evidence of effectiveness (in relation to clinical and/or functional outcomes) and which have been delivered to young people in LAMICs. We will consider a wide range of delivery channels (e.g., in person, web-based or virtual, phone), different practitioners (healthcare practitioners, teachers, lay health care providers) and sectors (i.e., primary, secondary and tertiary health care, education, guardianship councils). In the pilot of screening procedures, 5% of all references will be screened by two reviewers. Divergences will be resolved by one expert in mental health research. Reviewers will be retrained afterwards to ensure reliability. The remaining 95% will be screened by one reviewer. Covidence web-based tool will be used to perform screening of references and full text paper, and data extraction. RESULTS: The protocol of this systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences. The results will be presented descriptively and, if possible, meta-analysis will be conducted. Ethical approval is not needed for anonymised secondary data. CONCLUSION: the systematic review could help health specialists and other professionals to identify evidence-based strategies to deal with child and adolescents with mental health conditions.","Grande, Antonio Jose; Ribeiro, Wagner Silva; Faustino, Christine; de Miranda, Claudio Torres; Mcdaid, David; Fry, Andra; de Moraes, Silvia Helena MendonÃ§a; de Oliveira, Sandra Maria do Valle Leone; de Farias, Joni Marcio; de Tarso Coelho Jardim, Paulo; King, Derek; Silva, Valter; Ziebold, Carolina; Evans-Lacko, Sara","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000018611","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Medicine (Baltimore);99(1): e18611, 2020 Jan.; Publication details: Medicine (Baltimore);99(1): e18611, 2020 Jan.; Developing Countries; Neurodevelopmental Disorders/therapy; Child; Humans; Neurodevelopmental Disorders/economics; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20264,""
"The efficacy of LigaSure&#8482; open instruments in cases of cesarean hysterectomy due to placenta percreta: a retrospective, record-based, comparative study","OBJECTIVE: The standard treatment for patients with placenta percreta is cesarean hysterectomy that can cause severe bleeding. New-generation vessel sealing systems like LigaSure can cut and seal vascular structures and tissues. The aim of this study was to retrospectively compare hysterectomies performed with traditional instruments and those performed with LigaSure instruments to determine the possible advantages with the latter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with placenta percreta who underwent elective cesarean hysterectomy by the same surgeon were divided into two groups based on the type of instruments used. Group 1, the standard conventional hysterectomy group, operated with conventional instruments for cutting and tying; and Group 2, the LigaSure hysterectomy group, operated with the new-generation bipolar sealing and cutting instruments. The groups were retrospectively compared for bleeding, operating time, and complications. RESULTS: In Group 2, the operating time, intraoperative and total transfused erythrocyte suspension units, total fluid in the drain, and total hospital stay were lower than in Group 1 (p < .05), as was the need for internal iliac artery ligation (p = .013). The complication rates were similar between the two groups (p > .05). CONCLUSION: The use of LigaSure open instruments in cesarean hysterectomies in patients with placenta percreta may reduce operating times and the amount of bleeding.","Bakacak, Zeyneb; Bakacak, Murat; Uzkar, Aytekin; Yazar, Fatih Mehmet; Yaylali, Asli; Boran, Ã–mer Faruk; GÃ¼zin, Kadir","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1846177","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med;34(6): 960-965, 2021 Mar.; Publication details: J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med;34(6): 960-965, 2021 Mar.; Placenta Accreta; Cesarean Section/adverse effects; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy/adverse effects; Ligation; Placenta Accreta/surgery; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20265,""
"Understanding the Outcomes of Supplementary Support Services in Palliative Care for Older People A Scoping Review and Mapping Exercise","CONTEXT: Supplementary support services in palliative care for older people are increasingly common, but with neither recommended tools to measure outcomes nor reviews synthesizing anticipated outcomes. Common clinically focused tools may be less appropriate. OBJECTIVES: To identify stakeholder perceptions of key outcomes from supplementary palliative care support services, then map these onto outcome measurement tools to assess relevance and item redundancy. METHODS: A scoping review using the design by Arksey and O'Malley. EMBASE, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PSYCHinfo searched using terms relating to palliative care, qualitative research, and supplementary support interventions. Articles were imported into Endnote&#8482;, and Covidence&#8482; was used by two reviewers to assess against inclusion criteria. Included articles were imported into NVivo&#8482; and thematically coded to identify key concepts underpinning outcomes. Each item within contender outcome measurement tools was assessed against each concept. RESULTS: Sixty included articles focused on advance care planning, guided conversations, and volunteer befriending services. Four concepts were identified: enriching relationships; greater autonomy and perceived control; knowing more; and improved mental health. Mapping concepts to contender tool items revealed issues of relevance and redundancy. Some tools had no redundant items but mapped only to two of four outcome themes; others mapped to all concepts, but with many redundant questions. Tools such as ICECAP-Supportive Care Measure and McGill Quality of Life had high relevance and low redundancy. CONCLUSION: Pertinent outcome concepts for these services and population are not well represented in commonly used outcome measurement tools, and this may have implications in appropriately measuring outcomes. This review and mapping method may have utility in fields where selecting appropriate outcome tools can be challenging.","Dodd, Steven R; Payne, Sheila A; Preston, Nancy J; Walshe, Catherine E","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.010","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Pain Symptom Manage;60(2): 449-459.e21, 2020 08.; Publication details: J Pain Symptom Manage;60(2): 449-459.e21, 2020 08.; Advance Care Planning; Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing; Aged; Humans; Mental Health; Palliative Care; Quality of Life; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20266,""
"Quality of life of low vision patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis","OBJECTIVE: Quality of vision plays an important role in everyday living, and low vision (LV) can take a toll on individual's quality of life (QOL). The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of LV on QOL and depressive symptoms in LV patients compared with healthy controls. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Literature was systematically searched to obtain all relevant records. Covidence software was used to conduct the systematic review. Duplicate records were removed, and 2 independent reviewers screened records for relevance. After screening, risk of bias assessment was carried out. Data were extracted and meta-analysis was performed using STATA 15.0. Fixed-effect and random-effect models were computed based on heterogeneity. RESULTS: In total, 2870 records were retrieved from database and grey literature searches. Twelve articles (35Â 341 subjects) were included for quantitative analysis. Overall, the QOL of LV patients was significantly lower compared with healthy individuals. Common QOL questionnaires, including 25-item visual function questionnaire (VFQ-25) (standard mean difference [SMD]Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯0.91, confidence interval [CI]: [0.42-1.40]), 36-item short form survey (SMDÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯0.53, CI: [0.26-0.80]), VFQ-14 (SMDÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯0.58, CI: [0.42-0.74]), and visual function QOL questionnaire (SMDÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯0.68, CI: [0.54-0.82]), demonstrated a poor QOL in LV patients compared with healthy controls. Additionally, odds of depressive symptoms were significantly greater (odds ratioÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯2.25, CI: [1.58-3.21]) in LV patients compared with controls.

"Perinatal Mental Health Care In The United States: An Overview Of Policies And Programs","In the United States, mental health conditions are the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth, and suicide and overdose combined are the leading cause of death for new mothers. Although awareness of and action on perinatal mental health is increasing, significant gaps remain. Screening and treatment are widely recommended but unevenly implemented, and policies and funding do not adequately support the mental health of childbearing people. As a result, treatable perinatal mental health conditions can have long-term, multigenerational negative consequences. This article provides an overview of the perinatal mental health landscape in the United States by identifying serious gaps in screening, education, and treatment; describing recent federal and state policy efforts; highlighting successful models of care; and offering recommendations for robust and integrated perinatal mental health care.","Griffen, Adrienne; McIntyre, Lynne; Belsito, Jamie Zahlaway; Burkhard, Joy; Davis, Wendy; Kimmel, Mary; Stuebe, Alison; Clark, Crystal; Meltzer-Brody, Samantha","https://dx.doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00796","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Aff (Millwood);40(10): 1543-1550, 2021 10.; Publication details: Health Aff (Millwood);40(10): 1543-1550, 2021 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20270,""
"Interplay between the genetics of personality traits, severe psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 host genetics in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection","Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, with its impact on our way of life, is affecting our experiences and mental health. Notably, individuals with mental disorders have been reported to have a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Personality traits could represent an important determinant of preventative health behaviour and, therefore, the risk of contracting the virus. Aims: We examined overlapping genetic underpinnings between major psychiatric disorders, personality traits and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method: Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to explore the genetic correlations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility with psychiatric disorders and personality traits based on data from the largest available respective genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In two cohorts (the PsyCourse (n = 1346) and the HeiDE (n = 3266) study), polygenic risk scores were used to analyse if a genetic association between, psychiatric disorders, personality traits and COVID-19 susceptibility exists in individual-level data. Results: We observed no significant genetic correlations of COVID-19 susceptibility with psychiatric disorders. For personality traits, there was a significant genetic correlation for COVID-19 susceptibility with extraversion (P = 1.47 Ã— 10-5; genetic correlation 0.284). Yet, this was not reflected in individual-level data from the PsyCourse and HeiDE studies. Conclusions: We identified no significant correlation between genetic risk factors for severe psychiatric disorders and genetic risk for COVID-19 susceptibility. Among the personality traits, extraversion showed evidence for a positive genetic association with COVID-19 susceptibility, in one but not in another setting. Overall, these findings highlight a complex contribution of genetic and non-genetic components in the interaction between COVID-19 susceptibility and personality traits or mental disorders.","Heilbronner, Urs; Streit, Fabian; Vogl, Thomas; Senner, Fanny; Schaupp, Sabrina K; Reich-Erkelenz, Daniela; Papiol, Sergi; Oraki Kohshour, Mojtaba; KlÃ¶hn-Saghatolislam, Farahnaz; Kalman, Janos L; Heilbronner, Maria; Gade, Katrin; Comes, Ashley L; Budde, Monika; Andlauer, Till F M; Anderson-Schmidt, Heike; Adorjan, Kristina; StÃ¼rmer, Til; Loerbroks, Adrian; Amelang, Manfred; Poisel, Eric; Foo, Jerome; Heilmann-Heimbach, Stefanie; Forstner, Andreas J; Degenhardt, Franziska; Zimmermann, JÃ¶rg; Wiltfang, Jens; von Hagen, Martin; Spitzer, Carsten; Schmauss, Max; Reininghaus, Eva; Reimer, Jens; Konrad, Carsten; Juckel, Georg; Lang, Fabian U; JÃ¤ger, Markus; Figge, Christian; Fallgatter, Andreas J; Dietrich, Detlef E; Dannlowski, Udo; Baune, Bernhardt T; Arolt, Volker; Anghelescu, Ion-George; NÃ¶then, Markus M; Witt, Stephanie H; Andreassen, Ole A; Chen, Chi-Hua; Falkai, Peter; Rietschel, Marcella; Schulze, Thomas G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1030","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BJPsych Open;7(6): e188, 2021 Nov.; Publication details: BJPsych Open;7(6): e188, 2021 Nov.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20271,""
"Association of parenting with suicidal ideation and attempts in children and youth: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies","BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death in children and youth, with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts (referred to as non-fatal suicidal behaviors (NFSB)) being among its strongest predictors. Positive parenting (e.g., warmth, responsiveness), negative parenting (e.g., control, hostility), and parent-child relationship quality (e.g., trust, communication) have been reported to be associated with differences in NFSB in this population. To date, no comprehensive systematic review has considered together the wide range of parenting factors studied in relation to NFSB, and no meta-analysis of existing findings has been conducted. The present study will critically appraise and synthesize the existing evidence from observational studies that examine the relationships between parenting factors and (i) suicidal ideation and (ii) suicide attempt in children and youth. METHODS: Studies will be retrieved from APA PsycInfo, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases. Retrospective, cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies, conducted in clinical and population settings, among youth aged less than 25 years and published as articles and dissertations in English or French will be eligible. Two reviewers will select articles using the Covidence Software after title and abstract screening and full-text assessment, will extract information using double data entry, and will appraise studies' quality using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Any disagreements will be discussed with a third reviewer. Publication bias will be evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test. In addition to a narrative summary of results, meta-analyses will be conducted using results from at least three studies. Three-level random effect models will allow to derive pooled estimates from dependent effect sizes (from the same sample or study). In case of significant heterogeneity, moderation analyses will be performed considering participants' characteristics and methodological aspects of studies. The results will be reported according to the PRISMA guidelines, and the certainty of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. DISCUSSION: In highlighting parenting factors associated with NFSB and in estimating the overall strength of these associations in children and youth, our results will inform further intervention and prevention strategies designed for young people experiencing NFSB and their families.

"Parent-directed intervention versus controls whilst their child waits for diagnostic assessment: a systematic review protocol","BACKGROUND: Waiting lists are an ongoing issue for publicly funded community and hospital-based health services. Parents and caregivers are instrumental supports in the health and well-being of young and school-aged children, yet little is known about the way they can be supported during waiting periods. Given mounting evidence about the value of early intervention in physical and mental health literature, and waits for some public health services extending past 12 months, it is both timely and warranted to explore interim interventions that may be applied in this period. METHODS: Intervention studies that have applied an educational programme, information, group-based support or individualised therapy to primary caregivers of children (heron referred to as parent-directed interventions), waiting for diagnostic assessment at any inpatient or outpatient health service and aged between 1 and 12 years of age, will be reviewed. These will include intervention studies of any type that have included more than 5 participants or participant groups and where a control or comparison group has been included. Abstract screening, full-text review, data extraction and risk of bias will be conducted by two reviewers. Relevant databases in health and education will be systematically searched using key words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and grey literature will be explored. Databases will include PubMed, Ovid for MEDLINE and PsycINFO, EBSCO for the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). CovidenceÂ© will be used to support abstract and full text screening, which will be completed by two main reviewers. Results will be tabulated, summarised and meta-analysed using a random-effects model, in any instance where concordant outcome measures have been applied. Results will be published and reported in line with PRISMA reporting guidelines. DISCUSSION: Given little is known about effective support for families when children are awaiting diagnostic assessment for any medical, developmental or behavioural condition, the authors will synthesise existing evidence about parent-directed interventions in this period. It is hoped that by understanding the existing evidence interventions that are proven to be effective will be adopted and intervention innovation can occur.

"Educational and training interventions aimed at healthcare workers in the detection and management of people with mental health conditions in South and Southeast Asia: systematic review protocol","INTRODUCTION: The mental health burden and treatment gap in South and Southeast Asia is high and significant. Capacity building of healthcare workers is essential to support programmes related to the detection and management of patients with mental health conditions. We aim to conduct a systematic review to summarise the research on educational, training and capacity-building interventions aimed at the healthcare workforce in detection and management of mental health conditions in South and Southeast Asia. OBJECTIVE: To synthesise evidence on (1) the types of educational and training interventions that have been used to improve the knowledge, skills and attitudes of healthcare workers in South and Southeast Asian countries in the detection and management of mental health conditions; (2) the effectiveness, including cost-effectiveness of the interventions; and (3) the enabling factors and barriers that influence the effectiveness of these interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will be conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. We will search six electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Global Health for empirical studies published from 1 January 2000 to 31 August 2020. Search results from each database will be combined and uploaded in Covidence library. Title, abstract and full-text screening, and data extraction of each included study will be performed by two independent reviewers. Disagreements between reviewers will be resolved by a third reviewer and study team. Quality of included studies will be assessed by the modified Cochrane Collaboration tool and ROBINS-I tool.

"Evaluation of Israeli healthcare workers knowledge and attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine","OBJECTIVES: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are considered an important target group for the COVID-19 vaccines. The current study assesses the knowledge and attitudes of Israeli HCWs regarding COVID-19 immunization, and how various occupational and demographic factors may underlie COVID-related knowledge and attitudes differences. METHODS: Following a pre-test to validate measures, a cross-sectional online anonymous survey was distributed to HCWs using a snowball sampling method. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 714 participants (mean age 39.9; range 18-74; 447 female), 52% doctors, 32% nurses, and the remainder by paramedical staff. Of the respondents, 553 (77.4%) answered the question are you in favor of getting the COVID-19 vaccine, 105 (14.7%) were not sure, and 56 (7.8%) were not in favor. Doctors had higher odds of agreement as compared to both nurses (pÂ <Â .025) and paramedical staff (pÂ <Â .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that increased age (OR: 1.075; 95% CI: 1.04-1.11, pÂ <Â .001), profession (physician vs. nurse; OR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.32-5.65; pÂ <Â .007), and getting the current influenza vaccine (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 2.47-9.95) were significant predictors of agreement. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of HCWs knowledge and in favor attitudes were observed. Yet negative attitudes were also noted, particularly among nurses, paramedical staff, and young employees.","Zaitoon, Hussein; Sharkansky, Livnat; Ganaim, Loai; Chistyakov, Irina; Srugo, Isaac; Bamberger, Ellen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phn.12987","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Public Health Nurs;2021 Oct 06.; Publication details: Public Health Nurs;2021 Oct 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20276,""

"The psychosocial challenges associated with gestational diabetes mellitus: A systematic review of qualitative studies","BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes is a disease with complex management that requires multidisciplinary collaboration. To achieve treatment goals, in addition to using medications and paying attention to exercise and diet, it is also important to take into account the mental health and psychosocial aspects of diabetes management. This study aimed to highlight these challenges associated with gestational diabetes. METHOD: This qualitative systematic review involved a search of the following databases: CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. Title, abstract, and full-text screening was done using Covidence software, and quality assessment of the included papers was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Checklist. Enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of the qualitative research statement (ENTREQ) was used in the design of this paper. Data synthesis was done using meta-aggregation method. RESULTS: Out of the 2440 articles searched, 24 were qualitatively analyzed. The CASP score of the included papers was optimal. The 514 findings extracted from the 24 studies were aggregated into five broad conceptual categories: psychological challenges, socio-cultural challenges, information-communication challenges, challenges associated with a lifestyle change, and challenges related to health care. CONCLUSION: Recognizing the psychosocial challenges associated with gestational diabetes and developing support packages tailored to psychosocial needs can help improve the management of these patients.","Faal Siahkal, Shahla; Javadifar, Nahid; Najafian, Mahin; Iravani, Mina; Zakerkish, Mehrnoosh; Heshmati, Rasoul","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pcd.2021.09.003","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Prim Care Diabetes;2021 Sep 15.; Publication details: Prim Care Diabetes;2021 Sep 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20278,""
"Systematic Review of Caregivers and Palliative Intent Radiation Therapy: Barriers, Facilitators, Decision Making Needs","PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the facilitators, barriers, and decision making needs of caregivers of patients receiving palliative intent radiation therapy MATERIALS/METHODS: Systematic review of articles utilizing PRISMA guidelines was performed. Inclusion criteria included studies published from 2007 to 2018 focusing on caregivers of patients receiving palliative intent radiation therapy (PRT) for advanced cancers. Pediatric and non-English articles were excluded. Rayyan QCRI was utilized to screen abstracts, and Covidence organized the review of full text articles by 2 reviewers. RESULTS: Of 6079 articles identified, 36 were selected for full text review, and 6 met inclusion. Limited literature was found. Caregivers experience anxiety, fatigue, and hopelessness. Caregivers need more information and their emotions impact both the receipt of radiation therapy and satisfaction with services. CONCLUSION: While limited, literature focusing on caregivers of patients undergoing palliative intent radiation therapy consistently find unmet caregiver education and emotional distress which impact patient receipt of and satisfaction with PRT services.

"Parenting Interventions and Secondary Outcomes Related to Maternal Mental Health: A Systematic Review","PURPOSE: Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders can have far reaching negative impact on both maternal mental health and child growth and development. Multimodal group parenting programs have been shown to improve maternal mental health symptoms however, they are often costly to provide and not accessible to many mothers, especially those mothers suffering from mental health symptoms. Therefore, the authors sought to answer the following question by undertaking a systematic review of the literature: are parenting interventions aimed at improving maternal-child interaction also a way to address mental health symptoms (i.e. depression, anxiety, stress) in mothers? METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. An online platform that supports the systematic review process and quality assessment according to Cochrane guidelines, Covidence, was used in conjunction with an adapted extraction tool to identify relevant studies and extract data for analysis. RESULTS: 11 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. There was great heterogeneity between study interventions and measurement of outcomes for maternal mental health symptoms which precluded meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Studies reviewed did not demonstrate consistent evidence to recommend that parenting interventions leads to improvement in maternal mental health symptoms for depression, anxiety or stress. However, there was evidence that participating in parenting programs does not worsen these symptoms and some encouraging evidence that alternative delivery methods, beyond face to face, could, with more research, lead to more financially feasible and sustainable models of delivery of these types of interventions in the future.","Waldrop, Julee; Baker, Maureen; Salomon, Rebecca; Moreton, Elizabeth","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03130-6","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Matern Child Health J;25(6): 870-880, 2021 Jun.; Publication details: Matern Child Health J;25(6): 870-880, 2021 Jun.; Mental Health; Mothers; Parenting; Anxiety; Female; Humans; Mother-Child Relations; Mothers/psychology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20280,""

"Comparison of Treatments for Cocaine Use Disorder Among Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Importance: In the US and the United Kingdom, cocaine use is the second leading cause of illicit drug overdose death. Psychosocial treatments for cocaine use disorder are limited, and no pharmacotherapy is approved for use in the US or Europe. Objective: To compare treatments for active cocaine use among adults. Data Sources: PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for clinical trials published between December 31, 1995, and December 31, 2017. Study Selection: This meta-analysis was registered on Covidence.org (study 8731) on December 31, 2015. Clinical trials were included if they (1) had the term cocaine in the article title; (2) were published between December 31, 1995, and December 31, 2017; (3) were written in English; (4) enrolled outpatients 18 years or older with active cocaine use at baseline; and (5) reported treatment group size, treatment duration, retention rates, and urinalysis results for the presence of cocaine metabolites. A study was excluded if (1) more than 25% of participants were not active cocaine users or more than 80% of participants had negative test results for the presence of cocaine metabolites at baseline and (2) it reported only pooled urinalysis results indicating the presence of multiple substances and did not report the specific proportion of positive test results for cocaine metabolites. Multiple reviewers reached criteria consensus. Of 831 records screened, 157 studies (18.9%) met selection criteria and were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis: This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Search results were imported from PubMed XML into Covidence.org then Microsoft Excel. Data extraction was completed in 2 iterations to ensure fidelity. Analyses included a multilevel random-effects model, a multilevel mixed-effects meta-regression model, and sensitivity analyses. Treatments were clustered into 11 categories (psychotherapy, contingency management programs, placebo, opioids, psychostimulants, anticonvulsants, dopamine agonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, miscellaneous medications, and other therapies). Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations. The significance threshold for all analyses was P = .05. Data were analyzed using the metafor and mice packages in R software, version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Data were analyzed from January 1, 2018, to February 28, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the intention-to-treat logarithm of the odds ratio (OR) of having a negative urinalysis result for the presence of cocaine metabolites at the end of each treatment period compared with baseline. The hypothesis, which was formulated after data collection, was that no treatment category would have a significant association with objective reductions in cocaine use. Results: A total of 157 studies comprising 402 treatment groups and 15Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯842 participants were included. Excluding other therapies, the largest treatment groups across all studies were psychotherapy (mean [SD] number of participants, 40.04 [36.88]) and contingency management programs (mean [SD] number of participants, 37.51 [25.51]). Only contingency management programs were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of having a negative test result for the presence of cocaine (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.62-2.80), and this association remained significant in all sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In this meta-analysis, contingency management programs were associated with reductions in cocaine use among adults. Research efforts and policies that align with this treatment modality may benefit those who actively use cocaine and attenuate societal burdens.","Bentzley, Brandon S; Han, Summer S; Neuner, Sophie; Humphreys, Keith; Kampman, Kyle M; Halpern, Casey H","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.8049","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(5): e218049, 2021 May 03.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(5): e218049, 2021 May 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20282,""

However, the focus on optimally managing children in hospitals is changing with new variants and concerns with the development of hyperinflammatory syndromes. There are also concerns with the overuse of antimicrobials to treat patients with COVID-19 in hospitals enhancing resistance rates. The Bangladesh Paediatric Association have developed guidelines to improve patient care building on national guidance. Consequently, there is a need to document the current management of children with COVID-19 in Bangladesh and use the findings for future guidance. Methods: Rapid analysis of the management of children with COVID-19 among eight private and public hospitals in Bangladesh with varying numbers of in-patient beds using purposely developed case report forms (CRFs). The CRFs were piloted before full roll-out. Results: Overall low numbers of children in hospital with COVID-19 (4.3% of in-patient beds). The majority were male (59.6%) and aged 5 years or under (63.5%). Reasons for admission included respiratory distress/ breathing difficulties with 94.2% of COVID-19 cases confirmed. All children were prescribed antibiotics empirically, typically those on the Watch list of antibiotics and administered parenterally, with only a small minority switched to oral therapy before discharge. There was appreciable prescribing of Vitamins (C and D) and zinc and encouragingly limited prescribing of other antimicrobials (antivirals, antimalarials and antiparasitic medicines). Length of stay was typically 5 to 10 days. Conclusion: Encouraging to see low hospitalisation rates and limited use of antimicrobials apart from antibiotics. Concerns with high empiric use of antibiotics and limited switching to oral formulations can be addressed by instigating antimicrobial stewardship programmes. We will be monitoring this.

"Psychological vulnerability and coping among management students during COVID-19 pandemic","PurposeIn light of growing concerns related to the psychological vulnerability during the pandemic, this study aims to examine the impact of fear or trauma of COVID-19 on stress, anxiety and depression among management students. Additionally, the study also explores the possible strategies adopted by professional students to cope with the pandemic situation.Design/methodology/approachWith an approach to establish a probable concrete relationship between fear with the level of stress, anxiety and depression, the data for the study was collected from 1,408 management students through a structured questionnaire designed in Google Form and administered through WhatsApp. The survey was carried out in the month of July and August 2020 during the lockdown period. Correlation and structural equation modeling have been used to examine the relationship among the test attributes.FindingsThe results from the study discovered that â€œfear of COVID-19â€ has a significant and considerable impact on the increased level of anxiety and stress among the professional students, but the observations did not demonstrate a significant influence of the â€œfearâ€ on â€œdepression.â€ The responses reveal that students have developed anxiety and felt stressed mostly due to uncertainty in the upcoming academic plans, disturbances in their regular academic routines and concerns about their future careers. Further, the findings have portrayed that students have adopted both protective and avoidance coping strategies to overcome the adverse consequences of the pandemic.Research limitations/implicationsThe study gives an insight on the psychological vulnerability of the management students and their capability to overcome such sudden disruptions due to pandemics. This research could thus, serve as a reference to the policymakers, universities and institutions while planning out programs and schemes, which would encourage the aspiring managers to overcome the crisis and prepare themselves to befit the vibrant corporate world.Originality/valueSeveral studies exist on the impact of the pandemic on undergraduate students in different universities. However, there are a dearth of literature, which reflects the psychological vulnerability of professional graduates especially management students who are on the verge of starting their professional career.","Sundaray, Bijaya Kumar, Sarangi, Pragyan, Patra, Soumendra Kumar","https://doi.org/10.1108/JMHTEP-05-2021-0041","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The Journal of Mental Health Training, Education, and Practice; 16(6):454-467, 2021.; Publication details: The Journal of Mental Health Training, Education, and Practice; 16(6):454-467, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20285,""
"Aging Matters Through the Years: A Retrospective","The goal of the Aging Matters column is to address important issues related to geropsychiatry and the well-being of older adults. This article offers reflections on columns from the past 15 years and how the aging process has changed in issues related to aging and technology, aging healthfully, end-of-life issues, caregivers for older adults, and growing old in American society. To promote successful aging, we need to hear stories of what it is like to grow old in America. We also need research to better understand the aging process and what is needed for successful aging. In addition, we need policies and resources that help ensure well-trained caregivers who can protect vulnerable older adults and help them age healthfully. Stories of individuals, research, and health care policies need to be connected to create meaningful changes within the health care system.

"Reduced physical activity and weight gain are associated with an increase of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic A general practitioners' prospective observational study","Objectives: We aimed to assess associations between depressive symptoms, lifestyle, and somatic symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: A prospective, observational study using a self-designed questionnaire. Setting: Three general practitioners' (GP) offices in rural Germany. Participants: 271 adult patients without manifest cardiovascular or pulmonary disease with (n = 82) and without (n = 189) hypertension reporting to our GP offices. Main outcome measures: The reported increase of depressive symptoms (loneliness, sleeplessness, joylessness, listlessness) prior to the first documented case in Germany on 27.01.2020 (t0) as opposed to patients' health perception during the Corona pandemic (t1) was the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures were changes in physical activity (PA), dyspnea and angina in the two groups. Results: Out of 271 patients (50.8 Â± 16.8 years, 55.1% females), 1.5% were tested positive for COVID-19. Overall, listlessness (8.5%, p = 0.001), sleeplessness (5.2%, p = 0.001) and joylessness (4.2%, p = 0.003) were increased. Dyspnea significantly increased (9.2%, p < 0.001) and employment status worsened (6.5%, p < 0.001). There were significant associations between the increase of depressive symptoms, weight increase (p = 0.017), and reduction in physical activity (p = 0.046). However, after adjusting for age, hypertensive patients did not show more depressive symptoms (p = 0.704), dyspnea (p = 0.063) or angina (p = 0.432), nor was there any difference in PA (p = 0.906) compared to healthy individuals. Conclusions: We demonstrate an association between the deterioration of depressive symptoms, weight gain, and reduced physical activity during COVID-19, both in hypertensives and healthy controls. Hypertension is no driver of symptom deterioration during the pandemic. The trial was registered in the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00022157).","Wernhart, Simon; Weihe, Eberhard; Rassaf, Tienush","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/20480040211047742","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JRSM Cardiovasc Dis;10: 20480040211047742, 2021.; Publication details: JRSM Cardiovasc Dis;10: 20480040211047742, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20287,""

"The Application of Tactical Urbanism in Public Space on COVID-19 Transmission Prevention","Tactical urbanism (TU) is frequently used as an interim or low-cost solution to tackle a design-related problem in public space. As the importance of good-designed public open space for mental health now realized significantly during the pandemic, the need for a tool to keep health protocol followed in public space is imperative. The modification of public spaces is applied in several cases to guide peopleâ€™s behaviour and interaction within public space under health protocol submission. This paper tried to analyse the application of TU to combat COVID-19 transmission on public space by using case study and systematic literature review from applied cases worldwide. The cases are categorized based on the problem identification and interventions conducted on urban design elements. It is found that the application of TU can be assembled into health protocol requirements-driven and accommodation of COVID-19-related policies externalities. The outcome of this paper could be used as an issue-based urban design precedent on COVID-19-related tactical urbanism interventions.","Fachmy Sugih, Pradifta, Puspitasari, Gina, Imam, Indratno, Fadhilah, Faisal","https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/830/1/012087","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: IOP Conference Series.

"Food Insecurity among International Post-Secondary Students Studying on a Canadian Campus: A Qualitative Descriptive Study","Mots-clÃ©s: rÃ©ussite universitaire, Canada, insÃ©curitÃ© alimentaire, Ã©tudiants, recherche qualitative Introduction International foreign students are important to Canada's general economy and to the economic sustainability of post-secondary institutions. Since graduation from a Canadian post-secondary institution is a pathway to permanent residency, Canada is an attractive location for international students to pursue their foreign education. Contributors to international students' financial hardship included not receiving financial support from the foreign institution of study, paying high international tuition fees and living expenses, credit card debt, and family funding or graduate student assistantships that were inadequate to cover the costs of education. [...]of the cause, international post-secondary students who experience food insecurity are likely susceptible to the same range of negative academic, nutritional, and physical and mental health outcomes associated with food insecurity among domestic students, including the inability to cover basic needs, persistent worry about not having sufficient food, disrupted learning, and negative impacts on social life (Bruening et al., 2017;Entz et al., 2017;Frank et al., 2018;Jyoti et al., 2005;Lee et al., 2018;Maroto et al., 2015;Mhurchu et al., 2010;Morris et al., 2016). To be included in the study, participants had to (a) be international post-secondary students without children in their care, (b) have requested and received emergency food relief from the on-campus food bank, and (c) have been confirmed as having food insecurity in our previous quantitative study using the 10-item USDA Adult Food Security Survey Module (United States Department of Agriculture, 2020).Alternate abstract:Enrollment of international post-secondary students is increasing across Canadian campuses. International post-secondary students may experience challenges in accessing nutritious foods that meet their dietary needs and food preferences. These challenges can pose negative impacts on their health, well-being, and academic achievement. Our aim was to describe international post-secondary students' perceptions of (1) challenges to attaining food security and (2) consequences of food insecurity on the university experience. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 11 international post-secondary students who had food insecurity, were enrolled at a public university in Canada, and who had requested emergency food hampers from the on-campus food bank. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using manifest, inductive content analysis. International post-secondary students reported several logistical issues related to obtaining sufficient food, including a lack of time, limited family support, modest food preparation skills, and low knowledge about supportive services and resources. Students also faced challenges in sourcing culturally appropriate foods, including issues related to food availability, accessibility, acceptability, and affordability. Further, they perceived food insecurity to negatively influence their academic performance through compromised concentration, reduced class and exam attendance, and adverse impacts on physical, mental, and social well-being. Some students reported extreme food deprivation, resulting in hunger. Our results revealed the negative impacts that food insecurity can have on international post-secondary students. Findings underscore the imperative to minimize the occurrence of food insecurity while studying in Canada by introducing and enhancing support systems on campus and in the community to enable food security.","Hanbazaza, Mahitab, Ball, Geoff D.

"The acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system in COVID-19","Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) cleaves sphingomyelin into the highly lipophilic ceramide, which forms large gel-like rafts/platforms in the plasma membrane. We showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses these platforms for cell entry. Lowering the amount of ceramide or ceramide blockade due to inhibitors of ASM, genetic downregulation of ASM, anti-ceramide antibodies or degradation by neutral ceramidase protected against infection with SARS-CoV-2. The addition of ceramide restored infection with SARS-CoV-2. Many clinically approved medications functionally inhibit ASM and are called FIASMAs (functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase). The FIASMA fluvoxamine showed beneficial effects on COVID-19 in a randomized prospective study and a prospective open-label real-world study. Retrospective and observational studies showed favorable effects of FIASMA antidepressants including fluoxetine, and the FIASMA hydroxyzine on the course of COVID-19. The ASM/ceramide system provides a framework for a better understanding of the infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical, antiviral, and anti-inflammatoryÂ effects of functional inhibitors of ASM. This framework also supports the development of new drugs or the repurposing of ""old"" drugs against COVID-19.","Kornhuber, Johannes; Hoertel, Nicolas; Gulbins, Erich","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01309-5","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Mol Psychiatry;2021 Oct 04.; Publication details: Mol Psychiatry;2021 Oct 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20291,""

"Therapeutic Factors and Member Satisfaction in an Online Group Intervention During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of the present study was to evaluate members' perceptions of the therapeutic factors during a group intervention that was designed to mitigate the adverse psychological effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the imposition of restrictive measures, their satisfaction with the online format of the intervention, and how these are associated with the intervention's outcomes. The participants (N = 44, M age  = 31.93, SD = 8.09) were Greek adults who attended a 2-week, voluntary, online group intervention. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, 1Â week before and 1Â week after implementation, participants completed several questionnaires measuring their demographic characteristics, empathy, resilience, affectivity, feelings of loneliness, depression and anxiety levels, and feelings of fear regarding the outbreak. One week after the intervention, they also completed two questionnaires evaluating the therapeutic factors and their satisfaction and impressions regarding telemental health counseling. Analyses showed that the most frequently cited therapeutic factor was guidance, followed by acceptance, self-disclosure, universality, and instillation of hope. Therapeutic factors of catharsis, self-disclosure, guidance, self-understanding, vicarious learning, and therapeutic alliance correlated with elements of empathy, resilience, loneliness, positive emotions, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and fear of the coronavirus. Satisfaction with the online format of the intervention was associated to universality, elements of empathy, and symptoms of depression. More specifically, member satisfaction was negatively correlated with improvement in personal distress and depression, an unexpected finding that may be attributed to the brief duration of the present intervention. The practical value of the results for the development and implementation of online psychological interventions during a crisis is discussed.","Brouzos, Andreas; Vassilopoulos, Stephanos P; Stavrou, Vaia; Baourda, Vasiliki C; Tassi, Christina; Brouzou, Katia Ourania","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41347-021-00216-4","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Technol Behav Sci;: 1-11, 2021 Sep 26.; Publication details: J Technol Behav Sci;: 1-11, 2021 Sep 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20293,""
"Operationalising the ""One Health"" approach in India: facilitators of and barriers to effective cross-sector convergence for zoonoses prevention and control","BACKGROUND: There is a strong policy impetus for the One Health cross-sectoral approach to address the complex challenge of zoonotic diseases, particularly in low/lower middle income countries (LMICs). Yet the implementation of this approach in LMIC contexts such as India has proven challenging, due partly to the relatively limited practical guidance and understanding on how to foster and sustain cross-sector collaborations. This study addresses this gap by exploring the facilitators of and barriers to successful convergence between the human, animal and environmental health sectors in India. METHODS: A mixed methods study was conducted using a detailed content review of national policy documents and in-depth semi-structured interview data on zoonotic disease management in India. In total, 29 policy documents were reviewed and 15 key informant interviews were undertaken with national and state level policymakers, disease managers and experts operating within the human-animal-environment interface of zoonotic disease control. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that there is limited policy visibility of zoonotic diseases, although global zoonoses, especially those identified to be of pandemic potential by international organisations (e.g. CDC, WHO and OIE) rather than local, high burden endemic diseases, have high recognition in the existing policy agenda setting. Despite the widespread acknowledgement of the importance of cross-sectoral collaboration, a myriad of factors operated to either constrain or facilitate the success of cross-sectoral convergence at different stages (i.e. information-sharing, undertaking common activities and merging resources and infrastructure) of cross-sectoral action. Importantly, participants identified the lack of supportive policies, conflicting departmental priorities and limited institutional capacities as major barriers that hamper effective cross-sectoral collaboration on zoonotic disease control. Building on existing informal inter-personal relationships and collaboration platforms were suggested by participants as the way forward. CONCLUSION: Our findings point to the importance of strengthening existing national policy frameworks as a first step for leveraging cross-sectoral capacity for improved disease surveillance and interventions. This requires the contextual adaptation of the One Health approach in a manner that is sensitive to the underlying socio-political, institutional and cultural context that determines and shapes outcomes of cross-sector collaborative arrangements.","Asaaga, F A; Young, J C; Oommen, M A; Chandarana, R; August, J; Joshi, J; Chanda, M M; Vanak, A T; Srinivas, P N; Hoti, S L; Seshadri, T; Purse, B V","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11545-7","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 1517, 2021 08 06.; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 1517, 2021 08 06.; One Health; Animals; Humans; India; Zoonoses/epidemiology; Zoonoses/prevention & control; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20294,""
"Psycho-social consequences associated with COVID-19 in people with ASD and their families: A literature review","Background: COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and has inevitably affected the whole world. This effect is greater on people with ASD (ASD) and their families. Depression, attempts to cope with change, and having difficulty interacting with others are some of the challenges people with ASD often face. The aim of this study was to review the psycho-social consequences of COVID-19 in people with ASD and their families. Methods: This study is a Literature Review. Extensive electronic search results for the keywords ASD, COVID-19, Coronavirus, psychological, psychosocial, and consequence in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct, SID and Magiran in 2020, eventually provided a total of 130 articles. After reviewing the titles of the articles, we excluded 85 articles as they were duplicated and/or irrelevant. Finally, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 articles remained. Results: In general, the change in routine and uncertainty caused by COVID-19 have caused distress for people with ASD and will worsen their symptoms and mental health. Excessive stress worsens the mental health of caregivers, and as this burden increases, they report higher rates of social harm, depression, and anxiety that affect their daily functioning. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic affects all strata of society. People with ASD are particularly vulnerable to the psychosocial effects of this epidemic.

"Suicidal deaths amid covid-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional autopsy-based study","Background: Suicide is a global issue, with an estimated 75.5% of the cases occurring in developing countries, and India alone accounting for 26.6% of all global suicidal deaths. With an advent of COVID-19 in the early months of 2020, India observed a rapid rise in suicidal deaths. Though, various media reports predicted loneliness, mental illness and economical instabilities as the major triggering factors, there is a lack of analytical or descriptive studies confirming this hypothesis. In this context, the present cross-sectional study was planned to determine the socio-demographic profiles of the victims and the triggering factors of the suicidal deaths during the COVID-19 phase, in context to the victims of suicide from 2017 to the Pre-COVID phase. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted by analyzing the suicidal deaths from 2017 to 30th June, 2020, interviewing the deceased family members during the COVID-19 phase and studying the Inquest reports, with the documents from the Institutional Medical Record Section. Conclusion: The authors feel that suicide is an act of moment in mind, so any decision made under excitement or incitement is the real culprit. To curb the menace of suicide, state and society should ensure education, employment and socioeconomic well-being, along with strict law enforcement.","Sardar, T.; Biswas, R.; Biswas, A.; Chatterjee, S.","https://doi.org/10.37506/ijfmt.v15i4.17112","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology; 15(4):2696-2704, 2021.; Publication details: Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology; 15(4):2696-2704, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20297,""

"Stigma and mental health during covid-19 new normal transition in indonesia","Background: Social isolation and economic catastrophic became the main characters of the current pandemic. Historically, the strongest stigmas related to diseases were characterized as highly transmittable, potentially lethal, and without remedy. All represented COVID-19 during the early transition into the new normal. We aimed to analyzed stigma and economic stressors concerning mental health. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 1375 participants in Java, Indonesia. Mental health status evaluated with DASS-21. The presence of social and self-stigma related to Covid-19 assessed with a questionnaire developed based on seven domains of public stigma. Demographics and other psychosocial stressors were assessed with an online questionnaire. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression had carried out. Result: A very high percentage of perceived and anticipated self-stigma and social stigma revealed. Controlling demographics factors, clear self-stigma increased the risk for depression (2.323 (1.241-4.346), p&lt;0.05), anxiety (2.134 (1.205-3.777), p&lt;0.05) and stress 3.931 (1.779-8.685), P&lt;0.001). Clear social stigma increased the risk for anxiety (2.000 (1.066-3.756), p&lt;0.05) but not on depression and stress.Conclusion: Ensuring basic needs fulfilment and eliminating stigma is critical for supporting mental health in the Covid-19 pandemic. Further research into the stigma-related risks is necessary because it represents an important need for intervention in public health.","Latifah, L.; Nurcahyani, Y.

"The Fear of COVID-19 Raises the Level of Depression, Anxiety and Stress through the Mediating Role of Intolerance of Uncertainty","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in various psycho-social effects, including adverse effects on mental health in the general population. Many studies across different countries showed a significant increase in symptoms of fear, depression, anxiety and stress compared to the situation before the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, it has gained more importance to examine the relationship between fear of the disease and mental health problems. This study aims to investigate the mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty in the relationship between fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, and stress. In this study, the sample consisted of 679 individuals. Among 679 respondents, 467 respondents were women (68.8%) and 212 respondents were men (31.2%). Data were collected through an online survey using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were used for data analysis. A significant positive relationship was observed between fear of COVID-19 and intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress. All variables were found as differing significantly concerning gender, and the levels of fear were significantly higher in women than in men. Intolerance of uncertainty was found to fully mediate the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and depression, anxiety and stress. The findings obtained from this study were discussed in the light of literature findings and various suggestions were presented to researchers, mental health practitioners and policy makers.","Kardas, Ferhat","https://doi.org/10.31577/sp.2021.03.828","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Studia Psychologica; 63(3):291-306, 2021.; Publication details: Studia Psychologica; 63(3):291-306, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20303,""
"Men's psychological well-being during COVID-19: the moderator role of posttraumatic growth","Background and objective: Men are significantly affected by COVID-19 stressors that impact psychological well-being. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between distress, risk perception, emotional representations, preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors, COVID-19 traumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and psychological well-being, taking also into consideration sociodemographic variables as well as the moderator role of posttraumatic growth in the relationship between traumatic stress and psychological well-being. Material and methods: A cross-sectional design was used. Data were collected during the lockdown, in Portugal, from January to March 2021. The sample included 220 men who answered the questionnaires online. Results: Anxiety and depression symptoms (distress), traumatic stress, and emotional representations were negatively associated with psychological well-being. Older men, professionally active men, and men not in teleworking reported greater psychological well-being. The findings also showed that less emotional representations, less traumatic stress, and lower levels of distress contributed to greater psychological well-being. Finally, posttraumatic growth played a moderating role in the relationship between traumatic stress and psychological well-being. Conclusion: Interventions and further studies must consider the buffering role of posttraumatic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic and focus on helping men handle the associated traumatic stress in order to promote psychological well-being.","Santos, M.; Machado, A.

"WhatsApp and communication in a pandemic state: Family members and institutionalized elderly: Case Study in the County of Idanha-a-Nova (Portugal)","The context of the pandemic we experienced, caused by COVID-19, implied the adoption of several measures, in an attempt to limit its dissemination. Among which, there is social isolation and the prohibition of visits to institutionalized elderly people. These measures favor the worsening or onset of mental illnesses in the elderly, including depression. As a way to reduce these consequences, video calls began to be made in the institutions so that users could see and talk to their family/friends. For the realization of video calls, the informal caregivers began to request the WhatsApp application, because it is currently the most used application in this context. This is how we get to the question of this study: Is the digital application WhatsApp adapted for the institutionalized elderly population? This study then aims to: to know the opinion of the elderly about WhatsApp;identify the advantages, obstacles, limitations pointed out by them about this application;reduce the infoexclusion among the elderly population;stimulate the creation/maintenance of digital social networks;decrease consequences of the isolation caused by COVID-19. The methodology adopted for this study was qualitative, being an Exploratory Case Study, based on descriptive logic. A non-probabilistic convenience sample was selected, composed of 5 subjects institutionalized in an institution of Idanha-a-Nova. For data collection, a characterization questionnaire was applied, and the participant was observed in the interaction with WhatsApp, during which the field notes and observation grid were registered and finally the Focus Group technique was used. It was concluded that the application and the equipment itself are not adapted to the institutionalized elderly belonging to this study, mainly due to the difficulty in accessing effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily.

"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission fear and the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders and severe asthma, and other high-risk groups","Objective: The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the long term is unclear. We evaluated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)â€“related transmission fear and mental-health disorders in populations at high risk for COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Healthcare workers and patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs), severe asthma, malignancy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were included in the study. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation (FIVE) scales were applied during face-to-face interviews. Results: There was a total of 560 participants, 80 per group;306 (55%) were female. The FIVE and HADS-A scale scores of health care workers were significantly higher than the other groups (p = 0.001 and 0.006). The second-highest scores were in patients with PID. There was no significant difference between the groups in HADS-D scores (p = 0.07). There was a significant positive correlation between FIVE scale scores and anxiety (r = 0.828;p &lt; 0.001) and depression (r = 0.660;p &lt; 0.001).

"Playing across the social zone - Animal Crossing, gaming communities and connectedness in a time of crisis","This proposal focuses on the multifaceted interplay between video games, connectiveness, and online communities in a time of emergency;COVID-19 has presented challenges for teenagers, forcing them to re-mediate their interactions with peers. Digital entertainment has been frequently accused to be a bearer of negative attitudes and anti-social behaviors, but there is also relevant evidence about how video games can foster bonding and inclusion. Nevertheless, updated lenses are needed for understanding the impact of the pandemic on playing and vice versa;in other words, video games can become a lens through which we can understand how teenagers and young adults experience and see the world around them, especially during these turbulent times. Moreover, video games are increasingly experienced in multiple ways, from watching live shows on Twitch.tv to discussing games on Reddit;as such, this additional layer must be investigated too for situating the impact of gaming practices on social and individual schemes. This article intends to provide a snapshot of how this medium can be used as a catalyst for social research, looking at its consumption but also at the social halo it conveys. More specifically, an ethnographic approach has been chosen for providing an intensive analysis of how the acclaimed video game Animal Crossing was perceived and used as a socializing tool by a teenager.","Gandolfi, Enrico, Gandolfi, Sofia","https://doi.org/10.7336/academicus.2021.23.03","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Academicus; - (23):41-51, 2021.; Publication details: Academicus; - (23):41-51, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20309,""
"Acceptance and Attitude toward COVID-19 Vaccination among the Public in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-sectional Study","Aim and objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate vaccine acceptance and attitude to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine among the general population in Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods: The present study was conducted among the general population in Saudi Arabia above 18Â years of age. The data were collected online, by questionnaire containing 20 questions using Google form, in both Arabic and English, and were distributed to friends, families, and relatives through mail, WhatsApp groups, and Twitter. The questionnaire was randomly given out to the people living in five provinces of Saudi Arabia. Results: A sum of 1,713 participants responded to the online survey. The greatest number of participants were at the age between 31 years and 45Â years (36.6%) and 56.4% were females. The results showed that 74.6% have not registered for the vaccination and 44.9% responded not to take the vaccine. About 60.80% were concerned about the side effects, and 48.2% were worried about the allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine. About 49.1% of participants agreed that preventive measures, such as wearing mask, social distance, and using sanitizers, keep the virus away, and 53.20% believes that being exposed to disease naturally is safer for the immune system. Around 23.90% believes that vaccination cannot reduce the possibility of getting COVID-19. Conclusion: In the present study, the negative attitudes and afraid of the side effects of the vaccine are the most reasons for indecision and rejection about COVID-19 vaccine. For the future COVID-19 vaccination campaign not to fail, the Ministry of Saudi Arabia should closely follow the vaccination development processes, inform the public transparently, and consider publicâ€™s concerns.

"Routledge international handbook of music psychology in education and the community","This handbook provides an evidence-based account of psychological perspectives on issues in music education and music in the community through the life course, exploring our understanding of music learning and participation across contexts. The contributors draw on multidisciplinary research from different cultures and contexts in order to set out the implications of music psychology for music education and music in the community. Highlighting the intersecting issues across education and community contexts, the book proposes new theories as well as offering important refinements to existing conceptual models. Split into six parts, it considers the role of music in society as well as for groups and individuals, and explores topics such as processing and responding to music;pedagogical and musical practices that support or pose challenges to the emotional, cognitive, social or physical wellbeing of learners and participants in a range of contexts;and 'music in identity' or 'identity in music'. With the final part on future directions and the implications for professional practice in music education and music in the community, the book concludes by exploring how the two sectors might work more closely together within a post-COVID-19 world. Based on cutting-edge research from an international team, this is essential reading for anyone interested in music psychology, education and community, and it will be particularly helpful for undergraduate and graduate students in music psychology, music education and community music.

"Who Gains from Place-Based Tax Incentives? Exploring Apartment Sales Prices in Qualified Opportunity Zones","Qualified opportunity zones, or o-zones, were established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This new place-based community development program encourages the investment of private capital into economically depressed areas through the use of tax incentives. With significant tax-induced demand, a small â€œinvestment box,â€ and a closing (now closed) window of opportunity for full tax benefits, conditions have been ripe for accelerating o-zone property prices. This study examines the policyâ€™s effect on transaction prices for existing market-rate apartment properties located in census tracts that were designated as o-zones. It finds that certain segments of the apartment investment pool located in o-zones experienced significant price increases between 2017 and 2019. With material sales price increases, the benefits related to tax savings, at least in part, have effectively been transferred to the sellers of these properties. This finding acts as a cautionary reminder to taxable investors. While tax benefits are alluring, investment decisions should not rely on tax incentives alone.

"Cutting Carbon in the Time of COVID","A statistical analysis of the time when those 2,000 climate laws were passed shows that lawmakers are demonstrably less willing to act on climate change in difficult economic times.7 There has been no shortage of exhortations to use the COVID-19 recovery for a ""great reset"" and to ""build back better,"" that is, to align recovery packages with the Paris Agreement.8 However, to date, only a small fraction of the massive fiscal support packages to cushion the impact of the pandemic is Paris aligned.9 Many governments are using postâ€“COVID recovery measures to roll back existing environmental regulations and to increase fossil-fuel intensive infrastructure and electricity.10 It is clear, therefore, that national policies to implement the Paris Agreement and the postâ€“COVID economic recovery need to be brought in line. Making polluters pay We have learned a lot about the best institutional frameworks and the most effective policy packages to combat climate change.11 Central to all of these recommendations is the need to put a price on carbon, either by taxing emissions or by forcing polluters to buy emissions permits.12 Just over a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions are currently subject to a carbon price.13 Pricing carbon will begin to correct the fundamental market failure at the core of the climate problem, namely that the emitters of greenhouse gases are not confronted with the environmental costs caused by their actions. There is a long list of associated problems, including failures in capital markets, network issues (e.g. in the build-up of an electric vehicle charging infrastructure), and largely un-monetized side benefits such as better air quality and healthier lifestyles.16 There are also policy distortions, not least the widespread subsidization of fossil fuels and the underpricing of energy.17 Carbon policy has focused particularly heavily on market failures in two areas: clean technology support and energy conservation. Effective stimulus packages have to be timely (ready to be deployed immediately) and targeted (tapping into underused pools of labor and capital) to maximize the economic multiplier effect of the intervention.21 To varying degrees, zero-carbon interventions like clean energy investment, building energy efficiency upgrades, and clean R&D spending all meet these requirements.22 According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the multipliers associated with green spending are two to seven times larger than those associated with noneco-friendly expenditure, depending on sectors, technologies, and time horizons.23 Building efficiency upgrades, for example, have high employment effects, low deadweight costs (i.e., they would not have happened anyway), high social (fuel poverty) benefits, and they tackle a hard-to-treat source of carbon emissions.","Bowen, Alex, Burke, Josh, Fankhauser, Sam","https://doi.org/10.1353/gia.2021.0030","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Georgetown Journal of International Affairs; 22(2):200-205, 2021.; Publication details: Georgetown Journal of International Affairs; 22(2):200-205, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20313,""
"Risk factors and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 among resident doctors-a retrospective analysis in a non-COVID tertiary care centre","Introduction: The national registry of Indian Medical Association (IMA) shows that 747 doctors have died of COVID 19 as on 1.4.2021 & there is paucity of data on the risk factors for COVID 19 among healthcare workers from India. Objectives: To identify the risk factors and challenges in breaking the chain of infection among COVID infected resident doctors. Methods: A cross sectional study using a structured questionnaire to interview 67 COVID affected resident doctors, was done at National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, a non-COVID tertiary healthcare centre, Bengaluru, India, during March 2020 to April 2021. The data was analysed statistically using the SPSS software version 17. Results: 67 resident doctors participated, with a median age of 29 years Male to female ratio was 3:2. Patient-facing resident doctors (91%) were affected more than the nonpatient-facing(9%)0.55% were fully vaccinated against COVID, 9% infected after first dose, 3% infected within 14 days of the second dose. 33% were unvaccinated All were symptomatic and 97% resumed duty after 14 days of isolation. No mortality reported. Conclusion: The above observations expose the vulnerability of resident doctors in contracting the infection during patient care due to longer exposure, unavoidable suboptimal compliance to infection prevention & control practices, inadequate work redistribution strategies etc. The analysis of these risk factors is pointing to the need for more effective interventions and occupational health policies. Limitations of the study is that, being a non-covid speciality, the outcome cannot be extrapolated onto a covid care facility. (Figure Presented).","Hb, V.

"Physical Activity and Aging: Exploring Motivations of Masters Swimmers","Physical activity benefits the health of older adults (e.g., lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, and falls). However, less than one in four Americans meets guidelines for physical activity and inactivity increases with age. Masters athletes are exemplary because of their remarkable physical functioning. Swimming is a global, fast-growing sport in Masters athletics. This qualitative study explored motivations and barriers of 18 older adult members of a Masters swim club in Southern California. Guided by a primary research question: Why do Masters swimmers choose swim late in life, when most of their age cohort are becoming less physically active, semi-structured interviews delved into the lived experiences of the participants, and solicited peer feedback. Four main themes emerged: (1) I Just Love the Sensation of Being in the Water, (2) Tell Your Body What to Do Instead of the Other Way Around, (3) Make a Commitment to Your Friends That Youâ€™re Going to be There, and (4) Iâ€™ve Never Gone This Long in My Life Without Swimming. Participants expressed longing and regret that they could not swim due to COVID risk and safety guidelines. These findings can be used to design community programs to promote lifelong physical activity participation.","Brilliant, S.

"Factors associated with acceptance of a virtual companion providing screening and advices for sleep problems during COVID-19 crisis","The COVID-19 crisis has generated an increase of sleep problems in the general population. Digital technologies can help dealing with mental health repercussions of COVID-19 but their acceptance by the population need to be better understood. KANOPEE is a smartphone application providing interactions with a virtual companion to screen and deliver personalized advices to deal with sleep problems. In this study we tried to highlight the factors associated with acceptance of this app, among factors including user characteristics, perceived trustworthiness of the virtual companion and context of use. 3,479 users answered the acceptance questionnaires, with a very positive attitude towards the app. Results indicate that age, education, familiarity with technologies, trustworthiness of the virtual agent and length of interaction are significantly associated with acceptance of the app. To conclude, this study is one of the first to measure acceptance of a virtual companion providing support during the COVID-19 crisis, and provide avenues of research for design and evaluation of intelligent virtual agents for health.

"IoT cloud-based framework using of smart integration to control the spread of COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the most crucial emerging virus in the world. The absence of licensed medication or vaccination leads to alternative strategies. A fundamental response plan implemented by all countries was the detection and isolation of infected cases. Contact tracing of infected citizens and testing every suspected case is a prerequisite to avoid new quarantine measures. Infected cases called 'Orphan cases' with no epidemiological connection are more worrying. The initial method to identify them should be knowing the probability for a citizen to be infected, given that presents specific symptoms, to be tested as a suspected case and not as random. This article proposes a cloud-based identification system that studies suspected cases to increase the likelihood that a positive result is correct. Also, it introduces an innovative solution to prevent and control the further spread of Corona-virus disease based on smartphones through the deployment of cutting-edge computing systems in the framework of a Naive Bayesian Network (NBN). Furthermore, the integration of Google Maps could provide geolocation risk assessment and early inferences to government health authorities to raise the test rates in risk- prone areas.

"Towards developing an EMR in mental health care for children's mental health development among the underserved communities in USA","Next Step Clinic (NSC) is a neighborhood-based mental clinic in Milwaukee in the USA for early identification and intervention of Antism spectrum disorder (ASD) children. NSC's primary goal is to serve the nnderserved families in that area with children aged 15 months to 10 years who have ASD symptoms free of cost. Our proposed and implemented Electronic Medical Records (NSC: EMR) has been developed for NSC. This paper describes the NSC: EMR's design specification and whole development process with the workflow control of this system in NSC. This NSC: EMR has been used to record the patient's medical data and make appointments both physically or virtually. The integration of standardized psychological evaluation form has reduced the paperwork and physical storage burden for the family navigator. By deploying the system, the family navigator can increase their productivity from the screening to all intervention processes to deal with ASD children. Even in the lockdown time, due to the pandemic of COVID-19, about 84 ASD patients from the deprived family at that area got registered and took intervention through this NSC: EMR. The usability and cost-effective feature has already shown the potential of NSC: EMR, and it will be scaled to serve a large population in the USA and beyond. Â© 2021 IEEE.","Arefin, K. Z.; Shuvo, K.

"Mental Health during Covid-19 Pandemic-Observations among Head Neck Cancer Patients","Objective In crisis as Covid-19 pandemic the individual coping has a special importance for each tumor patient in order to overcome their specific burdens. Material and methods We have measured mental health data of patients with head and neck cancer in two projects - WHO-5, SpREUK, distress thermometer of burdens. Before pandemic we included 113 patients, during 1st wave we registered 84 patients, and 86 patients took part during 2nd wave. Results During the first lockdown we have seen a decreasing trend of disease burden. The patients reported significant improved life satisfaction and increased search, trust, and reflections. During 2 nd wave those developments were still seen, but in reduced amount. The generally not very high scoring religious trust was significantly reduced during the 2nd lockdown. Conclusions Tumor patients are able to overcome crisis situations by their individual coping strategies. Spiritual care could support these resources.","BÃ¼ntzel, J.; Vitek, P.; Micke, O.; Walter, S.; BÃ¼ssing, A.","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1545-2218","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Deutsche Zeitschrift fur Onkologie; 53(3):107-111, 2021.; Publication details: Deutsche Zeitschrift fur Onkologie; 53(3):107-111, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20322,""

"Using Social Media for Peer-to-Peer Cancer Support: Interviews With Young Adults With Cancer","BACKGROUND: Web-based social support can address social isolation and unmet support needs among young adults with cancer (aged 18-39 years). Given that 94% of young adults own and use smartphones, social media can offer personalized, accessible social support among peers with cancer. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the specific benefits, downsides, and topics of social support via social media among young adults with cancer. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with young adults with cancer, aged between 18 and 39 years, who were receiving treatment or had completed treatment for cancer. RESULTS: Most participants (N=45) used general audience platforms (eg, Facebook groups), and some cancer-specific social media (eg, Caring Bridge), to discuss relevant lived experiences for medical information (managing side effects and treatment uncertainty) and navigating life with cancer (parenting and financial issues). Participants valued socializing with other young adults with cancer, making connections outside their personal networks, and being able to validate their emotional and mental health experiences without time and physical constraints. However, using social media for peer support can be an emotional burden, especially when others post disheartening or harassing content, and can heighten privacy concerns, especially when navigating cancer-related stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Social media allows young adults to connect with peers to share and feel validated about their treatment and life concerns. However, barriers exist for receiving support from social media; these could be reduced through content moderation and developing more customizable, potentially cancer-specific social media apps and platforms to enhance one's ability to find peers and manage groups.","Lazard, Allison J; Collins, Meredith K Reffner; Hedrick, Ashley; Varma, Tushar; Love, Brad; Valle, Carmina G; Brooks, Erik; Benedict, Catherine","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/28234","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Cancer;7(3): e28234, 2021 Sep 02.; Publication details: JMIR Cancer;7(3): e28234, 2021 Sep 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20325,""
"Cross-Canada Release of the Post-Secondary Student Stressors Index (PSSI): Protocol for a Cross-sectional, Repeated Measures Study","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of mental health-related problems, including stress, psychological distress, and symptoms of mental illnesses, continues to increase among Canadian postsecondary student populations. Excessive stress in this population has been linked to a number of negative academic and health outcomes. Despite attempts to improve mental health at postsecondary institutions, a persistent gap exists in the evaluation of the specific sources of stress for students within the postsecondary setting. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to report the study protocol for a cross-Canada, multisite launch of the Post-Secondary Student Stressors Index (PSSI), which will engage postsecondary institutions across the country as partners and facilitate improved measurement of the sources of student stress, in addition to contributing toward improved tailoring of upstream mental health services and support. METHODS: Created in collaboration with students, the PSSI is a validated 46-item tool assessing stressors across five domains: academics, learning environment, campus culture, interpersonal, and personal stressors. The tool is designed to be applicable to students at all years, levels, and areas of study. Data will be collected longitudinally at multiple time points over the course of each academic year. RESULTS: We recruited 15 postsecondary institutions across Canada for the first year, inviting students to participate in an online survey including questions concerning sociodemographic characteristics, stress, mental health, and resiliency. Analyses, including appropriate data visualization, will be conducted to determine the impact of specific stressors on mental health, linking responses over time to allow for the observation of changes in trends. CONCLUSIONS: The PSSI is an intuitive and evidence-informed tool that can aid postsecondary institutions in evaluating the sources of student stress on their campuses. This multisite project will make a substantial contribution to the current literature regarding postsecondary student stress and allow institutions across the country to improve the tailoring of upstream mental health services in order to directly support the unique needs of their student body. Opportunities for knowledge translation and exchange are discussed.

"Air pollution exposure in relation to guard duty at Tidworth Camp: A cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: Air pollution is the largest environmental health risk in the United Kingdom, and an issue of concern amongst outdoor workers. Road transport is a major source producing the largest amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) (as a secondary pollutant). Hundreds of vehicles enter and exit the Tidworth Camp's main gate daily, potentially producing these pollutants. However, the air pollution exposure experienced by personnel on guard duty is unknown. This study aimed to determine and compare background NO2 and O3 levels experienced by personnel on guard duty. METHODS: Cross-sectional data was collected using a static sampling technic on randomly selected days of the week. Data analysis was done using IBM-SPSS-26 and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The background concentration of NO2 and O3 pollutants were within recommended limits. There was no significant difference between mean morning and afternoon exposure levels for both pollutants. However, NO2 and O3 levels were significantly higher during weekdays compared to weekends (M = -0.022, SD = 0.007, t(6) = -8.672, p <0.0001 and M = -0.016, SD = 0.008, t(6) = -5.040, p = 0.002 respectively). Both pollutants showed no significant differences in exposure levels when only weekdays were compared. NO2 levels showed a weak positive correlation during weekdays (r = 0.04) and a strong positive correlation during weekends (r = 0.96). O3 levels had a positive correlation on both weekdays and weekends; however, levels on Monday showed a negative correlation (r = -0.55). Linear regression analysis showed that outside temperature was a significant predictor of O3 levels (p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Personnel on guard duty experienced higher pollution levels during weekdays compared to weekends; however, air pollution levels for both pollutants were within recommended limits. Further studies are recommended over hotter months using a personal sampling technic to measure personal air pollution exposure levels in order to minimise any health and safety risks.","Niba Rawlings, Ngwa; Ambe, Akwah Emmanuela; Ngongalah, Lem","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258070","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;16(9): e0258070, 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One;16(9): e0258070, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20327,""
"How can dementia and disability be prevented in older adults: where are we today and where are we going?","Ageing of the population, together with population growth, has brought along an ample increase in the number of older individuals living with dementia and disabilities. Dementia is the main cause of disability in old age, and promoting healthy brain ageing is considered as a key element in diminishing the burden of age-related disabilities. The World Health Organization recently launched the first risk reduction guidelines for cognitive impairment and dementia. According to recent estimates, approximately 40% of dementia cases worldwide could be attributable to 12 modifiable risk factors: low education; midlife hypertension and obesity; diabetes, smoking, excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, depression, low social contact, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury and air pollution indicating clear prevention potential. Dementia and physical disability are closely linked with shared risk factors and possible shared underlying mechanisms supporting the possibility of integrated preventive interventions. FINGER trial was the first large randomized controlled trial indicating that multidomain lifestyle-based intervention can prevent cognitive and functional decline amongst at-risk older adults from the general population. Within the World-Wide FINGERS network, the multidomain FINGER concept is now tested and adapted worldwide proving evidence and tools for effective and easily implementable preventive strategies. Close collaboration between researchers, policymakers and healthcare practitioners, involvement of older adults and utilization of new technologies to support self-management is needed to facilitate the implementation of the research findings. In this scoping review, we present the current scientific evidence in the field of dementia and disability prevention and discuss future directions in the field.","Lisko, I; Kulmala, J; Annetorp, M; Ngandu, T; Mangialasche, F; Kivipelto, M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joim.13227","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Intern Med;289(6): 807-830, 2021 Jun.; Publication details: J Intern Med;289(6): 807-830, 2021 Jun.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20328,""
"Mental Health and Well-Being During the First vs Second COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Cyprus","Introduction: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries imposed strict governmental lockdowns. Research investigating the psychological impact of pandemic-induced lockdowns is accumulating, though to date no study has examined the psychological health and associated parameters of well-being in countries that underwent additional lockdowns as the pandemic continued into resurgence ""waves."" Aim: The present study provides an overview of the psychological impact of COVID-19 across the two lockdowns in the Cypriot population. Methods: In total, 957 participants completed an online survey during the first lockdown, 134 of whom completed a similar survey again during the second lockdown. The outcomes assessed included stress, positive and negative affect, and well-being. Results: The results indicated no population-wide severe reactions in the participants. Repeated measures analyses showed similar mental health levels during both the first and the second lockdowns. Further inspection of participants' scores indicated that, for all mental health variables, approximately half of the participants improved, while the other half deteriorated. Discussion: Perceived social support and psychological flexibility predicted most psychological outcomes during both lockdowns. Further research is necessary to understand the continuing effects of the pandemic and associated lockdowns on mental health.","Papageorgiou, D.; Kassianos, A.

"COVID-19 epidemic-induced changes in mood and anxiety mediates the relationship between resilience and symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety in sexual assault survivors","Background Sexual assault survivors are a vulnerable sub-population that might be severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, yet received little research attention during this global crisis. Higher levels of resilience are generally associated with lower symptoms of depression and anxiety and are thus considered as promoting adjustment to stress. Here, we tested the associations between resilience, depression, and anxiety symptoms among sexual assault survivors during the COVID-19 epidemic. Pandemic-induced changes in mood and anxiety were also examined as potential mediators of the relations between resilience and clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods At the pandemic onset, 83 sexual assault survivors (66 females, average age=37.68Â±10.90 years) undergoing treatment at a specialized psychiatric outpatient clinic completed a survey aimed at identifying patients in distress during the lockdown. The survey included a battery of questionnaires assessing resilience, pandemic-induced changes in mood and anxiety, and clinical symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. Results Resilience scores were significantly negatively correlated with both depression and generalized anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, pandemic-induced changes in mood and anxiety significantly mediated these effects. Limitations This study cross-sectional design did not allow establishing a temporal relationship between pandemic induced changes (mood and anxiety) and clinical symptoms (depression and generalized anxiety). Conclusions Our findings highlight the need to develop interventions for reducing situational changes in mood and anxiety during periods of acute stress, while increasing resilience factors, in order to decrease the burden of stress on sexual assault survivorsâ€™ mental health during the pandemic and beyond.","Armon, Daphna, Fine, Naomi B.; Seligman, Zivya, Ginzburg, Karni, Ben-Zion, Ziv","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100252","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders Reports;: 100252, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders Reports;: 100252, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20330,""
"W57 MENTAL HEALTH DATA COLLECTION IN THE ESTONIAN BIOBANK: INSTRUMENTS, METHODOLOGY AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS","Background: Background: Common psychiatric disorders are clinically heterogeneous and often display many overlapping symptoms as well as comorbidity across psychiatric disorders, hence complicating the genetic investigation of these disorders. To facilitate new discoveries and gain better understanding of the genetics of psychiatric problems, large well-phenotyped biobank samples are greatly needed. The Estonian Biobank (EstBB;N=200,000) is a data-rich national biobank that joins genomic, biomarker, electronic health record (EHR), national registry and questionnaire data to significantly advance the current knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of complex and rare diseases. We aimed to expand the EstBB database with rich phenotypic questionnaire-based information on a broad set of symptoms of common psychiatric disorders and related phenotypes. Methods: Methods: We compiled an online questionnaire â€œWellbeing and mental healthâ€ which included self-report brief screening instruments to capture a broad range of symptoms on current and/or lifetime depression, anxiety disorders, mania, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, psychotic experiences, suicidal thoughts and behavior, cognition, substance (ab)use, problematic gambling and related risk- and protective factors, such as childhood adversity, stressful life events, social support, lifestyle, sociodemographic factors and life satisfaction. In addition, the participants were asked about the side effects, discontinuation and switching of medications prescribed for a mental health problem in their lifetime. Since the start of the data collection coincided with the peak of the second COVID-19 wave in Estonia, we included items related to current perceived stress, burnout and change in mental health during the pandemic. When selecting instruments, preference was given based on 1) reliability and validity of the instruments;2) whether an Estonian adaptation and/or validation has been conducted;3) application in other large biobanks (e.g. the UK Biobank) for future harmonization or replication;4) short length. Results: Results: The invitations to participate in the online mental health study were e-mailed out to all living EstBB participants with available e-mail addresses (N=184,622), followed by two e-mail reminders. The active data collection phase spanned over three months from March to May 2021. The preliminary response rate was 46.7% (N = 86,222) out of all who were contacted. We will present preliminary results on the comparison of respondents and non-respondents based on demographic data, psychiatric diagnoses in EHR and psychiatric polygenic risk scores. Discussion: Discussion: We have significantly expanded the EstBB resource with phenotypic information on a broad range of psychiatric symptoms and related phenotypes to facilitate future research in psychiatric genetics.

"YOUR ILLNESS ON DRUGS: THE GENETICS OF SUBSTANCE USE INFORMS OUR RESPONSE TO SOMATIC DISEASES","Overall Abstract: SUDs are among the top contributors to all cause mortality. This session highlights cross-cutting genetic and genomic analyses that illuminate the relationships between substance use disorders (SUDs) and aspects of health and disease beyond the known relationships with other psychiatric disorders. This is a topic that has gotten very little attention in the past. It is timely, given multiple global health crises, as it addresses the role of SUDs in respiratory and cardiometabolic illness, COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS â€“ each among the leading contributors to mortality. The first talk will showcase findings from a phenome-wide analysis (PheWAS) of alcohol and cannabis involvement, using medical center data. It demonstrates that genetic liability for substance use has a profound effect on multiple bodily systems. For example, genetic liability for cannabis use predicted respiratory illness while that for alcohol use predicted heart disease. Individuals with SUDs are at higher risk to develop severe cases of COVID-19. The second talk examines genetic correlations between COVID-19 severity phenotypes and 1014 heritable traits, and reveals that the largest genetic causality proportions were for alcohol use frequency, smoking and cannabis use. Third, we pivot from the current pandemic to the ongoing HIV epidemic to discuss the impact of cocaine abuse among HIV+ individuals. The findings showed cocaine use increased viral load, worsened progression, accelerated mortality, and increase the latent viral reservoir. Specific DNA methylation and gene expression differences that appear to be biological mediators of these relationships were uncovered. The last talk addresses the mediating role of behavioral disinhibition, which is genetically correlated with SUD, using a multivariate GWAS approach to creating a broad genetic measure of externalizing behavior (EXT). Pooling data from ~1.5 million people, more than 500 genetic loci were discovered. A PheWAS showed that EXT-PRS was associated with 255 of the 1335 disease phenotypes tested (FDR &lt; 0.05). Individuals with higher EXT-PRS showed poorer health in nearly every bodily system. To conclude, the panel will discuss the importance of considering the genetics of SUDs more broadly, to better understand both psychiatric and somatic disorders and the enormous health burden arising from them.

"COViT-GAN: Vision Transformer forCOVID-19 Detection in CT Scan Imageswith Self-Attention GAN forDataAugmentation","The Vision Transformer (ViT) is currently gaining popularity in computer vision circles due to its record-breaking performance and faster training time achieved without relying on convolution operations found in CNN architectures. In this study, the Vision Transformer is applied to the task of COVID-19 detection from computed tomography (CT) scan images, specifically on the COVID-CT and Sars-CoV-2 datasets. Using a model pretrained on the mid-sized ImageNet-21k dataset, results show that even the smallest ViT variant that uses small input patch sizes outperformed cutting-edge CNNs especially on the smaller COVID-CT dataset with only a few hundred training images. Furthermore, generation of synthetic images using a ResNet-based Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN-ResNet) was employed as a data augmentation method to alleviate the problem of limited data and was found to further improve accuracy by approximately 3% and 2% on the COVID-CT and Sars-CoV-2 datasets, respectively. In addition to being more computationally efficient and scalable than CNNs, ViT also provides representations that allow visualization of areas that are semantically relevant for detection.

"The Study About the Emotional State and Physical Activity of Adolescents During the COVID-19 Epidemic","To investigate the relationship between emotional status and physical activity in adolescents during the epidemic period of Corona Virus Disease 2019. 600 junior and senior high school students from three municipal middle schools were randomly selected as the research objects. The self-evaluation of anxiety and depression and the evaluation of physical activity were carried out in the form of questionnaire survey. A total of 600 questionnaires were put in and 562 were recovered. The scores of SDS and SAS were 49.30 Â± 7.02, and 53.42 Â± 5.37 respectively. According to different age groups, there was significant difference in SAS among the three groups in different age groups (P &lt;0.05). The total score of PA was (3.24 Â± 0.98). According to different age groups, there were significant differences in PA total score, MVPA activities, physical education activities, weekend activities and one week total activities among the three groups (P &lt;0.05). The total score of anxiety was negatively correlated with the total score of PA (r = -0.54, P = 0.024), MVPA (r = -0.38, P = 0.049) and physical education (r = -0.62, P = 0.016), and the total score of one week was negatively correlated (r = -0.44, P = 0.041). During the period of Corona Virus Disease 2019 epidemic, the anxiety level of adolescents increases with age, while the physical activity status decreases gradually, and is negatively correlated with anxiety.

"Addressing the opioid crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic with a virtual, interactive and interprofessional opioid overdose workshop for healthcare professionals","Introduction: The opioid epidemic is a growing and significant public health concern in California's Fresno County. To prevent opioid misuse, overdoses, and deaths, health professionals must learn how to work collaboratively to rapidly identify overdose threats, reverse overdoses, link people to effective treatment and reduce harms associated with opioids. A traditional interprofessional in-person workshop was not feasible due to the COVID-19 pandemic;therefore, a virtual interprofessional workshop was developed and implemented. The faculty team who developed the workshop sought to discover if a virtual approach would promote learning and influence participants' attitudes toward opioid overdose. Research Question or Hypothesis: Does a virtual, synchronous, interprofessional workshop impact healthcare professionals' knowledge and attitudes toward opioid misuse? Study Design: A quantitative, quasi-experimental pre and post approach was used. The target population were healthcare professional providers and students. Methods: Participants attended a 4-hour online synchronous workshop focused on opioid overdose and Naloxone training. Firstresponder Naloxone kits were provided through California's Naloxone Distribution Project. Data were collected via an online survey platform using the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) using a pre/post method, and the Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS), using a retrospective pre/post method. Data were confirmed to be non-parametric, so Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to compare pre- and post-test OOKS overall score and risk, sign, action, and naloxone use subscales and OOAS overall score and competence, concerns, and readiness subscales (Bonferroni adjusted a=0.006). Results: A total of 80 providers, students, and faculty from a variety of specialties participated. All OOKS and OOAS scores, except the readiness subscale, were significantly improved following the workshop and Naloxone training (p&lt;0.004). Conclusion: A 4-hour online synchronous workshop significantly improved knowledge of and attitudes toward opioid overdose among healthcare professional providers and students. These study findings will inform future curriculum development and enhancement of future virtual programs to efficiently train healthcare professionals about approaching an opioid overdose.","Leon, R.; Gilbert, M.; Moore, S.; Nisbett, N.; Sailor, S.; Leiva, M.","https://doi.org/10.1002/jac5.1481","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: JACCP Journal of the American College of Clinical Pharmacy; 4(9):1210, 2021.; Publication details: JACCP Journal of the American College of Clinical Pharmacy; 4(9):1210, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20335,""
"Crisis, Resilience, and Civic Engagement: Pandemic-Era Census Completion","How do economic shocks and financial resilience shape civic engagement, especially for the economically insecure? I turn to the early months of the coronavirus pandemic for insights. In April 2020, with more than 23 million adults unemployed, the US government asked residents to participate in the constitutionally mandated decennial census. I test how variations in income shocks from the shutdown and sources of financial resilience predict disparities in census completion, a civic act designed to minimize participation barriers. First, I use nationally representative survey data to demonstrate that policies that protect the economically vulnerable from the full impacts of economic shocks also predict higher census completion rates. Then, I use Google Trends data to show that high unemployment search volume interacted with low resilience to predict depressed census completion. Findings shed light on how economic crises can widen participation gaps - with representation and resource consequences - and how policies that lessen acute economic shocks may reduce participation disparities.

"Factors influencing knowledge, awareness, and compliance with standard precautions among psychiatric nurses","This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, awareness, and compliance with standard precautions and to examine individual factors related to compliance with standard precautions among psychiatric nurses. Data were collected from September 2020 to March 2021. A total of 160 questionnaires were distributed, and a total sample of 134 valid questionnaires was analyzed. Compliance with standard precautions was significantly correlated with knowledge and awareness. Awareness (ÃŸ = .547, p &lt; .001) was a significant factor of compliance with a total explanatory power of 35.0% (F = 7.27, p &lt;.001). Thus, the current coronavirus disease pandemic has significantly influenced the mental health infection system. These findings highlighted that psychiatric nurse must continue their efforts to improve compliance with infection prevention to prepare for an uncertain future with potential pandemics.","Kyoung, Park Sook, Ki, Yang Ya, Ju, Song Eun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.09.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2021.; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20337,""

"Cardiac Complications in Patients with COVID-19","Background and Aims: This research project aimed to determine the prevalence of cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19 presenting to University Hospital of North Tees (UHNT) with a view to determining compliance with NICE guidelines, comparing to other reported data on cardiac complications, and detecting useful trends that could be used to influence future guidelines. Methods: The notes of 80 patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 were reviewed for various factors, including cardiac complication markers (ECG, Troponin, cardiac imaging, BNP). Data was recorded on excel, anonymised, and analysed. Findings were compared to NICE guidelines and COVID- 19 research. Results: 63/80 patients were positive for COVID-19. On ECG: 10/63 (15.9%) had atrial flutter/ fibrillation (AF), 6/63 (9.5%) had ST depression/ T wave inversion (ST<U+2193>/TWI). The remainder had normal sinus rhythm, no ST<U+2193>/TWI or did not have a recorded ECG. Of the 16/63 (25.4%) patients with either AF or ST<U+2193>/TWI, 2/16 (12.5%) had a negative troponin, 14/16 (87.5%) had no troponin done/recorded. 2/63 (3.2%) had slightly elevated troponin but no ECG. No patients had a moderate to high troponin rise. Conclusion: Data is partially limited by no routine cardiac investigations. However we can infer that the majority of patients did not require these investigations. Where investigations did occur, we noted no cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients. This is in keeping with research by Linschoten et al, which shows a low incidence of cardiac complications in COVID-19 inpatients.1 Further work is required to determine what cardiac investigations should be routine in COVID-19 patients in order to meet NICE recommendations.","Tiah, A.

"Impact of the covid-19 pandemic on mental health of portuguese anaesthesiologists from the national health service","Introduction: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has posed strain on the entire healthcare system. Portuguese anaesthesiologists played a major role, being relocated to newly created intensive care units and performing risky procedures such as endotracheal intubation. We aimed to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of Portuguese Anaesthesiologists working for the National Health Service. Material and Methods: Transversal observational descriptive and analytical study directed to residents and specialists in Anaesthesiology working in public hospitals in Portugal during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Mann-Whitney and ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the GHQ-12 score between groups and paired sample t-test to compare the GHQ-12 score before and during the pandemic. The statistical significance was considered for p-value &lt; 0.05. Results: One-hundred eighty-four physicians answered the questionnaire. The majority of the respondents were women (75%) and most participants were aged between 31 and 40 years old (31%). Participants were mainly from the Northern Region (55.4%). Female participants presented a statistically significant higher GHQ-12 score (p-value 0.024). Nearly 80% of the participants exhibited psychological distress during the pandemic. The main adversities faced were fear of infecting the family and lack of hospital organization. Discussion and Conclusion: Participants reported experiencing a higher psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially women. Therefore, it is important to recognize this problem and take measures to improve the mental health of anaesthesiologists and other healthcare workers to avoid potential short and long-term consequences.","Tiago, C.; Dias-Vaz, M.; Barata, M.; Carvalho, A.

"Knowledge, awareness and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students of biomedical faculties of the University of Zagreb","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all fields of life, including the student population. In a short period students had to get used to online teaching and a different approach to learning. The purpose of this research was to investigate and compare whether there is a difference in knowledge, attitudes, behavior and psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among students of biomedical faculties at the University of Zagreb (School of Dental Medicine, School of Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine). Materials and methods: The survey was conducted between November 2020 and January 2021. Participants were students of biomedical faculties of the University of Zagreb from 1st to 6th year through online survey (n =518). We distributed the survey through closed Facebook groups and student representatives of mentioned faculties. The survey questionnaire consisted of 4 parts: 13 questions about the SARS-COV-2 virus and COVID- 19 infection for knowledge assessment purposes, 13 questions on personal attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic, 10 questions on behavior and preventive measures during a pandemic and 23 questions on psychological impact of the pandemic on the lives of the respondents. Results: No statistically significant difference in knowledge was found between the exam- ined faculties H (3, N = 518) =7.814111;p = 0.05. 41% of students believe that the pandemic will last for another 6 months (from the moment of conducting a survey) while 58% of students disagree with the decisions of the National Civil Protection Headquarters Of the Republic of Croatia. Conclusion: In conclusion, although of different views, students of biomedical faculties have equal knowledge about pandemic COVID-19 and adhere to the directed guidelines to a greater extent. Variety of responses to questions about the psychological impact of a pandemic point to the importance of mental health and the support to overcome pandemic from a psychiatric and psychological aspect.","Å piljak, B.; Milicevic, A.

"Dexmedetomidine infusion for conscious sedation in fess for mucormycosis","Aim of study: To study the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine infusion for conscious sedation in post-covid patients for FESS. Method: we conducted a prospective study of 96 post-covid patients with mucormycosis posted for bilateral FESS after standard approval from the ethical committee in our institute. The patients included were ASA Grade I-3 presenting 4 to 6 weeks after covid infection. 78 out of 96 patients were severely diabetic with mean HbA1c between 8 to 9. 48 patients had severe lung infection with a CT severity scoring &gt; 15/25. Surgery was performed under local anaesthesia with 2% lignocaine and adrenaline infiltration. Patient was premedicated with injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, intravenous midazolam 0.03- 0.05 mg/ kg and intravenous fentanyl 1-2 Âµg/kg. Intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion was started preoperatively. initial loading dose was a bolus of 1 Âµg/kg over 20 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 Âµg/kg intraoperatively. The entire surgery was conducted under local anaesthesia with sedation in 90 patients. General anaesthesia was given in 6 patients because of patient non- cooperation and increased bleeding. Observation: Dexmedetomidine is a potent selective alpha 2 adrenergic agonist. It caused dosedependent sedation and anxiolysis, potentiation of opioid analgesia, minimal respiratory depression and had additional antisialagogue, antitussive and sympatholytic properties. Its use improved the surgical field significantly without compromising patient safety. 10 patients developed bradycardia/ hypotension intraoperatively, so the infusion was discontinued. Conclusion: Easy administration of dexmedetomidine and lack of toxic side effects while maintaining adequate perfusion of vital organs makes it a near-ideal hypotensive agent. Its additional antiinflammatory property is particularly beneficial in post-covid patients. It is an invaluable adjunct In cases where general anaesthesia is avoided. We conclude that dexmedetomidine plays a pivotal role in conscious sedation for FESS.","Shrivastava, G.; Khanna, R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dexmedetomidine+infusion+for+conscious+sedation+in+fess+for+mucormycosis","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Anesthesia and Analgesia; 133(3 SUPPL 2):1460-1461, 2021.; Publication details: Anesthesia and Analgesia; 133(3 SUPPL 2):1460-1461, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20342,""

"Which is more dangerous: COVID-19 disease or isolation of a patient with depression?","Background: Social isolation due to COVID-19 may aggravate psychiatric symptoms (1). We aim to present a suicide attempt as a result of isolation due to COVID-19 pneumonia in a severely depressed patient. Case Report: A 63-year-old man with a medical history of depression, presented with a 3-day history of weakness, fever, and cough. After a positive COVID-19 PCR result, treatment with favipiravir was initiated and he was sent to isolation at home. Direct contact between the family and the patient was purposely minimal;visitors were prohibited. On isolation day 7, he attempted suicide by jumping out of the second floor. His computed tomography revealed multiple rib fractures, left hemopneumothorax, head injury, bladder laceration, and pelvic fracture with active bleeding (Figure1). He was transferred to the ICU. A chest tube was inserted. His psychiatric history was obtained after extubation, he had an anxious period with insomnia after a traffic accident in 2017 and received psychiatric support for a long time. He was transferred to the ward after 5 days of ICU stay. Discussion: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by nightmares and flashbacks of past traumatic events, avoidance of reminders of the trauma, and sleep disturbance (2). This novel, potentially deadly virus may frighten itself, as well as relieve feelings of fear, helplessness, and loneliness from previous bad experiences. All of these feelings can be aggravated by fever, dyspnea, and weakness, together with isolation from the family. Conclusion: Healthcare professionals treating patients during the COVID-19 pandemia should be aware of their patient's history of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and/or distress. Scoring systems to identify patients with high-risk psychological burdens should be urgently established. (Figure Presented).","KiliÃ§aslan, B.; TÃ¼mer, M.; Akinci, S.

"The Impact of Clinical Setting on Evaluating Patients Using the PROMIS-29 Baseline Measures in the COVID Era: A Retrospective Multicenter Quantitative Analysis","BACKGROUND: Multidimensional patient-reported outcomes are a critical part of assessing patients to better understand their well-being during treatment. The PROMIS-29 assessment tool is utilized as a component of assessing multidimensional pain scales. It includes patient-reported measures of pain, mood, sleep, social participation, and function. Currently, there are no data on whether a patient's immediate environment (remote versus in person) influences the reported patient outcomes measurement of a multidimensional tool represented as PROMIS-29 data. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed. Subjects were identified and consecutively enrolled upon entry into a chronic pain or spine center in the United States. The PROMIS-29 v2.1 was recorded. Statistical differences were assessed among age groups and across the seven domains of the assessment. RESULTS: A total of 25,187 distinct patients were enrolled in the study from August 2018 to December 2020 with a presenting baseline measurement of PROMIS-29. The PROMIS-29 v2.1 was evaluated across the seven domains, and subgroup age analysis was performed for patients completing surveys in the clinical setting (non-remote group) and those completing the survey in the remote setting (remote group) during entry into spine and pain practices across the United States. For mental health scores, those less than 40Â years of age and those over 80Â years of age showed significant differences in ratings of anxiety and depression in the remote versus non-remote setting. Regarding physical health scores, those aged 60-79 showed a significant difference in the remote versus non-remote ratings for pain interference (p = 0.005; 63.9 vs. 64.4), physical function (p = 0.000; 36.4 vs. 35.7), and fatigue (p = 0.020; 57.2 vs. 57.7), while subjects over 80Â years of age showed a statistical difference between the remote versus non-remote setting only in rating physical function (p = 0.025; 33.0 vs. 34). Notably, the rating of sleep disturbance in the remote versus non-remote setting was the only significant variable in the 40-59 age category (p = 0.000; 60.0 vs. 59.1). Those less than 40Â years of age also reported a significant difference in the remote versus non-remote setting when rating sleep disturbance (p = 0.000; 60.5 vs. 58.9). With regard to social function, only those older than 80Â years showed a significant difference in rating of ability in the remote compared to the non-remote setting (p = 0.031; 39.6 vs. 40.7). CONCLUSIONS: This data set is the first published data describing the influence of environment (remote versus in person) on PROMIS-29 outcome measurements in the chronic pain population.","Engle, Alyson M; Abd-Elsayed, Alaa; Pope, Jason E; Fishman, Michael","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40122-021-00323-3","","Country: NZ; NOVA ZELÃ‚NDIA; NEW ZEALAND; NUEVA ZELANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pain Ther;2021 Oct 02.; Publication details: Pain Ther;2021 Oct 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20353,""
"Association of Children's Physical Activity and Screen Time With Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: Children's physical activity and screen time are likely suboptimal during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may influence their current and future mental health. Objective: To describe the association of physical activity and screen time with mental health among US children during the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey was conducted from October 22 to November 2, 2020, among 547 parents of children aged 6 to 10 years and 535 parent-child dyads with children and adolescents (hereinafter referred to as children) aged 11 to 17 years and matched down to 500 children per cohort using US Census-based sampling frames. Children aged 11 to 17 years self-reported physical activity, screen time, and mental health, and their parents reported other measures. Parents of children aged 6 to 10 years reported all measures. All 1000 cases were further weighted to a sampling frame corresponding to US parents with children aged 6 to 17 years using propensity scores. Exposures: Child physical activity, screen time, COVID-19 stressors, and demographics. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mental health using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for total difficulties and externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Results: Among the 1000 children included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 10.8 [3.5] years; 517 [52.6%] boys; 293 [31.6%] American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, or Black individuals or individuals of other race; and 233 [27.8%] Hispanic/Latino individuals), 195 (20.9%) reported at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day. Children reported a mean (SD) of 3.9 (2.2) d/wk with at least 60 minutes of physical activity and 4.4 (2.5) h/d of recreational screen time. COVID-19 stressors were significantly associated with higher total difficulties for both younger (ÃŸ coefficient, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9) and older (ÃŸ coefficient, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.0-0.7) groups. After accounting for COVID-19 stressors, engaging in 7 d/wk (vs 0) of physical activity was associated with fewer externalizing symptoms in younger children (ÃŸ coefficient, -2.0; 95% CI, -3.4 to -0.6). For older children, engaging in 1 to 6 and 7 d/wk (vs 0) of physical activity was associated with lower total difficulties (ÃŸ coefficients, -3.5 [95% CI, -5.3 to -1.8] and -3.6 [95% CI, -5.8 to -1.4], respectively), fewer externalizing symptoms (ÃŸ coefficients,  -1.5 [95% CI, -2.5 to -0.4] and -1.3 [95% CI, -2.6 to 0], respectively), and fewer internalizing symptoms (ÃŸ coefficients, -2.1 [95% CI, -3.0 to -1.1] and -2.3 [95% CI, -3.5 to -1.1], respectively). More screen time was correlated with higher total difficulties among younger (ÃŸ coefficient, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.5) and older (ÃŸ coefficient, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6) children. There were no significant differences by sex. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional survey study, more physical activity and less screen time were associated with better mental health for children, accounting for pandemic stressors. Children engaged in suboptimal amounts of physical activity and screen time, making this a potentially important target for intervention.","Tandon, Pooja S; Zhou, Chuan; Johnson, Ashleigh M; Gonzalez, Erin Schoenfelder; Kroshus, Emily","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.27892","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(10): e2127892, 2021 10 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(10): e2127892, 2021 10 01.; COVID-19; Exercise/psychology; Mental Health; Screen Time; Stress, Psychological/psychology; Adolescent; Child; Female; Humans; Male; SARS-CoV-2; United States; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20354,""
"VR Health Experience: A Virtual Space for Arts and Psychomotor Therapy","Introduction: Mental health and well-being are under pressure because of the corona pandemic. Arts and psychomotor therapists said that they had almost no experience with working online, but despite the fact that they felt incapable, they were positive towards it. Method: This qualitative action research was aimed at how arts and psychomotor therapists can become more skilled in offering online arts and psychomotor therapy and how they can methodically enlist the VR Health Experience (a virtual arts and psychomotor therapy space) in therapy. It is envisaged that the arts and psychomotor therapist could be telepresent in order to offer arts and psychomotor therapy remotely. In online training that made use of the Lean Startup Method, participants (n = 5) integrated their working knowledge with the VR Health Experience. The interventions were immediately tested by the participants and in practice. Participants were interviewed retrospectively and their experiences were thematically analysed. Results: The VR Health Experience came forward as an innovative addition to the usual arts and psychomotor therapy. Often, clients were encouraged to play and experiment, and the VR world offered several options. The VR Health Experience lowered the threshold, expanded the training areas and held a great attraction for play. Discussion: This project offered an innovative quality boost for arts and psychomotor therapy. Arts and psychomotor therapy have proven to be possible remotely via telepresence of the therapist. The therapist is present together with the client in the VR Health Experience, the virtual arts and psychomotor therapy space, where connectedness can be felt and new experiences can be gained. VR also offers further possibilities in arts and psychomotor therapy.","Haeyen, Suzanne; Jans, Nathalie; Glas, Marleen; Kolijn, Joep","https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.704613","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Front Psychol;12: 704613, 2021.; Publication details: Front Psychol;12: 704613, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20355,""
"Anxiety in relatives of patients with covid-19 hospitalized at respiratory diseases national institute","Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had impact on peopleâ€™s mental health. The family or caregiver of hospitalized patients are considered a vulnerable population, who do not usually receive the necessary mental health care, and due to the current confinement, they have to be apart from their relative interned for COVID-19, making their situation harder. Objective: To know the anxiety symptoms of the relatives of patients in hospital for such disease. Material and methods: Exploratory, descriptive and ambispective study on relatives of hospitalized patients for COVID-19 at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, interviewed through the questionnaire GAD-7, from May 15 to September 30, 2020. A descriptive analysis was carried out and sociodemographic variables were collected for their correlation. Results: A sample of 234 family members was analyzed, with an average age of 42 years, the mean of anxiety symptoms was at seven, corresponding to a diagnosis of mild anxiety. Of them, 73.5% reported mild symptomatology and 26.5% moderate-severe. Women have more moderate-severe symptomatology compared to men (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Almost a third of the family members reported mild or severe anxiety symptoms. These results are very important because anxiety could influence the decisions they make about the treatment of their hospitalized patients for COVID-19. Developing strategies to give them psychological support could be the most important goal throughout the pandemic. Â© 2021, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias.

"The Mental Health of US Parents During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Evidence suggests parents experience unique pandemic-related stressors related to isolation, food insecurity, school closures, and unemployment. This study examined 1,048 U.S. parents' depression, anxiety, stress, atid alcohol and substance use behavion during March and April 2020 to better understand the impact of pandemic-related conditions on parents' mental health. Mean scores indicated severe levels of depression and stress and extremely Severe anxiety. Nearly two thirds (74.7%) indicated alcohol use in the past month, with 26.5% scoring in the range for problem alcohol use. Almost half of the sample reported using at least one substance in the previous 2 weeks. Men had significantly higher alcohol consumption and substance use than women. Depression, anxiety, and stress were higher for parents who consumed alcohol or substances and had a history of depression or anxiety. The longterm impact of COVID-19 is unknown, and mental health care is likely to be in high demand moving forward.

"Counselors' Experience of Work and Family Roles During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In this study, the researchers used quantitative analysis to examine the relationship between counselors' work-family conflict, work-family enrichment, work variables, and faamily variables during the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors that predicted counselors' experience of conflict between work and family roles included lacking workplace flexibility, having a child under the age of 6, spending a high number of hours caring for, others, and experiencing a change in location of the work setting due to COVID-19. Workplace flexibility and a low number of hours spent caring for others predicted counselors' experience of enrichment. Participants' mean responses to the Work-Family Conflict Scale and Work-Family Enrichment Scale indicated they experienced higher levels of enrichment than conflict during the pandemic.

"STATISTICAL METHODS TO REPRESENT THE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION EXPERIENCED IN ALMADINH KSA DURING COVID-19","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an issue of global concern. It has been nine months since the first confirmed case of the coronavirus disease in Saudi Arabia. The recent COVID-19 outbreak has had a devastating impact on education, economic, stability and health. This study investigates the prevalence of anxiety and depression among individuals in Almadinh KSA during COVID-19. Method: A cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed to public in Amdadina KSA via Google forms collect the data. The responds included 78 female and 352 male, socio-demographic information including age, gender, and education levels was collected. Three mathematical models were determined to be powerful statistical techniques for classifying and predicting anxiety and depression: logistic regression, decision tree, and analysis. Results: The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression were 92.6 % and 91.4.0%, respectively. The decision tree and linear discriminate analysis yielded the same results. The accuracy of correctly classified cases was the same in all three methods. This analysis reveals significant structural differences between three methods. There is a wide range of Saudi citizens who are at higher risk for dysfunctional behavior during COVID-19 pandemic.","Alharbi, R.; Alnagar, D.; Abdulrahman, A.

"'Prime time of life', a 12-week home-based online multimodal exercise training and health education programme for middle-aged and older adults in laois","Introduction: Multimodal exercise training can ameliorate the physiological decline associated with ageing. This study aimed to investigate whether 12 weeks of a home-based online multimodal training and health education intervention could improve functional ability and perceptions of physical and mental health in middle-aged and older adults. Methods: Sixty-one male (N = 18, 59.1 Â± 7.0 years) and female (N = 43, 60.9 Â± 6.8 years) participants with various clinical conditions completed two 60-minute training sessions per week for 12 weeks delivered online via Zoom. All sessions included aerobic, resistance, balance, and flexibility exercises. One weekly session incorporated 15 minutes of health and fitness education. The pre/post testing sessions were conducted in a local community centre in line with COVID-19 public health guidelines. Paired samples t-tests and the Wilcoxon signed rank tests were utilised to compare scores pre and post intervention. Results: There were significant improvements in participants 6-minute walk (p &lt; 0.0001), sit-to-stand (p &lt; 0.0001), timed-up-and-go (p &lt; 0.0001), sit-and-reach (p &lt; 0.0001), squat jump (p &lt; 0.0001), core endurance (p &lt; 0.0001), grip strength (right hand p = 0.03, left hand p = 0.04) and balance (right leg p &lt; 0.0001, left leg p = 0.004) tests post intervention. Perceptions of physical (p &lt; 0.0001) and mental (p &lt; 0.0001) health also improved significantly. Discussion: Twelve weeks of online multimodal training and health education can significantly improve cardiovascular fitness, strength, power, balance, flexibility, and perceptions of physical health, mental health, and quality of life in middle-aged and older adults. While there are some limitations to online interventions, the benefits are numerous and equal to those reported for onsite interventions and should be considered for wider rollout in this population.

"The Relationship Between the Activity Level, Internet Addiction, and Depressive Symptoms of University Students During the Coronavirus Disease-2019 Outbreak Cross-Sectional Study","Objective: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic significantly disrupted normal activities globally. Social restriction measures were encountered during the pandemic process, which resulted in students staying at home for a long time. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between physical activity, internet addiction, and depressive symptoms of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 160 students studying at Aydin Adnan Menderes University Soke Health Services Vocational School between July and August 2020. A Personal Identification Form, Short Form of Young's Internet Addiction Test, Beck Depression Scale, and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) were used to collect the research data. Spearman correlation test and Student's t-test were used for data analysis. Results: The IPAQ revealed that 28.2% of the students were active. The students' mean depression scores were 8.8 +/- 6.6 (0-37) and the internet addiction mean score was 25.1 +/- 7.2 (12-47). A moderately significant positive correlation was found between the mean scores of internet addiction and depressive symptoms (r=0.303;p&lt;0.01). No difference was found between the mean scores of depressive symptoms and internet addiction in active and inactive students (p&gt;0.05). Contrarily, a relationship was determined between internet addiction and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Improving the physical and psychological health of university students during the pandemic process is important for public health. Therefore, various multi-sectoral approach developments, such as online physical activity programs, are recommended. Additionally, students should be made aware of how to balance the time spent in front of the computer or the internet.","Ozturk, N.; Oter, E.

"Optimization strategies of human mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic: A review","The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is being felt in all spheres of our lives â€“ cutting across the boundaries of nation, wealth, religions or race. From the time of the first detection of infection among the public, the virus spread though almost all the countries in the world in a short period of time. With humans as the carrier of the virus, the spreading process necessarily depends on the their mobility after being infected. Not only in the primary spreading process, but also in the subsequent spreading of the mutant variants, human mobility plays a central role in the dynamics. Therefore, on one hand travel restrictions of varying degree were imposed and are still being imposed, by various countries both nationally and internationally. On the other hand, these restrictions have severe fall outs in businesses and livelihood in general. Therefore, it is an optimization process, exercised on a global scale, with multiple changing variables. Here we review the techniques and their effects on optimization or proposed optimizations of human mobility in different scales, carried out by data driven, machine learning and model approaches.

"Happiness in Czechia during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The unprecedented growth of prosperity in developed countries, including the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, interrupted by the economic crisis in 2008â€“2009, came to a halt at the beginning of 2020. This was due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 respiratory disease pandemic, for which no cure was known in June 2020. The response of governments in the form of declaring a state of emergency and closing national and regional borders for several months had serious economic and, above all, psychological consequences. Anxiety, depression, and possibly suicides were expected to increase. In this paper, we focused on the experience of happiness, understood as positive emotion, expressing the highest degree of well-being. The conceptualization of happiness is based on the analysis of six indicators. The aim of the paper was to explore the experience of happiness during the COVID-19 pandemic in Czechia. Two hypotheses were formulated in terms of the expected effects of this pandemic on the experience of happiness. Measuring happiness in one region of the Czechia on a scale of 0â€“10 using both face-to-face methods and social networks yielded different results from those expected.","Petrovic, FrantiÅ¡ek, MurgaÅ¡, FrantiÅ¡ek, KrÃ¡lik, Roman","https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910826","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(19):10826, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(19):10826, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20363,""
"Gendered Factors Associated with Preventive Behaviors and Mental Health among Chinese Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic Home Quarantine","The outbreak of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly impacted the life and mental health of many people globally. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors associated with preventive behaviors and mental health among Chinese adults during their home quarantine in the COVID-19 period. An online questionnaire survey was administered in March 2020. The study participants were adults aged between 18 and 70 years old from 31 provinces in China. Of the 3878 participants, 1314 reported moderate levels of anxiety, and the remaining participants reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety. Findings revealed that females aged between 18 and 30 years old who had higher educational qualifications, greater levels of preventive knowledge, trust in the government, and resided in urban and medium-risk areas (R2 = 0.100, F = 27.97, p &lt;0.001) were more likely to exhibit preventive behaviors. In contrast, a higher negative emotional response was generally seen in males who had low levels of preventive knowledge and behaviors, higher risk perception of infection, lower trust in the government, and unhealthy lifestyles (R2 = 0.127, F = 32.33, p &lt;0.001). In addition, the high-risk perception of infection was positively associated with high odds of anxiety (AOR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.10â€“1.24), whereas a greater level of preventive knowledge (AOR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.19â€“0.70) and behaviors (AOR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57â€“0.84), higher trust in the governmentâ€™s COVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures (AOR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71â€“0.83), and a healthier lifestyle (AOR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.79â€“0.99) were negatively associated with high odds of anxiety. Results showed that a lower level of anxiety and negative emotional response were associated with better preventive behaviors against COVID-19, which were influenced by preventive knowledge, risk perception, trust in the governmentâ€™s COVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures, and healthy lifestyle. Findings in this study could help formulate health interventions for vulnerable groups related to gendered vulnerabilities in the COVID-19 environment to improve their mental health and preventive behaviors, especially during the period of a pandemic.","Liu, Shu-Mei, Shih, Shu-Fang, Meng, Bo, Zhen, Rui, Pan, Xiao-Ben, Ng, Eric, Hsu, Chia-Hsuan, Fang, Wei-Ta","https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910819","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(19):10819, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(19):10819, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20364,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on College Students: An Online Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic, since its beginning in December 2019, has altered every aspect of human life. In Vietnam, the pandemic is in its fourth peak and is the most serious so far, putting Vietnam in the list of top 30 countries with the highest daily cases. In this paper, we wish to identify the magnitude of its impact on college students in Vietnam. As far as weâ€™re concerned, college students belong to the most affected groups in the population, especially in big cities that have been hitting hard by the virus. We conducted an online survey from 31 May 2021 to 9 June 2021, asking students from four representative regions in Vietnam to describe how the pandemic has changed their lifestyle and studying environment, as well as their awareness, compliance, and psychological state. The collected answers were processed to eliminate unreliable ones then prepared for sentiment analysis. To analyze the relationship among the variables, we performed a variety of statistical tests, including Shapiroâ€“Wilk, Mc Nemar, Mannâ€“Whitneyâ€“Wilcoxon, Kruskalâ€“Wallis, and Pearsonâ€™s Chi-square tests. Among 1875 students who participated, many did not embrace online education. A total of 64.53% of them refused to think that online education would be the upcoming trend. During the pandemic, nearly one quarter of students were in a negative mood. About the same number showed signs of depression. We also observed that there were increasing patterns in sleeping time, body weight, and sedentary lifestyle. However, they maintained a positive attitude toward health protection and compliance with government regulations (65.81%). As far as we know, this is the first project to conduct such a large-scale survey analysis on students in Vietnam. The findings of the paper help us take notice of financial and mental needs and perspective issues for indigent students, which contributes to reducing the pandemicâ€™s negative effects and going forwards to a better and more sustainable life.","Tran, Thien Khai, Dinh, Hoa, Nguyen, Hien, Le, Dac-Nhuong, Nguyen, Dong-Ky, Tran, An C.; Nguyen-Hoang, Viet, Nguyen Thi Thu, Ha, Hung, Dinh, Tieu, Suong, Khuu, Canh, Nguyen, Tuan A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910762","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(19):10762, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(19):10762, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20365,""
"Changes in Mathematics Core Curriculum and Matriculation Exam in the Light of the COVID-19-Shock","The new National Core Curriculum came into force in September 2020 in Hungarian schools. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a deep impact on the final stages of its development. In this paper we have selected two areas for analysis: the fundamental principles of mathematics curriculum and the matriculation exam in mathematics. We propose improvements in both fields, further emphasizing the importance of skills in displaying, understanding and processing information, including visual information obtained as a source or outcome of a problem. We argue that representation, interpretation, and critical evaluation of data and information must be essential parts of the mathematics curriculum. In this context, we also propose a new type of task for the matriculation exam: a complex essay task. The ultimate goal is the development of cross-cutting competencies to support students to become citizens who can make responsible decisions based on the data and knowledge available.","Csapodi, Csaba, Hoffmann, MiklÃ³s","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11100610","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(10):610, 2021.; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(10):610, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20366,""

"Remotely enhancing our education in response to COVID (APLS and CPRR)","BackgroundWhen COVID hit, ALSG had to quickly adapt their education programmes to ensure training was safe and sustainable. The RCPCH endorsed APLS course, and the RCPCH joint Child Protection (CPRR) course, have been adapted and made accessible in a remote environment, allowing for safe delivery of essential training, with learning still very much at the heart.ObjectivesAlthough the environment had changed and many restrictions on human contact were put in place, keeping learning at the heart of education was ALSGâ€™s fundamental objective.The candidatesâ€™ experience must be enhanced by learning remotely.Make training available and accessible in a safe environment by evolving courses to be delivered online.Save lives and improve patient outcomes by continuing to provide essential training.As child protection presentations increased during COVID, it was important for ALSG to ensure colleagues had the skills and confidence to be able to address these.MethodsMethods - APLSAPLS is traditionally a two day, face-to-face course with a third day doing pre-course online learning via interactive e-modules. An alternative â€˜remotely enhancedâ€™ APLS model was adapted which now includes:One day pre-course learning (e-modules) and additional online materials such as skills, tutorials and podcasts.One day remote learning â€“ faculty-led teaching in a virtual environment, building on the pre-course learning. Case based discussions have been introduced to prepare the candidates for how their learning and practice works in the workplace.One day practical face-toâ€“face training with embedded skills which gives candidates more time to practise the illness, cardiac and trauma skills through simulations.Methods â€“ CPRRCPRR has been converted from a one-day, face-to-face course to a fully online course The majority of the learning takes place in virtual groups of 3 or 6 candidates, in the form of discussions and role plays. As a lifesaving communications course ALSG has taken the opportunity to increase the practice of difficult conversations, introducing new, up to date role plays to reflect the increase in domestic violence and selfharm during the pandemic.ResultsALSG and centres around the UK have adopted the remotely enhanced model of learning and 23 courses have taken place since September 2020.Faculty memberâ€˜ALSG have continued to put the needs of the patients and candidates first resulting in a course [APLS] that continues to deliver first rate education. I felt that the COVID measures in place were innovative and comprehensive which meant they had minimal impact on our ability to focus on teaching.â€™APLS working group chairâ€˜Education lies at the heart of this course, as clinicians must continue to progress their learning as well as their skills and the launch of APLS in this new format is an excellent step forward and one which will continue past the current pandemic.â€™ConclusionsALSGâ€™s remotely enhanced courses provides colleagues with an alternative way of engaging in training whilst global restrictions are in place. It provides candidates with additional resources to support their learning and many have commented they feel much better prepared for attending the course. Remotely enhanced learning is not just for the here and now, ALSG sees a place for this in the future too.","Kay, Sinead","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.845","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A486, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A486, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20368,""
"Virtual art therapy: meeting the psychosocial needs of children and young people with a long term health condition during the Covid-19 pandemic","BackgroundChildren and young people (CYP) with a long term condition (LTC) are known to have increased psychosocial needs. This is also true for siblings of CYP with a LTC.The current COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the psycho-social wellbeing of CYP, especially those with a LTC and their siblings. This has resulted in an increase in demand for psychosocial support which has presented a challenge as to how these needs might be met.During the pandemic, a Childrenâ€™s Hospital, in partnership with Teapot Trust (a charity providing art therapy) offered a virtual art therapy intervention to CYP with chronic kidney disease in order to support their psychosocial needs. The art therapy was delivered virtually via Zoom.ObjectivesTo explore the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering a virtual art therapy intervention and measure the impact of the intervention on Children and young people psychosocial wellbeingMethodsThe hospital MDT identified and shared referrals with the Teapot Trust art therapist. CYP completed a Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) survey at the start and end of the intervention to assess impact on psychosocial wellbeing.From August â€“ December 2020: 8 CYP (aged 6â€“14 years) received virtual art therapy support. Sessions were either delivered 1:1 (N=4) or group (N=4). The art therapist delivered the therapy via Zoom. All CYP received an individual art resource pack. Youth workers participated in sessions where considered helpful. CYPs needs were identified at their initial session and a support plan put in place. Progress was reviewed after 8 weeks and sessions extended if needed. At the end of the intervention CYP also completed an enjoyment feedback form. Parentâ€™s feedback about their childâ€™s well-being and enjoyment was collected at the end of the intervention.ResultsThe CYP received a mean of 8 (range 6 â€“ 18 weeks) sessions.CYP: N=8. 87.5% (N=7) completed the WEMWBS survey. Average WEMWBS score increased from 82.7 (high) at baseline to 91.3 (high) post intervention which is a positive change across the whole group.All 100% (N=7) showed improved self-esteem, improved mood, increased energy and motivation, and increased relaxation.Parent feedback: 62.5% (N=5) completed the feedback forms. 100% (N=5) responses were positive.CYP said â€˜it helped me understand all those feelings that were hidden for such a long time.â€™Parent feedback â€˜the difference in Râ€™s mental health from when she started the art therapy and finished was like night and dayâ€™â€¦â€¦ â€˜being very proactive in her own self-care, seemed happier â€¦â€¦â€¦extremely pleased with the resultâ€™.ConclusionsDelivery of a virtual art therapy intervention appears to support improvement of the psychosocial wellbeing of CYP.

"The poverty pandemic: start seeing, screening and intervening","BackgroundBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, 4 in 10 children local to North Middlesex Hospital lived in poverty. Recent job losses, rising debt, bereavement and deteriorated mental health, all inevitably increase hardship. Poverty increases the risk of chronic diseases, mental illnesses, accidents and trauma. Surprisingly, families living in the west of Enfield and Haringey live almost 15 years longer in good health than those in the east!ObjectivesWe challenged our paediatric staff to start seeing poverty as a chronic health problem and not just a moral issue. By screening for poverty, as we do other health risks, we can identify and intervene for vulnerable families and offer them essential help.MethodsIn July 2019 we explored paediatric doctorsâ€™ awareness of the social determinants of health. Using quality improvement methodology we built upon our pilot project in Kingston Hospital. Barriers to screening and possible questions were discussed. Education sessions, email communications, text reminders and leaflets were shared regularly with paediatric staff. Surveys were planned to monitor staff progress and record families being signposted.ResultsBarriers to screening for poverty included a perceived lack of time, inexperience, being unaware of resources and inadequate privacy during clinical assessments. In October 2019, only 10% of staff surveyed routinely screened for poverty. 13% felt they had sufficient knowledge of where to signpost families in need and 22% recalled giving social help in the preceding 3 months.To improve these rates we devised change ideas:screening questions co-designed with parents,â€˜123 fight inequalityâ€™ leaflets of practical resources co-produced,presentations and workshops with local parents who had suffered hardship.Despite these and regular communications to staff, poverty screening rates worsened during the pandemic. In October 2020 we re-launched Connected Communities (CC) and the provision of support workers within the hospital. Staff reported feeling empowered knowing that practical help would be given. A poverty screening guideline was drafted with case studies and recommended screening using framing like:â€˜Since the pandemic we know more parents are finding it difficult to pay bills/debts, afford food or find employment, - do you?â€™ Or asking â€˜do you worry that your housing is affecting your childâ€™s health?â€™ We delivered teaching together with CC support workers in February 2021.In March 2021, 43% of doctors and nurses surveyed reported they had screened the last patient they saw;79% were aware of resources and;67% had signposted someone to help in the last 3 months. From zero introductions to Connected Communities in October 2020, a staggering 95 parents have been screened and recommended to contact our support workers. Only 23 have engaged so far and they have received help with housing, finances/benefits and citizenship. Ten do not speak English but will be supported to access advice.ConclusionsTackling health inequalities takes commitment. By seeing, screening and intervening, we help reduce stigma and identify vulnerable families. Our close partnership with Connected Communities increased staff confidence and increased introductions. More work is needed to determine why only 23/95 parents take up the offer but language barrier, parental expectations or clerical factors may contribute.","Okereafor, Akudo, Saunders, Helen, Brassington, Sophie, Myers, Alice, Patel, Esha, Zhu, Hannah","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.837","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A481-A482, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A481-A482, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20370,""
"Epidemiology, severity and outcomes of children presenting to emergency departments across Europe during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic: an observational cohort study","BackgroundAn unprecedented reduction in paediatric emergency department (PED) attendances has been reported following the introduction of social distancing measures during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK. Emerging evidence also suggests changes in the type of acute presentations to urgency and emergency care.ObjectivesWe aimed to describe the patterns of children presenting to PEDs across Europe during the first wave of the SAS-CoV-2 pandemic, and compare these with historical data, to understand the timeliness of their presentations in relation to the disease severity, and to monitor for emerging disease entities.MethodsThe â€˜Epidemiology, severity and outcomes of children presenting to emergency departments across Europe during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemicâ€™ (EPISODES) - study collected data from 39 PEDs in 18 countries including 6 UK sites. Routine clinical data were extracted from electronic health records for all children aged &lt;16 years from January 2018 â€“ May 2020, and these were uploaded using a standardised data entry form on the validated online REDCap system. Standardised 28-day rates were calculated for PED attendance, hospital admission, and selected diagnoses;interrupted times series were performed. Ethics approval was obtained at all study sitesResultsPED attendances varied between 420 and 6,370 between sites for January 2020. Across sites, a reduction in PED attendances (March 2020 vs March 2021) ranged from 29.0% in children aged 5â€“12 years to 44.8% in children &lt;14 days;a larger reduction was seen at the 6 UK sites. In a preliminary sample across sites, no increase was seen for appendicitis (standardised 28-day number of patients of 181 in April 2018 vs 219 in April 2019 vs 182 in April 2020) or diabetic ketoacidosis (27 vs 29 vs 28);a reduction was observed for otitis media (1628 vs 1538 vs 214), tonsillitis (3672 vs 3506 vs 776), and mental health issues (329 vs 300 vs 176). Reductions in hospital admissions were seen for any type of admission, including admissions &gt;72 hours and to intensive care.ConclusionsThis multinational study confirms a dramatic reduction in PED attendances of all levels of severity observed during the first wave of COVID-19 across Europe. The reduction was consistent in all participating sites, despite the heterogeneity in social distancing measures introduced. We did not find an increase in appendicitis or diabetic ketoacidosis, and a decrease for mental health issues.","Nijman, Ruud, Honeyford, Kate, Bressan, Silvia, Titomanlio, Luigi","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.816","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A469-A470, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A469-A470, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20371,""
"Parental perceptions of paediatric emergency departmental attendance in children during the COVID-19 pandemic in UK (PPEDiC) The qualitative view","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has massively impacted on how healthcare is accessed. Paediatric Emergency Departments (PED) attendances have fallen dramatically in the UK during this period. Studies so far have focused on quantitative data when exploring this topic;whereas, our study uses qualitative methodology to review parental attendance motivations. Our study addresses a critical gap in understanding the factors that may influence caregiversâ€™ PED attendance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic within our region.ObjectivesThe aim of the study was to explore and understand how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced caregiversâ€™ health-seeking behaviours. Specifically , we assessed how caregiver behaviour has changed, the perceived factors affecting presentation to the paediatric emergency department, how information around health has been received by caregivers and how the information should be communicated by health-care professionals to meet the caregiversâ€™ needs.MethodsThis qualitative sub-study was part of a mixed method study assessing parental perceptions and experience of PED. It used a purposive and convenience sampling method to recruit caregivers attending PED with varied age, gender and ethnicity. Using in-depth interviews, we explored caregiversâ€™ experiences and perceptions of PED attendance among caregivers who presented with their children at our trust, comprising of two hospitals, during November - December 2020. Informed written consent was obtained from caregivers. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed thematically using coding to identify emergent themes, patterns and concepts from participantsâ€™ accounts. The thematic content analysis was conducted by two study members for inter-rater reliability.ResultsThe findings coalesced around three main themes: caregiversâ€™ lived experience of the pandemic, healthcare seeking perceptions and behaviour, and information sources/communication channels. When describing experiences of the pandemic, almost all participants expressed intense emotions such as fear, anxiety, depression and the need to adapt to new social norms. Decision-making around when and where to seek care for a sick child was predominantly influenced by the severity of the childâ€™s condition, professional medical advice and perceptions of the SARS-COV-2 transmission risk posed by visiting the hospital: â€˜weâ€™ve heard â€¦ of people going into hospital for something unrelated and catching itâ€™ID8. Some caregivers reported how hospital staff actions and/or the hospital environment itself could mitigate and/or propagate these concerns in equal measures, such as wearing masks correctly. Caregivers also expressed worries around overburdening the NHS â€˜Iâ€™ll just ring the GP see what they say â€¦ make sure they (the hospital) wouldnâ€™t think we were wasting their timeâ€™ID4. Despite the varied range of communication channels reportedly providing health information, which included government, health services, mainstream and/or social media, many participants cited distrust in one or several of these sources. Health professionals, schools and social networks were cited as trusted and preferred sources for disseminating information around paediatric health issues.ConclusionsOur findings show that caregivers are fearful of bringing sick children to PED and some mainstream sources of information are perceived to be untrustworthy. Public health messaging should emphasize the availability and safety of hospital facilities.","Appleby, Gayle, Wharton-Smith, Alexandra, Hemeson, Anthony, Sajjanhar, Tina, Wicksey, Lorraine, Emedo, Marylyn, Cahill, Benjamin, Keers, Sophie, Yim, Alastair, Nyirenda, Maggie","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.794","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A457, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A457, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20372,""

The first COVID-19 lockdown in England, beginning in March 2020, necessitated Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) providers to conduct many consultations and assessments remotely, where remotely is defined as in a format other than in-person (such as a telephone or video call). However, such practices were previously uncommon, hence little is known about whether service users feel that these remote ways of working can continue to meet their healthcare needs. This study aims to investigate whether remote CAMHS consultations and assessments are as acceptable to children and young people (CYP) and their parents or carers as the in-person equivalents.ObjectivesTo assess the acceptability of the newly remote practices of a CAMHS Intensive Outreach Team implemented during the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 23rd 2020 â€“ May 30th 2020). This was facilitated through telephone interviews with the CYP (aged 0â€“17) who accessed the service during this time, along with their parents or carers.MethodsThe emergency departments of three hospitals within the same region of England were used to source participants for the study, along with a CAMHS Intensive Outreach Team serving the same locality. A database of CYP who were referred to this outreach team from these emergency departments during the first COVID-19 lockdown was generated (n=84), along with their primary parent or carer (n=84). All were invited to the study by a postal letter (n=168), and telephone interviews were carried out with those who responded to the letter. Acceptability was assessed through questions inviting a rating on a 10-point Likert scale. The questions assessed whether the service user felt â€˜supported and heardâ€™ and â€˜respected,â€™ during their consultation, and whether they were â€˜happyâ€™ with it. Of the participants, some had consulted with the CAMHS team in-person, and others had consulted with them remotely. Responses from each category were separated after the data collection phase, to allow for statistical comparison of the results between the in-person and remote consultation groups.ResultsTelephone interviews were conducted with 36 CYP, and 77 parents or carers. Results were statistically analysed through use of an independent two-tailed T-test. Of the CYP, there was no significant difference between the Likert ratings of acceptability for in-person consultations (n=27, M=8.7) and remote consultations (n=9, M=9.3), conditions t(29)=2.064, p = 0.020. Of the parents or carers, there was also no significant difference between the Likert ratings of acceptability for in-person consultations (n=53, M=8.1) and remote consultations (n=24, M=7.9) conditions t(56)=0.586, p=2.667.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique avenue to investigate whether previously uncommon remote ways of working are as acceptable to CAMH service users in the mainstream. Our findings support the idea that remote CAMH consultations are just as acceptable to both CYP and their parents or carers as their in-person equivalents, suggesting that their continued use could be a welcome addition to mainstream practice.","Agutu, Oliver, Mack, Cerys, Thirlwall, Kimberley, Woodin, Geoffrey, Reeves, Megan, Robinson, Rory, McLewis, Benjamin, Jeeves, Thomas, Chinnock, Bernadette, McLernon, Dominic","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.753","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A433, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A433, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20374,""
"Regional online learning programme: experience on its opportunities and barriers","BackgroundAlthough children and young people develop mild disease with Covid-19, the pandemicâ€™s impact on child health and wellbeing is immeasurable. Maintaining a knowledgeable, adaptable and compassionate paediatric workforce will help healthcare systems adapt to an expected longer-term impact on child health, including widening of inequalities and increased mental health problems. With disruption to paediatric services and cancellation of face-to-face teaching, we needed to make radical changes to our regional training.ObjectivesWe share our experience in designing a multi-faceted online learning programme (OLP) and discuss the opportunities and challenges encountered.MethodsA structured, centralised and curriculum-mapped OLP with supplementary workplace-based learning packs (LP) was instigated for paediatric trainees of all levels in our region since March 2020. Data was collected from online surveys, YouTube channel hits, GoToMeet platform and virtual focus groups.ResultsOpportunities: This was a trainee-led and centred programme adapted in response to trainee feedback. The generated synchronous and asynchronous materials were popular: as of January 2021, 231 sessions were streamed lasting 19,418 minutes and attended by 14,470 users. Furthermore, when surveyed, 552 respondents rated the live sessions 4.7/5 for educational value. Our priority was to offer online learning to preserve traineesâ€™ continued ability to meet curriculum competencies. The LPs were specifically designed with matched Progress Domain competencies. We surveyed learners covering 80% of training sites;62% accessing the LPs attested to their value in supplementing teaching and enhancing self-directed learning and 54% used them to facilitate local small group teaching and simulation. The centralisation of learning on the virtual platform enabled involvement of healthcare workers (HCW) from across the region, widening access to high-quality teaching and engagement in discussions on advancement in research and consensus of best practice. From March-September 2020, sessions were run by a multi-disciplinary and inter-speciality group of educators from 13 different NHS trusts.Barriers: Facilitating a psychologically safe learning environment is a major challenge as explicit strategies previously available are poorly translated to the online environment. Educatorâ€™s technical capability and the availability of technical support, although may seem trivial, can positively impact on an educatorâ€™s capacity to be virtually present, channelling their cognitive load towards high-quality facilitation of learning. Having open and honest discussions on sensitive and confidential matters such as safeguarding necessitates a non-judgemental, protected space. In these scenarios, limitation of the virtual environment is evident. Although some courses have thrived when converted to the digital platform, an online forum is not appropriate for all contents (eg Child Bereavement Course). Lastly, a notable barrier is the blurring of home and work environments. The added pressure to connect to online events and remain visible during a period trainees are overstretched physically, mentally and emotionally may increase HCW stress and risk burn out.ConclusionsA well-designed and inclusive virtual specialty training proved vital during the pandemic. Appropriate recognition and addressing of barriers to online learning would allow positive aspects to be continued into blended teaching programmes in the future.","Satar, Ain, Birley, Katherine, Abiramy, Fernando, Berg, Richard, Amutha, Anpananthar, Prince, Nick, Runnacles, Jane","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.729","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A419-A420, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A419-A420, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20375,""
"Paediatric emergency department attendances during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ patterns of conditions, demographics and ethnicities","BackgroundThe first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom began in March 2020 and resulted in the closure of schools and non-essential services as mandated by the government. During this period a notable reduction in the number of children attending the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) was witnessed. At this time information that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) patients were having worse outcomes from COVID-19 was becoming apparent. This raised questions about which groups of patients were not utilising the emergency services despite being acutely unwell and how we can better support these patients.ObjectivesThe primary objective was to identify the specialty-specific case mix of emergency paediatric presentations during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to the same time period in the preceding year. A secondary aim was to understand if COVID-19 had an impact on the proportion of BAME patients attending the PED.MethodsWe retrospectively collected data on PED attendances at a busy district general hospital in two time periods;March to May 2020, and March to May 2019. Information on patientsâ€™ age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis (categorised by specialty) and the outcome of their attendance were collected for all children aged 0â€“16 within each time period.Results5,153 patients attended the PED between March 2020 and May 2020, compared to 11,897 in the corresponding time period in 2019, representing a 56.7% reduction from one year to the next. The largest difference in presentations was seen in May 2020, with a 72% reduction in presentations. Gender and age distribution of children presenting remained consistent between 2020 and 2019, with the majority of children being within the 1â€“4-year age group. In the 2020 cohort, 38% of patients attending were from a BAME group compared to 45% in 2019. There was a reduction of more than 50% of children presenting with notifiable diseases, gastrointestinal, respiratory, otolaryngology, urological, renal, anaphylaxis/allergy and accidental (trauma, poisoning, foreign body and burns) presentations. The number of children presenting with mental health or safeguarding problems decreased by 39% in 2020 compared to 2019. Infant-specific presentations, along with haematology, oncology and endocrine presentations increased between 2019 and 2020.ConclusionsA significant decrease in PED presentations was seen during the first wave of the pandemic. This reduction was possibly caused by patient, parental and carer fears of attending hospitals at the height of the pandemic. Alternatively, it may have be caused by an increased ability of parents to manage certain conditions at home. Furthermore, the reduction in some presentations may have reflected a true reduction in infectious diseases due to social distancing measures. Similarly, the reduction in trauma and accidental injury may have reflected a true reduction due to stay at home rules. Future implications of this study are to further understand why the reduction in PED presentations was seen and if this trend was also present in further waves of the pandemic in the UK. Additionally, this work will help inform resource allocation during subsequent outbreaks.","Surtees, Cara, Okereafor, Akudo, Clements, Charlotte","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.701","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A403-A404, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A403-A404, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20376,""
"Winter 2020â€“21 in the paeds ED â€“ a public health revolution?","BackgroundThe Paediatric Emergency Department is typically under immense pressure during winter months but the winter of 2020â€“2021 has seemed very different. We sought to quantify this and to reflect on how local departments, regional healthcare systems and national guidance could adapt as a result.ObjectivesTo determine whether or not there was any significant difference in the overall number of patients attending our Paediatric Emergency Department in winter months during the COVIDâ€“19 pandemic compared to preceding years.To determine whether or not there was any significant difference in the spectrum of patients attending our Paediatric Emergency Department in winter months during the COVIDâ€“19 pandemic compared to preceding years.To reflect on how these findings should influence local, regional and national public health strategy moving forward.MethodsWe reviewed all attendances for patients under 18 years of age at our Paediatric Emergency Department for the months November, December, January and February and years 2018â€“2021 inclusive.We compared overall attendances for each year.We also compared proportions of patients attending with respiratory presentations, mental health, safeguarding, minor injuries or â€˜otherâ€™, using diagnostic coding.ResultsPaediatric ED attendances for December 2020, January 2021 and February 2021 were significantly lower than during preceding years.The proportion of patients attending the Paediatric ED with respiratory complaints were significantly lower in the 2020â€“2021 Winter compared with the preceding two years.The proportion of patients attending the Paediatric ED with mental health or safeguarding complaints were significantly higher in the 2020â€“2021 Winter compared with the preceding two years.ConclusionsAt a local level, these changes have required rapid redeployment of staff and services to areas of greater need and, in particular, have driven improvement to better rapid Child & Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) input.The significant reduction in respiratory illness should lead to careful consideration of some level of social distancing/infection control measures to remain in place in future years, with balanced consideration of the resulting impact on safeguarding and mental health.","Jenkinson, Emma, Evans, Ross, Belshaw, Ian","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.694","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A399-A400, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A399-A400, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20377,""
"Assessing the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had on childrenâ€™s mental health presentations to a tertiary childrenâ€™s emergency department","BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruption of children and young peopleâ€™s (CYP) lives. The lasting effects of the pandemic have not truly been assessed. We have seen a rise in severity of mental health presentations and a trend in a younger age group presenting to the emergency department (ED).ObjectivesTo describe the change in mental health presentations during each UK lockdown period.MethodsSingle centre retrospective chart review, in a tertiary childrenâ€™s hospital. All mental health presentations were included during each of the UK lockdown periods;First lockdown (23.03.2020 - 04.07.2020), Second lockdown (05.11.2020 - 02.12.2020) and Third lockdown (05.01.2021 - 08.03.2021). Data was taken from a previous comparative search of coding and clinical key words which identified all CYP presenting with a mental health issue.Electronic patient notes were used to gain data on coded diagnosis, sex, age and ethnicity. The same lockdown dates were used to compare these presentations to presentations in 2017, 2018 and 2019.ResultsThere has been a rise in mental health presentations during the second and third lockdown periods compared to to the last four years. Pre-Covid 2017 Pre-Covid 2018 Pre-Covid 2019 During Covid-19 First lockdown (1) 130 185 214 146 Second lockdown (2) 54 62 58 76 Third lockdown (3) 61 108 151 200 The most common coded diagnosis during Covid-19 was Depressive disorder (69, 16.3%), Anxiety (49, 11.6%), Paracetamol overdose (86, 20.3%) and Eating Disorder (33, 7.8%). There were also diagnoses seen that did not present in 2017 -2019 e.g. Suicidal thoughts (20, 4.7%) and mixed overdose (30, 7.1%).The common age group seen in all three Covid lockdown periods was 15 years (Lockdown 1â€“44%, Lockdown 2â€“34.2%, Lockdown 3â€“25%). There were more females affected (Lockdown 1â€“80.1%, Lockdown 2â€“81.5%, Lockdown 3â€“74.5%) and White British were affected more (Lockdown 1â€“80.1%, Lockdown 2â€“81.5%, Lockdown 3â€“74.5%).Throughout the last four years during the same three periods the similarity in age, sex and ethnicity has also been seen. The most common diagnoses seen during the last four years included paracetamol overdose and depressive disorder which have risen with each year:2019 (Paracetamol OD 20.1%, Depressive disorder 21%, eating disorder 6.1%, anxiety 15.6%)2018 (paracetamol OD 18.3%, depressive disorder 27%, eating disorder 2.8%, anxiety 10.7%)2017 (paracetamol OD 9.7%, depressive disorder 10.2%, eating disorder 2.4%, anxiety 4%)ConclusionsThe lower mental health presentations seen during the first lockdown compared to the last four years can be explained by the effect the start of the pandemic had in the UK population. The â€˜stay at homeâ€™ message may have provided valuable parental support to those CYP who would have otherwise presented during that period with a mental health issue. However, with the ongoing changes during the last year surrounding financial and educational uncertainty, the numbers have risen. Recent epidemiological models have predicted a spike in Covid-19 in July, this will impact the mental health numbers that emergency departments will see. Adequate provision should be put in place to support the CYP now and in the future.","Cuellar, Bianca, Henderson, Sally, Briggs, Emily","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.646","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A371-A372, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A371-A372, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20378,""
"Piloting a virtual â€˜safe spaceâ€™ for facilitated peer support discussion","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on the healthcare system and the professionals that work within it. It is increasingly recognised that peer support helps to strengthen resilience for professionals working within stressful systems, whether in healthcare or in other industries. Models such as Schwartz rounds and Balint groups focus on emotional responses to pre-determined themes or participant-suggested clinical cases in a facilitated, supportive group discussion setting away from the clinical area. Both methods have been shown to improve staff wellbeing whilst preventing the development of â€˜burnoutâ€™ in participants. However, the need for social distancing during the pandemic increased the difficulty of organising safe face-to-face group discussion at a time when peer support methods were arguably needed more than ever.ObjectivesTo pilot a facilitated peer support session in a virtual format and assess the acceptability of the format for trainees.MethodsA themed discussion entitled â€˜In This Bleak Midwinterâ€™ was incorporated into the January 2021 regional ST3 trainee study day, which was convened virtually via Zoom videoconferencing software. 21 ST3 trainees were split into three virtual breakout rooms, with at least one trainee per group given a short briefing beforehand and asked to prepare something to begin the discussion. One trainee was removed from the session due to camera issues, as the faculty felt video was crucial for maximising engagement with the session and maintaining the trust necessary to develop a â€˜safe spaceâ€™ for open discussion. Three members of a local chaplaincy team, trained in Schwartz and Balint methodology, facilitated group discussions which lasted for approximately 55 minutes. A scheduled break followed to allow trainees to reflect and recover before continuing with the rest of the dayâ€™s programme. Feedback was gathered via anonymous online survey.Results85% of trainees rated the session as â€˜excellentâ€™ on a five-point Likert scale, the most positive rating possible. 58% of respondents specifically mentioned the session in a free text question asking for â€˜three good things about the dayâ€™. Three trainees stated in a free text question asking â€˜how could the day be improved?â€™ that they would like facilitated peer support sessions to be scheduled during every monthly teaching programme. One trainee subsequently sought professional help for their mental health and directly cited the session as the driver to do so.ConclusionsThe considerable positive feedback suggests that facilitated peer support sessions can be successful when held in a virtual format. Data on lasting effects were not gathered and future research could try to ascertain whether the positive reactions produced medium-term and long-term benefits, similar to face-to-face sessions. Future research could also examine the effect of cameras on engagement, as this seemed the main barrier to participation and engagement in our pilot session.","Monaghan, Sean, Bryson, Elizabeth, Phillips, Andrew, Nash, Paul","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.629","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A361-A362, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A361-A362, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20379,""
"Unprecedented times â€“ unseen effects on child mental health","BackgroundThe unprecedented times of the Covid-19 pandemic have presented a plethora of new challenges for both users and providers of healthcare. A now well-recognised effect of the pandemic is the devastating impact it is having on the mental health of young people. There have been a notable increase in the number of mental health cases presenting to Paediatric Emergency Departments, and this is a problem predicted to persist for the foreseeable future. Caring for these young people in both Emergency Departments and on General Paediatric wards is a challenge.To ensure that healthcare professionals are well-equipped to care for these young people and their families, it is vital that the multidisciplinary team (MDT) receive relevant training, and feel well-supported themselves. The introduction of in-situ simulations with focus on Child and Adolescent Mental Health, has highlighted effective methods for the management of challenging cases. The collaboration with airline pilots in facilitation of the Human Factors debriefs has contributed to creating an open environment for safe learning.ObjectivesTo encourage training focused on child mental health through in-situ simulation during the time of the pandemic.To focus on Human Factors training through involvement of airline pilots.To encourage MDT contribution through creating a â€˜safe learning spaceâ€™ for participants.MethodsThis was a qualitative study. High fidelity in-situ simulations were performed in real clinical environments, with primed actors. Clinical faculty focused on the technical aspects, whilst uniformed airline pilots provided feedback on Human Factors. To encourage participation from all team members, there was significant emphasis on psychological safety throughout. The key learning points were written up and shared with the wider MDT.Scenario examples:Ligature â€“ management of patient collapsed in the toilet with ligature tied around their neck, with a distressed parent present.De-escalation â€“ patient with an overdose threatening to leave the ward prior to Mental Health assessment.Acute psychosisâ€“ de-escalation of agitated patient, necessitating an MDT approach, including the involvement of security.ResultsThe simulations encouraged closer analysis of the technical aspects of managing acute presentations of young people with psychiatric presentations. Moreover, they provided a safe training space for staff to reflect on the difficulties faced, with facilitation from airline pilots, and parallel aviation examples. Key Human Factors themes were identified by the pilots, with particular focus on workload management, when dealing with a distressed patient and also an anxious relative. The feedback from these sessions was unanimously positive, with 100% of participants reporting they would like to participate in more.ConclusionsThe creation of a safe learning environment for the management of challenging mental health presentations has been extremely valuable in the training of the MDT. Continued learning in this way is of particular prominence at this time, in light of the increase in presentations as a result of the pressures of the pandemic. It is important for the training needs of staff to be met, and for them feel safe and well-supported at this challenging time.","Mumtaz, Sophia Mooncey, Jolly, Alexander, Robinson, Kerry, Fisher, Megan, Lloyd, Robert, Fielding, Dave","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.624","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A358-A359, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A358-A359, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20380,""
"Evaluation of availability of specialist psychological services for paediatric cystic fibrosis patients in district general hospitals and tertiary centres","BackgroundCystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic disorder. Given the chronic, progressive and disabling nature of CF, it is well recognised that living with CF can have an emotional and psychological impact. A significant number of CF patients report experiencing stress, anxiety, low mood and difficulties in managing their treatments. The morbidity and mortality factors pose cognitive, emotional and behavioural challenges for many children with CF and their families. NICE (National Institute of Clinical excellence) guidelines recommends that the specialist cystic fibrosis multidisciplinary team should include Specialist Clinical Psychologist (SCP) who have specialist expertise in managing psychosocial problems in children and young people with CF.ObjectivesWe conducted an online national survey across England to evaluate the services available for psychological assessment of CF patients in District General Hospitals and Tertiary Paediatric Respiratory Centres.MethodsWe contacted paediatric tertiary centres (n=21) and District General Hospitals (n=33) CF specialist teams across England. A questionnaire exploring current psychologist services was emailed to them.Results5/21 tertiary hospitals and 14/33 DGH participated in this survey. Of the 19 (n) responses, 5 (26%) were tertiary hospitals and 14 (74%) were DGH.All respondents from the tertiary hospitals revealed they had availability of Specialist Clinical Psychologist (SCP) who participated in all CF meetings including MDT (Multi-Disciplinary) and Annual Reviews.3/14 DGH (21%) had availability of SCP locally who saw patients in CF Annual reviews and MDT meetings.In another 3/14 DGH (21%), CF patients had no access to SCP either locally nor in tertiary hospitals. These patients were referred to CAMHS locally for psychological concerns or a Diabetes Psychologist if patient had Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD).In the remaining 8/14 DGH (58%), CF patients had no access to SCP locally but out of these, SCP from tertiary hospitals visited CF clinics in 2 DGH. CF patients from the remaining 6 DGH visited tertiary hospitals to access psychology services.ConclusionsFrom the analysis of the results from the online survey, we concluded that very few DGH have local SCP services. Where SCP services are not available, patients have to rely on tertiary hospitals or local CAMHS services. It is known that patients with long term physical health problems are likely to have mental health problems. NHS England highlights that prevention of mental health problems is the most cost-effective service that can be provided. Hence, it is recommended that all children and young people with CF should have access to psychological services so that they benefit from early psychological intervention and improved health outcomes through improvement in wellbeing. Our survey indicates that there is an unmet need to develop psychological services within DGH. A major limitation of this survey is the low response rate which we attribute to the work and capacity pressures from COVID-19.","Wajid, Lubna, Prasad, Archana","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.608","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A349-A350, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A349-A350, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20381,""
"Changing patterns in paediatric attendances during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundThe WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Irish schools closed on 12 March and a nationwide stay-at-home order was issued on 27 March. A 34â€“76% decrease in paediatric ED presentations has been reported during the pandemic.ObjectivesThis study aims to assess the impact of the pandemic on attendances and admissions to a regional paediatric unit.MethodsA single-centre retrospective review of presentations to the paediatric assessment unit (PAU) and admissions to the paediatric ward from April-July 2019 and 2020 was performed. Data was obtained from the PAU attendance diary and HIPE reporting database. Unscheduled PAU attendances included GP/self-referrals with medical or surgical complaints, excluding injuries. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics.ResultsThere was a 40% decrease in unscheduled PAU presentations in April-July 2020 (n=747) compared with 2019 (n=1244). The most common presenting complaints in 2020 were gastrointestinal symptoms (33.2%), rashes (12.2%), unwell child &lt;1 year including pyrexia (7.4%) and respiratory symptoms (7%).There was a 67.2% decrease in admissions in April-July 2020 (n=170) compared with 2019 (n=519). Discharge diagnoses were categorised for admitted patients in May-July 2019 and 2020. There was a reduction in most categories in 2020 including dermatological (-80.7%), respiratory (-80%), cardiovascular (-75%), neurological (-62.2%), gastrointestinal (-61.3%), surgical (-60%), musculoskeletal (-57.1%), injury & poisoning (-45.2%) and mental health/safeguarding (-33.3%) cases. There was an 11.1% increase in genitourinary cases in 2020.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a drastic decrease in paediatric clinical activity. Not surprisingly, we have seen a reduction in presentations relating to viral transmission (wheeze, gastroenteritis, rashes) and school-related stress (headaches, abdominal pain). Despite the anticipated negative effects of the pandemic on mental health, psychiatric admissions did not increase. The number of surgical cases, comprised largely of acute appendicitis, was 60% lower during the pandemic, supporting the possibility of a viral trigger. Other factors which may have influenced presentations include greater parental supervision at home, fear of contracting or spreading COVID-19, reduced outdoor/sporting activities and reduced vehicular pollution.Whilst SARS-CoV-2 infections in children have been relatively mild, the pandemic has had a profound impact on paediatric services. Reflecting on these shifts may provide insight into the aetiology of paediatric diseases, the factors influencing a parentâ€™s decision to present to hospital, the factors influencing a clinicianâ€™s decision to admit patients and the effect of the pandemic on the health of children in general.","Sarah, Oâ€™Loughlin, Sharaf, Suzan, van der Spek, Nick","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.600","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A345, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A345, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20382,""
"Using a patient reported experience measure (PREM) to assess the experience of carers in paediatric intensive care during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundIn April 2020, in response to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, NHS England recommended limiting visiting to hospital inpatients, with resultant changes to our hospital policy of open visiting limiting visits to a single carer. In addition, changes to the way healthcare professionals interacted with carers had to be implemented, such as remote meetings, use of personal and protective equipment and social distancing.ObjectivesOur objective was to understand the impact of these changes on carers of children requiring intensive care during the Pandemic.MethodsA patient reported experience measure (PREM) focusing on experiences of attending the hospital and the impact of the necessary changes was developed by clinicians, family liaison nurses and the PREM team at our institution. The PREM was distributed to carers whose child was either a planned or emergency admission to the Paediatric, Neonatal or Cardiac intensive care units between December 2020 and March 2021. Quantitative and thematic analysis of responses was undertaken.ResultsTo date, 80 PREMs have been given to carers and 67 completed questionnaires have been received (76% response rate). Overall levels of satisfaction were very high, with 94% reporting that they were very or mostly satisfied with the intensive care team and the service they provided. Nearly two-thirds of the carers were concerned about catching COVID whilst on the intensive care unit but this decreased to 43% for other public areas of the hospital, such as the cafeteria.All carers understood the need for them to wear a mask but only 65% agreed that staff were able to interpret and respond appropriately to their emotions when they were wearing one. One third of respondents reported that they did not get the emotional support they needed from family or friends. Some carers found the restricted visiting policy challenging, with 24% reporting that it was not acceptable that the sole carer permitted at the bedside could not change as needed. This was supported by the qualitative comments, which indicated that whilst parents understood the rationale for the one carer policy, it caused additional distress.Loneliness and lack of physical contact were identified by parents as particularly stressful, together with the need to cope alone with complex information. Carers described being â€˜fully aloneâ€™ without their partners, which affected the mental health of both parents and resulted in feelings of despair and confusion.ConclusionsOur intensive care is one of the largest paediatric units in the UK and during the pandemic we increased our capacity to accommodate intensive care patients from other paediatric units that reconfigured to treat adult patients. During the pandemic, our usual approach to carer support was challenged by visiting and communication restrictions, the impact of which may have long-term consequences. Despite these challenges, we were able to sensitively provide the high standards of care expected by patients and their families.","Ndokera, Rufaro, Pierce, Christine, Wray, Jo, Oldham, Geralyn","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.595","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A342-A343, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A342-A343, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20383,""
"Opening up in lockdown: mapping child & adolescent mental health crises in paediatric a&e during Covid-19","BackgroundDuring the Sars-CoV2 pandemic, emergency care settings have continued to act as key contact points between healthcare professionals and young people experiencing acute mental health crises. Despite growing concerns that the psychosocial health and wellbeing of young people across the United Kingdom have been adversely affected by increasing social isolation, uncertainty and emotional trauma during successive national lockdowns, we are only now beginning to appreciate the impact of this phenomenon.1Objectives1. Determine whether lockdown correlated with any significant difference in the number or nature of Child & Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) referrals in the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED).2. Identify any health inequalities affecting young people referred to CAMHS during lockdown.MethodsWe audited every patient aged 0â€“17yrs who attended PED at Kingâ€™s College Hospital during all three national lockdowns in England (n=5072) in 2020â€“2021, gathering data on age, gender, time of presentation, ethnicity, borough, source of referral, pre-existing safeguarding alerts, diagnosis, discharge destination, safeguarding outcomes for all CAMHS referrals (n=115). We compared this to corresponding data from all patient attendances (n=13,451) and CAMHS referrals (n=106) during the same time periods in 2019. Patient demographics were compared to national secondary school 2019 census data from the Department of Education2.ResultsThe proportion of CAMHS referrals among &lt;18yr-olds in PED during each lockdown was significantly greater than during 2019 (Chi squared L1=5.1x10-4;L2=2.3x10-4;L3=1.7x10-4), representing an almost 3-fold increase overall. Fewer than one in five of these children triggered pre-existing safeguarding alerts at triage.The second lockdown coincided with the greatest proportion of CAMHS referrals (&lt;18yr-olds 3.1%;&lt;13yr-olds n=7 and 13â€“17yrs n=49), representing a significant increase compared to the first lockdown (p=1.4x105). There was no significant difference between the second and third lockdowns.Up to one third of 13â€“17yr-olds referred to CAMHS were unaccompanied during the third lockdown, coinciding with the highest proportion of admissions and transfers in this age group (n=12;36%).Consistently, the most common indication for CAMHS referral among &lt;13yr-olds was depression and/or anxiety, while among 13â€“17yr-olds it was intentional overdose (IOD) or deliberate self-harm (DSH). While an upward trend in the number of 13â€“17yr-olds presenting with DSH and IOD was observed between the first and second lockdowns, our current sample size is insufficient to establish statistical significance.While the majority of CAMHS referrals among 13â€“17yr-olds across all three lockdowns were from ethnic minority groups (L1 74%;L2 76%;L3 56%), this was consistent with the general paediatric population in Southwark & Lambeth. However, our sample size was insufficient to establish significant differences between individual ethnic groups. The majority of 13â€“17yr-olds referred to CAMHS were female (L1 63%;L2 85%;L3 87%) across all three lockdowns.ConclusionsOur findings suggest there was a significantly higher proportion of acute mental health presentations in PED during lockdown, especially amongst 13â€“17yr olds, and an upward trend in DSH and IOD. This has significant implications for the future provision of child and adolescent mental health services in hospitals and the community and the ramifications of this phenomenon post-lockdown have yet to be seen.","Temple, Jonathan, Das, Sreena, Lalarukh, Asim","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.582","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A334-A335, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A334-A335, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20384,""
"Staff wellbeing and team morale during the Covid-19 pandemic at Birmingham childrenâ€™s hospital","BackgroundCovid-19 has significantly impacted the nations day-to-day life and inevitably affected the workplace too. The NHS has been under visible unprecedented stress and consequently staff have carried the burden. The general paediatricians at Birmingham Childrenâ€™s Hospital wanted to understand how the medical staff felt they could be supported during this difficult timeObjectivesTo assess the wellbeing and team morale amongst medical staff within the General Paediatrics team at Birmingham Childrenâ€™s Hospital (BCH) during the Covid-19 pandemic and implement a new method to improve wellbeing and team morale.MethodsA questionnaire was created and distributed to the medical staff working within the General Paediatrics team at BCH. Questions were formulated following research relating to existing staff wellbeing questionnaires and current literature regarding the effects of Covid-19 on mental health, wellbeing and team morale.ResultsTwenty-two staff members completed the questionnaire which represented their experience over the last month. Fifteen (68.2%) looked forward to going to work and nineteen reported feeling â€˜happy, smiling and laughing at workâ€™ when asked. However, 27.3% only felt appreciated at work a few times a month or less and 31.7% stated that their good work was acknowledged less than a few times a month. Twelve felt that they needed someone to talk to at work and four felt unable to confide in a colleague at least a few times a month. 50% felt then needed some time alone during a break at work. 81.8% admitted that Covid-19 had affected their mental health or wellbeing, 50% felt socially isolated as a result of Covid-19 and 95.5% felt worried about their health of the health of family/friends as a result of Covid-19. Seventeen staff members felt that Covid-19 had affected team morale and eighteen felt that knowing their colleagues better would improve team morale and make them more likely to confide in them if needed.ConclusionsThis evaluation highlights that the majority of staff at BCH felt Covid-19 had affected their mental health, wellbeing and the General Paediatric team morale. It stressed the importance building colleague relationships to support each other during this worrisome time. A â€˜Letâ€™s Strike Up a Conversationâ€™ matchbox activity was created in response to the findings to initiate non-covid and work-related conversation during work breaks. The matchbox had conversation starting â€˜Match cardsâ€™ within to stimulate and improve team communications and encourage staff to get to know each other. The effects of this intervention are to be evaluated in due course. The assessment of staff wellbeing and team morale has highlighted the importance of actively surveying the team during new and unexpected changes/circumstances. Early recognition facilitates early response and adjustments to boost team morale and wellbeing.","Lee, Natasha","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.543","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A312, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A312, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20385,""
"Safeguarding during COVID 2020 lockdown â€“ a local perspective","BackgroundDuring the first COVID-19 UK lockdown, there was concern that vulnerable children and young people (CYP) were less visible to support services and healthcare professionals due to reduced societal safety nets, increased alcohol sales and domestic violence. This resulted in a widespread reduction in safeguarding referrals but an increased proportion of serious incidents. Nationally safeguarding referrals fell by a fifth but serious safeguarding incidents increased by 27%.ObjectivesA local, district general hospital, perspective on the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on;numbers of safeguarding referrals in the Emergency Department (ED);proportion of mental health and eating disorders;referrals related to substance abuse and domestic violence (DV) and severity of safeguarding presentations.MethodsA qualitative retrospective cohort analysis was undertaken reviewing electronic records of all cases referred to the ED psychosocial meeting with safeguarding concerns for CYP during the first lockdown until children returned to school (23/3/2020 â€“ 6/9/2020). Comparison was made with cases referred during the same period in 2019. Following an initial feasibility study of 50 cases from each dataset, 1 in 5 patients were randomly selected and analysed until data saturation was achieved. In total, 200 cases were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, date and mode of presentation, presenting complaint, the outcome of the attendance and referrals made.ResultsThere was an 18% reduction in numbers of referrals from 384 in 2019 to 314 in 2020. Although there was no increase in the rate of presentations due to mental health crises or eating disorders, there was an observed rise in paediatric suicide attempts. Amongst CYP, there were similar numbers of referrals for substance abuse but there was an increase in the number of parents referred for substance abuse during lockdown. Additionally, DV related referrals halved during the lockdown.Although there was a reduction in referrals for suspected child abuse, there were increased presentations with physical abuse and an absence of reports of neglect, emotional and sexual abuse. Of the physically abused, the COVID lockdown group were younger at presentation with a median age of 10 months (IQR 11 days â€“ 4 years) compared to 4 years old (IQR 1 â€“ 11 years). Safeguarding presentations were more severe during lockdown including significant fractures and traumatic head injury. Of the cohort reviewed, 3 of 11 children were removed from their primary carer during lockdown compared with 2 of 16 in 2019.ConclusionsOur data mirrors the safeguarding data nationally, with reduced referrals but an increase in severity. There has been a rise in the rate of substance misuse in adults and a higher rate of referrals for physical abuse with children being removed from their parent or carer. These vulnerable children need to be seen and it is the responsibility of all those working in the childrenâ€™s sector to be proactive and seek out those missing.","Leith, Elizabeth, Chawatama, Tsitsi","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.533","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A306, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A306, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20386,""
"Mental health presentations to a paediatric emergency department during a global pandemic","BackgroundRecent anecdotal reports suggests that more and more children are experiencing poor mental health as a result of multiple factors relating to the ongoing pandemic and subsequent school closures. We aimed to describe this change within mental health presentations at our own Paediatric Emergency Department. The department is located at a large childrenâ€™s hospital where, in 2019, we saw nearly 60,000 patients. Since March 2020 and the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, we have seen less than half that number.ObjectivesTo understand the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and school closures on the mental health of the population attending a paediatric emergency department.MethodsAll patients under 16 who attended the emergency department with a mental health problem between 01/02/2019 and 31/01/2021 were identified. The number of presentations and admissions were analysed, as well as the index of multiple deprivation based on the patientâ€™s postcode.ResultsOver the 24 month period we had 1431 mental health related attendances with a median age of 14 years. When looking at attendances by month, the mean number of presentations was 53.6 and the median, 61.5. Based on this data, we found that there has not been a significant increase or decrease in the number of attendances over the period studied, with the month with the most attendances being January 2020. It must be remembered that there has been a significant reduction in ED attendances overall and so the proportion of our patient population suffering from a mental health problem has increased.The mean number of admissions over this time was 28.8 and the median 28.5. There has been an increase in admissions however this seems to have been a steady increase over the 24 months rather than a sudden upsurge during the pandemic, but again, this will equate to an increase in the proportion of admissions that are related to a mental health problem. Specific conditions, such as eating disorders, did show a large increase in numbers during the pandemic.The vast majority of these patients are in the lowest decile, the 1st, on the index of multiple deprivation. Rather than a gradual reduction in mental health problems as socioeconomic circumstances improve, there is a fairly consistent picture over the 3rd to 10th deciles, with a slightly higher incidence in the 2nd.ConclusionsAbsolute numbers of presentations to an emergency department with mental health problems, and onward admissions into the hospital, have not increased significantly during the pandemic but the proportion of patients we see with mental health problems has. The majority of presentations are from sections of the population with the most challenging socioeconomic circumstances.Our next step is to understand if the presentations we have seen have been more severe during the pandemic. Understanding the long term effects and identifying risk and resilience factors are vital for future planning of services and making these more accessible.","Stewart, Helen, Sabir, Lisa, Ramlakhan, Shammi, Yarlett, Frances","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.528","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A303, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A303, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20387,""
"Speak up for youth","Backgroundâ€˜If this is a space for young people then it should be created by young people.â€™ This quote was from our virtual focus group with adolescent service users in our journey to co-create a waiting area for Young People (YP) in the community. The rise in mental health problems in YP, has been amplified by the COVID-19 Pandemic [1]. Community services must become emotionally aware, through minimising anxiety for YP within assessment and treatments pathways to optimise engagement. The 2019 â€˜State of Child health & Usâ€™ report states the importance of youth friendly services and clinical environment as key for improving engagement and long-term health outcomes [2]. Specific feedback from YP included being with people of a similar age and having a one-stop shop approach to YP health needs [3].ObjectivesEvaluate the YPâ€™s experience of the Centre for Child Health with a real-time survey at the point of access.Collaborate with YP who use our service in an online focus group to co-create their vision of a YPâ€™s waiting area.Seek funding to co-produce a comfortable, relaxing and educational waiting area based on YPâ€™s feedback, decreasing anxiety and improving engagement with the service and hence their long-term health outcomes.MethodsA 10 question online survey asking YPâ€™s Likert scaling of their opinions and feelings regarding the waiting room, health promotion materials and understanding of and engagement with their health conditions. Including qualitative descriptions of the waiting area and ideas for improvement.ResultsSURVEY: 10 responses collected from users aged 11â€“18 (03/11/2020 â€“ 15/12/2020). Almost half of respondents found the waiting area â€˜boringâ€™ and â€˜baby focusedâ€™, causing them to feel sad before their appointment. Only 1 in 3 respondents reported they understood their health. 50% were not satisfied with the health information provided â€“ over half preferring electronic format, recommending introducing a tablet in a separate YPâ€™s area.VIRTUAL FOCUS GROUP: (02/12/20) 8 service users participated. They shared feelings of anxiety due to â€˜long waitsâ€™ amongst others. They suggested improvements such as, â€˜less hospitallyâ€™/â€˜warmerâ€™ colours, circular â€˜inclusiveâ€™ seating and a range of activities. Other suggestions included YP inspired artwork and an accessible library of short â€˜Tik-Tokâ€™ style videos to deliver health promotion and appointment information.ConclusionsWe successfully collaborated with YP virtually, to co-create a vision of a youth friendly waiting area at the childrenâ€™s centre. We have put in a funding application to make their vision a reality. We will: provide tablets loaded with short videos of appointment overviews and health promotion resources;create a warmer colour scheme and relaxed seating area for a welcoming environment. We will co-create virtual art-work with local YP for display. We will collate ongoing feedback on our changes from the YP using established methods. We will monitor attendance figures as a proxy for engagement with services and ultimately improve our patientsâ€™ experience.","Srithar, Karusan, Britto, Patrick, Battersby, Anna, Robinson, Polly, Gribbon, Caroline","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.509","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A292-A293, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A292-A293, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20388,""
"Paediatric mental health presentations prior to, and during, the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic impact on the mental health of the population has been widely reported and paediatric mental health has not been spared (1). Assessing the impact of this on acute paediatric services is important to ensure our facilities and services can meet the needs of these young people going forward.ObjectivesThis retrospective study looked at changes in number, type and acuity of patients presenting with suicidal ideation and self-harm to a single district general hospital before and during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The potential impact of related national events, such as lockdowns and school closures, on these admissions was considered.MethodsInformation was collected on all patients aged &lt;18 years who required involvement of our local CAMHS service during their hospital admission over a 26 month period, 13 months â€˜pre-COVIDâ€™ (January 2019-January 2020) and 13 months â€˜post-COVIDâ€™ (February 2020-February 2021). Data recorded included: age, length of stay, presenting complaint, interventions required, need for registered mental health nurse (RMN) support during admission and discharge location.ResultsThe total number of mental health admissions remained static during the time period (average â€˜pre-COVIDâ€™ admissions 13.9 young people/month and â€˜post-COVIDâ€™ 14/month) with no change in the patient average age (mean 14.5 vs 15 years).Despite a rising trend, there was no significant increase in the rates of young people acting upon their suicidal ideations (73% pre vs 80% post, p value 0.14) or the proportion requiring active medical treatment (most commonly N-acetylcysteine) following significant overdoses (12% vs 17.5%, p value 0.18).However, young people presenting during the pandemic were significantly more likely to require RMN support whilst an inpatient (117% increase in demand, p=0.001) and subsequently be discharged to somewhere other than their home address (p value 0.01) - either a tier 4 psychiatric bed (2.2% â€˜pre-COVIDâ€™ vs 6.6% post) or a social care placement (2.2% vs 5.5%).Patient numbers requiring detention under a Mental Health Act section or chemical sedation remained low throughout (all &lt;1% in both periods).ConclusionsYoung people with mental health concerns have placed a significant demand on acute paediatric services for many years, and not just over the last 12 months of unprecedented additional societal challenges. The increased needs of cases during the pandemic, however, are putting excessive pressure on already scarce resources.Evidencing the increase in acuity of mental health presentations during the COVID-19 pandemic is important for both forward planning of acute care services and to ensure appropriate ongoing community mental health support to this vulnerable patient group, particularly as the long-lasting health impacts remain to be determined.ReferenceVizard T, Sadler K, Ford T, Newlove-Delgado T, et al.

"Psychosocial wellbeing concerns raised for children and young people seen in a busy district general emergency department during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus has had minimal direct impact on the physical health of children and young people (CYP). However, it has had much greater implications on their psychosocial wellbeing in terms of disruption to schooling and its inherent structuring of their lives as well as to the wider adult society. This work describes the impact we have seen in our busy London Emergency Department (ED) in terms of safeguarding concerns raised for under 18â€™s since the start of the pandemic.ObjectivesTo highlight the number and types of safeguarding concerns raised by staff working in our ED to better inform education around identifying those in need and knowing how to signpost them to sources of support.MethodsOur Paediatric ED hosts a weekly multidisciplinary meeting to discuss all attendances of CYP under 18 where a safeguarding referral was made to Childrenâ€™s Social Care or where concerns were raised about the presentation by our Paediatric and Maternity Liaison Service (PMLS) who screen all ED notes. We have undertaken a retrospective review of the minutes of each meeting since the beginning of March 2020.ResultsThere was a marked decrease in ED attendances of under 18s from March 2020 â€“ February 2021 (11,836) compared with the same period the previous year (21,864). Despite this a total of 817 cases (approx. 7% of attendances) were discussed in the 52 meetings since the pandemic started in March 2020.An alert on the Child Protection â€“ Information Sharing (CP-IS) was present for 21.5% of cases discussed.Number of cases discussed per month:March 2020 68 April 2020 28 May 2020 59 June 2020 64 July 2020 59 August 2020 83 September 2020 84 October 2020 62 November 2020 94 December 2020 91 January 2021 69 February 2021 56 The relatively few cases discussed in April mirrors the huge reduction in non-coronavirus-related presentations we saw across both the Adult and Paediatric ED that month.Number of cases discussed per age group:&lt;5yo 164 5â€“9yo 55 10â€“14yo 204 15/16/17yo 394 Nearly half of all cases discussed (394) involved young people aged 15, 16 or 17 years old, for which their mental health was the commonest reason for a concern being raised (64% of cases). Almost 1 in 5 cases related to a concern about youth violence and its inherent risks. In 11% of these cases there was a concern about alcohol use and 12% of cases raised a concern of substance misuse (most commonly cannabis â€“ both in smoked and edible forms).ConclusionsDespite a marked overall reduction in ED attendances we have continued to see a significant number of concerning presentations, particularly in those aged 15â€“17yo. This highlights the important of staff working in ED understanding the concept of contextual safeguarding in order to identify those young people at risk of harm, whilst also feeling confident in communicating with this age group in order to best support them and signpost/refer them to relevant support agencies.","Fraser, Lauren, Khan, Nabeela, Kothari, Varun, Sarya, Elnour, Ojaruwedia, Matthew, Rathore, Subhan","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.474","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A273, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A273, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20390,""
"Addressing stress in the paediatric workplace through focus groups","BackgroundStress in the workplace is an increasingly visible phenomenon affecting physicians across specialties. Paediatrics has seen markedly elevated burnout together with falling application rates and rising trainee dropout rates. This mix is disastrous for morale and staffing which, in turn, perpetuates the problem. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic with resultant redeployment of paediatric staff to adult departments has served only to exacerbate pre-existing workplace stress.Existing structures such as Balint Groups or Schwartz Rounds have a place within departments, exploring cases or emotional response to working within the clinical environment. We aimed to provide a space to allow paediatric doctors to freely explore their workplace experiences, clinical and emotional, in a safe, confidential environment with peers facilitated by a clinical psychologist.ObjectivesTo provide a safe and confidential environment for paediatric clinicians of all grades to explore their workplace experiences in the company of their peers and with the guidance of a clinical psychologist as facilitator.To use these sessions identify stressors in the workplace and explore coping mechanisms.MethodsInvitations to attend small focus groups of no more than 9 people were sent to clinicians of all grades working in general paediatrics, neonates, paediatric hepatology and paediatric emergency medicine at our hospital. These groups were given protected time and were facilitated by a clinical psychologist.Each group was subdivided into groups of 3 doctors. Every person was asked to share stories of times they felt stressed at work and to separate their thoughts according to these questions:What is your experience of stress and burnout at work?How did it leave you feeling at the time or on reflection?What did you do to attempt to cope with how you were feeling at the time?What would be needed to support you: organisational factors, personal factors, increased support?Tell us about what you have found helpful and what would be needed in an ideal world?In each subgroup there were 3 roles;storyteller, listener, and an observer who would take notes on the interaction. These would rotate every 10 minutes.Once everyone had related their stories the group would reconvene to discuss and collate themes in a section facilitated by a psychologist. Avenues of communication were available post-session via email and a survey to get in touch with the faculty regarding any outstanding issues. All information gathered was confidential.ResultsThemes collected centred on persistent low morale, feelings of helplessness, uselessness and dread. All tallied well with issues we know affect existing and putative paediatric trainees.ConclusionsResults indicate that attendees found the forum a useful and open place to share their experiences, and that that this would be valuable as a regular event in the paediatric calendar, particularly with the additional stress placed on clinicians with redeployment. As such, we hope to present a replicable session template which can be adopted by other departments and hospitals. Through increased adoption and feedback the template could be improved to best fit those making use of the sessions.","Greenbury, Charles, Day, Jemma, Baker, Alastair","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.422","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A242-A243, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A242-A243, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20391,""
"Improving psychosocial care of young people in ED post COVID-19","BackgroundAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the care of 16 and 17 year old patients in the Emergency Department (ED) at St Thomasâ€™ Hospital was moved from adult ED to the adjacent paediatric ED in order to reduce the pressure on the adult department. Paediatric emergency clinical staff work with an embedded safeguarding team, hold a weekly psychosocial review meeting and so comprehensive adolescent assessment may be improved in paediatric ED.ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to compare the psychosocial care of 16 and 17 year old patients in the adult and paediatric emergency departments.MethodsSettingThe Emergency Department at Guys and St Thomasâ€™ NHS Foundation Trust is a large (&gt;140,000 attendances/annum) inner city department. The adult and childrenâ€™s (part of Evelina London Childrenâ€™s Hospital) departments are physically adjacent. There is separate Paediatric Emergency Medicine staffing.MethodsAttendances of 16 and 17 year old patients were retrospectively observed. ED notes from 100 random patients from both September 2019 and September 2020 were reviewed.September 2019 was before the COVID-19 pandemic, and September 2020 after the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK. In September 2020 the majority of schools were open and despite no national lockdown there were still significant restraints on socialising/recreational activity in London.Expected standard of care was that a HEADSS (psychosocial history) assessment was completed for each attendance.Presenting complaint, completion of HEADSS questionnaires and need for referral to psychosocial services were assessed. Quality of HEADSS questionnaire was also scored using a grading system agreed amongst the team.ResultsPrimary mental health presentations had increased from 3% of total presentations in 2019 to 6% in 2020. Alcohol/recreational drug presentations increased from 1% to 4%.HEADSS questionnaire completion increased from 20% to 53% between 2019 & 2020. Comprehensive completion increased from 7% to 40%.Subsequent referral to psychosocial services (CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service), social care or liaison youth worker service)) increased from 8% to 18% of all 16 and 17 year old presentations between the two periods.Individual case reviews during the observed period showed that comprehensive completion of HEADSS questionnaires identified psychosocial issues which would not have been identifiable from presenting complaint or basic history alone.ConclusionsThe departmental change brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic enabled a comparison between the care of 16 and 17 year old patients in adult ED and paediatric ED and how this might impact their psychosocial care.In paediatric ED young people of 16 and 17 years old had a higher completion of comprehensive HEADSS questionnaires, there had been an increase in referrals to psychosocial services and we have seen evidence of psychosocial issues being identified and managed in paediatric ED when HEADSS questionnaires have been completed.With an increase in mental health and drugs/alcohol presentations, a comprehensive psychosocial assessment is vital to ensure safeguarding and social needs are met.","Alden, Frederick, Criddle, John, Eason, Michael, Wells, Alexander","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.416","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A239, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A239, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20392,""
"Bringing our HEEADSSS together - prioritising the voices of children and young people","Collaborators: Leah Simpson, Margaret Williams, Chloe Batchford, Alexandra Davison, Pamela Dawson, Ashley Holt, Shaheen Ghumra, Anandi Singh, Kiran Raju, Marwa Alkotamy, Mohammed Haque, Luke Hailston, Alice Packham, Rachel Oâ€™Sullivan, Laura Kelly, Lauren Brace, Jayne Thompson, Alec Rapson, Samuel Danaher, Samuel Jack, Teim Eyo, Kirsten Brown, Mica Skilton, Moataz Badawy, Ahmed Abdella, Joshua Meremikwu, Mofoluwake Faturoti, Mushfiq Sahebzada, Priscilla Wong, Alexis Perry, Thomas Baird, Marianne Yousif, Lesley Peers, Helen McDermott, Stuart HartshornChildren and young people (CYP) are increasingly attending acute paediatric services due to mental health difficulties. 50% of all mental health problems are established by 14 years of age and 75% by 24 years. Underinvestment in mental health has been a longstanding concern, amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic through extra stress caused by prolonged school closures, social isolation and a lack of access to usual support services.In 2020, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health highlighted that suicide is now the leading cause of death in England and Wales for children aged 5â€“19 years, emphasising the need to prioritise and improve mental health. Paediatricians must develop the knowledge and skills to identify, support and make appropriate referrals for common mental health problems. HEEADSSS is a well-known psychosocial screening tool with eight domains, used to identify potential or actual harm.ObjectivesEstablish whether CYP within the West Midlands, UK are receiving adequate psychosocial assessments on hospital admission and whether healthcare professionals are signposting to relevant services.The primary outcome was the percentage of CYP with documented evidence of being offered a HEEADSSS assessment.MethodsA regional prospective audit across nine hospitals was performed for three days per week from 4st -31st January 2021. A standardised proforma was used to gather information from medical records of all CYP aged &gt;12 years admitted to paediatric wards. Pooled data were analysed using Microsoft Excel.Results231 patients were included. The median age was 14 years old (range 12â€“17 years). 163(71%) were female. 202(87%) had no known communication difficulties. 53(23%) were known to CAMHS and 43(19%) to social care. 78/231(34%) were admitted with mental health as the presenting complaint.35/231(15%) were documented to be given the opportunity to be spoken to alone;29(82%) accepted.No department had a psychosocial screening tool embedded in the admission document.158/231(69%) had less than half of the eight domains completed. The median was 1.5 (range 0â€“8). Home and education/employment were most frequently asked (37â€“42%). Eating/exercise, drugs, safety, sexual activity and other activities were the least frequently asked (14â€“27%). The proportion of those with a concern identified when asked ranged from 18%-39%.However, in self-harm, depression and suicide, only 85/231(37%) were asked, with concern identified in 87%.78 patients were admitted for mental health;28(39%) had less than half the domains completed (median 5, range 0â€“8). Drug use 46/78(59%), safety and sexual activity (both 38/78(49%)) were inconsistently documented in this group, with concerns identified in 20â€“26% of those asked.90/231(39%) were referred to CAMHS, social care, counselling, online or other support services. 16/77(21%) patients with a concern documented in at least one domain were not referred onwards.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates poor implementation of the HEEADSSS tool on admission, across a wide geographical area. Increased utilisation of a psychosocial screening tool would provide more opportunities to CYP to discuss their psychosocial health and receive appropriate support, in line with national guidance standards. Further work is underway addressing barriers to using HEEADSSS, considering electronic or embedded tools and signposting to relevant services.","","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.363","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A208-A209, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A208-A209, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20393,""
"Volunteering for wellbeing: young peopleâ€™s experiences of volunteering in response to the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundThere has been significant concern about the wellbeing of children and young people during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during periods of lockdown and school closures. Social distancing has led to some young people and their families feeling isolated and unable to access appropriate support. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has highlighted an increase in mental health presentations and disordered eating. Targeting enjoyable and worthwhile interventions which have a positive impact on self-esteem and confidence can improve the resilience of young people.ObjectivesOur aim was to listen to the voices of young people about their experiences of volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact this has had on their wellbeing so we can shape and influence future opportunities in the youth sector.MethodsWe interviewed young people between the ages of 10 and 17 years who have volunteered with St John Ambulance as part of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Opportunities they had participated in included:Logistics support, including packing and shipping orders for clinical equipment and stocking ambulancesTraining the emergency response and communication course elements for volunteer vaccinatorsSupporting the public working as a vaccination care volunteer at mass vaccination centresFacilitating online engagement opportunities for other youth volunteersThere was an initial online focus group to share ideas about volunteering and its impact on wellbeing and each young person subsequently produced a written statement about their volunteering experiences using semi-structured questions provided for guidance. These statements were used to identify themes for further exploration and discussion about the provision of volunteering opportunities for young people.ResultsThe young people all agreed that volunteering had a very positive impact on their wellbeing. They felt they had improved their capability across a variety of domains and had experienced new opportunities. These included presenting and teaching both face-to-face and using technology, developing engagement session resources and organising people and processes. This enhanced their confidence and adaptability. One young person commented that he was proud his calm and friendly communication had enabled him to put the public at ease in vaccination centres thus improving their experience.The young people felt they had something to look forward to which gave them a break from the potential boredom of lockdown and reduced their focus on negative aspects of the pandemic, especially isolation. Being active increased happiness and they felt part of a supportive team working towards a goal which gave them purpose. They expressed pride in the direct impact that their work has had on their communities and the pandemic response.ConclusionsFacilitating the involvement of young people as part of the pandemic response has had a positive impact on their wellbeing through challenging circumstances. Promoting volunteering opportunities for them leads to an increased feeling of belonging through participation in their communities, enhances their transferable skills and fosters a sense of pride in the positive impact of their contributions. These experiences will help youth services focus on opportunities which benefit health.","Pool, Hannah, Atkinson, Matthew","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.338","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A194-A195, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A194-A195, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20394,""
"Deliberate self-harm among children and young people at a large secondary care centre","BackgroundA recent global meta-analysis (2018) of children and adolescents showed that the lifetime aggregate and 12 months prevalence of deliberate self-harm was 13.7% and 14.2% respectively. Given the high prevalence of this problem and the frequent cases we see in our local population, it is useful to understand the demographics and associations with deliberate self-harm in our local population, identifying those at risk and identify any delays in care for those that need to be admitted to a psychiatric institution to facilitate appropriate care.ObjectivesWe designed a descriptive study to look at the self-harm associations in our population, to help identify the population at risk and to identify any delays in care to those needing to be transferred to a mental health facility for specialised care.MethodsThe acute paediatrics handover list (electronically stored on our Trust database) was searched for any patients fulfilling the criteria of deliberate self-harm â€“ from April 2019 to November 2019. A total of 57 patients met the criteria for inclusion. The electronic patient database was then searched for each patient and the relevant information documented on a Microsoft excel sheet. The data was then analysed to determine the trends and patterns.ResultsThe most common method of deliberate self-harm was by overdose with paracetamol being the most common drug used. The most common trigger identified was family stressors (26%) followed by self-esteem issues/loneliness and low mood (25%). 39% of patients were assessed by the Emergency Department Psychiatry Team as needing one to one nursing. 88% of patients were discharged to their previous residence and 2% of patients required admission to a mental health facility. The rest were discharged to a place other than their previous residence â€“ for example a relativeâ€™s home. The patients requiring discharge to a mental health facility had the largest delays from the time point of the decision being made to the actual transfer â€“ up to eleven days.ConclusionsThere is a delay in transfer for patients who require admission to a mental health bedâ€“ this may have implications for patient care and use of resources.. One to one nursing was required in a high number of cases, although the majority of these had an inpatient stay of one day or less and discharged to the previous residence, â€“ Previous studies have reported school stressors as a main trigger for deliberate self-harm, but our study indicated in this population, family stressors played more of a prominent role. This study can therefore form the basis for comparison of this pre-pandemic data with the patterns seen during and post the COVID â€“ 19 pandemic as there would have been more time spent with family and less in school.","Samuel, Ria, Craze, Janet, Nsiah, Yvonne","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.335","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A192-A193, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A192-A193, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20395,""
"Impact of COVID-19 in the management of Under-16s presenting to the acute hospital with self-harm","BackgroundSuicide is the most common cause of death among children and young people over five years of age and the prevalence of all mental health conditions is increasing in the UK. Self-harm is an important indicator of distress and it requires appropriate intervention and management. Covid-19 has a high morbidity rate but a significant part of this morbidity is the impact on mental health.ObjectivesThe aim of this observational study was to look at the number of under 16s attending A&E with self-harm or suicidal ideation and compare the presentations before the first lockdown of Covid-19 with post lockdown in September 2020.MethodsData was collected from East and North Hertfordshire A&E for September 2019 and September 2020. Self-harm was noted as a spectrum from occasional self-scratching to overdose with intent to die to completed suicide. Suicidal ideation was recorded separately from self-harm.ResultsIn response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Childrenâ€™s Crisis Assessment and Treatment Team (C-CATT), the crisis team who assess patients presenting to the acute District General Hospital, increased their hours of service and now function 24/7.There was an increase of 48% of under sixteens presenting to the acute hospital with a mental health crisis in September 2020 when compared to September 2019. However, the number of young people under sixteen presenting with suicidal ideation increased by 133%. Females presenting with suicidal ideation increased by 200%.ConclusionsWe hypothesise that the increase in mental health presentations to A&E are largely due to stresses associated with Covid-19 and its direct and indirect impact on physical and mental health along with the re-opening of schools after the first lockdown of 2020. The social isolation and lack of access to pastoral support from schools as well as changes to mental health services resulted in a dramatic rise in the number of young people presenting to A&E with a mental health crisis. The impact of Covid-19 on young peopleâ€™s mental health will likely be a significant risk factor for future physical and mental ill health across the globe.","Pierson, Kim, Naashoma Naashoma Pereira, Carvalho, Shaker-Naeeni, Hadi","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.318","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A182-A183, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A182-A183, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20396,""
"Giving clinical governance a makeover â€“ a quality improvement project (a work in progress)","BackgroundClinical Governance (CG) underpins the daily practice of doctors, nurses and allied health professionals (AHPs), affecting how we care for patients as well as ongoing education and aspiration to excellence.The 7 pillars of Clinical Governance, namely: Risk Management, Clinical Audit, Education and Training, Clinical Effectiveness, Information, Patient Experience and Staff Management influence every aspect of working. However, involvement in clinical governance is frequently seen as the remit of consultants and senior managers, and can feel far removed from junior doctors, nurses and others on the ground day-to-day.This project took place across the general paediatric and neonatal departments of a busy London District General Hospital. It was conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic, with its additional pressures.ObjectivesThe aim of this project was to:Gauge levels of knowledge, awareness and involvement in CG amongst the entire paediatric and neonatal teams.Raise the profile of CG.Investigate ways of disseminating information from CG activity, including meetings, rapid reviews, serious incident reports.Begin a monthly CG newsletter.Run other CG-based teaching and activities aimed at increasing awareness.MethodsQuality Improvement methodology was followed, using the Model for Improvement.An initial questionnaire of junior and senior doctors, nurses and AHPs evaluated understanding of CG, most effective ways of communication, reading habits of existing departmental bulletins, and areas of CG participants wished to learn more about. This was used to generate change ideas.MeasureWe surveyed the same group monthly on their perceived knowledge, involvement and awareness of CG. This generated a score out of 12.7 Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were carried out (to date):Choosing name of a new monthly newsletter by competition,A monthly Clinical Governance newsletter â€˜The Chaterpillarâ€™, communicating learning points from CG activity;â€˜Greatix of the monthâ€™;CG Pillar of the month;and advertising upcoming learning events,Seminar on Quality Improvement,Simulation training based on a serious incident involving an adolescent in a mental health crisis,Teaching following a pharmacology rapid review,Interactive Clinical Governance teachingReflections on â€˜Journey of a Datixâ€™ResultsMultiple changes were adopted into the fabric of the department, including the monthly CG newsletter, regular mental health-based simulation training, and clinical governance in the teaching timetable.Although the measure across the three months showed the median score of knowledge, involvement and awareness of CG remained unchanged, there was greater participation of junior doctors, nurses and AHPs in subsequent surveys. The consultantâ€™s scores were generally high, so this consistency implied greater multidisciplinary involvement was occurring within the department.ConclusionsClinical Governance remains the foundation of clinical activity, and quality improvement methodology has brought about change within our department. Further change ideas include a â€˜Clinical Governance Weekâ€™ and greater involvement of nurses. The project (still in progress) has led to lasting impact and enrichment of the paediatric department.There is new involvement, ideas and energy to be harnessed beyond the traditional senior management, enabling lasting improvement in clinical practice for our department and beyond, as more individuals are empowered with the knowledge and skills required to be tomorrowâ€™s leaders.","Sheikh, Hajera, Marshall, Hannah, Devereux, Emma, Taylor, Katherine, Gerrard-Hughes, Anna, Ng, Belinda","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.262","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A151, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A151, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20397,""
"Tics and the COVID pandemic-observation from a tertiary care seizure clinic","BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a notable negative impact on the overall mental well-being of children and young adults. Those with Tourette syndrome have had worsening of both tics and associated co-morbidity such as obsessive behaviours along with sleep disturbance. Social isolation is likely to have not helped this vulnerable population.ObjectivesThe current study aims to document the impact of COVID 19 on tic exacerbations, frequency, severity and type of tics, incidence of Tourette syndrome and child and parent-perceived change in the pattern of tics among a cohort of children attending seizure clinic.MethodsThis observational study reviewed patient numbers of tics/tic-like functional neurological symptoms in a cohort of children attending a seizure clinic at the department of paediatrics, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom. The data was reviewed for a one year period (March 2020 to March 2021) and compared to the pre-pandemic numbers over a similar duration. Feedback given by children having tics and their parents were considered in documenting specific observations.ResultsThere was over four-fold increase in the number of children presenting with tics over the observation period compared to the preceding year. Tic-like functional neurological presentations also had increased dramatically (both vocal and motor phenomena) and a small proportion of these children mentioned seeing videos of popular personalities with tics on a social media platform. New diagnosis of Tourette syndrome saw a three-fold increase in this set-up. On the positive side, home schooling had helped some children with pre-existing tics with regards to the perceived severity. These parents reported that their children felt no necessity to suppress their tics all day (unlike whilst in school) and hence they observed a steady pattern of tics rather than significant troublesome outbursts in the evenings. A third had associated sleep disturbance.ConclusionsOurs is an interesting observation and discussions with colleagues in the wider set-up revealed similar patterns. Documenting this will help inform healthcare providers with a view to expanding available mental health expertise for this challenging cohort of children and young adults.","Dayasiri, Kavinda, Anand, Geetha","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.242","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A139, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A139, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20398,""
"You donâ€™t ask, you donâ€™t get? Safeguarding 16- and 17-year-olds during the pandemic in an adult emergency department","BackgroundMultiagency work in safeguarding has been hampered by pandemic related reduction in General Practitioner appointments and schools moving to remote learning, reducing the opportunities for safeguarding issues to be raised and actioned. The prevalence and severity of mental health conditions amongst adolescents has since the onset of the COVID19 pandemic. A reduction in socialisation, and increased use of social media use are among many influencing factors.Safeguarding concerns and mental health are often intertwined. The way to best identify any psychosocial concerns is to ask;taking a thorough psychosocial history.Many 16- and 17-year olds are seen in adult Emergency Departments (ED) but are still under the umbrella of paediatrics for safeguarding.ObjectivesIdentify and quantify safeguarding and CAMHS referrals within 16- and 17-year olds.Identify areas of improvements to better recognise and report safeguarding concerns.MethodsThis is a single centre, cross-sectional study of a major trauma centre ED in London. Patients were all those aged 16 and 17, attending the adult ED, in November 2020. Demographic information, presenting complaint, diagnosis and discharge location were collected, as well as information regarding safeguarding and CAMHS referrals, and presence of a thorough psychosocial history. Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel.Results68 patients (38 aged 16 (24F, 14M), and 30 aged 17 (16M, 14F)) were included in analysis.Safeguarding50% of patients (34) attending had safeguarding referrals made. 59% of these were new referrals, and 41% were information sharing. 65% were made by the A&E team, the remaining 35% of referrals were made by the safeguarding team (who retrospectively look through all patient notes aged under 18 years). 59% of referrals were made on the same day, and where a referral was delayed, it took an average of 5.4 days to complete.The most common reason to refer to safeguarding was for intoxication, drug use and intentional overdose (35%), followed by physical abuse/assault (26%). 2 referrals were felt to have been missed, both were 16 years old, female, and secondary to an eating disorder and self-harm, respectively.CAMHS18% of patients (n=12) were referred to CAMHS, of which 66% were female, and 75% were 16 years old. Intentional overdose was the largest group of CAMHS referrals (33%). 2 referrals to CAMHS were missed â€“ one had anxiety;one had an eating disorder.Psychosocial historyOnly 4% of patients (n=3) had what was felt to be a full psychosocial history documented in their ED clerking. Those that did were all 16 years old and female. Two of these presented with an intentional overdose and one with assault. Two of these were performed by A&E doctors, and one was by a paediatrician working in adult ED. All patients had some form of psychosocial history documented, but often incomplete, usually only mentioning smoking or alcohol.ConclusionsA huge number of safeguarding referrals were required during this month of lockdown in the 2020 pandemic, adding to the ongoing evidence that the pandemic negatively impacted adolescents.Thorough psychosocial histories should be routine to best identify safeguarding or mental health concerns.","Harriott, Josh, Sapaetharan, Vithullan","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.222","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A128-A129, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A128-A129, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20399,""
"A service evaluation of general paediatric caseload","BackgroundIn the literature there is currently little data regarding general paediatric caseload. There are some reports of acute attendances, ward admissions and outpatient clinics, however most of these are from the 1990â€™s and early 2000â€™s with limited recent data available. The caseload within the general paediatric service has changed over the last 10â€“20 years and there have been recent changes due to COVID-19.ObjectivesTo describe general paediatric caseload at University Hospital Southampton (UHS) including emergency department (ED) attendances, ward admissions and outpatient clinic appointments in order to contribute to local service improvements, national projects and research planning.MethodsData was collected for all patients under the age of 18 years. ED and ward data were collected retrospectively, the clinic data was collected both prospectively and retrospectively. Analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel.ResultsBetween 11thSeptember 2019 and 10th September 2020, 22,940 patients attended the ED. The top 3 presenting complaints were shortness of breath (10.8%), head injury (9.7%) and fever (9.5%) and the top 3 diagnoses (made by a doctor) were â€˜no abnormality detected/no diagnosis recordedâ€™ (21.9%), URTI (6.6%) and closed fracture (5.6%). In the 12â€“17-year-old age group, mental health issues were the 4th most common diagnosis (8.4%). Over the same year, 3212 patients were admitted to wards under general paediatrics. The top reason for admission was viral infection for stays less than 24 hours (16.3%) and 24â€“72 hours (13.8%) and acute bronchiolitis (20.9%) for stays over 72 hours. The median length of stay was 1 day, and the most common length of stay was 0 days. Over 8 weeks of outpatient clinics (September-October 2020) there were 476 appointments. The top 3 reasons for attendance were constipation (8.2%), food allergies/intolerances (5.9%) and abdominal pain (4.2%). 16.3% of appointments were unattended.ConclusionsThis is the first report of the full service provided by the general paediatric department at UHS, identifying common conditions presenting to the service. There may be a number of reasons why the final diagnosis made in ED was most commonly â€˜no abnormality detectedâ€™. These include patientsâ€™ symptoms easing prior to consultation and miseducation, where the patients attend for a reason perceived to be concerning, however the child is found to be well. Review of current guidance has shown a lack of information available for some common conditions and developing new pathways of care may be beneficial for clinicians and families. Additional targeted work and focussed education into these areas may lead to improvements in care. The data can be used to help inform further research projects, as well as to develop services within local healthcare systems, improving the management of patients presenting with conditions that could be dealt with outside a hospital setting.","Turberville, Lucy, Cathie, Katrina","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.187","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A108, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A108, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20400,""
"Improving awareness of staff wellbeing in a paediatric haematology and oncology unit","BackgroundHealthcare staff wellbeing has never been such a priority. The Covid pandemic has impacted our lives personally and professionally.ObjectivesTo increase awareness of and engagement in wellbeing within a paediatric haematology and oncology unit.MethodsWe undertook a number of PDSA wellbeing projects from September 2020. These included:A wellbeing email (initially twice weekly) to all departmental and support services staff, including non-clinical staff.A â€˜Celebrate the Small Thingsâ€™ board for staff messages.A â€˜HALTâ€™ (hungry, angry, late and tired) box to encourage breaks and sustenance.A Christmas celebration of our staff, based on an online survey;highlighting team and individual strengths.We undertook an online survey, requesting feedback on the length, content and frequency of wellbeing emails, and requesting further qualitative feedback on the project.ResultsSince September 2020, 31 wellbeing emails have been sent out to 75 members of our department, including medical, nursing, support and secretarial staff. Content is varied and includes videos, coaching-type questions, articles and challenges. Themes include civility, gratitude, finding joy, mental health resources, humour, acknowledging and validating our difficult job, and valuing colleagues. As a marker for â€˜engagementâ€™, 29 emails have been received back in response.There have been 27 messages added to our celebration board.Our Christmas celebration highlighted 27 individuals, and acknowledged the work of the Wellbeing Team. Individuals were sent an email certificate. Comments specific to the wellbeing team included, â€˜Thank you for recognising the need and taking time to care for us allâ€™ and â€˜I think both the wellbeing emails and promotion of wellbeing has been fantastic. What may seem like a nice little email can have a huge impact not just on peopleâ€™s wellbeing but has as a knock on effect their motivation, productivity and general output.â€™Eleven staff completed our survey (15% response rate);72% rated the emails as â€˜veryâ€™ or â€˜extremelyâ€™ helpful. All responders felt the emails were the right length. 63% felt they were the right frequency, with 36% feeling they were too frequent. Comments on the project were overwhelmingly positive;they included â€˜simply knowing that there is someone (some people) who care about us and want to make this a more positive environment J also, the content is great!â€™ and â€˜I think it is great to raise the wellbeing agenda, such an important and overlooked area.â€™ConclusionsWellbeing is multi-faceted and as such is difficult to measure. We have measured markers for engagement in our project rather than wellbeing per se.There was a low response rate to our survey, though those who did respond were very positive. This is likely to be a confounding factor of the motivation of responders being those who are â€˜engagedâ€™. From the survey results we have reduced the frequency of emails to weekly, and have acted on suggestions for content.Overall our project has been well received and has raised the importance of staff wellbeing within our department.","Johnston, Shona, Mitchell, Amy, Craven, Joanna, Mitchell, Laura","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.131","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A76-A77, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A76-A77, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20401,""
"Are greater numbers of children with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus a further example of collateral damage from the COVID-19 pandemic?","BackgroundThe 2019 novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a number of changes to the daily routine for school aged children. Specifically, remote learning due to school closure, increased screen time for virtual learning, greater sedentary exposure, less exercise and potential changes to diet. These risk factors pose a potential threat for significant increase in weight gain leading to further increase in obesity among children and young people (CYP). This might eventually translate to the increased incidence of complications due to obesity including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).ObjectivesA case series to find the incidence of T2DM in children and young people in a large UK teaching hospital during the COVID-19 related lockdown period.MethodsWe prospectively collected data on children aged &lt;17 years admitted to a large UK teaching hospital with newly diagnosed T2DM. Data was collected between May 2020 and November 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined demographic, clinical and biochemical data.ResultsSix newly diagnosed children (five males, one female), four from minority ethnic backgrounds, mean (SD) age 14.4 (2.2) years, weight 84 (27) kg and BMI 32 (6) kg/m2 (BMI Z score +1.92 (0.5). 3 (50%) children had learning difficulties and all presented with classic features across the spectrum of severity from osmotic symptoms to one child with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 50% had acanthosis nigricans at presentation and a mean (SD) blood glucose of 18.38 (4.5) mmol/L. Mean (SD) HbA1c was 89.5 (23.8) mmol/mol. All six children had negative diabetes antibodies. All of them tested negative for COVID-19. Most parents reported that their children gained weight during lockdown. For comparison, in the preceding years, on average two children (age &lt;17 years) per year are diagnosed with T2DM in the same centre.ConclusionsWe are seeing an increased incidence of T2DM in children and young people (CYP) in a large UK teaching hospital during the ongoing UK â€˜lockdownâ€™. This was reflected by a significant threefold increase in children with newly diagnosed T2DM. We draw attention to whether environmental and societal changes during lockdown have conferred an increased risk of obesity among CYP which have led to this significant increase in the incidence of T2DM. Alternatively this could be an indirect effect of the current pandemic. Both highlight the importance of adequate measures to be implemented to restore the physical and mental health of these CYP. In light of this we propose that parents, children and school authorities should work together to motivate CYP to participate in regular physical activities that are practically feasible during lockdown. Furthermore, there may be a delay in accessing healthcare services due to various psychosocial factors as seen in children with type 1 diabetes resulting in delayed diagnosis. All these highlight the importance of increased awareness among the public and healthcare professionals to diagnose these children early and initiate treatment.","Minhas, Dimple, Subbarayan, Anbezhil, Sundaram, Prem","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.109","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A64, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A64, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20402,""
"Reaching out to children and young people about mental health in the Covid-19 pandemic","BackgroundSince the start of the Covid-19 pandemic the mental health of children and young people across the country has been affected. The ongoing uncertainty during the pandemic has made normality a thing of the past. The burden of this has created an escalation of worsening mental health diagnoses and created a new population with new mental health issues.Childrenâ€™s mental health week is celebrated every year in the hospital. This year, given the pandemic restrictions, new ways of raising awareness of childrenâ€™s mental health was sought with using social media outlets.ObjectivesTo create content on the hospital trust social media pages that would engage children and young people in childrenâ€™s mental health week.To use social media to showcase the mental health teams that work in the hospital and the mental health organisations who work in the city who are frequently signposted to from the hospital mental health teams.MethodsChildrenâ€™s mental health week runs over seven days and we created content for each day. Firstly, we obtained photos of each mental health team in the hospital and a blurb to introduce themselves and what their job entailed. Secondly, we asked various organisations who are based in our city, whose work revolves around childrenâ€™s mental health, to provide the same information. Thirdly, and most importantly, we asked the hospital youth involvement group to create questions to ask all the teams involved as we wanted to showcase the voice of the young person in this week. The week also focused on allowing the children and young people who were in patients in the hospital to share their talents and express themselves in ways they manage their mental health.ResultsThe performance for each post on each day was analysed and compared to other posts that had happened after this week. Each different post for each day gained a high number of likes, shares and comments. Although one of the comparative posts gained more likes and reactions compared to our week, the post shares were considerable higher for our week overall and the Facebook reach was also higher.The advantage of using social media in this way also highlighted the week to other outlets and the city online paper featured our story on their social media pages.ConclusionsIt was clear that the subject of childrenâ€™s mental health is an area which still requires highlighting. The comments we received about the content during the week has prompted us to continue with this style, to raise awareness of childrenâ€™s mental health. The advantages of using social media on this subject enabled us to reach a larger number of young people and their families and carers. The trust social media pages have a large number of followers and to be able to reach so many people on such an important subject made a larger impact than the previous years.","Cuellar, Bianca, Morgan, Emma","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.57","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A34, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A34, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20403,""
"Review of a virtual work experience, used to support school-aged students during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on education, mental health and morale of school-aged students. Schools have been closed for months on end, meaning many have been left to ponder future careers with little or no help. Additionally, those considering a career within the NHS have been presented with press reports revealing how difficult working within this area can sometimes be but had little or no opportunity to visit or speak to professionals working in the roles. Thus, by holding a Virtual Work Experience for students who are interested in a career within the NHS we aimed to reduce anxieties and boost knowledge.ObjectivesOur aims were to improve studentsâ€™ knowledge of what it is like to work within the NHS, as well as give insights into the multiple different career options that are available. In addition, we hoped the session would give students information to help them to go on and be successful in their applications and interviews.In the long term, we hope this project will help the NHS and itsâ€™ patients as we will have more informed young people joining the different professions.MethodsIn partnership with the School Volunteering Team at Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, we invited school-aged students who were interested in exploring a career within the NHS to attend the session. We invited representatives from the Clinical (Doctor/Nursing student/Paramedic/GP nurse etc), Administrative and Management team along with Allied health professionals from both the Hospital and Community set-up to give presentations or video insights into their roles. Students were asked to complete a questionnaire pre and post-attending to help us evaluate what was useful and the effect the session had.ResultsIn total 26 students attended the day, 15 filled in the questionnaire pre-attending, and 14 post. 57% of students had done no medical work experience prior to this session, and of those who had, a third had only done virtual sessions.From the questionnaires we found 12/14 students felt more confident in their decision to work in the NHS following the session, with the remaining 2/14 feeling no different. Additionally, we found 92% of students planned to use this event in their UCAS, personal statement and/or interview questions.ConclusionsYoung people have been hugely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic;theyâ€™ve been kept away from school, their peers and also missed opportunities for learning about future careers. Additionally, the current COVID-19 pandemic has placed the NHS in prime public view, revealing the hardships that often go along with the work.Thus, by holding this event we hoped to allay fears, provide information and allow students to ask questions about entering into a profession within the NHS. The eventâ€™s feedback was very positive, so we are now going on to hold a larger event in March 2021;inviting more students to attend and including more specialtiesTherefore, by helping these young people at a time when access to services is so limited, we can help to continue to encourage them into careers within the NHS.","Bailey, Emma, Bailey, Robert, Rajendran, Prabu, Hazell, Sabine, Emery, Mhairi","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.50","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A30, 2021.; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 106(Suppl 1):A30, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20404,""
"Neuro-COVID-19","Neuromuscular manifestations of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection are frequent, and include dizziness, headache, myopathy, and olfactory and gustatory disturbances. Patients with acute central nervous system disorders, such as delirium, impaired consciousness, stroke and convulsive seizures, have a high mortality rate. The encephalitis/encephalopathy that causes consciousness disturbance and seizures can be classified into three conditions, including direct infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, encephalopathy caused by central nervous system damage secondary to systemic hypercytokinemia (cytokine storm) and autoimmune-mediated encephalitis that occurs after infection. The sequelae, called post-acute COVID-19 syndrome or long COVID, include neuromuscular manifestations, such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, muscle weakness, brain fog and cognitive impairment. It is desirable to establish diagnostic criteria and treatment for these symptoms. Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndrome, bilateral facial paralysis, encephalitis and opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome have been reported as adverse reactions after the COVID-19 vaccine, although these are rare.

"Fear of COVID-19 scale: Psychometric characteristics, reliability, validity and factors predictive of fear in the Pakistani population","There is a growing concern regarding mental health and psychological distress caused by the COVID-19. The degree of fear has been assessed by few studies but most of those used invalidated measures. Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) is a seven-item scale developed during this pandemic. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the Urdu version of FCVS-19 in the Pakistani population. They were also asked the question about COVID-19 factors that were associated with fear. The Urdu translation of the measure has excellent internal consistency and validity.

"Lockdown dreams: Dream content and emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic in an italian sample","Beginning in March 2020, the Italian population was subjected to a lockdown lasting approximately 3 months due to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emergency. Drawing on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of dream data, the present study aimed at exploring the effects of social isolation and the lockdown on Italian people's dreams, focusing on content and dominating emotions. An online survey was administered to 598 participants who aged 18-70 years (M = 30.9, SD = 10.9). In the survey, participants were asked to: (a) write down two dreams they had during the lockdown and (b) provide data on demographic and socioeconomic factors;sleep quality before and after lockdown;and levels of anxiety, depression, and rumination. Questions also explored participants' perceived fear of contagion, dream recall frequency (DRF), and dream vividness. Participants' dream transcripts revealed a majority of negative emotions-particularly fear/fright/terror and anxiety/anguish/preoccupation. Moreover, several themes emerged from the content analysis, including relationships, the human and natural environment, and COVID-19. The results deepen our understanding of the dominant dream emotions of people experiencing a collective stressful event, such as the social isolation necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the findings support the continuity hypothesis, which holds that dreams tend to reflect the emotional concerns of the dreamer and help to integrate intense or disruptive emotions experienced during waking life.

"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health of General Population and University Students Across the World: A Review","Background: With the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic across the world, people have suffered an unexpected setback to their mental health. As psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general population and university students go unnoticed. This review aims to present existing literature that reports the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and university students in different countries. Methods: A manual search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar and Mendeley from inception to 31st January 2021. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. Results: During COVID-19 pandemic, relatively high rates of depression (4.5% to 72.3%), anxiety (12.7% to 85.7%) and stress (5% to 90.1%) were reported in the general population as well as in university students, depression (3% to 70.5%), anxiety (9% to 63.3%) and stress (61.5% to 25%) in India, Nepal, Pakistan, China, Spain, US, UK, France, Egypt, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. Risk factors associated include female gender, younger age group (&lt;40 years), unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety and stress. Alleviating the hazardous effects of COVID-19 on mental health should be given due attention internationally. Â© 2021. All Rights Reserved.","Singh, S.; Singh, N.; Ahiwar, R.; Sagar, S.

"Emerging Public Mental Health Crisis Due to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic and Lockdown in Nigeria","Background: The coronavirus disease will worsen existing mental health disorders and bequeath new mental disorders on many. The objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of significant depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, as well as identify its associated risk factors among people living under the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic lockdown in Nigeria. Methods: It was a cross-sectional survey done online. Socio-demography, perceived stress, social support, and domestic abuse was ascertained. Depressive and PTSD symptoms were measured following four weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown. Results: Prevalence of significant depressive and PTSD symptoms among 755 respondents were 33.6%, and 42.9%, respectively. Proportions of those who experienced emotional abuse, financial abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse from people close to them during the lockdown were 16.4%, 5.3%, 3.2%, and 2.8% respectively. Perceived stress from home and lockdown, coping methods, social support, emotional abuse, and financial abuse were independent predictors of significant depressive symptoms. Work status, perceived stress from home, fear of coronavirus and lockdown, coping methods, and emotional abuse were independent predictors of significant PTSD symptoms among respondents. Conclusions: As the pandemic continues, COVID-19 appears to be associated with significant depressive and post traumatic stress disorder symptoms among people in Nigeria. Consequently, positive health practices embedded in different socio-cultural practices should be encouraged to help people face the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic while preparing a robust public mental health strategy to combat the inevitable consequences of the crisis. Aside from this, innovative efforts from researchers, policymakers, health professionals, and the public are needed to face the present and future mental health threats of the pandemic.","Olushola, O.; Bolanle, O.; Abiodun, A.; Olurotimi, C.; Akintayo, O.; Akintayo, O.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Emerging+Public+Mental+Health+Crisis+Due+to+Coronavirus+Disease+(COVID-19)+Pandemic+and+Lockdown+in+Nigeria","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences; 58(2):19-32, 2021.; Publication details: Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences; 58(2):19-32, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20413,""

"Taking an Anti-Health Inequity Approach to Counter the Unfair Burden of Poor Health","In the 1990s Margaret Whitehead defined health inequities-often referred to in the United States as ""health disparities""-as health differences that are avoidable, unnecessary, and unjust.1 More recent work (e.g., by Braveman2) has done much to sharpen our understanding of why we need specific efforts to counter fundamental inequities if we are to achieve health equality. An anti-health inequity approach would call for a doubling down on efforts to monitor these conditions among Black women specifically, aiming to reduce maternal mortality in this group, and thus narrowing health gaps.

"COVID-19 pandemic and the mental health of elderly","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARSCoV-2, COVID-19 infection, announced by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020 as a global pandemic, originating from the Wuhan province of the People's Republic of China in December 2019, has affected virtually all countries to different extents in a very short period of time. On the basis of the reports by the healthcare teams engaged in the field and the short term research carried out, the infection has been shown to be especially more effective on the elderly population with chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, frequently leading to mortality. Consequently, the case-fatality ratio has been lower in countries with predominantly young populations in comparison to those with higher counts of elderly citizens.

"Changes in Alcohol Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Young Adults: The Prospective Effect of Anxiety and Depression","Health measures instantiated to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have imposed significant constraints for the population and impacted on drinking habits and mental health. This study longitudinally compared changes in alcohol consumption before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and the impact of sociodemographic and mental health variables on such changes among a community sample of young adults. Data were collected in the context of a larger, ongoing longitudinal study. The sample consisted of 305 young adults from Spain aged between 18 and 26 years (mean age = 21.27, (SD = 2.21), female = 53.4%; college students = 61.6%) who completed first (November-2019 and February-2020; i.e., before the outbreak of COVID-19) and second follow-up questionnaires (March 2021, a year after the COVID-19 outbreak). Alcohol use (quantity and drinking frequency), depression and anxiety symptoms were measured. Quantity and frequency of alcohol use decreased from the pre- to post-COVID-19 period. A decrease in drinking frequency was observed among college students, but not in noncollege peers. Although we found no effect of pre-COVID-19 anxiety on alcohol use changes, those with more depressive symptoms at the pre-COVID assessment were more resistant to decreasing their drinking quantity and frequency after the COVID-19 outbreak. This information will be of value when designing interventions aimed at reducing harmful alcohol use and highlights the role of mental health status when identifying high risk populations of young-adults during this, and future, public health crises.","Vera, BelÃ©n Del Valle; Carmona-MÃ¡rquez, JosÃ©; Lozano-Rojas, Ã“scar MartÃ­n; Parrado-GonzÃ¡lez, Alberto; Vidal-GinÃ©, Claudio; Pautassi, Ricardo Marcos; FernÃ¡ndez-CalderÃ³n, FermÃ­n","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194468","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Clin Med;10(19)2021 Sep 28.; Publication details: J Clin Med;10(19)2021 Sep 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20419,""
"Burden, Depression, and Awareness of Information on Safety Behavior in Korean Hemodialysis Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships among burden, depression, awareness of information (AIC), and safety behavior among hemodialysis patients in Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study participants included 149 patients who received hemodialysis at seven general hospitals in Korea between January and February 2021. A structured questionnaire was used to survey their levels of burden, depression, AIC, adherent safety behavior (ASB), and dysfunctional safety behavior (DSB).

"""Medical Student Syndrome""-A Myth or a Real Disease Entity? Cross-Sectional Study of Medical Students of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland","The description of Medical Student Syndrome is based on the assumption that inexperienced medical students are prone to develop a pathological fear of medical conditions they are taught about. The aim of this study is to examine the sample of students (medical and non-medical) in order to assess and compare their level of hypochondriacal attitudes and health-related anxiety. We also examined other factors which might have had an influence on hypochondria and nosophobia attitudes among students. Methods: The study was conducted in two groups of students: 313 medical students at the Medical University of Silesia and 293 students at non-medical universities in Katowice, Poland. The study used the medical student syndrome self-explanatory questionnaire constructed for the study, taking into account the specificity of the group and the research problem. The research questionnaire was completed in an online survey by 606 students. Results: The results of the study showed that medical students obtained the same scores on a nosophobic scale as the non-medical students (p = 0.5). The analysis of hypochondriacal behavior showed significantly higher results in the non-medical student group (p = 0.02). In the entire study group, females and participants with mental disorders obtained higher scores in relation to nosophobia. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were more common in the group of medical students. Conclusions: Medical studies are not a risk factor for the occurrence of health anxiety and hypochondrial attitudes. Such factors are female gender and having a mental illness.","Szczurek, Katarzyna; Furgal, Natalia; Szczepanek, Dawid; Zaman, Rashid; Krysta, Krzysztof; Krzystanek, Marek","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189884","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 19.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20421,""
"Feelings, Behavioral Actions and Depressive Symptoms Related to COVID-19 among Undergraduates in Hail, Saudi Arabia","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) outbreak has had a profound psychological impact on university undergraduates. Feelings, behavioral actions, and depressive symptoms related to COVID-19 in undergraduates in Hail, Saudi Arabia, were assessed using an online survey. Eighteen feelings and six behavioral acts were assessed. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptomatology. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression techniques were used. The mean age of the participants (n = 418) was 20.2 years (standard deviation (SD) = 1.8 years), and 52.9% (n = 221) were males. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms were reported by 47.1% of male and 51.3% of female participants. Social isolation, loss of interest, obsessive monitoring of symptoms, concentration difficulties, recurrent negative thoughts, and worries about health services emerged as vital negative feelings related to COVID-19 that were expressed by the participants. Younger age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.636, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.428-0.946) and coming from the middle-income category (OR = 0.388, 95% CI = 0.151-0.994) were found to be protective factors against developing depressive symptoms. Frequent cleaning of hands, wearing masks when going out, and adherence to social distancing rules were practiced by 71.5% (95% CI = 67.2-75.8%), 78.7% (95% CI = (74.4-82.5%) and 66.0% (95% CI = (61.3-70.5%) of the participants, respectively. These behavioral acts were not associated with the development of depressive symptoms. Although the practice of COVID-19 precautionary measures by the participants was satisfactory, nearly half of the participants reported depressive symptoms. Innovative educational strategies are needed to curb concentration difficulties and social isolation experienced by undergraduates during outbreaks such as COVID-19.","Aldhmadi, Badr K; Itumalla, Ramaiah; Kumar, Rakesh; Perera, Bilesha","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101280","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Healthcare (Basel);9(10)2021 Sep 28.; Publication details: Healthcare (Basel);9(10)2021 Sep 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20422,""
"Assessing Patient Needs During Natural Disasters: Mixed Methods Analysis of Portal Messages Sent During Hurricane Harvey","BACKGROUND: Patient portals play an important role in connecting patients with their medical care team, which improves patient engagement in treatment plans, decreases unnecessary visits, and reduces costs. During natural disasters, patients' needs increase, whereas available resources, specifically access to care, become limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine patients' health needs during a natural crisis by analyzing the electronic messages sent during Hurricane Harvey to guide future disaster planning efforts. METHODS: We explored patient portal use data from a large Greater Houston area health care system focusing on the initial week of the Hurricane Harvey disaster, beginning with the date of landfall, August 25, 2017, to August 31, 2017. A mixed methods approach was used to assess patients' immediate health needs and concerns during the disruption of access to routine and emergent medical care. Quantitative analysis used logistic regression models to assess the predictive characteristics of patients using the portal during Hurricane Harvey. This study also included encounters by type (emergency, inpatient, observation, outpatient, and outpatient surgery) and time (before, during, and after Hurricane Harvey). For qualitative analysis, the content of these messages was examined using the constant comparative method to identify emerging themes found within the message texts. RESULTS: Out of a total of 557,024 patients, 4079 (0.73%) sent a message during Hurricane Harvey, whereas 31,737 (5.69%) used the portal. Age, sex, race, and ethnicity were predictive factors for using the portal and sending a message during the natural disaster. We found that prior use of the patient portal increased the likelihood of portal use during Hurricane Harvey (odds ratio 13.688, 95% CI 12.929-14.491) and of sending a portal message during the disaster (odds ratio 14.172, 95% CI 11.879-16.907). Having an encounter 4 weeks before or after Hurricane Harvey was positively associated with increased use of the portal and sending a portal message. Patients with encounters during the main Hurricane Harvey week had a higher increased likelihood of portal use across all five encounter types. Qualitative themes included: access, prescription requests, medical advice (chronic conditions, acute care, urgent needs, and Hurricane Harvey-related injuries), mental health, technical difficulties, and provider constraints. CONCLUSIONS: The patient portal can be a useful tool for communication between patients and providers to address the urgent needs and concerns of patients as a natural disaster unfolds. This was the first known study to include encounter data to understand portal use compared with care provisioning. Prior use was predictive of both portal use and message sending during Hurricane Harvey. These findings could inform the types of demands that may arise in future disaster situations and can serve as the first step in intentionally optimizing patient portal usability for emergency health care management during natural disasters.","Baek, Juha; Simon-Friedt, Bridget; Lopez, Adriana; Kolman, Jacob M; Nicolas, Juan; Jones, Stephen L; Phillips, Robert A; Menser, Terri","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/31264","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e31264, 2021 09 01.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e31264, 2021 09 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20423,""
"Effectiveness of an Internet-Based Machine-Guided Stress Management Program Based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Improving Depression Among Workers: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: The effect of an unguided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) stress management program on depression may be enhanced by applying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to guide participants adopting the program. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe a research protocol to investigate the effect of a newly developed iCBT stress management program adopting AI technologies on improving depression among healthy workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study is a two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Participants (N=1400) will be recruited, and those who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control (treatment as usual) group. A 6-week, six-module, internet-based stress management program, SMART-CBT, has been developed that includes machine-guided exercises to help participants acquire CBT skills, and it applies machine learning and deep learning technologies. The intervention group will participate in the program for 10 weeks. The primary outcome, depression, will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory II at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. A mixed model repeated measures analysis will be used to test the intervention effect (group Ã— time interactions) in the total sample (universal prevention) on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: The study was at the stage of recruitment of participants at the time of submission. The data analysis related to the primary outcome will start in January 2022, and the results might be published in 2022 or 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the effectiveness of a fully automated machine-guided iCBT program for improving subthreshold depression among workers using a randomized controlled trial design. The study will explore the potential of a machine-guided stress management program that can be disseminated online to a large number of workers with minimal cost in the post-COVID-19 era.

"Assessing the Care Modality Preferences and Predictors for Digital Mental Health Treatment Seekers in a Technology-Enabled Stepped Care Delivery System: Cross-sectional Study","BACKGROUND: Access to mental health services continues to be a systemic problem in the United States and around the world owing to a variety of barriers including the limited availability of skilled providers and lack of mental health literacy among patients. Individuals seeking mental health treatment may not be aware of the multiple modalities of digital mental health care available to address their problems (eg, self-guided and group modalities, or one-to-one care with a provider). In fact, one-to-one, in-person treatment is the dominant care model with a masters- or doctoral-level trained mental health provider, and it may or may not be the appropriate or preferred level of care for an individual. Technology-enabled mental health platforms may be one way to improve access to mental health care by offering stepped care, but more research is needed to understand the care modality preferences of digital mental health care seekers because additional modalities become increasingly validated as effective treatment options. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe and evaluate the predictors of care modality preferences among individuals enrolled in a technology-enabled stepped mental health care platform. METHODS: This exploratory, cross-sectional study used employee data from the 2021 Modern Health database, an employer-sponsored mental health benefit that uses a technology-enabled platform to optimize digital mental health care delivery. Chi-square tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to evaluate associations among the categorical and continuous factors of interest and the preferred care modality. Bivariate logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of preferring a one-on-one versus self-guided group, or no preference for digital mental health care modalities. RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 3661 employees. The most common modality preference was one-on-one care (1613/3661, 44.06%). Approximately one-fourth of the digital mental health care seekers (881/3661, 24.06%) expressed a preference for pursuing self-guided care, and others (294/3661, 8.03%) expressed a preference for group care. The ORs indicated that individuals aged 45 years and above were significantly more likely to express a preference for self-guided care compared to individuals aged between 18 and 24 years (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.70-3.59; P<.001). Individuals screening positive for anxiety (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.86; P<.001) or depression (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.95; P=.02) were more likely to prefer one-on-one care. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings elucidated that care modality preferences vary and are related to clinical severity factors and demographic variables among individuals seeking digital mental health care.","Kozlov, Elissa; McDarby, Meghan; Prescott, Maximo; Altman, Myra","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/30162","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e30162, 2021 Sep 15.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e30162, 2021 Sep 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20425,""
"Virtual Reality for Supporting the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety: Scoping Review","BACKGROUND: Mental health conditions pose a major challenge to health care providers and society at large. The World Health Organization predicts that by 2030, mental health conditions will be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide. The current need for mental health care is overwhelming. In New Zealand, 1 in 6 adults has been diagnosed with common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety disorders, according to a national survey. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to effectively help patients overcome a wide variety of mental health conditions. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) might be one of the most exciting technologies emerging in the clinical setting for the treatment of anxiety and depression. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the virtual reality (VR) technologies currently being used to help support the treatment of depression and anxiety. We also aim to investigate whether and how CBT is included as part of VRET and look at the VR technologies and interventions that have been used in recent studies on depression and anxiety. METHODS: We performed a scoping review. To identify significant studies, we decided to use already aggregated sources from the Google Scholar database. Overall, the goal of our search strategy was to limit the number of initial results related to VR in mental health to only a relevant minimum. RESULTS: Using our defined keywords, Google Scholar identified >17,300 articles. After applying all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified a total of 369 articles for further processing. After manual evaluation, 34 articles were shortlisted; of the 34 articles, 9 (26%) reported the use of CBT with VR. All of the articles were published between 2017 and 2021. Out of the 9 studies, CBT was conducted within a VR environment in 5 (56%) studies, whereas in the remaining 4 (44%) studies, CBT was used as an addition to VRET. All 9 studies reported the use of CBT either in vivo or in a virtual environment to be effective in supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies demonstrated the use of VR to be effective for supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression in a range of settings and recommended its potential as a tool for use in a clinical environment. Even though standalone headsets are much easier to work with and more suitable for home use, the shift from tethered VR headsets to standalone headsets in the mental health environment was not observed. All studies that looked at the use of CBT either in vivo or in a virtual environment found it to be effective in supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression.","Baghaei, Nilufar; Chitale, Vibhav; Hlasnik, Andrej; Stemmet, Lehan; Liang, Hai-Ning; Porter, Richard","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29681","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(9): e29681, 2021 Sep 23.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(9): e29681, 2021 Sep 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20426,""
"Health Care Provider Perspectives on the Use of a Digital Behavioral Health App to Support Patients: Qualitative Study","BACKGROUND: Despite the growing evidence indicating the efficacy of digital cognitive behavioral interventions (dCBIs) for behavioral health (BH) treatment, broad and consistent use of such interventions has been limited by knowledge obtained in real-world settings, including factors that impact provider uptake/referral. Engaging providers early in the implementation process offers an opportunity to explore their needs and behaviors, integrate interventions into workflows, and better understand provider setting capabilities. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed providers' views on the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app in multiple care settings. METHODS: Participating providers included BH and physical health (PH) providers from a women's health center, an outpatient BH clinic, and both rural/urban primary care settings. All participating providers cocreated workflows through facilitated workshops, including establishing feedback loops between the project team and providers and identifying clinical champions at each site. Over a 12-week period, the providers referred adult patients experiencing anxiety or depression to a mobile app-based dCBI, RxWell, and provided other indicated treatments as part of usual care. Referrals were completed by the providers through the electronic medical record. To better understand facilitators of and challenges in integrating RxWell into routine practice and perceptions of sustainability, a series of qualitative interviews was conducted. Interview data were analyzed to identify major themes using an inductive content analysis approach. RESULTS: A total of 19 provider interviews were conducted to discover motivators and barriers for referring RxWell. The providers benefited from a focused discussion on how to incorporate the referral process into their workflow, and knowing the app content was rooted in evidence. Although the providers believed engaging in experiential learning was important, they indicated that more education on the digital health coach role and how to monitor patient progress is needed. The providers thought patient engagement may be impacted by motivation, a lack of comfort using a smartphone, or preference for in-person therapy. The providers also expressed enthusiasm in continuing to refer the app. They liked the ability to provide patients with support between sessions, to have an extra treatment option that teaches BH exercises, and to have a CBT treatment option that overcomes barriers (eg, wait times, copays, travel) to traditional therapy modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Digital intervention success in health care settings relies heavily on engagement of key stakeholders, such as providers, in both design and implementation of the intervention and focused evaluation within intended care setting(s). Scaling digital interventions to meet the mental health needs of patients in usual care settings leans on thoughtfully constructed and streamlined workflows to enable seamless referral of patients by providers. Our findings strongly suggest that providers are supportive of digital tool integration to support the mental health of patients and endorse its use within their routine workflow.","Silfee, Valerie; Williams, Kelly; Leber, Brett; Kogan, Jane; Nikolajski, Cara; Szigethy, Eva; Serio, Catherine","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/28538","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e28538, 2021 Sep 28.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e28538, 2021 Sep 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20427,""
"Smartphone Technology to Empower People Experiencing Homelessness: Secondary Analysis","BACKGROUND: In the United States, the number of people experiencing homelessness has continually increased over the last 3 years. Homelessness is associated with poor health, and people experiencing homelessness are often burdened with high rates of chronic and mental health conditions, functional limitations, and cognitive impairment. Despite the high burden of chronic illness and functional limitations, there is limited literature exploring self-management among homeless populations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate how access to smartphone technology facilitates self-management, including the attainment of social needs within the context of homelessness. METHODS: A secondary analysis of 33 exit interviews from 2 feasibility studies related to mobile health interventions among people experiencing homelessness was conducted. Iterative thematic analysis was used to identify themes representative of participants' experiences using smartphone technology. RESULTS: Collectively, participants revealed not only how the context of homelessness constrained their ability to engage in activities necessary to self-manage health and meet social needs but also how consistent and predictable access to the tools available through a smartphone changed their behaviors and outlook. The global theme of empowered by technology was identified and defined as how having a smartphone with a plan for unlimited text, calling, data, and transportation allowed participants to navigate homelessness and facilitated self-management. CONCLUSIONS: People experiencing homelessness used the tools on a smartphone to make decisions, take action, solve problems, and use the resources-skills necessary for fulfilling tasks required for effective self-management. Further, consistent access to smartphone technology and transportation empowered participants to meet the requirements for the attainment of social needs.","Thurman, Whitney; Semwal, Monika; Moczygemba, Leticia R; Hilbelink, Mark","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/27787","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e27787, 2021 09 29.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e27787, 2021 09 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20428,""
"Evaluation of a Commercial Mobile Health App for Depression and Anxiety (AbleTo Digital+): Retrospective Cohort Study","BACKGROUND: Digital solutions, such as web-based and mobile interventions, have the potential to streamline pathways to mental health services and improve access to mental health care. Although a growing number of randomized trials have established the efficacy of digital interventions for common mental health problems, less is known about the real-world impact of these tools. AbleTo Digital+, a commercially available mental health app for depression and anxiety, offers a unique opportunity to understand the clinical impact of such tools delivered in a real-world context. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to examine the magnitude of change in depression and anxiety symptoms among individuals who used AbleTo Digital+ programs. The secondary aim is to evaluate Digital+ module completion, including the use of 1:1 coaching. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed previously collected and permanently deidentified data from a consecutive cohort of 1896 adults who initiated using one of the three Digital+ eight-module programs (depression, generalized anxiety, or social anxiety) between January 1 and June 30, 2020. Depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms were assessed within each program using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Social Phobia Inventory, respectively. Linear mixed effects models were built to assess the association between module completion and symptom change among users who completed at least four modules and had at least mild baseline symptom elevations, controlling for age, gender, and baseline symptom severity. Digital+ use, including module completion, 1:1 coaching calls, and in-app coach messaging, was also evaluated. RESULTS: Significant effects were observed among depression (Cohen d=1.5), generalized anxiety (Cohen d=1.2), and social anxiety (Cohen d=1.0) program participants who completed at least four modules and had mild baseline elevations (n=470). Associations between module completion and change in depression (ÃŸ=-1.2; P<.001), generalized anxiety (ÃŸ=-1.1; P<.001), and social anxiety (ÃŸ=-2.4; P<.001) symptom scores retained significance with covariate adjustment. Participants completed an average of 2.6 (SD 2.7) modules. The average total length of app use was 52.2 (SD 83.5) days. Approximately two-thirds of the users engaged in at least 1 coaching call (66.82%, 1267/1896) or in-app text messaging (66.09%, 1253/1896). Participants who completed at least four modules participated in significantly more coaching calls per module (mean 1.1, SD 0.7) than users who completed fewer than four modules (mean 1.0, SD 1.2; t1407=-2.1; P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that AbleTo Digital+ users experienced significant reductions in depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms throughout the program.","Anton, Margaret T; Greenberger, Heidi Mochari; Andreopoulos, Evie; Pande, Reena L","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/27570","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e27570, 2021 Sep 21.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e27570, 2021 Sep 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20429,""
"The Psychological Experience of Frontline Perioperative Health Care Staff in Responding to COVID-19: Qualitative Study","BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has presented immeasurable challenges to health care workers who remain at the frontline of the pandemic. A rapidly evolving body of literature has quantitatively demonstrated significant psychological impacts of the pandemic on health care workers. However, little is known about the lived experience of the pandemic for frontline medical staff. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the qualitative experience of perioperative staff from a large trauma hospital in Melbourne, Australia. METHODS: Inductive thematic analysis using a critical realist approach was used to analyze data from 9 semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified. Hospital preparedness related to the perceived readiness of the hospital to respond to the pandemic and encompassed key subthemes around communication of policy changes, team leadership, and resource availability. Perceptions of readiness contributed to the perceived psychological impacts of the pandemic, which were highly varied and ranged from anger to anxiety. A number of coping strategies were identified in response to psychological impacts which incorporated both internal and external coping mechanisms. Finally, adaptation with time reflected change and growth over time, and encompassed all other themes. CONCLUSIONS: While frontline staff and hospitals have rapidly marshalled a response to managing the virus, relatively less consideration was seen regarding staff mental health in our study. Findings highlight the vulnerability of health care workers in response to the pandemic and reinforce the need for a coordinated approach to managing mental health.","Withiel, Toni; Barson, Elizabeth; Ng, Irene; Segal, Reny; Williams, Daryl Lindsay Goulding; Krieser, Roni Benjamin; Lee, Keat; Mezzavia, Paul Mario; Sindoni, Teresa; Chen, Yinwei; Fisher, Caroline Anne","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/27166","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Perioper Med;4(2): e27166, 2021 Sep 29.; Publication details: JMIR Perioper Med;4(2): e27166, 2021 Sep 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20430,""
"Recovery Following Peer and Text Messaging Support After Discharge From Acute Psychiatric Care in Edmonton, Alberta: Controlled Observational Study","BACKGROUND: Peer support is an emotional, social, and practical help provided by nonprofessionals to assist others in sustaining health behaviors. Peer support is valued in recovery-oriented models of mental health and is becoming increasingly implemented at the organizational level. Text messaging is a relatively low-cost, high-impact, and easily scalable program that uses existing technology, is devoid of geographic barriers, and is easily accessible to end users. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative peer support system plus a supportive text messaging program on the recovery of discharged patients from acute psychiatric care. METHODS: This prospective, rater blinded, controlled observational study included 181 patients who were discharged from acute psychiatric care. Patients were randomized to one of four conditions: treatment as usual (follow-up care), daily supportive text messages only, peer support only, or peer support plus daily supportive text messages. A standardized self-report measure of recovery (Recovery Assessment Scale [RAS]) was completed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Descriptive analysis, one-way analysis of variance, and repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance were used to examine the changes in the RAS among the study groups and over the follow-up time points. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients completed the assessments at each time point. For the overall sample, higher scores were found for the peer support plus text message condition compared with the text message only and treatment as usual condition on several scales (ie, willingness to ask for help and personal confidence and hope) and total score on the RAS, after 6 months of intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Peer support plus supportive text messaging seems to result in improved recovery compared with other interventions. It may be advisable to incorporate the two interventions as part of routine practice for patients with psychiatric disorders upon hospital discharge.","Shalaby, Reham; Hrabok, Marianne; Spurvey, Pamela; Abou El-Magd, Rabab M; Knox, Michelle; Rude, Rebecca; Vuong, Wesley; Surood, Shireen; Urichuk, Liana; Snaterse, Mark; Greenshaw, Andrew J; Li, Xin-Min; Agyapong, Vincent Israel Opoku","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/27137","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e27137, 2021 Sep 03.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e27137, 2021 Sep 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20431,""
"The Association Between Patients' eHealth Literacy and Satisfaction With Shared Decision-making and Well-being: Multicenter Cross-sectional Study","BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have shown that a high level of health literacy can improve patients' ability to engage in health-related shared decision-making (SDM) and improve their quality of life, few studies have investigated the role of eHealth literacy in improving patient satisfaction with SDM (SSDM) and well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the relationship between patients' eHealth literacy and their socioeconomic determinants and to investigate the association between patients' eHealth literacy and their SSDM and well-being. METHODS: The data used in this study were obtained from a multicenter cross-sectional survey in China. The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) and Investigating Choice Experiments Capability Measure for Adults were used to measure patients' eHealth literacy and capability well-being, respectively. The SSDM was assessed by using a self-administered questionnaire. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare the differences in the eHEALS, SSDM, and Investigating Choice Experiments Capability Measure for Adults scores of patients with varying background characteristics. Ordinary least square regression models were used to assess the relationship among eHealth literacy, SSDM, and well-being adjusted by patients' background characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 569 patients completed the questionnaire. Patients who were male, were highly educated, were childless, were fully employed, were without chronic conditions, and indicated no depressive disorder reported a higher mean score on the eHEALS. Younger patients (SSDM&#8805;61 years=88.6 vs SSDM16-30 years=84.2) tended to show higher SSDM. Patients who were rural residents and were well paid were more likely to report good capability well-being. Patients who had a higher SSDM and better capability well-being reported a significantly higher level of eHealth literacy than those who had lower SSDM and poorer capability well-being. The regression models showed a positive relationship between eHealth literacy and both SSDM (ÃŸ=.22; P<.001) and well-being (ÃŸ=.26; P<.001) after adjusting for patients' demographic, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and health status variables. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that patients with a high level of eHealth literacy are more likely to experience optimal SDM and improved capability well-being. However, patients' depressive status may alter the relationship between eHealth literacy and SSDM.","Xu, Richard Huan; Zhou, Ling-Ming; Wong, Eliza Lai-Yi; Wang, Dong","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26721","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e26721, 2021 09 24.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e26721, 2021 09 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20432,""
"A Social Media Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention to Prevent Depression in Perinatal Youth: Stakeholder Interviews and Intervention Design","BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults aged <25 years (youth) are at a higher risk of perinatal depression than older adults, and they experience elevated barriers to in-person care. Digital platforms such as social media offer an accessible avenue to deliver group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to perinatal youth. OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop the Interactive Maternal Group for Information and Emotional Support (IMAGINE) intervention, a facilitated social media group CBT intervention to prevent perinatal depression in youth in the United States, by adapting the Mothers and Babies (MB) course, an evidence-based in-person group CBT intervention. In this study, we report perspectives of youth and health care providers on perinatal youths' mental health needs and document how they informed IMAGINE design. METHODS: We conducted 21 semistructured in-depth individual interviews with 10 pregnant or postpartum youths aged 14-24 years and 6 health care workers. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using deductive and inductive approaches to characterize perceptions of challenges and facilitators of youth perinatal mental health. Using a human-centered design approach, stakeholder perspectives were incorporated into the IMAGINE design. We classified MB adaptations to develop IMAGINE according to the Framework for Modification and Adaptation, reporting the nature, timing, reason, and goal of the adaptations. RESULTS: Youth and health care workers described stigma associated with young pregnancy and parenting, social isolation, and lack of material resources as significant challenges to youth mental wellness. They identified nonjudgmental support, peer companionship, and access to step-by-step guidance as facilitators of youth mental wellness. They endorsed the use of a social media group to prevent perinatal depression and recommended that IMAGINE facilitate peer support, deliver content asynchronously to accommodate varied schedules, use a confidential platform, and facilitate the discussion of topics beyond the MB curriculum, such as navigating support resources or asking medical questions. IMAGINE was adapted from MB to accommodate stakeholder recommendations and facilitate the transition to web-based delivery. Content was tailored to be multimodal (text, images, and video), and the language was shortened and simplified. All content was designed for asynchronous engagement, and redundancy was added to accommodate intermittent access. The structure was loosened to allow the intervention facilitator to respond in real time to topics of interest for youth. A social media platform was selected that allows multiple conversation channels and conceals group member identity. All adaptations sought to preserve the fidelity of the MB core components. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the effect of stigmatization of young pregnancy and social determinants of health on youth perinatal mental health. Stakeholders supported the use of a social media group to create a supportive community and improve access to evidence-based depression prevention. This study demonstrates how a validated intervention can be tailored to this unique group.","Gewali, Anupa; Lopez, Alana; Dachelet, Kristin; Healy, Elise; Jean-Baptiste, Marimirca; Harridan, Holly; Evans, Yolanda; Unger, Jennifer A; Bhat, Amritha; Tandon, Darius; Ronen, Keshet","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26188","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(9): e26188, 2021 Sep 15.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(9): e26188, 2021 Sep 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20433,""
"Closing the Virtual Gap in Health Care: A Series of Case Studies Illustrating the Impact of Embedding Evaluation Alongside System Initiatives","Early decisions relating to the implementation of virtual care relied on necessity and clinical judgement, but there is a growing need for the generation of evidence to inform policy and practice designs. The need for stronger partnerships between researchers and decision-makers is well recognized, but how these partnerships can be structured and how research can be embedded alongside existing virtual care initiatives remain unclear. We present a series of case studies that illustrate how embedded research can inform policy decisions related to the implementation of virtual care, where decisions are either to (1) discontinue (red light), (2) redesign (yellow light), or (3) scale up existing initiatives (green light). Data were collected through document review and informal interviews with key study personnel. Case 1 involved an evaluation of a mobile diabetes platform that demonstrated a mismatch between the setting and the technology (decision outcome: discontinue). Case 2 involved an evaluation of a mental health support platform that suggested evidence-based modifications to the delivery model (decision outcome: redesign). Case 3 involved an evaluation of video visits that generated evidence to inform the ideal model of implementation at scale (decision outcome: scale up). In this paper, we highlight the characteristics of the partnership and the process that enabled success and use the cases to illustrate how these characteristics were operationalized. Structured communication included monthly check-ins and iterative report development. We also outline key characteristics of the partnership (ie, trust and shared purpose) and the process (ie, timeliness, tailored reporting, and adaptability) that drove the uptake of evidence in decision-making. Across each case, the evaluation was designed to address policy questions articulated by our partners. Furthermore, structured communication provided opportunities for knowledge mobilization. Structured communication was operationalized through monthly meetings as well as the delivery of interim and final reports. These case studies demonstrate the importance of partnering with health system decision-makers to generate and mobilize scientific evidence. Embedded research partnerships founded on a shared purpose of system service provided an effective strategy to bridge the oft-cited gap between science and policy. Structured communication provided a mechanism for collaborative problem-solving and real-time feedback, and it helped contextualize emerging insights.","Desveaux, Laura; Budhwani, Suman; Stamenova, Vess; Bhattacharyya, Onil; Shaw, James; Bhatia, R Sacha","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25797","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e25797, 2021 09 03.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e25797, 2021 09 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20434,""
"Investigating Viewership of Season 3 of ""13 Reasons Why"" and the Mental Wellness of Adolescents: Partially Randomized Preference Trial","BACKGROUND: A conflicting body of research suggests that additional investigation is needed to understand how globally watched television shows featuring social and mental health issues, such as 13 Reasons Why, might affect adolescents' mental wellness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate adolescents' viewership of the third season of the Netflix drama 13 Reasons Why (13RW-3) and their engagement with show-related content, paying special attention to mental health outcomes and conversational partners. METHODS: A panel-based research platform operated by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago recruited 157 adolescents aged 13 to 17 years from its nationally representative pool of participants. Participants answered questions about how they discussed and learned about social and mental health issues portrayed in 13RW-3 (eg, masculine role pressure and sexual assault) and questions about mental wellness (eg, mental health self-efficacy and depression). After the participants completed the survey (T1), they were directed to either watch 13RW-3 as it aired for the first time (intervention group) or not watch 13RW-3 (control group). Approximately one month later (T2), all the participants were asked to complete the postsurvey. Additional survey questions about conversational partners, information seeking because of watching the show, and use of show-related content were included in the intervention postsurvey. RESULTS: Our sample (N=157) was 52.2% (n=82) female and 54.8% (n=86) White, with a mean age of 14.99 (SD 1.4) years. At T2, viewers of 13RW-3 spoke about suicide significantly more frequently than nonviewers (P=.007). From T1 to T2, viewers increasingly discussed issues explored by 13RW-3 (P=.002), especially suicide, mental health, and bullying. Adolescent viewers were most likely to speak with friends, and parents were the second most commonly named. Two variables emerged as consistent moderators of conversational choices-having depressive symptoms and being impacted by sexual assault. There was no association between conversational frequency and information seeking around social and mental health issues, and neither mental health self-efficacy scores nor masculine role pressure scores significantly differed between viewers and nonviewers at T2. CONCLUSIONS: Viewing 13RW-3, a globally watched television show featuring social and mental health issues, led to adolescent conversations and information searches about topics explored by the show. Depressive symptoms and the impact of sexual assault moderated several relationships, guiding participants toward engaging with certain issues and seeking out specific conversational partners. As 13RW-3's stories drove conversations-and story-driven conversations can raise awareness, reduce stigma, shift attitudes, normalize certain behaviors, and strengthen supportive relationships-potential wellness implications for television shows featuring social and mental health issues are considerable.","Uhls, Yalda T; Felt, Laurel; Wartella, Ellen; Sanders, Andrew","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25782","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(9): e25782, 2021 Sep 15.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(9): e25782, 2021 Sep 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20435,""
"Health Behavior Survey Among People Who Use Opioids: Protocol for Implementing Technology-Based Rapid Response Surveillance in Community Settings","BACKGROUND: In 2018, 2 million Americans met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition diagnostic criteria for an opioid use disorder, and 9.9 million Americans had misused prescription pain relievers the previous year. Despite a rapid increase in opioid misuse, opioid use disorders, and overdoses, data are limited on the behavioral and contextual risks as well as the protective factors fueling the opioid epidemic in some hard hit US cities-Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas. Opioid use also contributes to the risk of other health problems such as HIV and hepatitis C virus infections or mental health disorders and is linked to behavioral and environmental risks (eg, homelessness, experiences of violence, involvement in the justice system). Knowledge of the relationships between these linked vulnerabilities and how they influence service utilization is critical to effective policy and interventions. OBJECTIVE: This survey explores the relationships between demographic and economic characteristics, behavioral and environmental risk factors, and service utilization of people who use opioids to inform public health practice, policy, and future efforts to mitigate the risks faced by this population experiencing multiple health, social, and economic vulnerabilities. The results of this survey will be used to identify needs and intervention points for people who use drugs currently served by public health organizations. METHODS: We implemented a community-engaged strategy that involved development and execution of a two-stage purposive sampling plan involving selection of partner organizations (syringe exchange programs in urban settings) and recruitment and enrollment of participants aged 18-69 years served by these organizations in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas from 2019 to 2020. The recruited participants completed a survey, including a variety of measures to assess health (physical and mental) and health behaviors such as sexual behavior, vaccine receipt, and HIV/ hepatitis C virus infection testing. Additional items assessed drug use and misuse, syringe exchange and health service utilization, sex exchange, histories of interpersonal violence, and vaccine confidence. RESULTS: This protocol was successfully implemented despite challenges such as real-time technology issues and rapidly finding and surveying a difficult-to-reach population. We sampled 1127 unique participants (248 in Atlanta, 465 in Los Angeles, and 414 in Las Vegas). CONCLUSIONS: The establishment and utilization of strong community partnerships enabled the rapid collection of data from a typically difficult-to-reach population. Local efforts such as these are needed to develop policies and practices that promote harm reduction among people who use opioids.

"Effects of COVID-19-related life changes on mental health in Syrian refugees in Turkey","Background: Mental disorders are currently the greatest global health burden. The coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having an adverse impact on people's mental health, particularly in vulnerable populations, such as refugees. Aims: The present study was designed to examine the association between COVID-19 and changes in mental health in Syrian refugees in Turkey. Method: We conducted a two-wave panel survey of a representative sample of 302 of the estimated 500 000 Syrian refugees (ages 18 and older) living under humanitarian support in Istanbul (first wave between 9 and 15 July 2020 and the follow-up between 11 and 14 September 2020). We administered seven items from the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey in addition to one-context specific item about life changes because of COVID-19, and measures of depression (10-item Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale, CESD-10), anxiety (6-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI-6) and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-4). Results: A factor analysis yielded three COVID-19 factors, labelled 'social relationships', 'stress' and 'hope.' We conducted a series of cross-lag panel analyses to test associations between the COVID-19 factors and mental health. We found associations between all COVID-19 factors and CESD-10, between COVID-19 'stress' and STAI-6, and between COVID-19 'stress' and COVID-19 'hope' and PSS-4. Conclusions: Our measures of life changes because of the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with changes in the mental health of Syrian refugees living in Istanbul. It is therefore important that they are provided with services to reduce what may be particularly debilitating consequences of COVID-19.","Bernardi, Luca; Gotlib, Ian H; Zihnioglu, Ã–zge","https://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1009","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BJPsych Open;7(6): e182, 2021 Nov.; Publication details: BJPsych Open;7(6): e182, 2021 Nov.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20437,""
"Is talk cheap? Correspondence between self-attributions about changes in drinking and longitudinal changes in drinking during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","BACKGROUND: There are concerns that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase drinking, but most accounts to date are cross-sectional studies of self-attributions about alcohol-related impacts and the accuracy of those perceptions has not been investigated. The current study examined the correspondence between self-attributions of pandemic-related changes in drinking and longitudinally-measured changes in drinking and alcohol-related consequences in a sample of emerging adults. METHODS: In an existing ongoing longitudinal study on alcohol misuse (&#8805;1 heavy episodic drinking day/month) in emerging adults, 473 individuals (Mage Â =Â 23.8; 41.7% male) received a supplemental assessment from June 17th to July 1st, 2020, during public health restrictions in Ontario, Canada. These intrapandemic data were matched to the most recent assessment prior to the pandemic (~8Â months earlier). Self-attributions about changes in drinking were assessed globally (i.e., increases/decreases/no change) and with higher resolution questions clarifying the magnitude of changes. RESULTS: Global self-attributions about changes in drinking substantively paralleled longitudinal changes in weekly drinking days (DD). In the longitudinal data, individuals' who self-reported increases in drinking exhibited significant increases; individuals' who self-reported decreases exhibited significant decreases; and individuals who self-reported no change exhibited nonsignificant changes. Higher resolution items likewise revealed longitudinal patterns of weekly drinking that were substantively consistent with self-attributions. Heavy DD and alcohol-related consequences exhibited similar patterns, but only individuals who self-reported large increases in drinking exhibited increases on these outcomes. Individuals who reported large increases in drinking also exhibited significant increases in depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Self-attributions about drinking closely corresponded to longitudinal changes in drinking, supporting the validity of self-attributions in population-level surveys, particularly in young adults. Notably, a subgroup was identified that exhibited pronounced increases for all alcohol-related outcomes and concurrent increases in internalizing psychopathology.","Minhas, Meenu; Belisario, Kyla; Gonzalez-Roz, Alba; Halladay, Jillian; Morris, Vanessa; Keough, Matthew; Murphy, James; MacKillop, James","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acer.14724","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Alcohol Clin Exp Res;2021 Sep 30.; Publication details: Alcohol Clin Exp Res;2021 Sep 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20438,""
"Compliance with COVID-19 public health guidelines: an attitude-behaviour gap bridged by personal concern and distance to conspiracy ideation","OBJECTIVE: This study examined predictors of compliance with public health guidelines to curb transmission of COVID-19. DESIGN: Applying an exploratory longitudinal design, participants (N = 431) from Germany and Austria completed surveys in April/May 2020 (T1) and July/August 2020 (T2). MEASURES: Three outcome measures operationalised compliance with public health guidelines at T2: self-reported adherence (behavioural), agreement and opposition (attitudinal). At T1, demographics, perceived distress (PHQ-4, crisis of meaning), resources (self-control, meaningfulness), locus of control, conspiracy mentality and social media use were assessed. At T2, situational variables were added (person at risk, infection of close person, fear of infection, COVID-19 stress). Temporal shifts from T1 to T2 were examined as complementary information. RESULTS: An attitude-behaviour gap at T2 was identified, as agreement with and opposition to the guidelines were only modestly correlated with adherence to them. Measures of personal concern (fear of infection, person at risk) were associated with both adherence and positive attitudes towards the measures. COVID-19 stress and conspiracy mentality predicted negative attitudes, but not adherence. Age predicted adherence positively, social media use negatively. CONCLUSION: The findings support the significance of personal concern for compliance with public health guidelines and suggest a critical impact of social media use and conspiracy mentality.","Schnell, Tatjana; SpitzenstÃ¤tter, Daniel; Krampe, Henning","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.1974861","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Health;: 1-22, 2021 Sep 28.; Publication details: Psychol Health;: 1-22, 2021 Sep 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20439,""
"Sociodemographic and environmental health risk factor of COVID-19 in Jakarta, Indonesia: An ecological study","Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly emerged on a global scale. Many factors have influenced the spread of COVID-19. This research studies the sociodemographic and environmental health risk factors associated with COVID-19. The study used an ecological study design with subdistricts as its unit of analysis. The total population was 44 subdistricts. Data analysis used correlation and linear regression tests. The study results showed that the average COVID-19 incident rate in Jakarta is 99.8 per 10,000 population. Risk factors for the spread of COVID-19 were associated with population's high level of education (BÂ =Â 3.094, p value<0.001), population density (BÂ =Â 0.275, p valueÂ =Â 0.029), and slum area (BÂ =Â 0.404, p value<0.001). The main risk factor for the spread of COVID-19 in Jakarta is high level of education, which can reflect a higher economic status to the population and a tendency to be more mobile. The government needs to enforce a mobility restriction to lessen the spread of COVID-19.","Adzania, Fajriah Hanika; Fauzia, Sifa; Aryati, Gita Permata; Mahkota, Renti","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100303","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: One Health;13: 100303, 2021 Dec.; Publication details: One Health;13: 100303, 2021 Dec.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20440,""
"Five probable factors responsible for the COVID-associated mucormycosis outbreak in India","The second wave of COVID-19 due to the delta variant (B.1.617.2) led to a rapid rise in total coronavirus and COVID-associated mucormycosis cases reported from India. Hence, our study explored the possible causes of a rapid upsurge in COVID-associated mucormycosis, which has accounted for over 70% of global cases. Factors associated with the increase in mucormycosis cases in COVID-19 patients include diabetes mellitus, steroid overdose, high iron levels, and immunosuppression, combined with other possible factors, such as unhygienic conditions, prolonged hospitalization, use of ventilators, and leaky humidifiers in oxygen cylinders. These create an ideal environment for contracting mucormycosis. However, these cases could be reduced by disseminating simple preventive measures and creating awareness among the medical society and general public of this rare and deadly contagion of COVID-associated mucormycosis. The identification of early symptoms will also help to restrict the spread of lethal fungal diseases. Furthermore, a collaborative team of surgeons, ophthalmologists, physicians, and otolaryngologists would be required in the hospital wards to accelerate surgeries on severely impacted patients.","Ravindra, Khaiwal; Ahlawat, Ajit","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.09.057","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Infect Dis;112: 278-280, 2021 Sep 27.; Publication details: Int J Infect Dis;112: 278-280, 2021 Sep 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20441,""
"Mental Health in COVID-2019 Survivors from a General Hospital in Peru: Sociodemographic, Clinical, and Inflammatory Variable Associations","The current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic constitutes a significant public health problem worldwide, as well as mental health problems. This study aimed to evaluate the mental health of COVID-19 survivors, considering their sociodemographic, clinical, and immune variables. A cross-sectional and correlational study was conducted on 318 COVID-19 survivors from one hospital in Peru. Through telephone interviews, evaluation of the presence of depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, anxiety symptoms through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, somatic symptoms through Patient Health Questionnaire-15, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms through Impact of Event Scale-Revised was carried out. Poisson regression analyses were performed with their adjusted variances to calculate the prevalence ratio (PR) with their 95% confidence interval. All regression models were adjusted (PRa) for follow-up time. A significant proportion of patients have depressive (30.9%), anxious (31.1%), somatic (35.2%), and PTSD (29.5%) symptoms. The variables associated with a higher frequency of clinically relevant mental symptoms were female sex, self-perception of greater COVID-19 severity, presence of persistent COVID-19 symptoms, loss of a family member due to COVID-19, and prior psychiatric diagnosis or treatment. In addition, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly higher in patients with clinically relevant symptoms of depression. COVID-19 survivors showed a high prevalence of negative mental symptoms. Our findings help to identify patients who are vulnerable and require psychiatric care.","Huarcaya-Victoria, Jeff; Barreto, Jessica; Aire, Lucia; PodestÃ¡, Angela; Caqui, MÃ³nica; Guija-Igreda, Rosa; Castillo, Claudia; Alarcon-Ruiz, Christoper A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00659-z","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-22, 2021 Sep 28.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-22, 2021 Sep 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20442,""

A comprehensive and evidence-building approach is needed to prevent, detect and intervene where child maltreatment occurs. This review identifies key challenges in definitions, overviews the latest data on prevalence rates, reviews risk and protective factors, and examines common long-term mental health outcomes for children who experience maltreatment. The review takes a systems approach to child maltreatment outcomes through its focus on the overall burden of disease, gene-environment interactions, neurobiological mechanisms and social ecologies linking maltreatment to mental ill-health. Five recommendations relating to the accurate measurement of trends, research on brain structures and processes, improving the reach and impact of teleservices for detecting, preventing and treating child maladjustment, community-based approaches, and building population-focused multidisciplinary alliances and think tanks are presented.","Mehta, Divya; Kelly, Adrian B; Laurens, Kristin R; Haslam, Divna; Williams, Kate E; Walsh, Kerryann; Baker, Philip R A; Carter, Hannah E; Khawaja, Nigar G; Zelenko, Oksana; Mathews, Ben","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01258-8","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Psychiatry Hum Dev;2021 Sep 29.; Publication details: Child Psychiatry Hum Dev;2021 Sep 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20443,""

"Taking care of the caretaker: navigating compassion fatigue through a pandemic","Nurses and midwives are complaining of extreme exhaustion, emotional distress, and physical anguish from long hours of wearing face masks and other personal protective equipment.2-3 In addition, they fear transmitting the coronavirus disease from the workplace to their family members, which causes some to live away from home.2 Even more distressing for many is the thought of providing high quality patient care, while accommodating for the surge of patients with viral infections, caring for colleagues with COVID-19, and treating patients without family at their side.2 The reality is that many nurses find themselves as the only person at the patient's bedside due to visitor restrictions . Compassion fatigue is the gradual physical and emotional withdrawal experienced by those who take care of traumatised and sick patients.5 Specifically, CF is the intersection of burnout (the response to things at work such as under staffing or bullying caused by excessive and prolonged stress), vicarious trauma (suffering caused by seeing others suffer), and primary traumatic stress (the impact of personal daily stressors, including previous traumas, such as adverse childhood experiences).6-7 It is an extreme state of tension and preoccupation with the suffering of those being helped to the degree that it can create a secondary traumatic stress for the HCP.6 It is estimated that 48-53 percent of nurses experience compassion fatigue, which could be understood as the impact or cost of caring.8 Nurses are known for their ability to alleviate patient suffering, however, lack of effective resources and knowledge of how to effectively treat patients with COVID-19 has left many HCPs feeling powerless to care for the sick and suffering in their care. Currently, there are few support strategies and interventions in healthcare organisations to assist nurses in dealing with sadness, grief, and loss.11 While it is important for HCPs to take ownership of their mental health and wellbeing, employers of HCPs should also take responsibility for their workers.3 Organisational consequences of CF can include reduced patient safety outcomes, negative workforce impacts, and greater costs.12 A more proactive approach to the development of strategies that address the mental health and well-being of HCPs could provide solutions for preventing and reducing CF among HCPs. [...]education can assist HCPs to utilise self-care strategies such as mediation and mindfulness and coping with ethical conflict and dilemmas.11 Workplace interventions are imperative to address the emotional distress nurses and midwives are currently experiencing.1142 Workplaces that offer a multitude of resources to assist healthcare providers with their mental health and wellbeing are considered 'healthy work environments'.","Chatmon, Benita N.

"INDEBTEDNESS IN THE TIME OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC â€“ CASE OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global unprecedented event since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. The IMF addressed this pandemic-caused economic fallout as the worst crisis since the Great Depression. Entire continents are in lockdowns just with essential services and activities. Unlike the global financial crisis that derived from a financial sector, this pandemic-caused crisis is shock in real economy, both on the demand and supply side. During previous crisis, especially during global financial crisis, most governments responded with austerity measures and fiscal consolidation. This time it is different. Governments worldwide approved additional expenditures, tax cuts, government bond issuance and borrowing in order to mitigate economic consequences of the looming crisis. One of the pandemic's result is dramatic increase of indebtedness that could affect efficiency of fiscal and monetary responses created before to fight against crisis. This sudden and strong COVID-10 shock especially effects developing countries and emerging markets, but also advanced countries with already limited fiscal space. The COVID-19 pandemic-caused crisis evoked again fear of debt crisis and expanded a number of countries with indebtedness problems. Bosnia and Herzegovina as developing country with complex state structure and its own macroeconomic, political, institutional problems is not spared of negative effects of the pandemic. In order to save economy when recovery from the previous crisis is still in swing, Bosnia and Herzegovina did emergency measures to support economy. Increase of government spending in addition to reduced tax revenues have created the need for budget rebalance and additional borrowing. The aim of this work is to show macroeconomic situation and problems in the EU countries, countries in the region and especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina before the pandemic as well as current problems, their reactions to COVID-19 pandemic and necessary financial support that could cause increase of indebtedness.","GadÅ¾ic, Mila, Juric, Jelena","https://doi.org/10.17818/DIEM/2021/1.8","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: DIEM: Dubrovnik International Economic Meeting; 6:75-88, 2021.; Publication details: DIEM: Dubrovnik International Economic Meeting; 6:75-88, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20446,""
"Evaluation of Asthma Control Status and Anxiety Level During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Children with Asthma","Objective: We aimed to evaluate asthma control status, drug compliance and anxiety levels of children and their parents who were followed up with the diagnosis of asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: Sixty-seven children aged between 8-12 years diagnosed with asthma and their parents were prospectively recruited to the study. A questionnaire including demographic features such as age, gender, asthma medications and questions about COVID-19 prepared according to a 5-point Likert scale was conducted to the parents. Children completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventories for Children (STAI-C) scales, and childhood asthma control test(c-ACT). Parents also fulfilled STAI scales. Results: The mean age of the patients was 9.5Â±1.2 years, the median follow-up period for asthma (C-ACT) was 36 (21-66) months, and 45 (67.2%) were male. Most of the children were using their asthma medication regularly. Children's STAI-C state and trait anxiety scores showed a statistically significant positive correlation with parents' STAI state and trait anxiety scores. The anxiety levels of parents who thought that they would get the disease and that there would be no effective treatment and vaccine against COVID-19 were found to be higher. Conclusion: During the pandemic period, regular asthma follow-up and drug compliance are very important controlling asthma symptoms in children. Considering the effects of the pandemic in children with asthma, psychosocial evaluations during outpatient controls may have positive effects on children's mental health and disease control.

Methods: Qualitative study grounded in Alfred SchÃ¼tz's social phenomenology in which 20 nurses who work in intensive care units at public and private hospitals were interviewed between July and September 2020. Data were analyzed according to the adopted theoretical-methodological framework and the literature related to the subject.  Results: The interviewed nurses mentioned demands about working conditions, professional recognition and training, and support to physical and mental health, which proved necessary considering the care intensity experienced by these professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Conclusion: Learning the nurses' experiences evidenced the need to adjust to a new way of providing care that included the physical space, new institutional protocols, continuous use of protective equipment, and patients' demand for special care.

"Suicide ideation in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic; IdÃ©es suicidaires au Canada pendant la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19","INTRODUCTION: Many Canadians report decreased mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and concerns have been raised about possible increases in suicide. This study investigates the pandemic's potential impact on adults' suicide ideation. METHODS: We compared self-reported suicide ideation in 2020 versus 2019 by analyzing data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (11 September to 4 December 2020) and the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey. Logistic regression was conducted to determine which populations were at higher risk of suicide ideation during the pandemic. RESULTS: The percentage of adults reporting suicide ideation since the pandemic began (2.44%) was not significantly different from the percentage reporting suicide ideation in the past 12 months in 2019 (2.73%). Significant differences in the prevalence of recent suicide ideation in 2020 versus 2019 also tended to be absent in the numerous sociodemographic groups we examined. Risk factors of reporting suicide ideation during the pandemic included being under 65 years, Canadian-born or a frontline worker; reporting pandemic-related income/job loss or loneliness/isolation; experiencing a lifetime highly stressful/traumatic event; and having lower household income and educational attainment. CONCLUSION: Evidence of changes in suicide ideation due to the pandemic were generally not observed in this research. Continued surveillance of suicide and risk/protective factors is needed to inform suicide prevention efforts.","Liu, Li; Capaldi, Colin A; Dopko, Raelyne L","https://dx.doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.41.11.06","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can;41(11)2021 Sep 27.; Publication details: Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can;41(11)2021 Sep 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20450,""
"Positive mental health and perceived change in mental health among adults in Canada during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic; SantÃ© mentale positive et changement perÃ§u de la santÃ© mentale chez les adultes au Canada pendant la deuxiÃ¨me vague de la pandÃ©mie de COVID 19","INTRODUCTION: Canadian surveys from spring/summer 2020 suggest the prevalence of some positive mental health (PMH) outcomes have declined compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, less is known about the state of PMH during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We compared adults' self-rated mental health (SRMH), community belonging and life satisfaction in Fall 2020 versus 2019 in the overall population and across sociodemographic characteristics using cross-sectional data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (September-December, 2020) and the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey. We also conducted regression analyses to examine which sociodemographic factors were associated with reporting in Fall 2020 that one's mental health was about the same or better compared to before the pandemic. RESULTS: Fewer adults reported high SRMH in Fall 2020 (59.95%) than in 2019 (66.71%) and fewer reported high community belonging in Fall 2020 (63.64%) than in 2019 (68.42%). Rated from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied), average life satisfaction was lower in Fall 2020 (7.19) than in 2019 (8.08). Females, those aged under 65 years, those living in a population centre, and those absent from work due to COVID-19 had lower odds of reporting that their mental health was about the same or better in Fall 2020. CONCLUSION: The PMH of adults was lower during the pandemic's second wave. However, the majority of individuals still reported high SRMH and community belonging. The findings identify certain sociodemographic groups whose mental health appears to have been more negatively impacted by the pandemic. Continued surveillance is important in ensuring mental health builds back better and stronger in Canada after the pandemic.","Capaldi, Colin A; Liu, Li; Dopko, Raelyne L","https://dx.doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.41.11.05","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can;41(11)2021 Sep 27.; Publication details: Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can;41(11)2021 Sep 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20451,""

However, most of these studies were of low-to-moderate quality and many were based on convenience samples or used mental health measures with low validity, or both. Consequently, it has been difficult to draw conclusions. METHODS: Both the 2020 Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (SCMH) and the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) (2015-2019) used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to screen for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults aged 18 or older. The prevalence of MDD was compared between the SCMH and the CCHS. Risk and protective factors for MDD in the SCMH were examined using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Based on SCMH data, 15.2% (95% CI: 14.2-16.2) of Canadians screened positive for MDD. The prevalence of MDD was more than two times higher in the SCMH (during COVID-19) than in the CCHS (predating COVID-19). In bivariate analysis, Canadians reporting five or more COVID-19-related risk factors were close to 30 times more likely to have MDD than those reporting no risk factors. Mastery and a sense of community belonging were protective factors for MDD. CONCLUSION: After remaining stable for two decades, the prevalence of depression among Canadians increased substantially with the onset of COVID-19. Ongoing monitoring of this common condition associated with major morbidity is vital to determine if elevated levels of MDD persist as we progress through and beyond future waves of COVID-19.","Shields, Margot; Tonmyr, Lil; Gonzalez, Andrea; Weeks, Murray; Park, Su-Bin; Robert, Anne-Marie; Blair, Dawn-Li; MacMillan, Harriet L","https://dx.doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.41.11.04","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can;41(11)2021 Sep 27.; Publication details: Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can;41(11)2021 Sep 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20452,""

Existing evidence shows that substance use and related harms differ by gender. Yet, no Canadian study has applied a gendered lens to alcohol and cannabis consumption use during this time. Our objectives were to (1) provide gender-specific prevalence estimates of self-reported increased alcohol and cannabis use; and (2) examine gender-specific associations between sociodemographic and mental health variables and alcohol and cannabis use. METHODS: Using data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health, we calculated nationally representative, gender-specific prevalence estimates and disaggregated them by sociodemographic and mental health variables. Four logistic regression models were used to assess the likelihood of self-reported increased alcohol and cannabis use. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported increase in alcohol use (16.2% women; 15.2% men) and cannabis use (4.9% women; 5.8% men) did not differ by gender. For both genders, income, racialized group membership, working in the past week, being a parent/legal guardian of a child aged under 18 and screening positive for depression and anxiety were associated with increased alcohol use. Men and women who were between the ages of 18 to 44, screened positive for depression, or both, were more likely to report increased cannabis use. For women, education was significantly associated with increased alcohol use. For men, being a parent/legal guardian was significantly associated with lower odds of increased cannabis use. CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic factors, as well as depression and anxiety, were similarly associated with increased alcohol and cannabis use for both men and women in the second wave of the pandemic.","Hill MacEachern, Kate; Venugopal, Jeya; Varin, MÃ©lanie; Weeks, Murray; Hussain, Nousin; Baker, Melissa M","https://dx.doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.41.11.03","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can;41(11)2021 Sep 27.; Publication details: Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can;41(11)2021 Sep 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20453,""

"Emotional Problems Prior to Adjuvant Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer","BACKGROUND/AIM: Being scheduled for radiotherapy can cause emotional distress. This study aimed to identify risk factors in 338 patients assigned to radiotherapy for breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen potential risk factors including the COVID-19 pandemic were investigated for associations with the six emotional problems included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer. RESULTS: Worry and fears were significantly associated with age &#8804;60 years; sadness with age and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) <90; depression with KPS and Charlson Comorbidity Index &#8805;3; loss of interest with KPS. Trends were found for associations between sadness and additional breast cancer/DCIS, Charlson Index and chemotherapy; between depression and additional breast cancer/DCIS, treatment volume and nodal stage N1-3; between nervousness and additional breast cancer/DCIS, mastectomy and triple-negativity; between loss of interest and Charlson Index, family history of breast cancer/DCIS, invasive cancer, chemotherapy, and treatment volume. The COVID-19 pandemic did not increase emotional problems. CONCLUSION: Several risk factors for emotional problems were identified.

After the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the nurse's mental health has been paid much attention. This study aims to investigate status and influencing factors for anxiety, depression, and insomnia in nurses during the normalized epidemic period, and to further compare the risk of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among nurses at different levels of hospitals between front-line epidemic nurses and other nurses so as to provide a basis for mental health work, nursing management, and relevant study in hospital. METHODS: A total of 4 237 nurses from all levels of hospitals in Hunan Province participated in the survey in December 2020. A self-designed anonymous questionnaire was used in this study. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia were assessed using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to evaluate nurses' anxiety, depression, and insomnia; t-test, analysis of variance, and multiple linear stepwise regression analysis were used to analyze the influencing factors of nurses' anxiety, depression, and insomnia. RESULTS: The scores of GAD-7 among 4 237 nurses were 4.44Â±4.20, with 10.3% of them experienced moderate to severe level anxiety. The scores of PHQ-9 were 6.03Â±4.76, with 17.5% of them experienced moderate to severe level depressive symptom. The scores of ISI were 8.37Â±5.42, with 12.3% of them experienced moderate to severe insomnia. There were significant differences in GAD-7, PHQ-9, and ISI scores among different groups of hospital levels, gender, professional title, position, education level, night shifts, and family monthly income (all P<0.05). Marital status, whether to participate in the front-line, and whether to participate in psychology training groups were not associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia (all P>0.05). Gender, hospital level, professional title, educational background, more night shifts, and family monthly income were the influencing factors for the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores. Gender, length of service, position, hospital level, educational background, night shifts in the last year, and family monthly income were the influencing factors for ISI score. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in the scores of the GAD-7, PHQ-9, and ISI between nurses whether to participate in the front-line, indicating that series of measures for front-line medical staff are effective in China.Meanwhile, some nurses experienced anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and attention should be paid to nurses with low position, more night shifts, lower-level hospitals, and families with low income. It is recommended that management policies, psychological support, and human resource protection should be given to relieve the pressure and maintain the mental health of nurses. At the same time, it is necessary to make mental health knowledge training as a routine training when responding to public health emergencies.","Liang, Mining; Chen, Qiongni; Li, Yamin; Fan, Xiaohui; Wang, Qian; Wang, Jianjian; He, Li; Li, Xuting; Tao, Hongyan; Xie, Lili; Nie, Hanzhu","https://dx.doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2021.210212","","Country: CN; CHINA; CHINA; CHINA; REPUBLIC OF CHINA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban;46(8): 822-830, 2021 Aug 28.; Publication details: Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban;46(8): 822-830, 2021 Aug 28.; COVID-19; Nurses; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Anxiety/epidemiology; Anxiety Disorders/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20456,""

"Exploring the Well-being of Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Prospective Longitudinal Study","BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) have experienced several stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural stressors, including extended work hours, redeployment, and changes in organizational mandates, often intersect with interpersonal and personal stressors, such as caring for those with COVID-19 infections; worrying about infection of self, family, and loved ones; working despite shortages of personal protective equipment; and encountering various difficult moral-ethical dilemmas. OBJECTIVE: The paper describes the protocol for a longitudinal study seeking to capture the unique experiences, challenges, and changes faced by HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study seeks to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of HCWs with a particular focus on moral distress, perceptions of and satisfaction with delivery of care, and how changes in work structure are tolerated among HCWs providing clinical services. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal design is employed to assess HCWs' experiences across domains of mental health (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and well-being), moral distress and moral reasoning, work-related changes and telehealth, organizational responses to COVID-19 concerns, and experiences with COVID-19 infections to self and to others. We recruited HCWs from across Canada through convenience snowball sampling to participate in either a short-form or long-form web-based survey at baseline. Respondents to the baseline survey are invited to complete a follow-up survey every 3 months, for a total of 18 months. RESULTS: A total of 1926 participants completed baseline surveys between June 26 and December 31, 2020, and 1859 participants provided their emails to contact them to participate in follow-up surveys. As of July 2021, data collection is ongoing, with participants nearing the 6- or 9-month follow-up periods depending on their initial time of self-enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol describes a study that will provide unique insights into the immediate and longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of mental health, moral distress, health care delivery, and workplace environment of HCWs. The feasibility and acceptability of implementing a short-form and long-form survey on participant engagement and data retention will also be discussed.

"Practical and Emotional Problems Reported by Users of a Self-guided Digital Problem-solving Intervention During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Content Analysis","BACKGROUND: To better direct assessments and interventions toward the general population during both the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future crises with societal restrictions, data on the types of practical and emotional problems that people are experiencing are needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the types of practical and emotional problems that the general population is experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic and to construct an empirically derived inventory based on the findings. METHODS: A total of 396 participants, recruited among members of the general public in Sweden who were experiencing practical and/or emotional problems during the pandemic, accessed a self-guided digital problem-solving intervention for a period of 1 week to report and solve the problems they experienced. Prior to accessing the intervention, the participants completed a short self-assessment regarding symptoms of depression and anxiety. Content analysis was used to account for the types of problems participants reported. A set of items for an inventory was later proposed based on the problem categories derived from the analysis. RESULTS: A majority of participants had clinically relevant symptoms of either depression or anxiety. The problems reported were categorized as 13 distinct types of problems. The most common problem was difficulty managing daily activities. Based on the categories, a 13-item inventory was proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The 13 types of problems, and the proposed inventory, could be valuable when composing assessments and interventions for the general population during the ongoing pandemic or similar crises with societal restrictions. The most common problem was of a practical nature, indicating the importance of including examples of such problems within assessments and interventions.

"Evaluating Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior of Dentists on HIV/AIDS in West Java, Indonesia, in the COVID-19 Era","Purpose: HIV/AIDS is still a serious public health problem in Indonesia. It has been concerned that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a serious impact on people living with HIV (PLWH). Therefore, dentists remain to have a significant role to play in the overall healthcare delivery to PLWH and reducing new HIV infections. The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of dentists in West Java about HIV/AIDS in the COVID-19 era. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing online questionnaires using a Google form to dentists in West Java. We used the purposive sampling technique to recruit the participants. The questionnaire consists of characteristics of respondents, 13 questions about knowledge, 9 questions about attitudes, and 6 questions about behaviors, which has previously been tested for validity and reliability. Data were analyzed using the Spearman correlation test and the Chi-square test. Results. The Questionnaire was sent to 435 dentists in the West Java region, Indonesia, with the assistance of the Indonesian Dental Association West Java region, to participate in this study. We received completed questionnaires from 209 (48%) respondents. The results of this study showed that 44% of dentists have good knowledge, 53% have a positive attitude, and 53% have positive behavior. No significant relationship was found between knowledge and attitudes (p=0.202) and behavior (p=0.087), but there was a significant relationship between attitudes and behavior (p=0.0001). Conclusion: About half of the dentists in West Java have good knowledge, positive attitudes, and behavior towards HIV/AIDS, but the others lack knowledge, negative attitudes, and behavior. Continuing HIV/AIDS education and training programs for dentists are still needed to keep improving their knowledge and awareness to support disease prevention and control in this COVID-19 era.","Sufiawati, Irna; Rafi, Muhammad Arib; Putri, Fidya Meditia","https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/1901887","","Country: EG; EGITO; EGYPT; EGIPTO; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Dent;2021: 1901887, 2021.; Publication details: Int J Dent;2021: 1901887, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20461,""
"Facilitators of and barriers to buprenorphine initiation for people with opioid use disorder in the emergency department: protocol for a scoping review","INTRODUCTION: Buprenorphine-naloxone is recommended as a first-line agent for the treatment of opioid use disorder. Although initiation of buprenorphine in the emergency department (ED) is evidence based, barriers to implementation persist. A comprehensive review and critical analysis of both facilitators of and barriers to buprenorphine initiation in ED has yet to be published. Our objectives are (1) to map the implementation of buprenorphine induction pathway literature and synthesise what we know about buprenorphine pathways in EDs and (2) to identify gaps in this literature with respect to barriers and facilitators of implementation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a scoping review to comprehensively search the literature, map the evidence and identify gaps in knowledge. The review will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols Extension for Scoping Reviews and guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institution for conduct of scoping reviews. We will search Medline, APA, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase and IBSS from 1995 to present and the search will be restricted to English and French language publications. Citations will be screened in Covidence by two trained reviewers. Discrepancies will be mediated by consensus. Data will be synthesised using a hybrid, inductive-deductive approach, informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research as well as critical theory to guide further interpretation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This review does not require ethics approval. A group of primary knowledge users, including clinicians and people with lived experience, will be involved in the dissemination of findings including publication in peer-reviewed journals. Results will inform future research, current quality improvement efforts in affiliated hospitals, and aide the creation of a more robust ED response to the escalating overdose crisis.","Bozinoff, Nikki; Soobiah, Charlene; Rodak, Terri; Bucago, Christine; Kingston, Katie; Klaiman, Michelle; Poynter, Brittany; Samuels, Glenna; Schoenfeld, Elizabeth; Shelton, Dominick; Kalocsai, Csilla","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053207","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e053207, 2021 Sep 27.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e053207, 2021 Sep 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20462,""

"Insomnia symptoms during the early and late stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background Evidence suggests that the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the prevention/control measures for COVID-19 may cause insomnia during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic in China. However, it is unclear whether insomnia sustains during the later phases of the pandemic. Methods We searched PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and China National Knowledge Infrastructure from the 27th December 2019 to the 2nd February 2021. As early stage studies on COVID-19 pandemic in China were defined as those conducted prior to April 1st, 2020, while late stage studies were those conducted after April 1st, 2020. Results A total of 98 studies with 193,889 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of insomnia symptoms among all populations was 39.1%;the pooled prevalence of insomnia symptoms during the early and late stages of COVID-19 in China were 37.0% (95% CI 34.1-39.9%) and 41.8% (95% CI 33.6-50.0%), respectively. Importantly, there was no significant difference regarding the prevalence of insomnia symptoms between the early and late stages of COVID-19. Meta-regression showed that healthcare workers, COVID-19 patients, patients with chronic medical conditions and patients with mental disorders had a higher prevalence of insomnia symptoms compared to the general population. This association remained significant in healthcare workers and patients with chronic medical conditions after adjusting for age, gender, areas of high or low prevalence of COVID-19 cases, anxiety and depression. Conclusions Over one third of our sample presented insomnia symptoms during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in China. Interestingly, prevalence of insomnia symptoms sustained high during the late stage of the pandemic despite the control of the disease and the amelioration of its adverse effects. Our findings suggest that insomnia symptoms related to COVID-19 appear to persist of over time.","Li, Yun, Chen, Baixin, Hong, Zhuoting, Sun, Qimeng, Dai, Yanyuan, Basta, Maria, Tang, Xiangdong, Qin, Qingsong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.09.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2021.; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20466,""
"Using a Chatbot to Address Psychological Distress Among First Responders","Frontline COVID workers (doctors, nurses, paramedics, law enforcement officers, social workers) have been especially impacted by the pandemic (1). Stigma and fear of job loss often prevent help seeking (2,3). Evidence-based interventions exist but can be hard to navigate, limiting or delaying their timely uptake (4,5). Tools are needed to better identify people in need of treatment and provide care navigation that is timely and tailored to the individuals' needs, preferences, and level of distress and helps to circumnavigate stigma. To address this need, our team is conducting formative and acceptability and feasibility research to inform the development of a chatbot-a conversational interface (e.g. Amazon Alexa) using text or speech in a conversational, human-like manner to deliver information-to screen and refer COVID frontline workers to care. We are conducting interviews with 20 community behavioral health providers, advocates, law enforcement officers, and people living with mental illness. We are then asking 40 naÃ¯ve users to test the prototype chatbot. Feedback from naÃ¯ve users will be integrated into the fully functional chatbot. Simultaneously, we are conducting a national survey with adults to test the feasibility and acceptability of using chatbot technology for behavioral health screening and referral and examine correlates of mental health chatbot use (i.e. demographics, stigma, and technology readiness). The setting of this study is online with frontline COVID responders and general community members. 20 stakeholder interviews, testing with 40 naive users, and feasibility and acceptability testing with 500 national participants. We will ask participants to test a chatbot that will provide screening for distress (PHQ-9) and referral. The chatbot will require about 5 minutes of time to use. Outcome measures related to feasibility and acceptability of the chatbot include willingness to engage with the chatbot and items from the Technology Acceptance Model. Findings will inform modifications to the chatbot and implementation planning. This work will inform the use of chatbots for mental health screening and referral for various populations.

"Verbal Augmented Reality Journaling App: Retention","Research Objectives To determine user retention of a verbally interactive, augmented reality buddy app that conducts daily reflective journaling for improving mental health. Design Observing retention rates of a free mobile application - YOU-AR-OK (YARO) - released through the iOS and Android App stores. YARO verbally guides daily journaling by prompting verbal responses. Setting General Community. Participants The convenience sample of participants were the general public who installed YARO on their mobile device: 2264 using Android and 568 using iOS from November 2nd to March 6th. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Measures are: the proportion of users who kept YARO installed versus uninstalled;the weekly retention rate after installation spike;and the number of users who regularly use the application over one-week timeframes. Results YARO had 568 installations with 95 deletions on iOS and 2264 installations with 1450 deletions on Android, resulting in 83% retention on iOS and 36% on Android. This rate is higher than other apps on iOS and similar to other apps on Android during COVID. On the day of a marketing push, Android installations spiked at 167 while deletions were 41, resulting in 75% retention after the first day of installations. The corresponding weekly Android retention rate was 59%. Daily usage was approximately 36% continuing for approximately one week after the spike. Conclusions YARO performed much better than other apps in the short term but similar to others in the long term. People may have found YARO useful and engaging for the first week, then got bored due to lack of new content and uninstalled. Improving long-term retention and health may involve continually updating the content to ensure users are regularly excited by YARO and engaged, along with gamification and personalization.

"Mobility Clinic COVID-19 Pandemic Patient Outreach Program","To proactively identify risks that may be exacerbated by the pandemic and mitigate them where possible, a primary care outreach program was developed. The screening algorithm was developed by our interdisciplinary Mobility Clinic team, and focuses on 5 domains: health destabilization, mental health, access to services and supports, social isolation, and caregiver stress. The algorithm was administered by phone and any risks identified received further investigation by the team. We used the opportunity to educate patients about the risks of COVID-19 and protective measures. Follow-up continued every 6-8 weeks throughout the duration of the pandemic. The program was developed and implemented in a primary care Mobility Clinic. The algorithm was administered by phone to individuals identified as past and current Mobility Clinic patients. A total of 107 unique patients were contacted, 76 who were male and 31 who were female. 74 patients were identified as having a spinal cord injury (SCI). Not applicable. An evaluation of this outreach program involved a description of the patient population contacted, the identification of common risks for patients, and patient satisfaction with the program. Some of the most common questionnaire responses by patients with SCI included feelings of stress and/or anxiety and a reduction in Personal Support Worker services leading to increased caregiver stress. The outreach program helps us to proactively identify risks for individuals with SCI, including stress, anxiety, and decreased Personal Support Worker services. Through the program, we are able to address these concerns and provide follow-up. Risk assessment and care at the primary care level can mitigate adverse events and hospitalizations, which is especially important during a pandemic situation when healthcare and hospital resources are limited.

"Facilitators for Coping With the COVID-19 Pandemic: Comparing Youth With and Without Disabilities","Research Objectives To understand the facilitators for helping youth with and without disabilities to cope and maintain mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design A descriptive design using in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews with a narrative thematic analysis. Setting Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada which was considered a hot zone for COVID-19 cases and deaths. Participants A purposive sample of 34 youth (17 with a disability;17 without) aged 16-29 (mean age 23.2). Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Interviews with participants Results Our findings revealed several similarities and some differences between youth with and without disabilities regarding facilitators for maintaining mental health during the pandemic. Enablers of coping included: (1) social support, (2) financial support, (3) keeping busy (i.e., having a daily routine, working to keep the mind occupied, volunteering to boost mental health, focusing on school work), and (4) work-life balance (i.e., reduced commute, more time for exercising, going outdoors, cooking, sleeping better, and reflection on life's purpose). Conclusions Our findings highlight how having coping strategies could help youth to deal with pandemic-related stress. Youth with disabilities may need some additional support in accessing resources, exercising and going outdoors to help enhance their coping strategies.

"Employed Care Partners Experienced More Depressive Symptoms During the Coronavirus Pandemic Than Unemployed or Retired Care Partners","To determine differences in depressive symptoms and general anxiety symptoms between working and non-working care partners during the coronavirus pandemic. Survey study. Community. 49 family care partners of individuals with neurological conditions who were employed(n=16), unemployed(n=4) or retired(n=25) during the coronavirus pandemic. N/A. Patient Health Questionnaire(PHQ-8;depressive symptoms), General Anxiety Disorder(GAD-7;general anxiety symptoms). Half(50%) of employed care partners, 37.5% of unemployed care partners, and 40% of retired care partners reported at least moderate depression(PHQ&gt;10). Half(50%) of employed care partners, half(50%) of unemployed care partners, and 32% of retired care partners reported at least moderate anxiety(GAD&gt;11). 69% reported that their responses on the survey were affected by the pandemic, 21% said that were not, and 10% did not respond to this question. A qualitative review of responses to the open-ended question ""how has the pandemic affected you?"" revealed that 11 care partners reported being confined at home, 4 reported social isolation, and 12 endorsed both home confinement and social isolation. Care partners also expressed the pandemic's impact on their work(n=3), depression/boredom of the care recipient and care partner(n=1) and added stress from masking policies in public spaces(n=1). As a result of the preventative measures put in place in response to the pandemic, many care partners faced limitations in their outings and essential errands. Our results indicate a larger proportion of care partners who are employed during the pandemic reported clinically significant depression compared to care partners who are unemployed or retired. This is likely due to care partners having to independently juggle between staying employed, care recipients' needs, and changes to the environment due to the pandemic. In addition, with social distancing measures put in place, care partners have to quickly incorporate these measures on their own to ensure their safety;thus, increasing care partners' workload and stress. Future studies should focus on interventions that would help care partners to be able to manage care recipients' needs, their own needs and other environmental stressors.

"Improving Mental Health Awareness: Recognizing concerning behaviors in patients and family members, and ensuring they receive help","It's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of mental illness and to take action to ensure people experiencing mental health problems receive the assistance and treatment they need. For nurses, this is as true at home as it is at work, particularly so when a person is exhibiting aggressive tendencies or other behaviors that could potentially lead to harm. With the COVID-19 crisis leading many family members to live more closely together for extended periods, nurses should be able to identify concerning behaviors and know what to do if they observe these in their loved ones.

"Telemedicine in the IDF Medical Corps: The Experience of Mental Health Officers Using Remote Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in an attempt to reduce the risk of infection, many mental health care providers in afflicted countries are currently closing their doors for patients who need ambulatory face-to-face therapy. The best solution for continuing mental health treatment in an epidemic is providing mental health care from a distance through telepsychiatry. Given that this is the first time that the Department of Health and Well-being in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is making extensive use of telepsychiatry, a survey has been conducted to examine various aspects of its use by Mental Health Officers (MHOs). Method:136 MHOs (social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists, 64% males, ages 26-47) with varying degrees of experience participated in an online survey conducted in April 2020 and were asked about various aspects of online treatment. Results: More experienced MHOs reported less difficulty using remote therapy and fewer concerns regarding aspects of treatment, compared to less experienced MHOs. Degree of confidence in use of remote therapy was positively correlated with degree of familiarity with patients. Most MHOs reported a positive impact of the remote therapy experience but stated that they prefer to return to face-to-face therapy once the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Conclusions: Training in remote therapy should be provided, especially to less experienced MHOs. Within medical constraints, one should strive to see new patients face-to-face;however, administrative sessions could and should be used remotely to a large extent even in routine times.","Ohayon, O.; Ben Yehuda, A.; Gold, N.; Antonovsky, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Telemedicine+in+the+IDF+Medical+Corps:+The+Experience+of+Mental+Health+Officers+Using+Remote+Therapy+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences; 58(2):3-9, 2021.; Publication details: Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences; 58(2):3-9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20474,""

"[Addicted During Pandemic? - COVID-19 and Addictive Disorders]; Suchtkrank in der Pandemie? Â­ COVID-19 und AbhÃ¤ngigkeitserkrankungen","AIM: To describe changes in consumer behavior, particularly in Germany, and the population groups affected due to in-creased substance use or are at greater risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and are also in danger of suffering from a more severe course of disease. METHODS: The literature search used databases from PubMed and PubPsych, along with expert opinions. RESULTS: A slight increase in daily use of alcohol and tobacco was seen, whereas the consumption of illegal drugs decreased in European countries. There was a drop in consumption among occasional users whereas among intensive users, there was an increase in consumption. Adults and children spent more time on media and internet activities during the pandemic. Anxiety, depression and stress could be the reason for the increased behavorial changes. People already suffering from an addiction were not only psychologically burdened but were also at higher risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection or a severe progression of the disease. CONCLUSION: These results suggest possible societal trends which should be validated by larger representative surveys in the near future. Protecting risk groups and utilizing pandemic-adapted prevention measures are necessary.","Erbas, Beate; Strauch, Hannah","https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1547-6948","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gesundheitswesen;2021 Sep 24.; Publication details: Gesundheitswesen;2021 Sep 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20476,""
"Psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Spain A post lockdown reflection","OBJECTIVES: This multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Spain during lockdown and the first wave of the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A self-report questionnaire that integrated the Spanish version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21) and the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSS) was designed to gather sociodemographic data and information related to the effects of lockdown on the lives of IBD patients. Twelve IBD units invited their patients to answer the anonymous online survey between the 1st July and the 25th August 2020. RESULTS: Of the 693 survey participants with IBD, 67% were women and the mean age was 43 (SD 12). Sixty-one percent had ulcerative colitis, 36% Crohn's disease and 3% indeterminate colitis. DASS-21 scores indicate that during lockdown the estimated prevalence of depression was 11% [95% CI 8.2-13%], anxiety 20% [95% CI 17 to 23%] and stress 18% [95% CI 8.2-13%]. Multivariate analysis showed that the perceived high risk of COVID-19 infection because of having IBD and maladaptation to government measures to reduce the spread of disease doubled the risk of anxiety and stress during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: In the short-term, lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to have an impact on the already affected mental health of our IBD patients in Spain.","HernÃ¡ndez Camba, Alejandro; Ramos, Laura; Madrid Ãlvarez, MarÃ­a Blanca; PÃ©rez-MÃ©ndez, Lina; Nos, Pilar; HernÃ¡ndez, Vicent; Guerra, Ivan; JimÃ©nez, Nuria; Lorente, Rufo; Sierra-AusÃ­n, MÃ³nica; Ginard, Daniel; Varela Trastoy, Pilar; Arranz, Laura; Cabello Tapia, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; Zabana, Yamile; Barreiro-de Acosta, Manuel","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2021.08.007","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gastroenterol Hepatol;2021 Sep 22.; Publication details: Gastroenterol Hepatol;2021 Sep 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20477,""
"The Association Between Substance Use Disorder and Depression During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain and the Moderating Role of Social Support: a Cross-Sectional Study","Substance use disorder is on the rise; it has increased massively during the COVID-19 lockdown and has been found as a risk factor for depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder. Less is known about the hypothetical moderating effect of social support in that association. Three thousand five hundred Spanish adults were interviewed by phone during the COVID-19 lockdown (May-June 2020). The 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) was used to measure the symptoms of depression. The CAGE Adapted to Include Drugs (CAGE-AID) questionnaire was used to assess substance use disorder during the previous month. Social support was measured through the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS-3). Regression models were constructed to assess factors related to depressive symptoms. People with substance use disorder (alcohol and drugs) showed considerable high levels of depressive symptoms, particularly among those with low levels of social support, which reported levels above major depressive disorder cut-off.","Faris, Lydia Hanaa; Gabarrell-Pascuet, Aina; Felez-Nobrega, Mireia; CristÃ³bal-NarvÃ¡ez, Paula; Mortier, Philippe; Vilagut, Gemma; Olaya, Beatriz; Alonso, Jordi; Haro, Josep Maria; LÃ³pez-Carrilero, Raquel; DomÃ¨nech-Abella, Joan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00651-7","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-11, 2021 Sep 27.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-11, 2021 Sep 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20478,""
"Cops and COVID: an examination of California officers' perceptions and experiences while policing during a pandemic","Purpose: Using online survey data from a sample of 440 police officers in California throughout May 2020, the current study collected time-sensitive information on officers' perceptions and departmental experiences in the wake of the pandemic. It examined officers' perceptions of agency responsivity as well as their perceptions of morale, stress and risk following agency responses and changes in policy patterns, service delivery innovations and other administrative challenges. Design/methodology/approach: COVID-19 had a tremendous impact on the law enforcement community, who continued to work and adapt in order to provide public safety. During the first few months of the pandemic, a number of national data collection efforts set out to understand what police agencies, at the organizational-level, were doing to address the crisis. Largely missing from these initial discussions were the perspectives of individual officers, particularly how they felt about their respective departments ensuring safety and balancing risk. Findings: Results from ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions found that the number of departmental changes made in the wake of COVID-19 that reduced policeâ€“public contact was associated with (1) increased levels of perceived agency responsivity to officer needs (i.e. balancing officer safety, taking active steps to maintain officers' mental health) and (2) reduced levels of perceived negative outlook (e.g. stress, low morale, danger/risk). Policy implications and the importance of police executives' decisions during crisis are discussed. Originality/value: This study is one of the first, to the authorsâ€™ knowledge, to examine perceptions of policing during the pandemic from an individual officer point of view rather than an organizational standpoint.

"Strategic transformation to sustilience: learning from COVID-19","Purpose: The authors seek to stimulate and strengthen learning for both institutional and corporate leadership to transform society toward sustainability and resilience. The authors use sustainability in the broader socioecological sense, rather than meaning merely financial survival. Based upon experiences by various parties in dealing with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or (C-19) during 2020 and into 2021, we are all driven to ask, â€œWhich lessons shall we learn?â€ Design/methodology/approach: Based upon a brief review of environmental and management literature, the authors compare experiences with C-19 and those of socio-ecological sustainability to-date and distill both sources for optimism as well as pessimism in the face of technical and socio-political challenges. Findings: Historical experiences are not particularly encouraging, but there are many opportunities for great improvements if institutional and corporate leaders choose to learn from both C-19 experiences and earlier efforts toward sustainability. Practical implications: Procrastination by major industrialized economies in not taking major positive actions to control and reduce carbon pollution and other environmental damage is leading to human crisesâ€“hunger and thirst followed by migration, conflicts and healthcare system collapses. Organizational executives need to develop flexibility and embrace precautionary principles regarding many stakeholders if humanity is going to have a good chance of flourishing in the future. Originality/value: The authors adapt the â€œwedding cakeâ€ model of Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) and their relationships to the concept of â€œdynamic materialityâ€ in both an organizational as well as a macro perspective. In addition, the authors introduce the word sustilience to describe an organization's combined ability to achieve â€œsustainabilityâ€ through relatively stable conditions as well as the â€œresilienceâ€ to rebound after major external shocks.

"Safety and feasibility of trans-venous cardiac device extraction using conscious sedation aloneâ€”Implications for the post-COVID-19 era","Abstract Background Transvenous lead extraction (TLE) for implantable cardiac-devices is traditionally performed under general anesthesia (GA). This can lead to greater risk of exposure to COVID-19, longer recovery-times and increased procedural-costs. We report the feasibility/safety of TLE using conscious-sedation alone with immediate GA/cardiac-surgery back-up if needed. Methods Retrospective case-series of consecutive TLEs performed using conscious-sedation alone between March 2016 and December 2019. All were performed in the electrophysiology-laboratory using intravenous Fentanyl, Midazolam/Diazepam with a stepwise approach using locking-stylets/cutting-sheaths, including mechanical-sheaths. Baseline patient-characteristics, procedural-details and TLE outcomes (including procedure-related complications/death) were recorded. Results A total of 130 leads were targeted in 54 patients, mean ageÂ Â±Â SD 74.6Â Â±Â 11.8years, 47(87%) males;dual-chamber pacemakers (nÂ =Â 26;48%), cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators (nÂ =Â 17;31%) and defibrillators (nÂ =Â 8;15%) were commonest extracted devices. MeanÂ Â±Â SD/median (range) lead-dwell times were 11.0Â Â±Â 8.8/8.3 (0.3-37) years, respectively. Extraction indications included systemic infection (nÂ =Â 23;43%) and lead/pulse-generator erosion (nÂ =Â 27;50%);mean 2.1Â Â±Â 2.0 leads were removed per procedure/mean procedure-time was 100Â Â±Â 54Â min. Local anesthetic (LA) was used for all (mean-dose: 33Â Â±Â 8Â ml 1% lidocaine), IV drug-doses used (meanÂ Â±Â SD) were: midazolam: 3.95Â Â±Â 2.44Â mg, diazepam: 4.69Â Â±Â 0.89Â mg and fentanyl: 57Â Â±Â 40Â Âµg. Complete lead-extraction was achieved in 110 (85%) leads, partial lead-extraction (&lt;4Â cm-fragment remaining) in 5 (4%) leads. Sedation-related hypotension requiring IV fluids occurred in 2 (managed without adverse-consequences) and hypoxia requiring additional airway-management in none. No procedural deaths occurred, one patient required emergency cardiac surgery for localized ventricular perforation, nine had minor complications (transient hypotension/bradycardia/pericardial effusion not requiring intervention). Conclusion TLE undertaken using LA/conscious-sedation was safe/feasible in our series and associated with good clinical outcome/low procedural complications. Reduced risk of aerosolization of COVID-19 and quicker patient recovery/reduced anesthetic risk are potential benefits that warrant further study.","Lachlan, Thomas, He, Hejie, Aggour, Hesham, Sahota, Preet, Harvey, Samuel, Patel, Kiran, Foster, Will, Yusuf, Shamil, Panikker, Sandeep, Dhanjal, Tarv, Dandekar, Uday, Barker, Thomas, Parmar, Jitendra, Kuehl, Michael, Osman, Faizel","https://doi.org/10.1002/joa3.12637","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Journal of Arrhythmia; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Arrhythmia; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20484,""
"A proposal for the creation of a Greek national team for crisis communication management","Emergency and crisis communication management has been documented in the literature as a significant dimension of operational preparedness, particularly in the case of public health crises. Amid the recent Covid-19 pandemic, therefore, the psychological effects of the crisis have prompted international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), to issue recommendations and guidelines on more effective risk and crisis communication. This paper examines the ways in which the Greek authorities handled the communication aspect of the first Covid-19 pandemic wave in the light of its impact on the mental health of Greeks. Emphasis is placed on the importance of operational planning, and an early assessment of the management experience as a whole is attempted, along with estimation of the impact of communication management in the medium term. The multilevel effect of communication in crisis management has been shown to have such a degree of added value that the development of national communication plans is now deemed necessary.

"EFECTELE PANDEMIEI COVID-19 ASUPRA SANATATII SI STARII DE BINE A COPIILOR","Considering the restriction of social interactions and the shift to the online school due to the COVID 19 pandemic, this article highlights the potential harmful consequences of this shift. Based on the results of researches conducted before and during the pandemic, the consequences of social isolation and prolonged use of digital technology by children and adolescents can be serious, affecting their long-term physical, cognitive and socio-emotional development. Numerous studies have shown that the main risks concern: (1) access to online content: addiction, cyberbullying, age-inappropriate information, personal data security issues;(2) lack of physical activity and social interaction: diseases, altered sleep patterns, sedentarism, unhealthy eating habits, obesity, diabetes, anxiety, depression, suicide risk and low social skills in the future. All these should be further researched by redesigning and conceptualising technostress, a concept used to bring together the undesirable effects that occur for adults who use intensively the digital technologies for professional purposes. The comparative research carried out with parents in two secondary Romanian schools has highlighted that parents are still confused, while the socio-economic and educational status of the family influences the emergence of risks related to the online content accessed by children, but not the risks related to social isolation and prolonged use of technology by children.","Rodideal, Anda, Marinescu, Valentina","https://www.google.com/search?q=EFECTELE+PANDEMIEI+COVID-19+ASUPRA+SANATATII+SI+STARII+DE+BINE+A+COPIILOR","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Revista Romana de Sociologie; 32(1/2):57-84, 2021.; Publication details: Revista Romana de Sociologie; 32(1/2):57-84, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20486,""

"[Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection: Clinical assessment and biomechanical functional evaluation one month after hospital discharge]; InfecciÃ³n grave por SARS-CoV-2: valoraciÃ³n clÃ­nica y evaluaciÃ³n funcional biomecÃ¡nica al mes del alta hospitalaria","OBJECTIVE: To describe by an observational cross-sectional study the clinical and functional situation, at one month after hospital discharge, of patients admitted with COVID-19 in the hospital ICU between March and December 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 59 patients were studied using different clinical scales and biomechanical analysis tests (hand dynamometry, fall risk assessment, gait and balance analysis). RESULTS: At one month after discharge, patients reported persistent symptoms: dyspnea (47.5%), arthromyalgia (45%) and cough (22%). In the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire up to 73% of patients reported levels of anxiety or depression. 74.6% and 69.5% presented alterations in the strength of the right and left hand, respectively. The risk of falls in 38% of patients was moderate to very high. The somatosensory index remained within normal parameters, while the vestibular and, to a lesser extent, the visual indexes were altered. In gait, 81.4% of patients showed no abnormalities outside the normal range, with a normal average walking speed. CONCLUSIONS: In the short term after severe COVID-19, patients have persistent symptomatology, anxiety/depression, impaired balance with increased risk of falls and loss of grip strength in both hands.","Ezzeddine Angulo, A; ElÃ­a MartÃ­nez, J M; IÃ±igo Huarte, V; MÃ¡Ã±ez AÃ±Ã³n, I; TenÃ­as Burillo, J M; Peydro de Moya, F","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rh.2021.07.003","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rehabilitacion (Madr);2021 Aug 05.; Publication details: Rehabilitacion (Madr);2021 Aug 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20499,""
"The Benefits of Physical Activity and Positive Mental Health for Reducing the Burden of COVID-19: Validation from a Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Investigation in China and Germany","Many people experience high burden by the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its consequences for health and everyday life. The present cross-national study investigated potential factors that can reduce the burden by COVID-19 in China and Germany. Cross-sectional and longitudinal (China: N = 474, baseline, BL: 2015, follow-up, FU: 2020; Germany: N = 359, BL: 2019, FU: 2020) data on physical activity (e.g., jogging) (BL/FU), positive mental health (PMH) (BL/FU), and burden by COVID-19 (FU) were collected via online surveys. In both countries, physical activity was positively associated with PMH, and both variables were negatively related to burden by COVID-19. Furthermore, PMH mediated the link between physical activity and burden. The mediation model was significant when physical activity and PMH were assessed at the BL, while burden was measured at the FU; and it was also significant when all variables were assessed at the FU. The present findings reveal that physical activity in combination with PMH can reduce the experience of burden by COVID-19. Conscious fostering of physical activity and PMH is supported as an effective strategy to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic outbreak on mental and physical health. Additional benefits such as increased adherence to governmental measures around COVID-19 are discussed.","Brailovskaia, J; Zhang, X C; Cai, D; Lu, S; Gao, Z H; Margraf, J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00653-5","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-14, 2021 Sep 24.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-14, 2021 Sep 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20500,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on nurses: A qualitative study","Coronavirus disease is a serious infectious disease that spread very rapidly. Coronavirus not only impacts the general population but also a thread for health care providers. Besides, it psychologically impacts health care professionals especially nurses. Objectives. To explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses working in corona isolation units. Methodology. A qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological study design. Overall, data were collected from 15 nurses working in tertiary care hospitals of district Nowshera. The study was carried from 1st April 2020 to 20th May 2020. Permission was granted from the District Health Officer of District Nowshera. Keeping the spread of the coronavirus in view, data was collected through semistructured in-depth telephonic interviews. Electronic consent was also granted from all the concerned participants before data collection. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's 7-step method. Results. A total of three themes were generated from the data;Stress, social isolation, and Coping and Self-Care Styles. Nurses working in COVID-19 units experience stress due to constant duty change, fatigue, change in duty placement, and work overload. Also, they experience social isolation due to the fear of getting infected and the disease transmission to their family and other population. Coping and self-care styles such as exercise, physical activity, facing the reality and religious beliefs are important for the nurses to maintain their mental health. Conclusions. The outbreak of COVID-19 psychologically impacts the nurses. Besides, the nurses experience stress and social isolation. The nurses also need coping and self-care styles to maintain their mental health. The role of the health department is very important to highlight this issue and provide proper assistance to the nurses. Â© Danial F., Khattak I.U., 2021.

"Covid 19 pandemic influence on pain clinic patients of â€œlaikonâ€ general hospital of athens","Aim: Aim of study was to record the COVID 19 pandemic impact on pain scores and quality of life in patients with chronic non-malignant pain, during lockdown periods. Material and Methods:119 patients, who have been taken care after â€œLaikonâ€ General Hospital of Athens Pain Clinic, with non-malignant pain under control before COVID 19 pandemic outbreak, were studied. All of them were asked to complete questionnaires from the beginning of the first till the end of second lockdown, where the parameters recorded were pain score, ability to work, relationship with their family, friends, sexual life, psychological status, depression, optimism, and suicidal thoughts in a scale from 1 to 10 every trimester, and results were analysed and studied. All patients completed the same questionnaires according to the period before pandemic, as well. Need for extra analgesicsâ€™ prescription, or medicationsâ€™ modification and supplementary analgesic medication, frequency of their appointments to pain clinic in comparison to the pre-pandemic era were also recorded. Statistical analysis of recorded parameters between the two lockdowns, their interval and pre-pandemic period followed questionnairesâ€™ collection, using <U+03C7>2 method. Results: Most patients from â€œLaikonâ€ General Hospital of Athens Pain clinic, demonstrated statistically significant worsening in recorded parameters, which was attenuated during second lockdown period (raise in recorded pain scores, raise in need for analgesics, need for supplementary antidepressants, and higher frequency of appointments to pain clinic), in comparison to the period before COVID 19 pandemic. Conclusions: People lockdowns caused by COVID 19 pandemic had bad impact to quality of life and pain scores in patients with chronic non-malignant pain, with raise in pain clinic appointmentsâ€™ frequency and modification plus supplementation of pharmaceutical treatment. Further studies, with higher number of patients are necessary to support these findings, hoping of course that no more lockdowns will be needed. Â© 2021, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

"Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 medical area: a systematic review","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a large-scale global epidemic, impacting international politics and the economy. At present, there is no particularly effective medicine and treatment plan. Therefore, it is urgent and significant to find new technologies to diagnose early, isolate early, and treat early. Multimodal data drove artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially be the option. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, AI provided cutting-edge applications in disease, medicine, treatment, and target recognition. This paper reviewed the literature on the intersection of AI and medicine to analyze and compare different AI model applications in the COVID-19 Pandemic, evaluate their effectiveness, show their advantages and differences, and introduce the main models and their characteristics. Methods: We searched PubMed, arXiv, medRxiv, and Google Scholar through February 2020 to identify studies on AI applications in the medical areas for the COVID-19 Pandemic. Results: We summarize the main AI applications in six areas: (I) epidemiology, (II) diagnosis, (III) progression, (IV) treatment, (V) psychological health impact, and (VI) data security. The ongoing development in AI has significantly improved prediction, contact tracing, screening, diagnosis, treatment, medication, and vaccine development for the COVID-19 Pandemic and reducing human intervention in medical practice. Discussion: This paper provides strong advice for using AI-based auxiliary tools for related applications of human diseases. We also discuss the clinicians' role in the further development of AI. They and AI researchers can integrate AI technology with current clinical processes and information systems into applications. In the future, AI personnel and medical workers will further cooperate closely.","Chang, Z. L.; Zhan, Z. Q.; Zhao, Z. F.; You, Z. X.; Liu, Y.; Yan, Z. H.; Fu, Y.; Liang, W.

"Subjective well-being in men and women during the COVID-19 lockdown: A structural mod","Introduction. As a measure for controlling COVID-19, lockdown has had a psychological impact on people. Since subjective well-being (SW) has been positively associated with mental health, the identification of its predictors in this context will enable it to be strengthened. Objective. To generate and test explanatory models for SW in men and women under lockdown due to the pandemic. Method. Four thousand seven hundred and seventy-one inhabitants of Mexico, with paid employment, under lockdown, answered a set of instruments via the Internet that evaluated positive and negative psychological factors in addition to SW. Based on correlation and multiple regression analysis, models were proposed for men and women, which were tested by path analysis. Results. Both models successfully fit the data and explained a high proportion of the SW variance. Spiritual strength was the best predictor, mainly for women, while the capacity for enjoyment was central to the models, mediating the effect of empathy and depression. Discussion and conclusion. SW is significantly predicted by the factors studied, especially spiritual strength and capacity for enjoyment, which seem to provide men and women with fortitude and meaning of life in adverse circumstances such as todayâ€™s.

"Psychosocial and mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown: A rapid qualitative study in migrant shelters at the Mexico-United States border","Introduction. Migrants could be at increased risk of the psychosocial and mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research is needed to assess their needs and the most useful interventions in this regard. Objective. To describe the mental health consequences of the pandemic and lockdown measures among migrants living in shelters in Tijuana, Mexico, during the COVID-19 pandemic, barriers to mental healthcare during this period, and the key elements of psychosocial support provided by civil society organizations (CSOs), as described by sheltersâ€™ staff. Method. In April-May 2020, we conducted a rapid qualitative study through interviews with persons providing services at eight migrant shelters, complementing the information with data from an ongoing ethnographic project. We situated the results within the levels of the United Nationsâ€™ Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) pyramid of psychosocial and mental health support. Results. In addition to fear of contagion and economic insecurity, migrants experienced emotional distress associated with hardening migration policies, and the difficulties of having to find shelter in place in non-private spaces. Some CSOs continued or adapted previous psychosocial support activities, helping migrants navigate these issues, but other activities stopped amidst physical distancing measures and because of limited resources. Migrants themselves implemented some group activities. There was a surge of civil society initiatives of online support, but some shelters laeked the technological and other resources to benefit from them. Discussion and conclusion. Migrants require a tailor made response to their mental health needs in the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the one provided by CSOs Â© 2021, Salud Mental.

"Factors Associated with Nurses' Nursing Intention toward COVID-19 Patients","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the factors related to nurses' intentions toward Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: The participants were 227 nurses, from three hospitals in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, Korea, who cared for patients directly. Based on the theory of planned behavior, nursing intention, key factors, and belief factors were measured using the modified nurses' intention to care for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Anxiety was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and depression by the Korean-Beck Depression Inventory. Data were collected via an online survey and analyzed using multiple regression. Results: The mean of the nursing intention scores for COVID-19 patients was 0.54Â±1.41. The predictors of nursing intention were perceived behavioral control (ÃŸ=.38), attitude toward behavior (ÃŸ=.28), and normative beliefs (8=.13) (Adj. R2=.49, F=27.89, p&lt;.001). However, anxiety and depression did not affect nursing intentions. Conclusion: To effectively manage the current COVID-19 pandemic, institutional and educational strategies must be developed to help nurses enhance their nursing practices and adopt a positive attitude toward the care of patients infected with COVID-19.

"Entrepreneurship Recovery in Romania after the Great Recession A Dynamic Spatial Panel Approach","Entrepreneurship plays a key role in transforming the economy and society by stimulating economic development, testing innovative ideas, creating new jobs, and by enriching the quality of life and human existence. Entrepreneurship dynamics depend upon a series of local and national economic factors, but are also affected by the international environment, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Statistical data show that new businesses are created at a slower rate during an economic crisis, when the economic climate is harsh, and business opportunities are scarce. Nevertheless, there are local differences in the reaction to crises, and new business formation tends to decline with variable intensity from one region to another, even in the same country. The crises are acting as a trigger for some opportunity-driven entrepreneurs, and resilient regions can thrive even in times of crisis or recover faster after a depression. To capture spatial interactions, as well as spatial short- and long-term effects, the method employed in our analysis relies on the estimation of dynamic spatial panel models. We tested the potential impact of a large variety of social and economic indicators on the creation of new firms and found that the most consequential factors of influence are the economic crisis (expressed through a binary variable), GDP per capita, FDI per capita, inflation, unemployment, and education. Our results convey a powerful policy message for both national and regional decision makers. We believe that, while putting entrepreneurial initiative to the test, the current COVID-19 crisis might act as a catalyst that leads to innovation and reshapes the economy and society.","Goschin, Zizi, Antonia, Mihai, Tigau, Horia","https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910702","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(19):10702, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(19):10702, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20507,""
"Essential Work in the US during COVID-19: Navigating Vulnerabilityâ€“Sustainability Tensions","The COVID-19 pandemic affected every functioning system in the United States. Workers deemed â€œessentialâ€ faced multiple threats to their well-being that quickly led to acute symptoms of anxiety, depression, burnout, and overall exhaustion, and organizations were challenged to devise employee protocols to maintain sustainability. This qualitative study takes a tension-centered approach to discern how â€œessential workersâ€ in the United States navigated this tenuous work landscape, particularly with regard to emotional work and workplace dignity. We conducted 19 semi-structured in-depth interviews with essential workers during COVID-19. Our constant comparative analysis of the data identified a macro-tension between vulnerability and sustainability that was revealed through two micro-tensions: (a) essential work as instrumental and disposable, and (b) workplace dignity as recognized and transgressed. We unpack the emotional responses enmeshed in these micro-tensions and situate our findings at the intersection of organizational sustainability, emotional work and workplace dignity. We offer theoretical and practical implications for essential workers and organizations.","Villamil, Astrid M.; Dâ€™Enbeau, Suzy","https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910665","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(19):10665, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(19):10665, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20508,""
"Design of a Digital Game Intervention to Promote Socio-Emotional Skills and Prosocial Behavior in Children","In emergency contexts such as the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health risk factors affect children and may affect behavioral and emotional problems including anxiety, self-blame, emotional disturbance, and stress. Preventive measures are crucial to address these health risks. Research highlights strength-based factors, such as socio-emotional skills and prosocial behaviors, as important for childhood development and socio-emotional wellbeing. Yet, the initial evidence base shows mixed effectiveness and insufficient behavior change theory application into socio-emotional and prosocial digital game interventions. Additionally, few interventions are designed with a clear process to convert theory into practical game solutions and very limited guidance on the digital game development process exists. This study describes the Intervention Mapping Protocol (IMP) and theory application in the design of a digital game intervention which aims to strengthen social-emotional skills development and promote prosocial behavior in 8â€“11-year-old children. The method systematically describes the steps of the IMP process in detail to guide future theory-based game design. The results explain the final digital game prototype that was co-designed with continuous input and insights provided by stakeholders and feedback from children. This paper contributes to our understanding of theory application in the design of digital game interventions focused on health and behavior change and provides much needed guidance on how theory and stakeholder input can be incorporated into a final game design.","Saleme, Pamela, Dietrich, Timo, Pang, Bo, Parkinson, Joy","https://doi.org/10.3390/mti5100058","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Multimodal Technologies and Interaction; 5(10):58, 2021.; Publication details: Multimodal Technologies and Interaction; 5(10):58, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20509,""

"Changes in nutrition and lifestyle habits during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey and the effects of healthy eating attitudes","BACKGROUND: Social isolation required by the pandemic has led to some changes in individuals' eating and lifestyle habits. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the change in nutrition and lifestyle habits of Turkish people during the COVID-19 outbreak and investigate the effects of individuals' attitudes to healthy eating on this change. METHOD: At the beginning of the pandemic, individuals over the age of 18 participated in this cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire. Demographic information (age, gender, education level, place of residence and occupation), anthropometric data (reported weight and height);nutritional behavior information (number of meals per day, changes in consumption of various foods, use of nutritional supplements, etc.) and changes in lifestyle habits were requested from the participations. In addition, the Healthy Nutrition Attitude Scale (ASHN) was used to determine the healthy eating attitudes of the participants. RESULTS: A total of 432 volunteers participated in the study. It was revealed that body weight increased in 38.0% of the participants and activity level decreased in 73.1% of them during the initial stage of the pandemic. Nevertheless, 44.7% of participants reported increased sleep time, 77.8% reported increased social media use, and 66.7% reported increased stress and anxiety. It was found that the most commonly used nutritional supplements during this period were vitamin C, vitamin D and multivitamin complex. Women have significantly higher ASHN scores compared to men (p &lt; 0.001). The total ASHN scores of those whose body weight did not change and those who increased their activity level were found to be significantly higher. It was determined that as the age and education level increased, the healthy eating attitude increased. CONCLUSION: In this study, findings regarding the negative effects of the COVID-19 quarantine on the nutrition and lifestyle of the Turkish people are presented. However, those with a positive attitude toward healthy eating were observed to have better weight control and eating habits and stress management during the pandemic. Therefore, it is thought that the dissemination of healthy eating attitudes in society may contribute to the maintenance of physical and mental health in the event of a pandemic. Â© 2021-IOS Press.

"Affection deprivation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A panel study","This study examined the longer-term effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns on relational communication and mental health. Specifically, the study used the theoretic premises of Affection Exchange Theory (AET: Floyd, 2006) to hypothesize connections between affection deprivation and several indices of mental health, including loneliness and depression. The study used a panel design to recruit participants at different time points during the COVID-19 lockdowns. We employed growth modeling to examine how affection deprivation influenced mental health outcomes over time. As predicted, affection deprivation was associated with stress, loneliness, and depression. Contrary to our hypotheses, affection deprivation was not associated with life satisfaction and happiness. In addition, the results showed that sex moderated the relationship between affection deprivation and depression. These findings are discussed in detail, including both theoretical and practical implications as well as directions for future research.","Hesse, Colin, Mikkelson, Alan, Tian, Xi","https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075211046587","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Journal of Social and Personal Relationships;: 02654075211046587, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Social and Personal Relationships;: 02654075211046587, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20513,""
"Telemedicine in Geriatric Psychiatry: Relevance in India","Telemedicine has evolved as a novel tool in delivering health care in the modern world. With the advancement in video conferencing technology at an affordable price and innovative digital medical instruments, it has grown from guiding paramedics in managing patients to aiding physicians in providing direct consultation. Delivering care for older adults has always been challenging due to comorbidities that may warrant a multidisciplinary approach leading to frequent visits across specialties. As per the preliminary reports of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India, 55% of this population suffers from any chronic illness, of which 40% have some form of disability and 20% deal with mental health issues. Over the years, telepsychiatry care for older adults has received increasing acceptability. Videoconferencing with improved connectivity and transmission rates has aided in evaluating, assessing, and providing mental health interventions at ease. The recent regulation of telemedicine practice in the country by rolling out the Telemedicine Practice Guidelines 2020 and Telepsychiatry Operational Guidelines 2020 has fast-tracked its utility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns of physical examination, psychological satisfaction of consulting physician in person, confidentiality, and security of information shared are points that need better addressing in the future. However, Telemedicine is recommended to be used judiciously, taking the risk and benefit of older adults on a case basis as it can significantly bring down the financial and emotional burden.","Kalaivanan, Rakesh Chander, Rahul, Patley, Manjunatha, Narayana, Kumar, Channaveerachari Naveen, Sivakumar, Palanimuthu Thangaraju, Math, Suresh Bada","https://doi.org/10.1177/02537176211033007","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine;: 02537176211033007, 2021.; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine;: 02537176211033007, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20514,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Campus Closure on Undergraduates","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an abrupt transition from in-person to online learning in Spring 2020.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to identify the impact of the transition on undergraduates during the period following the campus closure.Method131 psychology undergraduate students completed an online survey of how the COVID-19 closure had impacted their academics, online learning environment, and traumatic stress symptoms (using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for the DSM-5).ResultsMost participants reported increased academic difficulty compared to before closure. Approximately 30% reported elevated traumatic stress symptoms. Greater traumatic stress was associated with greater difficulty completing assignments, more limited access to the internet and quiet places to study, and greater sibling-care responsibilities.ConclusionsThe acute transition to online instruction posed academic and emotional challenges to many students, especially those from environments with competing demands or less access to academic supports. Follow-up evaluation is needed to determine whether these difficulties have persisted in subsequent semesters of online instruction.Teaching ImplicationInstructors should anticipate the emotional and academic needs of students who are relatively unfamiliar with online instruction and consider ways to minimize negative environmental impacts and increase access to mental health resources.","Telli, Olufunmilayo, Mountcastle, Lindsey, Jehl, Brianna L.; Munoz-Osorio, Angel, Dahlquist, Lynnda M.; Jayasekera, Ashani, Dougherty, Aryn, Castillo, Raquel, Miner, Kollin","https://doi.org/10.1177/00986283211043924","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Teaching of Psychology;: 00986283211043924, 2021.; Publication details: Teaching of Psychology;: 00986283211043924, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20515,""

"Police Officersâ€™ Best Friend?: An Exploratory Analysis of the Effect of Service Dogs on Perceived Organizational Support in Policing","This study explored the effectiveness of a novel technique for police departments to support their officers and promote wellness: the use of service dogs. We evaluated officer perceptions in two mid-sized, municipal police departments that have wellness programs with a service dog that is permanently assigned to a full-time police officer handler: Groton and Naugatuck, Connecticut. We assessed six factors believed to influence police officer wellness including: operational and organizational stress using the Police Stress Questionnaire;topical stressors including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, police use of force and community relations, and police reform efforts;Perceived Organizational Support (POS);receptivity to service dogs;and willingness to seek assistance for mental health issues. We found evidence that exposure to service dogs is significantly linked to both POS and receptivity to service dogs in policing. We also found that officer willingness to seek their department?s assistance regarding mental health approaches significance with greater exposure to the service dog (p = .07). Although we found no significant evidence that exposure to service dogs is linked to stress reduction, we found that police reforms pose a substantial perceived stress on officers in the study. This finding presents a serious challenge for reformers that risks undermining officer wellness. Implications of our findings and recommendations for future research are discussed.","Quick, Kenneth M.; Piza, Eric L.","https://doi.org/10.1177/0032258X211044711","","Database: Sage; Publication details: The Police Journal;: 0032258X211044711, 2021.; Publication details: The Police Journal;: 0032258X211044711, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20517,""
"Sentimental Analysis Applications and Approaches during COVID-19: A Survey","The social media and electronic media has a vast amount of user-generated data such as people' comment and reviews about different product, diseases, government policies etc. Sentimental analysis is the emerging field in text mining where people's feeling and emotions are extracted using different techniques. COVID-19 has declared as pandemic and effected people's lives all over the globe. It caused the feelings of fear, anxiety, anger, depression and many other psychological issues. In this survey paper, the sentimental analysis applications and methods which are used for COVID-19 research are briefly presented. The comparison of thirty primary studies shows that Naive Bayes and SVM are the widely used algorithms of sentimental analysis for COVID-19 research. The applications of sentimental analysis during COVID includes the analysis of people's sentiments specially students, reopening sentiments, analysis of restaurants reviews and analysis of vaccine sentiments.

"Chaos during the COVID-19 outbreak: Predictors of household chaos among low-income families during a pandemic","Objective Background Method Results Implications The objective of this study was to explore whether household chaos measured during the COVID-19 pandemic is predicted by prepandemic parental and household characteristics.The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered children's home environments and routines due to stay-at-home orders, school closures, and economic shocks. These disruptions have been especially challenging for low-income families who have limited resources and have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Household chaos, which captures routines, organization, stability, noise, and crowding in the home, is a documented threat to parent functioning and positive child development. The pandemic has likely exacerbated household chaos, especially for low-income families.Data come from a larger, ongoing study of low-income children and their parents in Tulsa, OK;this analysis relies on data from the subset of low-income parents who responded to surveys when their children were in kindergarten (in 2018â€“2019) and during the pandemic, when their children were in first grade (nÂ =Â 335). We use multivariate ordinary least squares regression models to test whether household chaos measured during the pandemic is predicted by prepandemic parental and household characteristics.Prepandemic parental depression and household chaos were significantly predictive of chaos during the pandemic, even after accounting for household demographics.The current study highlights pandemic-induced elevations in parental distress and household chaos among low-income families. Results will provide valuable direction to policymakers, educators, and parents on how best to offset negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family functioning and child development.

"Pandemic effects on social companion robot use in care homes","During the past year with a pandemic, there have been many discussions of the use of robots in healthcare, and in particular the care of older adults. There are reports that COVID-19 drives adoption of robot technologies, and that health institutions are more positive to the use of robots due to the lower risk of virus spread, among other reasons. The media have contributed significantly to an increased interest in caring robots and from a societal perspective - given recent lockdowns, social distancing, etc. - an increase of robot usage in health care settings is not difficult to imagine. Older adults have in many countries been isolated, either at home or in care homes. This group, and especially individuals with dementia, were already vulnerable before the pandemic, living with an increased risk for loneliness and depression. For the last 10 years in Sweden, many actions have been taken to improve these people's well-being and quality of life, including the use of social companion robots as psychological interventions. Given the increased isolation due to the pandemic, we wanted to investigate how the use of social companion robots has been affected in care homes during this time. We, therefore, interviewed nine health care staff members from seven different care homes for older adults in Sweden. The results summarised in this paper provides a real-world status report, one year after the outbreak, of how the pandemic has affected the usage of social companion robots in care homes.

"The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21: Development and Validation of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 8-Item in Psychiatric Patients and the General Public for Easier Mental Health Measurement in a Post COVID-19 World","Despite extensive investigations of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) since its development in 1995, its factor structure and other psychometric properties still need to be firmly established, with several calls for revising its item structure. Employing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), this study examined the factor structure of the DASS-21 and five shortened versions of the DASS-21 among psychiatric patients (N = 168) and the general public (N = 992) during the COVID-19 confinement period in Saudi Arabia. Multigroup CFA, Mann Whitney W test, Spearman's correlation, and coefficient alpha were used to examine the shortened versions of the DASS-21 (DASS-13, DASS-12, DASS-9 (two versions), and DASS-8) for invariance across age and gender groups, discriminant validity, predictive validity, item coverage, and internal consistency, respectively. Compared with the DASS-21, all three-factor structures of the shortened versions expressed good fit, with the DASS-8 demonstrating the best fit and highest item loadings on the corresponding factors in both samples (&#967;2(16, 15) = 16.5, 67.0; p = 0.420, 0.001; CFI = 1.000, 0.998; TLI = 0.999, 0.997; RMSEA = 0.013, 0.059, SRMR = 0.0186, 0.0203). The DASS-8 expressed configural, metric, and scalar invariance across age and gender groups. Its internal consistency was comparable to other versions (&#945; = 0.94). Strong positive correlations of the DASS-8 and its subscales with the DASS-21 and its subscales (r = 0.97 to 0.81) suggest adequate item coverage and good predictive validity of this version. The DASS-8 and its subscales distinguished the clinical sample from the general public at the same level of significance expressed by the DASS-21 and other shortened versions, supporting its discriminant validity. Neither the DASS-21 nor the shortened versions distinguished patients diagnosed with depression and anxiety from each other or from other psychiatric conditions. The DASS-8 represents a valid short version of the DASS-21, which may be useful in research and clinical practice for quick identification of individuals with potential psychopathologies. Diagnosing depression/anxiety disorders may be further confirmed in a next step by clinician-facilitated examinations. Brevity of the DASS-21 would save time and effort used for filling the questionnaire and support comprehensive assessments by allowing the inclusion of more measures on test batteries.","Ali, Amira Mohammed; Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A; Hori, Hiroaki; Kim, Yoshiharu; Kunugi, Hiroshi","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910142","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 27.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 27.; COVID-19; Depression; Anxiety/diagnosis; Depression/diagnosis; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humans; Mental Health; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological/diagnosis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20521,""
"Mental Health during COVID-19 Pandemic among Caregivers of Young Children in Kenya's Urban Informal Settlements A Cross-Sectional Telephone Survey","The emergence of COVID-19 has profoundly affected mental health, especially among highly vulnerable populations. This study describes mental health issues among caregivers of young children and pregnant women in three urban informal settlements in Kenya during the first pandemic year, and factors associated with poor mental health. A cross-sectional telephone survey was administered to 845 participants. Survey instruments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, COVID-19 Anxiety Scale, and questions on the perceived COVID-19 effects on caregiver wellbeing and livelihood. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and univariate and multivariate analysis. Caregivers perceived COVID-19 as a threatening condition (94.54%), affecting employment and income activities (>80%). Caregivers experienced discrimination (15.27%) and violence (12.6%) during the pandemic. Levels of depression (34%), general anxiety (20%), and COVID-19 related anxiety (14%) were highly prevalent. There were significant associations between mental health outcomes and economic and socio-demographic factors, violence and discrimination experiences, residency, and perceptions of COVID-19 as a threatening condition. Caregivers high burden of mental health problems highlights the urgent need to provide accessible mental health support.

"Depression as Compared to Level of Physical Activity and Internet Addiction among Polish Physiotherapy Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVES: The aim of the survey was to assess the level of depression correlated with physical activity and internet addiction among physiotherapy students of Polish universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The survey was carried out via the internet among Polish physiotherapy students (141 respondents). The level of depression was assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory, physical activity by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) in Polish and the level of internet addiction by the Kimberly Young Questionnaire. RESULTS: It was found that 31% of those surveyed stated that they suffered from moderate or severe depression. The overwhelming majority of the respondents (92%) considered the level of their internet addiction as low. More physical activity had a positive effect on mental health. The overuse of the internet exacerbated depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression observed in students is mainly related to distant learning systems. Therefore, regular physical activity is recommended as it is associated with a lower level of depression. It is also advisable to provide students with necessary psychological care. Excessive use of social media is not recommended to elevate mood as it makes depression symptoms worse.","Zalewska, Anna; Galczyk, Monika; Sobolewski, Marek; Bialokoz-Kalinowska, Irena","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910072","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 Sep 25.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 Sep 25.; Behavior, Addictive; COVID-19; Behavior, Addictive/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Exercise; Humans; Internet; Internet Addiction Disorder; Pandemics; Physical Therapy Modalities; Poland/epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20523,""
"Prior Social Contact and Mental Health Trajectories during COVID-19: Neighborhood <i>Friendship</i> Protects Vulnerable Older Adults","Social networking protects mental health during a crisis. Prior contact with social organizations, friends, and non-friend neighbors may be associated with better trajectories of loneliness, depression and subjective memory during COVID-19. Regression analysis was conducted using longitudinal data from a representative sample of n = 3105 US adults aged &#8805;55 in April-October 2020. Latent profile analysis was also conducted. Prior contact with friends (B = -0.075, p < 0.001), neighbors (B = -0.048, p = 0.007), and social organizations (B = -0.073, p < 0.001) predicted for better mental health during COVID-19. Three profiles were identified: Profile 1 had the best outcomes, with prior contact with social organizations (B = -0.052, p = 0.044) predicting decreasing loneliness. For Profile 2, prior 'meeting' contact with friends predicted decreasing loneliness (B = -0.075, p < 0.001) and better subjective memory (B = -0.130, p = 0.011). Conversely, prior contact with neighbors (B = -0.165, p = 0.010) predicted worsening loneliness among Profile 3. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a differential impact on the mental health trajectories of aging adults with social ties of different strengths. Stronger neighborhood networks are important to mitigate poor mental health outcomes among vulnerable older adults during a crisis. Older adults who are living alone and had relied on non-friend neighbors for social connectedness require additional community supports. Policy interventions are required to mitigate the mental health impact of future pandemics.","Gan, Daniel R Y; Best, John R","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18199999","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 23.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(19)2021 09 23.; COVID-19; Friends; Aged; Humans; Loneliness; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Social Isolation; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20524,""
"Predictors of Mental Health Status among Quarantined COVID-19 Patients in Saudi Arabia","BACKGROUND: The negative psychological impact of COVID-19 in the general population has been well documented. Similar studies among those who were infected and who underwent quarantine remain scarce, particularly in the Arab region. The present study aims to fill this gap. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, suspected/confirmed COVID-19 individuals who were quarantined in the Ministry of Health (MOH) facilities were invited to participate in an online survey. All consenting participants answered a generalized questionnaire that included demographic characteristics, as well as a five-part questionnaire that assessed the symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. RESULTS: A total of 335 suspected/confirmed COVID-19 individuals (198 males and 137 females) participated. Being female is associated with increased risk of depression (odds ratio OR 1.8 (confidence interval, CI 1.1-3.1; p = 0.03)) as well as being employed by the government (OR 2.8 (CI 1.1-7.0; p = 0.03)). Level of education (OR 2.3 (CI 1.0-5.4; p = 0.049)) and employment in government (OR 3.0 (CI 1.2-7.8; p = 0.02)) were significantly associated with distress. Increasing age (45 years and above) appeared to be protective against distress (OR 0.2 (CI 0.02-0.69; p = 0.008)), as well anxiety and sleep pattern (OR 0.3 p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Findings of the present study highlight that infected COVID-19 populations are at higher risk for acute and detrimental psychological well-being during quarantine and/or self-isolation. Identification of the coping mechanisms of older adults during periods of distress may prove beneficial in the pandemic preparedness of younger generations.","Alodhayani, Abdulaziz A; Almutairi, Khalid M; Alshobaili, Fahda A; Alotaibi, Adel F; Alkhaldi, Ghadah; Vinluan, Jason M; Albedewi, Hadeel Mohammed; Al-Sayyari, Lamis","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101271","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Healthcare (Basel);9(10)2021 Sep 26.; Publication details: Healthcare (Basel);9(10)2021 Sep 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20525,""
"The COVID-19 Global Pandemic and Its Impact on the Mental Health of Nurses in Malaysia","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic since its onset has had a dramatic and often devastating impact, both physical and psychological, on all healthcare workers. This study aimed to assess the impact of psychological distress that COVID-19 has on nurses, as well as the coping strategies that they employed. This is a cross-sectional national online survey. A total of 859 nurses actively involved in caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Malaysia participated in the study. More than three-quarters of the nurses experienced stress (77.2%). A total of 88.7% and 7.2% of nurses revealed a moderate and high stress level, respectively. Approximately one in eight (12.1%) nurses reported feeling depressed. Nurses working in the outpatient departments reported significantly higher stress levels than nurses working in inpatient care departments. Nurses having chronic health problems reported significantly higher depression levels than nurses with no chronic health problem. Highly stressed or depressed nurses tend to adopt avoidance coping strategies while religion and emotional support were used regardless of the stress or depression levels experienced. The findings of the study provide insight into the mental health and coping strategies of nurses actively involved in caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Malaysia.

"THE PANDEMIC PROCESS OF INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY STUDENTS","The Covid-19 outbreak has caused serious threats to the physical and mental health of individuals, and has caused many psychological problems such as depression. During pandemic associated shutdown of universities and travel restrictions on going abroad, international students had to spend this process in a foreign country where they were educated, away from their families. In this study, emotional states (moods) and academic concerns of university students were examined. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the reflections and effects of social supports offered to students and distance education provided at universities on their quality of life using qualitative research method. 360 international students who participated in the study from 30 different countries considered the interruption of education during the Covid-19 process as an important decision. The findings of the study are as follows: The interruption of face-to-face instruction (in-person learning) affected them negatively (r = 0.197 **), the most important problem they encountered in distance education was "" the language of instruction education"" (r = 0.247 **;r = 0.354 **) and this might pose problems in their future university life as well (r = -0.152 **). They also stated that negative feelings such as ""fear"", ""anxiety"" and ""helplessness"" brought students from different religions, languages and races closer to each other. In conclusion, the significant importance of social supports/aids for international students and various teachings of global catastrophes were revealed in the study. In addition, as a result of value-oriented distance education during the epidemic, it was determined that students have gained various gains in both the education process and their lifestyles.","Bekc&Iacute;, Banu","https://doi.org/10.26809/joa.6.2.04","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Awareness; 6(2):135-144, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Awareness; 6(2):135-144, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20527,""
"Extreme Psychological Stress During the Corona Crisis in China","The Covid-19 virus crisis is related to virology, medicine, politics, economy, lockdown, the constitution, masks, the future, and short-time work. But what about the mental health of the medical practitioners on the frontline? Experiences and research in China provide not only an insight into the almost superhuman medical performance, but also the most extreme mental stress and strain of these same practitioners.

"Attitude, practices and experience of dental professionals during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey from Gujarat, India","Introduction: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a declared public health emergency of international concern. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classified health-care professionals and exposure risk to coronavirus (COVID-19), identifying dental professionals in the very high-risk group due to the specificity of dental procedures and instrumentations used. Guidelines from relevant authorities suggested providing only emergency and urgent dental treatment during the pandemic which has led majority of dental practice to stop, thus instilling anxiety in the dental professionals. A study to assess the attitude, practice and experience of dental professionals from Gujarat state during the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire consisting of 32 questions using Google Form was distributed to 315 dental professionals. Data obtained were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 22.0. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to describe variables. Chi-square test was used to find a significant association between parameters, and P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Overall, 194 dental professionals (104 general dentists and 90 specialists) filled the questionnaire. Nearly half of the participants (49.5%) said that personal protective equipment (PPE) is uncomfortable while performing dental procedures. The majority of them (86.6%) insisted on increasing the cost of dental treatments. Regarding new practices adapted during the pandemic, 53 dental professionals (27.3%) did not find teledentistry effective in resolving the patient's problem. Only 75 dental professionals (38.7%) followed all the screening criteria for patients. Fifty-nine participants (30.4%) got the COVID-19 test for patients requiring the aerosol-generating procedure. While 125 participants (64.4%) performed aerosol-generating procedures either in urgent/emergency cases or elective cases, only 115 (59.3%) used full PPE with an appropriate mask. One hundred and thirty-seven (70.6%) of them reported a decrease in income during the pandemic, while 74 (38.1%) suffered from anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Dental health-care providers are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. Thus, they should execute proposed precautionary measures more diligently. Regular training and screening of dental professionals should be undertaken by state regulatory bodies. Adapting and adhering to change in work protocols by dental professionals will ensure not only their safety but also their patients. The emergence of COVID-19 has been great learning for the field of dentistry, and the dental practice is going to change for the better.","Prajapati, A. S.; Kulkarni, P. R.; Shah, H. G.; Shah, D.

"A cross-lagged study on health risk perception and life consciousness in college students during the COVID-19 epidemic","Objective: To explore the relationship between health risk perception and life consciousness in college students during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: A total of 320 college students were assessed twice at 6- month intervals with the Health Risk Perception Scale (HRPS) and Questionnaire of Life Consciousness for College Students (QLCCS). The subjects were divided into middle and high-risk areas group (n = 165) and low-risk areas group (n = 131) according to the COVID-19 epidemic risk level of their location. A structural equation model was established to analyze the cross-lag effect of HRPS score and QLCCS score, and the group difference test was conducted to reveal the inter-group difference. Results: The baseline HRPS scores were lower in the middle and highrisk areas group than in the low-risk areas group (P &lt; 0. 05) . After 6 months, the HRPS scores decreased, and the QLCCS scores increased in both groups (Ps &lt; 0. 05). In the cross-lagged model analysis, the baseline HRPS scores positively associated with the QLCCS scores 6 months later (ÃŸ = 0. 22), while the baseline QLCCS scores positively associated with the HRPS scores 6 months later (ÃŸ = 0. 15). There was difference in the relationship between HRPS scores and QLCCS scores between two groups (<U+0394><U+03C7>Â² = 9. 28, P &lt; 0. 05). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 epidemic, the health risk perception and life consciousness of college students are associated with interaction, and the relationship between them is affected by regional risk level.

"Mental Health Impact of Gender-Based Violence Amid COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review","Gender-based violence (GBV) and poor mental health have received particular attention among healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a review of available literature to understand the dynamics of GBV and its mental health impact in the context of COVID-19. Confinement and control by abusive partners, social and economic disruption, and restricted access to healthcare services were identified as the main contributing factors of GBV. The paper elaborates on the contribution of broader socioeconomic determinants of health as well as cultural and societal factors of victimization in shaping GBV by placing specific populations or individuals in a more vulnerable position within the society based on their gender. Socioeconomic determinants included socioeconomic status, education, migration and racial, ethnic, or gender-based minoritisation. Cultural and societal factors of victimization are mostly related to gender-based structural power discrepancies and communication patterns. Evidence suggests a complex relationship between COVID-19 specific stressors, such as health anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty, GBV, and mental health issues. COVID-19 stressors might directly trigger the mechanism of aggression and cause physical or psychological violence and associated mental health implications in victims, or it might be mediated by pre-existing mental health issues experienced by perpetrators.","Opanasenko, A.; Lugova, H.; Mon, A.

"New needs and training modalities for the sustainable transfer of know-how on food and agriculture statistics in the COVID-19 era","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Global Indicator Framework (GIF) has multiplied training needs due to the large number of new indicators to be monitored by countries, whereas COVID-19-related social distancing restrictions have provided an unexpected springboard for the proliferation of cutting-edge virtual training tools and modalities. This has exposed a panoply of new data-related skills needed by contemporary statisticians, and therefore the types of training that could be most appropriate for acquiring these skills. This paper analyses the changing context and nature of training, with particular reference to the experience of FAO as a custodian agency for a large share of SDG indicators. The combination of different learning modalities, appropriately blended into a coherent learning programme, is shown to have the greatest impact, with one modality reinforcing the strengths and dampening the limitations of another.

"One Transgender Community's Experience of the COVID-19 Pandemic A Report from Indonesia","This essay contains an introduction and a translation of an account provided in Indonesian by Rully Mallay, a transgender community leader and activist at the Kebaya Foundation, a shelter for people living with HIV in the province of Yogyakarta. It describes the impact of restrictions imposed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and mobilization in response to it by those who identify as ""waria"" between February and September 2020. Waria played a pivotal role inmobilizing a community response in that city, providing support not only to their own community but also to other marginal groups impacted in similar ways. Harsh lockdown measures imposed to respond to COVID-19 disproportionately affectedwaria, cutting off access to economic and community support. This was particularly acute for the many waria without state-issued identity cards. Nevertheless, Rully expresses her hope that through the skills and adaptability they have demonstrated in their response to the public health emergency, they might achieve recognition and acceptance from Indonesian society.","Mallay, R.; Hegarty, B.; Nanwani, S.; Praptoraharjo, I.","https://doi.org/10.1215/23289252-9009003","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Tsq-Transgender Studies Quarterly; 8(3):386-393, 2021.; Publication details: Tsq-Transgender Studies Quarterly; 8(3):386-393, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20534,""

Factors associated with psychological symptoms were identified by univariate (ANOVA and independent t test), and independent factors were detected by multivariate linear regression analysis after controlling other variables. p value of Results: A total of 400 participants completed the survey. Majority of them were females (84.5%, n = 338) and aged between 18 and 31 (53.5%, n = 214). About 76.5% (n = 306) reported symptoms of depression, 315 (78.8%) anxiety, 254 (63.5%) stress-based, and 187 (46.8%) suffered from clinical insomnia. Frontline HCWs at fever clinic were at higher risk of developing burnout symptoms (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, being younger, nonmarried, and nurse had no kids and changed accommodation during the crisis;all together were at higher risk of developing burnout symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). Adjusted linear regression showed that age was the major independent factor affecting DASS-21 subscales without affecting the level of insomnia (&lt;0.01). In addition, being worried about the family and loved ones independently influenced higher levels of depression and anxiety-based (&lt;0.001). Conclusion: This study revealed that COVID-19 outbreak has a significant psychological impact on frontline HCWs and the most vulnerable groups to psychological distress. Efficient support and interventions are needed to protect HCWs from being infected and promote their well-being.","AlGhufli, F.; AlMulla, R.; Alyedi, O.; AlAbdin, S. Z.; Nakhal, M.

"Understanding the concurrent risk of mental health and dangerous wildfire events in the COVID-19 pandemic","Little research has examined the mental health risks of concurrent disasters. For example, disasters like wildfires have been shown to have a strong association with psychological symptomsâ€”the 2020Â U.S. Western wildfire season was the worst on record and occurred while the country was still navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented two quasi-experimental analyses, an interrupted time series analysis, and a difference-in-difference analysis to evaluate the impacts of wildfires and COVID-19 on mental health crisis help-seeking patterns. Both methods showed no statistical association between exposure to wildfires and the seeking of mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlighted that 2020 wildfires were not associated with an acute increase in crisis texts for youth in the two months after the events, likely due to an already elevated text volume in response to the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 throughout the fall wildfire season (Aug to Oct 2020). Future research is needed outside of the context of the pandemic to understand the effects of extreme and concurrent climatic events on adolescent mental health, and targeted interventions are required to ensure youth and adolescents are receiving adequate support during these types of crisis events.","Sugg, Margaret M.; Michael, Kurt, Hajnos, Sarah N.; Greene, Shannon, Runkle, Jennifer D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150391","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Science of The Total Environment;: 150391, 2021.; Publication details: Science of The Total Environment;: 150391, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20543,""
"Adult Suicide-Related emergency department encounters during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Cross-Sectional study","Background. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in widespread psychosocial disruption, which may impact suicidal thoughts and behaviours. This study characterizes adult suicide-related emergency department (ED) encounters and patient characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to the year prior. Methods. Retrospective cross-sectional study in a large, integrated, community-based health system of adults (=18-years-old) with suicide-related ED encounters (defined by the Centres for Disease Control-recommended International Statistical Classification of Diseases [ICD-10-CM] codes) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period in 2019. Population-level incidence rate ratios (IRRs) compared suicide-related ED encounters in 2020 to 2019. Patient characteristics for the first suicide-related ED visit for each period were used to calculate percent relative change comparing 2020 to 2019. Findings. Of 10,651 suicide-related ED encounters in 2020 and 11,476 in 2019, 49.6% and 51.6% were for females and the mean age was 38Â±17 and 38Â±16 years-old, respectively. Suicide-related ED encounters significantly declined in each month of 2020 (IRR 0.71-0.91, p&lt;.05), but were equivalent to 2019 levels June-August. Adults in 2020 were more likely to have co-occurring substance use disorders (+15â€¢7%;95% CI 7â€¢0-24â€¢4%) or have no mental health or suicide diagnosis associated with an outpatient visit in the last year (+21â€¢1%, 95% CI: 12â€¢5-29â€¢6) compared to 2019. Interpretation. Adults with suicidal thoughts and behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had distinct social and psychiatric characteristics compared to patients in the prior year. These findings can help inform health system responses to mental health needs.","Ridout, Kathryn K.; Alavi, Mubarika, Ridout, Samuel J.; Koshy, Maria T.; Awsare, Sameer, Harris, Brooke, Vinson, David R.; Weisner, Constance M.; Sterling, Stacy, Iturralde, Esti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100078","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: The Lancet Regional Health - Americas; 4:100078, 2021.; Publication details: The Lancet Regional Health - Americas; 4:100078, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20544,""
"Addressing mental health stigma in low-income and middle-income countries: A new frontier for digital mental health","Summary Background Mental health stigma is a major barrier to seeking help, and leads to poor quality of life and social withdrawal for individuals living with mental illness. These concerns are especially severe in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) that face a disproportionate share of the global burden of mental illnesses. With growing access to digital technologies in LMICs, there may be new opportunities to address mental health stigma. This review considers the potential for emerging digital technologies to advance efforts to challenge mental health stigma in LMICs. Methods Promising digital strategies to reduce mental health stigma were identified through searching the peer-reviewed literature. Drawing from the Mental Illness Stigma Framework, these studies of digital strategies were grouped into three categories: 1) protest;2) education, and 3) contact. Results These three categories align with established stigma reduction programs. Digital strategies could expand the reach of or complement existing efforts. There are challenges with digital stigma reduction strategies, including the need for cultural adaptation of these programs to diverse contexts and settings, consideration of reliable measurement of mental health related stigma, and risks that digital media could perpetuate the spread of misinformation and exacerbate concerns pertaining to mental health stigma. Conclusion This review highlights the promise of technology for addressing mental health stigma in LMICs. This is imperative in the face of growing demand for mental health services owing to the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increasing reliance on digital platforms among individuals in most countries.","Naslund, J.

"ARE FERTILITY TREATMENT RETENTION RATES AFFECTED BY PATIENT PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY?","Objective: Patient retention is an important component of fertility treatment. Addressing barriers to continuation of care can improve retention and benefit those seeking guidance on family building. While it is understood that fertility treatment can cause psychological distress, the impact of an existing psychiatric illness on retention is less known. We aim to determine whether a pre-existing diagnosis of a psychiatric illness is an independent factor in determining patient retention. Materials and Methods: All new patients at a single site of our academic institution from October 2019 to March 2020 (COVID closures) were assessed for eligibility. Of 545 patients, 143 were excluded due to age &gt;45 years, pregnancy on initial consultation, history of cancer, or missing chart data. Charts were reviewed for a diagnosis of any psychiatric condition. Patient discontinuation was defined as loss to follow up prior to treatment completion. The data was analyzed to exclude patients who stopped treatment due to the COVID closure (43 patients). Fisherâ€™s exact test and Kaplan Meier Curves were used with a p-value of &lt;0.05 as significant. Results: Of the 359 included patients, 47 had a diagnosis of a psychiatric condition. Diagnoses included 20 patients (43%) with depression, 23 patients (49%) with anxiety, and 4 patients (8%) with ""other"" (bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). During the study period, 21 of 47 (45%) patients with a psychiatric condition and 124 of 312 (40%) patients with no psychiatric conditions discontinued care (p=0.53). Time to discontinuation was not significantly different between the groups whether patients had a psychiatric condition (15 months with no psychiatric history versus 12 months with a psychiatric history, p=0.71), and whether that condition was treated (12 months with psychiatric treatment versus 10 months with no psychiatric treatment, p=0.66). A sub-group analysis was performed by psychiatric condition. A diagnosis of depression did not impact the discontinuation of fertility treatments (33% versus 50%, p=0.37). However, patients with a diagnosis of anxiety were significantly more likely to discontinue care than those without anxiety (67% versus 35%, p=0.04). Conclusions: Our data show a diagnosis of anxiety can have an impact on fertility treatment retention rates. These data suggest that apart from the well-established psychological distress that infertility itself poses, recognizing and addressing pre-existing psychiatric disease must be an important goal of the fertility work-up. A thorough medical and psychiatric history to ensure patients are receiving proper treatment and support is paramount not only to improve retention rates, but in doing so, to ensure patients realize their family building goals. Impact Statement: Presenting with a history of anxiety can have a significant impact on fertility treatment retention rates and pre-existing psychiatric disease should be recognized and addressed in all fertility patients.","Brownridge, S.

"Feasibility of implementing a digital prehabilitation service for cancer patients in the NHS","Background: We have previously demonstrated the benefits of our hybrid clinic-home based model of prehabilitation on physical fitness, psychological wellbeing, and post-operative complications. Traditional models of prehabilitation that involved visits to a hospital and community centre have been disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented a digital cancer prehabilitation service (DPS) for patients undergoing curative treatment for cancer. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the service through measuring recruitment and retention and the impact on health metrics before and after the completion of the 12-week programme. Methods: All consecutive patients undergoing surgery for cancer were asked to participate. We recorded the number of patients that accepted and that completed the DPS. Patientsâ€™ physical activity (steps count) was regularly monitored through a wearable activity tracker;patients were supported through video calls every week by the clinical team. At the beginning and at the end of the DPS, patients underwent a remote video-based exercise assessment. Finally, patients were asked to answer a health survey before and after the intervention. Results: Since September 2020, 44 (of 50 patients) were recruited (88%) of whom 40 completed the programme (90%). There was no deterioration in physical fitness from baseline to programme completion. Additionally, there was 40% increase in physical activity and significant reductions in self-reported measures for distress (55%), anxiety (30%), depression (50%), and anger (35%). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a high recruitment and retention rate into the DPS for a group of NHS patients undergoing complex cancer treatment. We have also shown comparable health outcomes to our previously published clinic- home based hybrid model of prehabilitation. Further research is needed to demonstrate the impact on clinical outcomes such as treatment tolerance and quality of life. Legal entity responsible for the study: K. Moorthy. Funding: Innovate UK.

"Impact of COVID-19 vaccination campaign on psychological status in cancer patients (pts)","Background: The health emergency caused by the SarS-Cov-2 pandemic has been strongly impacting on oncological patientsâ€™ (pts). The purpose of this study was to explore the emotional impact and perception of cancer pts who received the vaccine against COVID-19 at the University Hospital and Trust of Verona (Italy). Methods: After the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine an anonymously questionnaire was proposed to cancer pts (March-May 2021). The survey investigated anxiety and depression levels using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), psychological distress with the Distress Thermometer (DT). Additionally, four specific items regarding the awareness about: i) infection risks, ii) interference with chemotherapy treatment, and iii) adverse effects, were developed. Descriptive analyses were performed. Results: A total of 736 patients (mean age 63 yrs) completed the questionnaire. Breast (23%) and gastrointestinal (40%) were the most represented cancer sites. The majority of pts (65%) reported mild levels of distress (DT =4), while moderate (DT 5-7) and severe (DT =8) levels were identified in 26% and 9% of participants, respectively. A total of 11% and 8% of pts experienced clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression (HADS =11), whereas 15% were borderline (HADS score 8-10). Two thirds of pts (67%) thought that the vaccination may reduce the infection risks and 56% felt safer. Overall, 59% of pts did not believe that vaccine-related side effects may interfere with the oncological treatment and 49% considered the vaccination safe. Conclusions: Most cancer pts undergoing COVID-19 vaccination presented mild levels of anxiety, depression and distress. Oncological pts undergoing vaccination felt safe and judged the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination to overweight the potential side effects. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors.

"Health behavior of cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic Focus head neck cancer","Background: During pandemic coping strategies become very important for for each individual cancer patient. Are there any changes in health behavior of our patients due to pandemic? Methods: We have analyzed questionnaire data of 575 patients, among them 171 head neck cancer patients. 246+84 questionnaires were filled in May 2020 (wave 1) and 158+87 questionannaires were filled in October 2020 (wave 2). We asked for alcohol consumption (5-point Likert scale), sportive activities, meditation, praying, and drug abuse (all 4-point Likert scale). We compared each item at both time points (t-test, 2 fold, inhomogenous variance). Sub-analysis were performed for head and neck cancer patients. Results: Comparing between both time points, we see a stable alcohol consumption (1.700Â±1.463 vs. 1.66Â±1.428), a significant decreased in sportive activities (1.789Â±1.013 vs. 1.557Â±0.995, p=0.013), a trend to less meditation (0,571Â±0.951 vs. 0.408Â±0.873, p=0.056), a significant decrease in praying (0.938Â±1.225 vs. 0.650Â±1.126, p=0.009) and an unchanged drug abuse (0.366Â±0.891 vs. 0.392Â±0.942). Comparing head neck cancer patients with cancer patients of other tumor localizations, they show a significant stronger reduction of praying (p=0.002). During wave 2 head neck cancer patients reported about more alcohol consumption (1.473Â±1.491 versus 1.697Â±1.427) and drug abuse (0.333Â±0.875 versus 0.48Â±1.044). Conclusions: During pandemic we see a reduction of individual coping strategies and changes in physical and mental health behavior.

"Evaluation of the socio-sanitary and emotional impact caused by SARS-CoV-2 in a Spanish cohort of cancer patients after the second pandemic wave","Background: The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused more than 120 million cases and more than 2 million deaths from its inception until March 2021, causing a great social and emotional impact. Our objective is to evaluate the emotional distress on the cancer population after the second wave and to compare it indirectly with the onset of the pandemic. Methods: Observational, cross-sectional, single-center study of 102 Spanish cancer patients recruited between the months of January and March 2021. Patients of any age, with tumors of any location and in any phase of the disease were included. Socioeconomic, health care and psychological variables have been collected, using the Kessler K-10 scale for the assessment of psychological distress. The association analysis of socio-sanitary variables with emotional variables was carried out using the Chi-square test in SPSS v25. Results: In our cohort, 74% of the cases were between 50 and 74 years old. The most represented tumors were breast (26%) followed by colorectal cancer (18%). 51% were retired people and 19% had temporary work disability, while around 6% were unemployed. 15% reported a change in income and around 19% lived alone without companions. Regarding health variables, 11% had presented symptoms associated with SARS CoV2 infection, 21% reported a longer waiting time for diagnostic test or initiation of oncological treatment, and 17% highlighted a shorter attention time by their medical oncologist. In relation to the emotional impact, a statistically significant relationship (p &lt;0.05) was observed between the female sex and greater nervousness, retired people and less nervousness and despair, as well as the delay in health care and greater feeling of uselessness, despair, restlessness and depression, especially if this occurred more than 1 occasion. Conclusions: the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a worsening of the socioeconomic and health conditions of cancer patients, persisting beyond the second pandemic wave. This is causing a chronification of the psychological impact in this population that could be improved with adequate prevention measures and better health care.

"Emotional distress in cancer patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Madrid","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as the most important international health problem of the last decades. This study explores the psychopathological implications that Covid-19 has caused on cancer patients during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain. Methods: In this prospective study, we included cancer patients in active treatment from March to June 2020. A 24-question semi-structured questionnaire was designed to measure baseline demographic, clinical and Covid-19 exposure characteristics. Mental health was assessed using the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A descriptive and analytical univariate analysis of the variables studied was performed. Results have been compared with baseline emotional distress rates from historical cohorts in cancer patients. Results: 104 cancer patients were included;a 52.8% of emotional distress, 42.3% of anxiety and 58.6% of depression were detected. 51% of patients expressed higher concern about cancer diagnosis vs COVID-19 infection. Tumor type, stage, type of oncologic treatment or rescheduling of cancer therapy were not related with higher levels of psychological symptomatology. Patients with previous consumption of psychotropic drugs and those who adopted additional infection prevention measures because they considered themselves at risk of having a more aggressive COVID-19 disease had higher levels of emotional distress (p=0.008;p=0.003), anxiety (p=0.026;p=0.004) and depression (p=0.013;p=0.008). Emotional distress was higher in patients whose financial status had worsened (p=0.002). Anxiety rates were higher among patients who often used relaxing therapies (p=0.011) and those who were frequently exposed to media (p=0.05). Depression rates were higher among patients with lower educational level (p=0.032), in those whose economic situation had worsened (p=0.003), and those who relied on Religion or Faith (p=0.029). Conclusions: High rates of emotional distress have been detected during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic among cancer patients in active treatment, however, not higher than expected in this population. The cancer disease itself continues to be the main factor of concern for cancer patients, above and beyond the distress generated by Covid-19 pandemic.

"Health-related quality of life, vaccine uptake and immune response among cancer patients undergoing treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Cancer patients are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness because of their systemic immunosuppressive state. The potential effects of cancer and/or anticancer treatments on COVID-19 vaccine response, adverse events and progression are unknown. Moreover, the impacts of financial, familial and societal stressors during the pandemic on health-related quality of life are unclear. To address these concerns, we report data from the ongoing U.S. NCI-funded SeroNet COVID-19 Risk Associations and Longitudinal Evaluation Study (CORALE) at a large health care system in Los Angeles. Methods: Cancer patients are invited to complete questionnaires, donate blood specimens and engage in long-term follow-up with repeat questionnaires and biosampling. Patient-reported outcomes are assessed at baseline, post-vaccination, 6, 12 and 24 months. Clinical information on cancer type, stage, treatment, dates, medications and outcomes (adverse events, SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination and cancer-related outcomes) are extracted from electronic medical records. Results: From December 2019-May 2020, we enrolled 317 patients with malignancies or hematologic disorders (70.0% response rate). The median age was 63 (interquartile range (IQR)=54-73) years, 47% were women, 30% self-identified as non-White minorities and 18% were unable to work due to health status. 3% were known to been infected with SARS-CoV-2. An overall COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate of 80% was reported. Among unvaccinated patients, women expressed more hesitancy than men (p=0.045). Concerns about adverse events (56%), rushed vaccine development (44%), and insufficient knowledge (44%) were reported. Self-reported symptoms after the first dose included injection site pain (21%) and fatigue (11%). We observed low levels of depression and high emotional support. Enrollment is ongoing. Conclusions: Individuals with cancer are a complex and extremely diverse population with a multitude of considerations for both immediate clinical care and long-term survivorship.

"Impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, C19) on medical oncologists (MOs) and cancer care: A Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists (CAMO) survey study","Background: The pandemic has presented professional and personal challenges for the MO workforce. CAMO sought to examine the temporal effects of C19 on MOs and care practices across Canada. Methods: Three serial multiple-choice, web-based surveys were conducted in 2020 â€“ from Mar 30th to April 4th (S1), May 6th to May 15th (S2) and Dec 10th to 18th (S3). The surveys were distributed by email to MOs identified through CAMO and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons directory (n=618). Participation was voluntary with no compensation. Descriptive analyses with frequency distributions are reported. Results: The timing for S1 and S3 coincided with the 1st and 2nd C19 waves in Canada. Response rates decreased slightly: 26% S1, 25% S2 and 20% S3. Per table, demographics were similar across surveys: majority of respondents were from a comprehensive cancer centre and in practice for &lt; 15 years. Concerns regarding PPE access and C19 personal risk decreased over time. A high rate of telemedicine was observed in S1 but this notably decreased by S3, despite the 2nd wave. A similar decreasing trend was observed in the proportion of altered chemotherapy plans due to C19. Similar levels of anxiety, depression, lack of focus and concerns for personal wellness were maintained over time. In S3, respondents noted delayed cancer diagnoses and oncologist burnout as the top 2 post-pandemic challenges, and 87% believed their workload would increase. [Formula presented] Conclusions: As the pandemic continues, positive trends can be observed in concerns around PPE access and C19 risk. A high level of telemedicine adoption was observed early in the pandemic but is decreasing, and chemotherapy plans remained unchanged for most patients. Concerns regarding personal wellness remained high across all 3 surveys. Proactive strategies to support physician wellness, mitigate burnout and manage MO workload are needed.

"1492P A longitudinal cohort study on assessing the impact COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of cancer care providers: Developing world scenario","Background: COVID-19 is one of the most unfortunate events seen in the 21st century due to its outrageous spread and ordeal effect on people. Cancer care providers (CCPs) are under immense mental burden due to the unpredictable pandemic and compromised cancer care amongst patients. Pandemic has taken a toll on the caregivers, be it physically, mentally, or psychosocially. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted from May 2020 to September 2020 to assess the pandemic's impact on mental health amongst the CCP. DASS 21 & PCL5 instruments were used to identify the temporal change with pandemic evolution on mental health. An online survey was administered at three different periods with 6-week intervals through email. Collected data is analyzed using the SPSS 26. Independent variables are presented as categorical data and analyzed using chi-square. Temporal change in the mean scores analyzed using independent t-tests. Various demographic factors were correlated with the DASS 21 scores and PCL 5 scores using logistic regression. Results: The questionnaire was emailed to 240 CCP's;115 responses were valid. Mean age is 29.9 +/- 5.86, 62.6% were male and 27.4% were female respondents. 41.7% were nursing staff, and 58.3% were doctors;67% had less than five years of medical experience. Respondents who stayed with family had significant depression levels in the first and third surveys (OR: 0.37, CI- 0.15-0.91, P=0.03), (OR: 0.17, CI-0.026-1.1, P=0.04). Stress levels were significantly high in the caregivers staying with family in the first survey (OR: 4.38, CI: 1.2-15.7, P=0.02). On analyzing three surveys, 55 respondents in both the first and second survey 21,8,17 respondents persisted in having depression, stress, and anxiety. There was an increase in the stress levels in the third survey when compared to the second survey. Conclusions: In any disaster or an unnatural event, time helps the human mind to adapt to the new conditions;it is similar to our initial results that show improvement in the depression, stress, and anxiety levels with the second survey. It is essential to assess and address the mental health status-related problems to ensure HCW's personal well-being and deliver quality health care to the patients.

"Investigation of grief process on patients with cancer","Background: The aim of this study was to investigate grief continuum on patient who have been diagnosed with cancer. Methods: This descriptive and analytical research was conducted between September 15th and October 31st, 2020 as online survey. The sample of research was formed 408 cancer patient who were reached through cancer groups on social media. Data were collected by using â€œDescriptive Information Question Formâ€, â€œProlonged Grief Disorder Scale-Patient Form (PGD)â€, â€œHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)â€ and â€œMultidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)"". The percentages, averages, One Way ANOVA, t-test, Pearson Correlation test and Post Hoc Bonferroni test were used as to analyse of data. In addition, Multi-Regression Test was performed to determine predictor factor upon correlated variables. Results: Of the participants 82.2% were women and the average age was 47.05Â±10.46. It was found that mean of PGD were significantly higher on participants who are primary-secondary school graduates, not working actively, having lower social-economic income and having metastasis. Most of patientâ€™s cancer treatments were not affected and interrupted by COVID-19 pandemic. There was mild and negative but statistically significant correlation among the score of PGD and age, MPSS;and strong positive statistically significant correlation among the score of PGD and anxiety and depression. These variables explained at the rate of %57 on PGD. It was revealed that anxiety was a predictor factor of PGD in a result of multi regression test. Conclusions: Firstly the score of PGD were higher on patients who have low social-economic income, do not working, have metastasis and have treatments interrupted cancer treatments by COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, the score of PGD was decreasing with age and increasing with anxiety and depression. Lastly anxiety was a predictor of PGD. In the light of the results, we suggested that oncology and CLP nurses and physicians who work with cancer patient, should have the awareness that cancer patient might have PGD. Secondly, the patients who have high level anxiety or diagnosed with anxiety disorder should be scanned in terms of PGD. Lastly, the effectiveness of the initiatives for PGD should be evaluated for future research. Legal entity responsible for the study: The author. Funding: Has not received any funding.

"1109P The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with NETs: Between resilience and vulnerability","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed lifestyles and quality of life (QoL) of the global population. Little is known regarding the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or bronchopulmonary (BP) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Methods: We prospectively evaluated seven specific constructs (depression, anxiety, stress, QoL, NET-related QoL, patient-physician relationship, psychological distress) by using validated screening instruments including the Depression anxiety stress scale-21 (DASS-21), the EORTC QLQ-C30, the EORTC QLQ GI.NET21, the patient doctor relationship questionnaire 9 (PDRQ9) and the Impact of event scale-revised (IES-R). Mental symptoms and concerns of patients with any stage, well-differentiated GEP or BP-NET were surveyed twice, during the plateau phase of the first (W1) and second epidemic waves (W2) in Italy. Results: We enrolled 197 patients (98 males) with a median age of 62 years (G1/G2: 96%;pancreas: 29%;small bowel: 25%;active treatment: 38%). At W1, the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was 32%, 36% and 26% respectively. The frequency of depression and anxiety increased to 38% and 41% at W2, with no modifications in the frequency of stress. By ordinal logistic regression analysis, female patients showed more severe forms of stress at W1 (OR=0.45Â±0.14;p=0.01), while the educational status was associated with the levels of anxiety at both W1 (OR=1.33Â±0.22;p=0.07) and W2 (OR=1.45Â±0.26;p=0.03). An improvement of the physical (p=0.03) and emotional functioning domains (p=0.001) was observed over time. Both nausea/vomiting (p=0.0002), appetite (p=0.02), treatment-related symptoms (p=0.005), disease-related worries (p=0.0006) and sexual function (p=0.02) improved between W1 and W2, suggesting that NET patients were able to cope with the perturbations caused by the pandemic. No difference was seen between W1 and W2 in the mean score (&gt;4/5) of the PDRQ9. By IES-R, post-traumatic stress disorder was observed in 53% of patients at W2. Conclusions: The implementation of psychological interventions within NET clinics might favor functional coping strategies, attenuating the psychological distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA AND PTSD DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A NARRATIVE REVIEW","As of August 9, 2021, there have been around 203 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease (2019) COVID-19, including 4.3 million deaths. Adverse psychological effects are expected to be long-lasting in vulnerable groups, especially among frontline healthcare workers, given the magnitude of the crisis. Observing strict quarantine and social distancing measures, while being an important strategy to curb the spread, have also led to a significant negative impact on mental health indicators;the long-term consequences are yet to be assessed on a global scale. A medical crisis may become a mental health crisis and the updated findings are reviewed in this paper to provide an updated brief for immunological, occupational, socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, psychological predictors while commenting on care recommendations to prevent psychological trauma from progressing to PTSD.","Sarfraz, A.; Sarfraz, Z.; Bano, S.; Sarfraz, M.; Razzack, A.

"When coping resources fail: the health-sustaining and moderating role of fortitude in the relationship between COVID-19-related worries and psychological distress","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health crisis and governments worldwide have attempted to mitigate the spread of the virus by implementing a range of stringent preventative measures. However, both the pandemic and the preventative strategies enacted may undercut critical protective factors that are known to buffer the negative impact of psychological stressors. The current study aimed to characterise the mental health impact of the pandemic in South Africa by investigating the potential protective role of fortitude in the relationship between COVID-19-related worries and psychological distress, indicated by the levels of depression and hopelessness. The participants were 337 young adults who completed four self-report questionnaires: the Fortitude Questionnaire, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Centre for Epidemiological Depression Scale and the COVID19-Related Worries Scale. In addition to descriptive statistics, path analysis was performed to determine the direct, indirect, mediating and moderating effects of fortitude on psychological distress. In this regard, psychological distress was conceptualised as a latent variable that is defined by the two indices of depression and hopelessness. The results demonstrated unprecedented levels of hopelessness and depression among the study sample. These levels were significantly higher than those encountered in previous studies in other contexts, suggesting a possible mental health crisis in the country. Women reported higher levels of psychological distress than men. On its own, fortitude had significant direct effects on psychological distress, affirming its role as a protective factor. However, fortitude was found to have an aggravating rather than buffering effect in interaction with worries. In this regard, the relationship between COVID-19-related worries and psychological distress was stronger among those with high levels of fortitude.","Padmanabhanunni, A.; Pretorius, T.

"Measures of depressive symptoms using beck depression inventory-ii among healthcare professionals during a pandemic of covid-19","The present study was carried out to assess the level of depressive symptoms among health-care professionals (HCPs) during the unprecedented time of COVID-19 using Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) in Karachi, Pakistan. This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted using BDI-II containing 21 questionnaires for the determination of depressive symptoms among HCPs including physi-cians, pharmacists, dentists, and other healthcare personnel working in a metropolitan city of Karachi, from February 2020 to May 2020. The survey forms were distributed electronically after obtaining written consent of respondents. One-way ANOVA test was used to evaluate the association between independents variables and BDI-II items. In the current research, out of 500 HCPs, only 328 completed the form. The mean age of the respondents was 36.32 Â± 5.23 years. The outcomes revealed that the respondents stated mild levels of depression (mean = 10.69 Â± 9.4). Cronbachâ€™s alpha or internal consistency reliability coeffi-cients for depression score was 0.903. Corrected item-total correlations were satisfactory. It was observed that the majority of BDI-II items were found to be significantly associated with the experience and profes-sion of respondents. The HCPs showed mild to moderate depression symptoms during the COVID-19. To avoid the switching of the psychological impact from moderate to severe, strategies should be designed and implemented by the government and health care bodies to overcome psychological distress among HCPs.","Iffat, W.; Nesar, S.; Shakeel, S.; Qamar, A.; Nazar, S.; Rahim, M.; Tariq, A.

"Predictors of burnout for frontline nurses in the COVID-19 pandemic: Well-being, satisfaction with life, social support, fear, work setting factors, psychological impacts, and self-efficacy for nursing tasks","The online convenience sample of 249 nurses all treated COVID-19 patients in the past year-with 45.0% in the emergency department and 36.9% in intensive care. Nurses were 68.7% female with a mean age of 32.17 years, as well as mostly white (69.1%). Some 28.5% had COVID-19, with 16.1% testing positive more than once in the past year.Using paired t-tests comparing scores for before versus during the pandemic, their physical health status and mental/emotional status were each significantly worse during the pandemic, their level of self-efficacy for performing nursing tasks was significantly worse during the pandemic, and their fear level was significantly higher during the pandemic. Nurses negotiated the pandemic with just moderate social support, while having moderate work setting concerns (e.g., safety), and rating the work climate as ""to some extent"" less favorable than before the pandemic. Nurses suffered moderate burnout using the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory-while females suffered higher burnout than males (p = .000) and non-whites higher burnout than whites. Past month mean Perceived Stress Scale scores were moderate. Nurses used alcohol/drugs closest to 30% of the time to cope with stress, while 35.7% increased use during the pandemic. They reported moderate mental distress over the past year, while 61.0% reported insomnia, 57.4% anxiety, 39.0% depression, 35.7% trauma, and 27.3% received counseling. Nurses reported moderate well-being over the past two weeks, and moderately high satisfaction with life. Backward stepwise regression found higher burnout significantly predicted by: fewer years working in nursing;higher Body Mass Index;more concerns at work (e.g., safety);higher past month perceived stress;higher past year mental distress;and, lower past two weeks' well-being-with 52.2% of the variance predicted.

"Early emotion regulation in the children of superstorm Sandy","Rising prevalence of childhood psychopathology mandate investigation into the antecedents of symptom onset. Growing evidence shows prenatal maternal stress experienced in utero is a strong contributor to offspring neurodevelopmental deficits, including emotion dysregulation, a core feature of many types of psychopathology. This dissertation summarizes a body of work studying children prenatally exposed to maternal stress related to a natural disaster, Superstorm Sandy (i.e., storm stress). This work includes six experiments conducted in the framework of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. The DOHaD hypothesis posits that developmental disruptions, like storm stress exposure, during a critical period of developmental, like gestation, can have long term influences on health. The first experiment explores infant behavioral temperament and shows correlations between objective stressors related to the storm and poor regulation and negative affect. Experiment 2 demonstrates that associations between temperament and a sympathetic nervous system measure, electrodermal activity (EDA), vary by child sex. Experiment 3 shows that prenatal storm stress is associated with increased EDA in girls, and decreased EDA in boys. Experiment 4 describes an interaction between prenatal storm stress and maternal depression predicting blunted offspring EDA in early childhood. Experiments 5 and 6 present preliminary findings that children prenatally exposed to storm stress exhibit differential prefrontal-limbic structure and amygdala function, respectively. Future work should expand the current sample, which was hampered by the Covid-19 pandemic, consider maternal mental health history in more depth, and continue to follow the trajectory of neurodevelopment of children affected by Superstorm Sandy. The vulnerability of pregnant people and their children, and how they can best be supported in the face of widespread disasters, needs to be more thoroughly studied as well. This knowledge may inform public health officials and mental health professionals in best practices to mitigate the impact of stressors, especially during pregnancy, and improve psychological wellbeing and optimal neurodevelopment in vulnerable people.

"Effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers on COVID-19 outcome: A Record Based Observational Study in West Bengal","BACKGROUND: Since its first identification in December 2019, in WUHAN (CHINA), SARS-COV-2, causative agent of Corona virus pandemic, has affected millions of people worldwide, causing thousands of death. There is much speculation about the interplay between ACEI/ARB and Corona virus infection, as for internalization into host cell SARS-COV-2 binds through S spike protein to ACE-2, aided TMPRSS2. METHODS: A record based observational study has been conducted (data obtained from the clinics of fourteen physicians) in two worst affected districts of West Bengal, to find out the association of ACEI/ARB on patients, suffering from Corona virus infection. The study-protocol has already been approved by Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. (IEC Ref. No: CREC-STM/2020-AS-37) Results: Increasing age, male sex and presence of co-morbidities (viz. Diabetes, COPD) are significantly associated with the occurrence of moderate and severe disease. Drugs (viz. ACEI/ARB), though are associated with less severe disease, have not achieved statistical significance, in the present study. CONCLUSION: Drugs, like ACEI/ARB, should be continued in patients suffering from COVID-19 infection, (if they are already on these drugs).

"Changes in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic: exploring gender differences and the role of emotional distress; Modifications de la consommation d'alcool pendant la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19 : exploration des diffÃ©rences selon le genre et du rÃ´le de la dÃ©tresse Ã©motionnelle","INTRODUCTION: Restrictions to do with the COVID-19 pandemic have had substantial unintended consequences on Canadians' alcohol consumption patterns, including increased emotional distress and its potential impact on alcohol use. This study examines 1) changes in adults' alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; 2) whether drinking more frequently during the pandemic is associated with increased feelings of stress, loneliness and hopelessness; and 3) whether gender moderates this relationship. METHODS: Participants were drawn from a cross-sectional survey of 2000 adults. Adjusted multinomial regression models were used to assess the association between drinking frequency and increased feelings of stress, loneliness and hopelessness. Additional analyses were stratified by gender. RESULTS: About 12% of respondents reported drinking more frequently after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 25%-40% reported increased emotional distress. Increased feelings of stress (odds ratio [OR] = 1.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-2.93), loneliness (OR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.22-2.61) and hopelessness (OR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.21-3.23) were all associated with drinking more frequently during the pandemic. While women respondents reported higher rates of emotional distress, significant associations with increased drinking frequency were only observed among men in gender-stratified analyses. CONCLUSION: Individuals who report increased feelings of stress, loneliness and hopelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to report increased drinking frequency; however, these associations were only significant for men in stratified analyses. Understanding how the pandemic is associated with mental health and drinking may inform alcohol control policies and public health interventions to minimize alcohol-related harm.","Thompson, Kara; Dutton, Daniel J; MacNabb, Kathleen; Liu, Tong; Blades, Sarah; Asbridge, Mark","https://dx.doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.41.9.02","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can;41(9): 254-263, 2021 09 22.; Publication details: Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can;41(9): 254-263, 2021 09 22.; Alcohol Drinking/epidemiology; Alcohol Drinking/psychology; COVID-19/psychology; Hope; Loneliness; Psychological Distress; Adult; Aged; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/prevention & control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Brunswick; Nova Scotia; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20568,""
"Prevalence and Factors Associated with Postpartum Depression in Primary Healthcare Centres in Yangon, Myanmar","Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) can have serious consequences on both the mother and infant. Despite the higher prevalence, there are limited numbers of studies on PPD in low-and middle-income countries, like Myanmar. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and associated factors of PPD in primary healthcare settings in Myanmar. Methods: This cross-sectional online study was conducted with 220 mothers under 6 months postpartum in April-May 2020 and who registered in public health centres in Kungyangone Township, Yangon, Myanmar. The postpartum depression was measured with the Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS, &#8805; 13 scores). Independent variables included sociodemographic factors, obstetric and infant factors, psychosocial factors (social support and social media usage), health services utilisation and accessibility factors. Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression were performed. Results: Overall prevalence of depressive symptoms in 220 women under 6 months postpartum was 31.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.9, 37.3). In multiple logistic regression, unplanned pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.946), less than four times antenatal care (ANC) visits (AOR: 2.518), travel time more than 1 h to reach health centres (AOR: 3.068) and birth interval more than 5 years (AOR: 4.594) were more likely to be associated with PPD, while preterm delivery (AOR: 0.091) was inversely associated. Conclusion: This study showed the relatively high prevalence of PPD and the strong association with preterm delivery, pregnancy intention, breastfeeding status, birth interval as well as frequency of ANC received and travel time to health centre. It may suggest that maternal mental health services should be integrated with existing maternal and child health (MCH) services for early detection and prevention of depression symptoms with promotion of MCH services utilisation and improved accessibility among mothers in primary healthcare setting.","Myo, Theigi; Hong, Seo Ah; Thepthien, Bang-On; Hongkrailert, Nate","https://dx.doi.org/10.21315/mjms2021.28.4.8","","Country: MY; MALÃSIA; MALAYSIA; MALASIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Malays J Med Sci;28(4): 71-86, 2021 Aug.; Publication details: Malays J Med Sci;28(4): 71-86, 2021 Aug.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20569,""
"The State of Mind of Health Care Professionals in Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Text Analysis Study of Twitter Discourses","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected populations worldwide, with extreme health, economic, social, and political implications. Health care professionals (HCPs) are at the core of pandemic response and are among the most crucial factors in maintaining coping capacities. Yet, they are also vulnerable to mental health effects caused by managing a long-lasting emergency with a lack of resources and under complicated personal concerns. However, there are a lack of longitudinal studies that investigate the HCP population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the state of mind of HCPs as expressed in online discussions published on Twitter in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the onset of the pandemic until the end of 2020. METHODS: The population for this study was selected from followers of a few hundred Twitter accounts of health care organizations and common HCP points of interest. We used active learning, a process that iteratively uses machine learning and manual data labeling, to select the large-scale population of Twitter accounts maintained by English-speaking HCPs, focusing on individuals rather than official organizations. We analyzed the topics and emotions in their discourses during 2020. The topic distributions were obtained using the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm. We defined a measure of topic cohesion and described the most cohesive topics. The emotions expressed in tweets during 2020 were compared to those in 2019. Finally, the emotion intensities were cross-correlated with the pandemic waves to explore possible associations between the pandemic development and emotional response. RESULTS: We analyzed the timelines of 53,063 Twitter profiles, 90% of which were maintained by individual HCPs. Professional topics accounted for 44.5% of tweets by HCPs from January 1, 2019, to December 6, 2020. Events such as the pandemic waves, US elections, or the George Floyd case affected the HCPs' discourse. The levels of joy and sadness exceeded their minimal and maximal values from 2019, respectively, 80% of the time (P=.001). Most interestingly, fear preceded the pandemic waves, in terms of the differences in confirmed cases, by 2 weeks with a Spearman correlation coefficient of &#961;(47 pairs)=0.340 (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of longitudinal data over the year 2020 revealed that a large fraction of HCP discourse is directly related to professional content, including the increase in the volume of discussions following the pandemic waves. The changes in emotional patterns (ie, decrease in joy and increase in sadness, fear, and disgust) during the year 2020 may indicate the utmost importance in providing emotional support for HCPs to prevent fatigue, burnout, and mental health disorders during the postpandemic period. The increase in fear 2 weeks in advance of pandemic waves indicates that HCPs are in a position, and with adequate qualifications, to anticipate pandemic development, and could serve as a bottom-up pathway for expressing morbidity and clinical situations to health agencies.","Elyashar, Aviad; Plochotnikov, Ilia; Cohen, Idan-Chaim; Puzis, Rami; Cohen, Odeya","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/30217","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(10): e30217, 2021 10 22.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(10): e30217, 2021 10 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20570,""
"""Skip the Small Talk"" Virtual Event Intended to Promote Social Connection During a Global Pandemic: Online Survey Study","BACKGROUND: Social distancing measures meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the past year have exacerbated loneliness and depression in the United States. While virtual tools exist to improve social connections, there have been limited attempts to assess community-based, virtual methods to promote new social connections. OBJECTIVE: In this proof-of-concept study, we examined the extent to which Skip the Small Talk (STST)-a business dedicated to hosting events to facilitate structured, vulnerable conversations between strangers-helped reduce loneliness in a virtual format in the early months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. We predicted that participants who attended STST virtual events would show a reduction in loneliness, improvement in positive affect, and reduction in negative affect after attending an event. We were also interested in exploring the role of depression symptoms on these results as well as the types of goals participants accomplished by attending STST events. METHODS: Adult participants who registered for an STST virtual event between March 25 and June 30, 2020, completed a survey before attending the event (pre-event survey; N=64) and a separate survey after attending the event (postevent survey; n=25). Participants reported on their depression symptoms, loneliness, and positive and negative affect. Additionally, participants reported the goals they wished to accomplish as well as those they actually accomplished by attending the STST event. RESULTS: The four most cited goals that participants hoped to accomplish before attending the STST event included the following: ""to make new friends,"" ""to have deeper/better conversations with other people,"" ""to feel less lonely,"" and ""to practice social skills."" A total of 34% (20/58) of participants who completed the pre-event survey reported depression symptoms that indicated a high risk of a major depressive episode in the preceding 2 weeks. Of the 25 participants who completed the pre- and postevent surveys, participants reported a significant reduction in loneliness (P=.03, Cohen d=0.48) and negative affect (P<.001, Cohen d=1.52) after attending the STST event compared to before the event. Additionally, depressive symptoms were significantly positively correlated with change in negative affect (P=.03), suggesting that the higher the depression score was prior to attending the STST event, the higher the reduction in negative affect was following the event. Finally, 100% of the participants who wished to reduce their loneliness (11/11) or feel less socially anxious (5/5) prior to attending the STST event reported that they accomplished those goals after the event. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary assessment suggests that the virtual format of STST was helpful for reducing loneliness and negative affect for participants, including those experiencing depression symptoms, during the COVID-19 pandemic. While encouraging, additional research is necessary to demonstrate whether STST has benefits when compared to other social events and interventions and whether such benefits persist beyond the events themselves.","Mote, Jasmine; Gill, Kathryn; Fulford, Daniel","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/28002","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e28002, 2021 Sep 23.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e28002, 2021 Sep 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20571,""
"Pretesting a Poster on Recommended Stress Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia: Qualitative Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) is a self-report questionnaire developed to evaluate the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms among individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent study in China showed high CPDI scores among individuals in the 18-30 years age group and those over 60 years. During the COVID-19 outbreak, people were expected to maintain their mental health conditions, especially stress levels. Therefore, many national governments actively published health promotion media in an effort to educate the public. One such media developed by the Ministry of Health, Republic of Indonesia, was a poster titled ""Hindari Stres dan Tetap Optimis dengan Melakukan Aktivitas Sehari-hari dan Tetap Menjaga Jarak."" OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a test on a stress management recommendation poster developed by the Ministry of Health, Republic of Indonesia, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak by using pretesting communication theory. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted among 8 key informants and 1 graphic design expert. RESULTS: Pretesting can identify the strengths and weaknesses of media. The large amount of text and the lack of illustrations made the poster less attractive to readers. Moreover, there was a discrepancy between the title and contents of the poster. The poster was not able to persuade the informants to change their behavior in the near future. CONCLUSIONS: The poster was understood and accepted by the informants, but there was still much to be improved considering the poster was a product of the Ministry of Health, Republic of Indonesia.","Wati, Risa Laras; Ulfa, Annisa Sayyidatul; Kevaladandra, Zulfa; Shalihat, Shelly; Syahadatina, Bella; Pratomo, Hadi","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25615","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e25615, 2021 Sep 23.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e25615, 2021 Sep 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20572,""

"Suicide reduction in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons informing national prevention strategies for suicide reduction","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of federal, public health and social support programs on national suicide rates in Canada. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Canadian National Database (i.e., Statistics Canada) and Statista. PARTICIPANTS: Population-level data, and economic and consumer market data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suicide mortality data, population data and unemployment data were obtained from available statistical databases (e.g. Statistics Canada). We quantified suicide rate by dividing the total number of suicide deaths by the national population expressed as a rate per 100,000 population. RESULTS: Overall suicide mortality rate decreased in Canada from 10.82 deaths per 100,000 in the March 2019 - February 2020 period to 7.34 per 100,000 (i.e. absolute difference of 1300 deaths) in the March 2020 - February 2021 period. The overall Canadian unemployment rate changed from an average monthly rate of 5.7% in 2019 to 9.5% in 2020. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that for the first post-pandemic interval evaluated (i.e., March 2020 - February 2021), suicide rates in Canada decreased against a background of extraordinary public health measures intended to mitigate community spread of COVID-19. An externality of public health measures was a significant rise in national unemployment rates in population measures of distress. Our results suggest that government interventions that broadly aim to reduce measures of insecurity (i.e., economic, housing, health), and timely psychiatric services, should be prioritised as part of a national suicide reduction strategy, not only during but after termination of the COVID-19 pandemic.","McIntyre, Roger S; Lui, Leanna Mw; Rosenblat, Joshua D; Ho, Roger; Gill, Hartej; Mansur, Rodrigo B; Teopiz, Kayla; Liao, Yuhua; Lu, Ciyong; Subramaniapillai, Mehala; Nasri, Flora; Lee, Yena","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01410768211043186","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J R Soc Med;114(10): 473-479, 2021 10.; Publication details: J R Soc Med;114(10): 473-479, 2021 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20574,""
"Anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic umbrella review of the global evidence","OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence relating to the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: An umbrella review of systematic reviews was undertaken using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methods. DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane database of systematic reviews, JBI Evidence Synthesis, MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL were searched in March 2021 for reviews published in English. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Systematic reviews reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers screened each abstract and independently reviewed full text articles. Study quality was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews, and the degree of overlap in primary studies was calculated. RESULTS: Ten systematic reviews (100 unique studies), including 169 157 HCWs from 35 countries were included. The prevalence of anxiety among all HCWs ranged from 22.2% (95% CI 21.3% to 23.1%) to 33.0% (95% CI 31.9% to 34.1%). The prevalence of anxiety among physicians (n=5820) was reported to be between 17% and 19.8% and for nurses (n=14 938) between 22.8% and 27%. The prevalence of depression among all HCWs ranged from 17.9% (95% CI 17.1% to 18.8%) to 36% (95% CI 34.9% to 37.1%). The prevalence of depression among physicians (n=643) and nurses (n=8063) was reported to be 40.4% and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation evident in the presence of anxiety and depression among HCWs. In particular, the prevalence of depression among physicians was high. Strategies to reduce the incidence of anxiety and depression are urgently required.

"Effectiveness of a brief positive skills intervention to improve psychological adjustment in patients with end-stage kidney disease newly initiated on haemodialysis: protocol for a randomised controlled trial (HED-Start)","INTRODUCTION: Initiation onto haemodialysis is a critical transition that entails multiple psychosocial and behavioural demands that can compound mental health burden. Interventions guided by self-management and cognitive-behavioural therapy to improve distress have been variably effective yet are resource-intensive or delivered reactively. Interventions with a focus on positive affect for patients with end-stage kidney disease are lacking. This study will seek (1) to develop a positive life skills intervention (HED-Start) combining evidence and stakeholder/user involvement and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of HED-Start to facilitate positive life skills acquisition and improve symptoms of distress and adjustment in incident haemodialysis patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single/assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare HED-Start to usual care. In designing HED-Start, semistructured interviews, a codesign workshop and an internal pilot will be undertaken, followed by a two-arm parallel RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of HED-Start. A total of 148 incident HD patients will be randomised using a 1:2 ratio into usual care versus HED-Start to be delivered in groups by trained facilitators between January 2021 and September 2022. Anxiety and depression will be the primary outcomes; secondary outcomes will be positive and negative affect, quality of life, illness perceptions, self-efficacy, self-management skills, benefit finding and resilience. Assessments will be taken at 2 weeks prerandomisation (baseline) and 3 months postrandomisation (2 weeks post-HED-Start completion). Primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach and compare changes in outcomes from baseline to follow-up relative to the control group using mixed-effect models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from Nanyang Technological University Institutional Review Board (IRB-2019-01-010).

"Impact of COVID-19 and other infectious conditions requiring isolation on the provision of and adaptations to fundamental nursing care in hospital in terms of overall patient experience, care quality, functional ability, and treatment outcomes: systematic review","AIM: This systematic review identifies, appraises and synthesizes the evidence on the provision of fundamental nursing care to hospitalized patients with a highly infectious virus and the effectiveness of adaptations to overcome barriers to care. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: In July 2020, we searched Medline, PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), BNI (ProQuest), WHO COVID-19 Database (https://search.bvsalud.org/) MedRxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org/), bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/) and also Google Scholar, TRIP database and NICE Evidence, forwards citation searching and reference checking of included papers, from 2016 onwards. REVIEW METHODS: We included quantitative and qualitative research reporting (i) the views, perceptions and experiences of patients who have received fundamental nursing care whilst in hospital with COVID-19, MERS, SARS, H1N1 or EVD or (ii) the views, perceptions and experiences of professional nurses and non-professionally registered care workers who have provided that care. We included review articles, commentaries, protocols and guidance documents. One reviewer performed data extraction and quality appraisal and was checked by another person. RESULTS: Of 3086 references, we included 64 articles; 19 empirical research and 45 review articles, commentaries, protocols and guidance documents spanning five pandemics. Four main themes (and 11 sub-themes) were identified. Barriers to delivering fundamental care were wearing personal protective equipment, adequate staffing, infection control procedures and emotional challenges of care. These barriers were addressed by multiple adaptations to communication, organization of care, staff support and leadership. CONCLUSION: To prepare for continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics, evaluative studies of adaptations to fundamental healthcare delivery must be prioritized to enable evidence-based care to be provided in future. IMPACT: Our review identifies the barriers nurses experience in providing fundamental care during a pandemic, highlights potential adaptations that address barriers and ensure positive healthcare experiences and draws attention to the need for evaluative research on fundamental care practices during pandemics.","Whear, Rebecca; Abbott, Rebecca A; Bethel, Alison; Richards, David A; Garside, Ruth; Cockcroft, Emma; Iles-Smith, Heather; Logan, Pip A; Rafferty, Ann Marie; Shepherd, Maggie; Sugg, Holly V R; Russell, Anne Marie; Cruickshank, Susanne; Tooze, Susannah; Melendez-Torres, G J; Thompson Coon, Jo","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jan.15047","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Adv Nurs;2021 Sep 23.; Publication details: J Adv Nurs;2021 Sep 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20577,""

"Psychological and behavioral responses during the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals with mobility and/or self-care disabilities","BACKGROUND: The lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic created major obstacles for individuals with disabilities to obtain support in their daily living. OBJECTIVES: This study was to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of US individuals with mobility and/or self-care disabilities during the pandemic. METHODS: From a nationally representative longitudinal survey (nÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯6403) administered during the pandemic, individuals were classified at baseline as having no mobility/self-care disability (ADLÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯0, nÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯4975), mobility or self-care disability (ADLÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯1, nÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯1061), and both mobility and self-care disabilities (ADLÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯2, nÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯367). Weighted mean of baseline mental distress scores (PHQ4), psychological risk factors (loneliness, stress, perceived COVID risk), resilience, and coping were compared among these groups. Random effects models were employed to assess the effects of disability and disability-moderated effects of risk factors on mental distress. RESULTS: At baseline, mental distress increased with greater ADL disabilities (Mean[95%CI]Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯1.88[1.77, 1.98], 2.54[2.29, 2.79], and 3.55[3.01, 4.08] for ADLÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯0, 1, and 2, respectively, pÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯<Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯.0001). Loneliness, stress, and perceived risk increased with ADL disabilities, but resilience and social coping decreased with it (p'sÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯<Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯0.0001). In the random-effects models, greater ADL disabilities, higher psychological risks, and use of cannabis and other recreational drugs were associated with greater mental distress. Greater ADL disabilities augmented the detrimental effects of risk factors on mental health, but resilience protected mental health both independently and through a buffering effect on its risk factors across all groups. CONCLUSION: Individuals with mobility and/or self-care disability tend to have poorer mental health and are differentially more affected by its risk factors. Mental health professionals should address these modifiable factors in interventions.","Na, Ling; Yang, Lixia","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101216","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Disabil Health J;: 101216, 2021 Sep 21.; Publication details: Disabil Health J;: 101216, 2021 Sep 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20579,""
"[COVID-19 Pandemic What have we learned?]; Pandemia COVID-19 Â¿Que Hemos Aprendido En Este Tiempo?","Since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in March 2020, we have learned a lot about the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and its role in pediatric pathology.Children are infected in a rate quite similar to adults, although in most cases they suffer mild or asymptomatic symptoms. Around 1% of those infected require hospitalization, less than 0.02% require intensive care, and mortality is very low and generally in children with comorbidities. The most common clinical diagnosis are upper or lower respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infection and, more seriously, multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Most episodes do not require treatment, except for MIS-C. Remdesivir has been widely used as a compassionate treatment and its role has yet to be defined.The newborn can become infected, although vertical transmission is very low (<1%) and it has been shown that the baby can safely cohabit with its mother and be breastfed. In general, neonatal infections have been mild.Primary care has supported a very important part of the management of the pandemic in pediatrics. There have been numerous collateral damage derived from the difficulty of access to care and the isolation suffered by children. The mental health of the pediatric population has been seriously affected. Although it has been shown that schooling has not led to an increase in infections, but rather the opposite. It is essential to continue maintaining the security measures that make schools a safe place, so necessary not only for children's education, but for their health in general.","Calvo, Cristina; Tagarro, Alfredo; EchevarrÃ­a, Ana MÃ©ndez; Colomer, BelÃ©n Fernandez; Rosa AlbaÃ±il Ballesteros, MÂª; Bassat, Quique; JosÃ© Mellado PeÃ±as, MÂª","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2021.09.006","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: An Pediatr (Engl Ed);2021 Sep 23.; Publication details: An Pediatr (Engl Ed);2021 Sep 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20580,""

The vaccination willingness among healthcare workers is of particular interest, as these groups play aÂ key role in the pandemic response. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated how the willingness of healthcare workers in Germany to get vaccinated depends on sociodemographic, occupational, and COVID-19-specific characteristics, as well as mental health. METHODS: Between November 2020 and January 2021, 6217 employees in the German healthcare system were questioned about their vaccination willingness, sociodemographic, occupational, COVID-19-specific, and psychosocial characteristics using the online VOICE survey within the framework of the University Medicine Network (NUM). RESULTS: The vaccination willingness of the sample group was 65.3%. AÂ higher vaccination willingness was associated with male gender; age >Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯40Â years; having no children or no migration background; not working in direct patient care; belonging to aÂ COVID-19 risk group or professional group of physicians and psychologists in comparison with nursing staff; feeling sufficiently informed about COVID-19 and protected by the measures of the national or local authorities and the employer; fear of infection; and lack of signs of depression. Physicians showed the highest willingness to get vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, an overall moderate vaccination willingness against COVID-19 in the health sector was described. Information about the disease and vaccination, especially for younger people, females, and non-physicians, adequate protective measures and prevention of depressive symptoms could increase the vaccination willingness.","Schug, Caterina; Erim, Yesim; Geiser, Franziska; Hiebel, Nina; Beschoner, Petra; Jerg-Bretzke, Lucia; Albus, Christian; Weidner, Kerstin; Steudte-Schmiedgen, Susann; Borho, Andrea; Lieb, Marietta; Morawa, Eva","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00103-021-03418-6","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz;2021 Sep 23.; Publication details: Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz;2021 Sep 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20581,""

"The outcomes of COVID-19 epidemic crisis on the elderly: A review study","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has led to more than 111,973,202 confirmed cases, and more than 2,478,409 deaths worldwide. Mortality rates are significantly higher in the elderly than in others during the epidemic of COVID-19;age is significant vulnerabilities to COVID-19. Analysis of clinical features according to the latest published data allows better understanding and better clinical judgment. Methods: In this review study, using the keywords, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus, viral and elderly pneumonia, pandemic, epidemic, quarantine, mental health, and social isolation in articles indexed in Embase, Proquest, Pub med, Google Scholar, Science direct, Scopus, Medline, Cochrane databases from December 2019 to February 2020, were searched. Findings: The elderly of more than 65-year-old are classified in high-risk groups, are more vulnerable than other age groups, and require more attention. Social isolation, social distance, and lockdown has raised concerns about their mental health to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Conclusion: Due to the increasing population of the elderly, such biological disasters, if do not take care of and pay enough attention to the various dimensions and problems caused by its consequences, would affect acute and long-term consequences on community health and general health of the elderly.

"Waiving COVID-19 Vaccine Patents: A Bad Idea and a Dangerous Precedent: Research and Regulation","The Biden Administration believes that suspending COVID-19 vaccine patents will expedite the swift development of high quality â€œcheapâ€ versions of existing vaccines and hasten the pandemicâ€™s end. This view is dangerously wrong. Vaccinating the world is essential, but temporarily waiving patent rights for COVID-19 vaccines (also known as â€œcompulsory licensingâ€) will actually slow their availability to the developing world. While providing no gain, compulsory licensing promises lots of pain. Waiving patent protection discourages cutting-edge research investments, which in turn produce breakthrough treatments not just for COVID-19, but for other diseases, like cancer. Weakening these protections would be anti-patient and counterproductive. The reality is that, in order to save the world, we must all work together as partners. The remarkable speed with which we developed diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines to combat COVID-19 points to the need for more collaboration, not less. Patents are a foundational principle upon which that success rests. While the policy of temporarily waiving patents seems fair and humanitarian, the devil is in the details. Such a policy will not result in a single citizen of the developing world getting vaccinated one minute sooner. In fact, the unintended consequences are the reverse. More confusion, lower quality, less transnational cooperation. A triple play of disastrous global proportions.","Pitts, Peter J.; Popovian, Robert, Weingarden, Wayne","https://doi.org/10.5912/jcb987","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Commercial Biotechnology; 26(2), 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Commercial Biotechnology; 26(2), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20585,""
"Could COVID-19 Cause â€˜Biopharmingâ€™ to Bloom?: Research and Regulation","At an accelerated rate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, academic and corporate scientists are using genetic engineering techniques to reprogram plants to produce significant concentrations of high-value pharmaceuticals. The concept is not new. Many common medicines, such as certain opiates, the laxative Metamucil, and the anti-cancer drug Taxol, are all purified from plants, and efficacy has been shown for some herbals in Traditional Chinese Medicine. There is great potential for cost-cutting in the process: The energy for product synthesis comes from the sun, and the primary raw materials are water and carbon dioxide. In addition, biopharming offers tremendous flexibility and economy when adjustments in production are necessary. The need for inexpensive, flexible production techniques for COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines could be a potent stimulus to biopharming research and development.","Hefferon, Kathleen, Miller, Henry","https://doi.org/10.5912/jcb941","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Commercial Biotechnology; 25(3), 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Commercial Biotechnology; 25(3), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20586,""
"Working in a Pandemic Hospital during COVID-19 Outbreak: Current Conditions and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Levels","Objective: Healthcare workers (HCW), who actively participate in combating the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, may experience rage and anxiety due to the high performance expected from them. This study aimed to reveal how working in a pandemic hospital affects the psychological status of healthcare professionals. Methods: 446 HCW, working frontline in a pandemic hospital, were included the study. Questions including basic demographic data and exposure risks to COVID-19 and depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21) were used as data collection tools. The forms were delivered online, and the responses were similarly collected. Results: DASS-21 scores of 384 (86.1%) HCW, who had contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19, were found to be higher than HCW who did not have contact with the patients. When we evaluated the scores of DASS-21, the scores were higher in women (p&lt;0.01), HCW diagnosed with COVID-19 among their colleagues (p&lt;0.01), and HCW with relatives diagnosed with COVID-19. Anxiety scores of nurses (p&lt;0.05) and single HCW, were also high (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: While the world continues to fight the COVID-19 outbreak, HCW are emotionally affected in this intense process. Providing psychosocial support and intervention to cover all healthcare professionals should be targeted by decision makers.

"Mental Health Challenges of Young Labor Migrants from the Healthcare Professionals Perspective: Lessons Learned from a Multi-Country Meeting","The mental health of young labor immigrants (YLIâ€™s) is a public health issue that has become notably more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is well established in the literature that most YLIâ€™s are young and healthy when they arrive in the host country. However, due to the poor living and working conditions, as well as linguistic and socioeconomic barriers to health care in the host country, their physical and mental health often deteriorates. Between 1 March 2021 and 5 March 2021, a virtual meeting was organized by Oslo Metropolitan University in collaboration with the Nordic Council of Ministers mobility and network program for education in the Nordic and Baltic countries (Nordplus). It consisted of a multidisciplinary team of 26 participants from Nordic and Baltic countries. Topics included working and living conditions of YLIâ€™s, prejudices towards immigrants, and mental health-related interventions for YLIâ€™s in the participating countries. This paper draws attention to some of the mental health challenges and needs of YLIâ€™s and to the suggestions gathered from the Nordplus meeting to combat these challenges from a healthcare professionalâ€™s perspective.","Princeton, Daisy Michelle, BregÃ¥rd, Ida Marie, Annion, Marianne, Shooghi, Gine, Rom, Gitte, Ã–rlygsdÃ³ttir, Brynja, SigurÃ°ardÃ³ttir, Hildur, Kuismin, Riita, Korhonen, Joonas, Kisa, Sezer","https://doi.org/10.3390/su131810482","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(18):10482, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(18):10482, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20588,""
"Discourse of Folk Literature on Healthy Ageing: A Case Study in Sindh, Pakistan during the Pandemic Crisis","Due to COVID-19 and the repeated imposition of lockdowns in Pakistanâ€™s Sindh province, the life of senior citizens has become challenging. Given the scarcity of health care policies targeted at Sindhâ€™s aged persons, the use of folk literature as therapy has increased to support against isolation, depression, and distress caused by COVID-19 and lockdowns. Although research on healthy ageing from medical and health care perspectives has been increasingly conducted in different contexts, there is a need to explore how folk literature can contribute to psychological, spiritual, and social wellbeing. Therefore, this research, conducted by collecting data from 15 aged participants through interviews and conversations, seeks to explore how senior Sindhis have used folk literature such as poetry, proverbs, and tales as therapy for their healing. Findings show that the participantsâ€™ use of Sindhi folk literature contributes to their psychological (eudemonic, evaluative, and hedonic) wellbeing, spiritual healing, and social satisfaction.","David, Maya Khemlani, Ali, Ameer","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10090350","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Social Sciences; 10(9):350, 2021.; Publication details: Social Sciences; 10(9):350, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20589,""
"Identified Challenges from Faculty Teaching at Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions after Abrupt Transition to Emergency Remote Teaching during the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has been one of the most significant disruptors of higher education in modern history. Higher education institutions rapidly transitioned to Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) in mid-to-late March of 2020. The extent of COVID-19â€™s impact on teaching and learning, and the resulting challenges facilitating ERT during this time, likely varied by faculty, institutional, and geographical characteristics. In this study, we identified challenges in teaching and learning during the initial transition to ERT at Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) in the Midwest, United States. We conducted in-depth interviews with 14 faculty teaching at Midwestern PUIs to explore their lived experiences. We describe the most overarching challenges related to faculty teaching through four emergent themes: pedagogical changes, work-life balance, face-to-face interactions, and physical and mental health. Five themes emerged that we used to describe the most overarching challenges related to students and their learning: learning patterns, technology access, additional responsibilities, learning community, and mental health. Based upon the identified challenges, we provide broad recommendations that can be used to foster a more successful transition to ERT in unforeseen regional or global crises in the future.","Colclasure, Blake C.; Marlier, AnnMarie, Durham, Mary F.; Brooks, Tessa Durham, Kerr, Mekenzie","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11090556","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(9):556, 2021.; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(9):556, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20590,""
"Pre-discharge factors associated with early readmission to psychiatric inpatient services within 90 days","AimsThe aim of this study was to identify pre-discharge risk factors associated with early inpatient readmission in general adult service users, with a particular focus on modifiable factors. We hypothesised that stability prior to discharge would reduce readmission to inpatient services within 90 days.BackgroundEarly readmission to inpatient psychiatric services is a poor outcome for service users, staff and the healthcare system. A variety of clinical, demographic and system factors, mostly non-modifiable, have been investigated previously. The identification of pre-discharge and particularly modifiable factors associated with readmission would give an opportunity for intervention and changes in policy.Method272 medical records of all admissions within an 8 month period to a NHS inner city psychiatric inpatient service were reviewed to identify factors associated with readmission within 90 days of discharge. The data were analysed by simple comparison, calculation of odds ratios and logistic regression.Result26% of service users were readmitted to the mental health trust within 90 days of discharge. Incidents (OR = 3.86;95% CI 1.39â€“10.75) and psychotropic medication change in the week before discharge (OR = 2.94;95% CI 1.43â€“6.03) were significantly associated with readmission, as were the number of previous admissions, and comorbid substance misuse. Successful overnight leave was found to be significantly protective against readmission (OR = 0.29;95% CI 0.11â€“0.72).ConclusionThe ability to predict those at high risk for readmission means they can be targeted for interventions and it can also help develop best practice around inpatient care and the discharge process. The novel findings in this study of pre-discharge modifiable risk factors such as stability and successful overnight leave could have significant implications in discharge planning policy.","Wright, Jessica, Rhianne, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.800","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 7(S1):S302-S303, 2021.; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 7(S1):S302-S303, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20591,""
"Taking leadership over psychopathogenic environments","AimsDo psychiatrists believe children are growing up in psychopathogenic environments that significantly contribute to mental ill- health? If so, do they feel empowered to change those environments? If not, how can psychiatrists be given a role where they can create meaningful change? Finally, how much responsibility can psychiatry usefully take for changing psychopathogenic environments?BackgroundWe define psychopathogenic environments as environments that predispose to mental ill-health. It is the psychological environment we live in - including income, the way we interact with others (e.g. social media, bullying), what we do with our free time, pressures at school and expectations of our peers. It is not discrete events (e.g. trauma) and stretches beyond life at home (where many ACE's occur).Self-harm presentations to medical professionals amongst teenagers are on the rise, Universities report a fivefold increase in disclosure of mental health conditions in the last decade. Here we consider if psychopathogenic environments are part of the cause of these changes.MethodA 10-item questionnaire distributed to Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists in NHS Lothian, NHS Grampian and Manchester University NHS Trust via a consultant in each Trust.ResultAll 14 respondents said psychopathogenic environments are â€œvery importantâ€ contributors to mental ill-health. 13/14 say the environments have got worse in the last 10 years. 13/14 responded negatively about whether psychiatrists could change them. When given white space to tackle the problem they suggested changes were needed from Government including against poverty / inequality, education, public health nudges, more resources, MDT working and better access to leisure facilities. Given specific choices, 11/14 identified influencing Government as a major way forward.ConclusionThis group of psychiatrists believe psychopathogenic environments are;1) a very important contributor to mental ill-health 2) getting worse but 3) feel largely powerless to tackle it. It is a problem they think is important and want to engage in, but lack time, resources and struggle with the complexity of the problem. How therefore, can psychiatrist show leadership in this area? The two perspectives to consider how to empower psychiatrists to help create change are 1) how they can influence the environment for individual patients, 2) how they can influence public policy and government to make wider changes.Is this the job of psychiatrists? Not alone, but as agents they have a unique insight and authority as both a lens for and director of these environments.","Cockburn, Alastair, Morris, Jane","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.653","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 7(S1):S244, 2021.; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 7(S1):S244, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20592,""
"Site downsizing: a blessing or a curse?","AimsTo measure staff wellbeing and morale, which in 2015 was described by CQC as 'low', following a downsizing of premises.BackgroundIn 2019, due to loss of mental health funding, Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust controversially sold the much-loved Queen Anne-style mansion Lyndhurts Gardens. The Rehab & Recovery team caring for those with serious mental illness were relocated to one floor of the much smaller Daleham Gardens. It was hypothesed by the authors that this would impact negatively on the already unhappy workforce.MethodThe same staff wellbeing survey was used as in in 2015 (following CQC's description of 'poor' morale), nearly 5 years on and following the site relocation. All clinical, managerial and administrative staff members were encouraged to participate by posting their survey anonymously in a make-shift postbox. Sweet treats were used to encourage participation within the busy team.ResultQualitative and quantitative data were collected from the team (response rate 44%). Exact tables will be shown but in summary;in the new building there was an increase in the number of staff who felt they could use initiative at work, make improvements at work, looked forward to going into work and felt enthusiastic about their job. Improvement cited were 'increased socials after work' and consequent 'wellbeing', in addition to 'good team atmosphere', 'good team work' and 'good relationships' in the new space. Further ideas were generated for additional improvements going forward.ConclusionWhilst caseloads and workloads are often cited as the cause of burnout, and indeed other changes in the 5 years could act as confounders, the design of work buildings is not to be underestimated. Contrary to what the authors had suspected, 'bigger' was not necessarily 'better' and a more condensed working environment made for greater togetherness amongst the team. In this age where economically desperate NHS trusts are forced to sell off their prized assets, observations that this is not always at the detriment of staff morale will provide some cause for optimism.","Waterhouse, Benjamin, Attwood, Ben","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.605","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 7(S1):S227, 2021.; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 7(S1):S227, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20593,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on child welfare-involved families: Implications for parentâ€“child reunification and child welfare professionals","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted children and parents involved in the child welfare system and the professionals working with these families. Using survey data collected August?September of 2020, this mixed-methods study examined the perspectives of 196 child welfare-involved professionals (77 attorneys, 99 caseworkers, and 20 therapists) in the United States about the impact of COVID-19 on parents of origin, children, foster parents, and child welfare professionals. Particular attention was paid to the implications of COVID-19 and associated challenges for parent?child contact and reunification. With respect to professional stresses, more than half of participants worried about their own personal safety and health amidst COVID-19, and more than three-quarters expressed concerns about the safety and well-being of child welfare-involved families. Participants, especially attorneys, expressed concerns about parent?child contact and disruptions to reunification. In-person parent?child visits had all but ceased during the early part of the pandemic, and participants identified barriers to effective virtual visits, including lack of foster parent oversight, technology issues, and children?s developmental stage and/or lack of engagement. Attorneys were especially critical of the cessation of in-person visits and viewed this as a serious threat to child-parent bonds and reunification. Participants, especially child welfare workers, voiced concerns about children?s mental health and educational outcomes amidst the pandemic. Findings have implications for attorneys, child welfare workers, and other practitioners who directly and indirectly interface with child welfare-involved families.","Goldberg, Abbie E.; Brodzinsky, David, Singer, Jacqueline, Crozier, Patience","https://doi.org/10.1177/25161032211045257","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Developmental Child Welfare;: 25161032211045257, 2021.; Publication details: Developmental Child Welfare;: 25161032211045257, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20594,""
"DeepSpatial'21: 2nd International Workshop on Deep Learning for Spatiotemporal Data, Applications, and Systems","With the advancement of GPS and remote sensing technologies and the pervasiveness of smartphones and mobile devices, large amounts of spatiotemporal data are being collected from various domains. Knowledge discovery from spatiotemporal data is crucial in broad societal applications. Examples range from mapping flooded areas on satellite imagery for disaster response to monitoring crop health for food security, from estimating travel time between locations on Google Maps to forecasting hotspots of diseases like Covid-19 in public health. The recent success in deep learning technologies in computer vision and natural language processing provides unique opportunities for spatiotemporal data mining (e.g., automatically extracting spatial contextual features without manual feature engineering) but also faces unique challenges (e.g., spatial autocorrelation, heterogeneity, multiple scales, and resolutions, the existence of domain knowledge and constraints). This workshop provides a premium platform for researchers from both academia and industry to exchange ideas on opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques of deep learning for spatiotemporal data. We hope to inspire novel ideas and visions through the workshop and facilitate the development of this emerging research area. Â© 2021 Owner/Author.","Zhou, X.; Zhao, L.; Jiang, Z.; Stewart, R.

"COVID-19 pandemic-related transition to telehealth in child and adolescent mental health","Introduction Objectives Procedures Results Conclusion This article explores one mental health company's urgent response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, and the multifaceted implications of quickly transitioning to telehealth services.The purpose of this article is to share information with interdisciplinary professionals about the planning, implementation, and results of transitioning to telehealth services during a pandemic.We compiled practice-related data regarding company attendance rates and customer and employee satisfaction with telehealth. Data include feedback from more than 40 clinicians and 60 families.The data suggest there are both benefits and limitations to engaging in telehealth services within a mental health company. Attendance rates increased dramatically, engagement improved with adolescents but proved challenging with the younger children. Telehealth helped overcome many typical barriers to mental health treatment. Concerns remain regarding confidentiality, assessment of abuse and neglect, and ability to read nonverbal social cues.Families and practitioners experienced the convenience and benefits of telehealth but also expressed concerns over certain limitations. Finding a responsible way to incorporate telehealth into practice postpandemic is a priority for mental health practitioners, both now and in the immediate future.

"Inequalities in womenâ€™s medium or low secure mental health settings: a scoping review","PurposeThe more disadvantaged members of society generally experience poorer outcomes following the development of mental ill-health. The purpose of this paper is to scope the literature and synthesise findings on the inequalities and mental health within secure mental health settings.Design/methodology/approachSix electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies. These were included if they examined the association between inequalities and mental health in womenâ€™s secure mental health settings.FindingsOf the 608 studies reviewed, 14 met the inclusion criteria. In these papers, violence and/or abuse were described as the most prevalent inequalities. The second most frequent group of inequalities identified were socio-economic. Only three published studies researched the impact of ethnicities. Physical health, alcohol abuse and a dysfunctional family upbringing were only mentioned in one of the studies. Gender identity, transitioning and sexual orientation was not considered in any papers. These are areas, which require further investigation to determine their specific impact in this setting.Research limitations/implicationsThis review highlights the dearth of high-quality research-based evidence underpinning an understanding of the impact of inequalities on women in secure mental health settings. The existing studies suggest that inequalities have a very particular impact and that intersectionality plays a key role. Further research is required to further understand how inequalities impact the lives of women in secure mental health settings.Practical implicationsThe inequalities that women experience in relation to mental health need to be further researched in the context of intersectionality. There are also research gaps in terms of gender identity, sexual orientation and socio-economic background. Further primary research using a more complex methodological paradigm is required to explore these factors and their impact on mental health service provision.Social implicationsThe role of inequalities should be considered as part of an overall care package, including the experiences of adverse childhood experiences and this should contribute towards the development of a trauma-based care approach.Originality/valueTo the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first study to scope literature about inequalities experienced in womenâ€™s secure psychiatric settings considering intersectionality.","Trumm, Aile, Brenisin, Kristina, Breen, Kieran","https://doi.org/10.1108/JFP-04-2021-0017","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Forensic Practice; 23(3):254-271, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Forensic Practice; 23(3):254-271, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20597,""
"Distinctive variations in accident and suicide mortality rates among Japanese elderly in 2020","Background In April 2020, the Japanese government requested that people stay home except when unavoidable for their livelihood, as a COVID-19 emergency measure. Especially, elderly people refrained from going out. We investigated mortality rates from external causes in 2020 among Japanese elderly people. Methods The monthly mortality rates from accidents (V01-X59), traffic accidents (V01-V99) and suicides (X60-X84) among elderly from 2015 to November 2020 were analyzed. Ordinary monthly expected values and reference ranges (RR: 95% range) were calculated by cause and sex and compared with the observed values. Results All accidents: Abnormal increases (beyond the RR) occurred in August for both sexes. Traffic accidents: Extreme decreases (below the RR) occurred in at least 3 months from March to October for each sex. Suicides: Extreme decreases occurred in at least 2 months from February to May for each sex. Abnormal increases occurred in November for males, and in September to November for females. Conclusions Extreme decreases in traffic accident mortalities can be explained by people staying home. Abnormal increases in accident mortalities in summer might be explained by the heat. The increases might also be related to wearing face masks. Suicide results suggest that females are especially vulnerable to the social environment created by the preventive measures against COVID-19. Key messages COVID-19 measures might have affected the physical, mental, and social well-being of elderly people.

"Health impacts of a 4 month community-wide lockdown: a prospective longitudinal study in Victoria, Australia","Background In response to the second wave of COVID-19 in Australia a 4 month community-wide lockdown resulted in Victoria, Australia. We explored the health impacts during lockdown and following its conclusion. Methods A cohort of 898 working-age Australians enrolled in a national longitudinal cohort study, completing surveys prior to, during, and following a Victorian lockdown during the southern hemisphere winter and early spring 2020. Mixed linear regression models examined health outcomes during and following the lockdown. Generalised estimating equations assessed changes in several determinants of health such as social interactions, engagement in work and finances. Results The Victorian lockdown had negative consequences for mental health and increased levels of psychological distress. These health impacts coincided with greater social isolation and cessation of work. Following the conclusion of lockdown, outcomes assessing mental health, work and social interactions had recovered to an extent whereby no significant long-lasting effects were identified compared to pre-lockdown conditions. Conclusions Extended community lockdowns have adverse health consequences. Governments should weigh the potential health impacts of lockdown with the benefits of reducing COVID-19 transmission. Services and programs to reduce the negative impacts of lockdown may include increases in mental health care, encouraging safe social interactions and financial support to maintain employment relationships. Longer-term follow-up is required to identify any persistent health effects of community lockdowns. Key messages Lockdowns result in adverse health consequences, and some quickly recover. Timely services and programs are encouraged to reduce negative impacts of lockdowns such as mental health supports and promoting safe interactions.

"Food insecurity and mental health features and behaviours in adults from Portugal","Background COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting population's health and economies, in which food insecurity appears as important concern, particularly considering its associations with mental health and adverse behaviours. This study explored the relationship between food insecurity and mental health features and behaviours in adults from Portugal. Methods A cross-sectional study using data from an online survey was performed, including Portugal's residents aged =18 years. Data on sociodemographics, behaviours, mental health features and food security status were collected. Food security status was evaluated with the United States Household Food Security Survey Module: Six-item Short Form. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, were used to explore the relationship between food security status and categorical variables. Results Food insecurity prevalence was 6.8%;showed to be significantly higher among less educated individuals (=12 years of schooling) (p &lt;0.001), those who were employed and remained since the beginning of the pandemic (p &lt;0.001) and among those reporting need to be careful about expenses (p &lt;0.001). Comparing to individuals who were food secure, food insecure participants were more likely to smoke (p =0.009), to report depressive symptoms (p &lt;0.001) and anxiety (p &lt;0.001), measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Conclusions From the present study, it can be concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic can affect food security in different subpopulations.

"Mental health and well-being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia during COVID-19","In May 2020, an independent working party was convened to determine the mental health and well-being needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia, in response to COVID-19. Thirty Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and allies worked together in a two-month virtual collaboration process. Here, we provide the working party's five key recommendations and highlight the evidence supporting these proposals. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-determination and governance must be prioritised to manage the COVID-19 recovery in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. To mitigate long-term social and economic impacts of COVID-19 to Australian society, the historical underinvestment in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples must be reconciled. Equitable, needs-based funding is required to support strengths-based, place-based initiatives that address the determinants of health. This includes workforce and infrastructure development and effective evaluation. There is a clear, informed pathway to health and healing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander being enacted by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership and community organisations;it remains to be seen how these recommendations will be implemented.

"Teacher Candidates' Perspectives of Infusing Innovative Pedagogical Methods and Trauma-Informed Practices into a Teacher Education Program During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Emerging scholarship asserts that education during the COVID-19 pandemic should be viewed from the perspective of trauma. To address the complexities and navigate the ongoing challenges of simultaneously revising courses and field experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, one teacher preparation program purposely embedded trauma-informed practices to ensure the social and emotional needs of teacher candidates were met. This research centers on understanding teacher candidates' perspectives of these changes that coupled mental health strategies with a move to remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings are organized around three themes: (a) engaging in pedagogical problem solving, (b) establishing an online community, and (c) building empathy. Implications and future research questions are also shared. In all, this research has the potential to inform program design efforts as it highlights the benefits of innovative course delivery as well as the persistent challenges of learning to teach during a crisis.

"2020 TAX COMPETITIVENESS REPORT: CANADA'S INVESTMENT CHALLENGE","Canada is already at a disadvantage with lagging growth and productivity even before the massive economic destruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic hit, Canada's corporate tax system was already becoming uncompetitive in attracting highly profitable investments relative to other developed countries. Canada's general corporate tax rate, averaging 26.1 per cent, is within spitting distance of the highest rates in the OECD. While some industries may benefit from special preferences, the corporate tax has become increasingly inefficient and complex with targeted measures, and in some cases impeding the allocation of capital to growth industries like communications and services. This was having a serious effect on Canada's economic health before COVID-19. Business investment in Canada has lagged that of many countries since 2015, well before the pandemic. Productivity has been weak and wages for workers have been depressed, particularly for unskilled labour. Additionally, the corporate tax system currently distorts the allocation of capital in the economy, favouring some sectors over others. In fact, some of the sectors least-favoured by the tax system -- including retail and tourism, which face an eight-point tax disadvantage compared to the governmentfavoured manufacturing sector -- are the very ones that had the roughest time during the pandemic and face a more difficult road to recovery.

"Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, Anti-Ad5 Antibodies, and Reactogenicity in Response to Ad5-nCoV (CanSino Biologics) Vaccine in Individuals with and without Prior SARS-CoV-2","This is the first study outside of clinical trials (phase I-III) evaluating the ability of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine to generate neutralizing antibodies and the factors associated with optimal or suboptimal response. In a longitudinal assay, 346 people (117 with prior COVID-19 and 229 without prior COVID-19) vaccinated with Ad5-nCoV were recruited. The percentage of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test) and antibodies against Ad5 (ADV-Ad5 IgG ELISA) were quantified pre and post-vaccination effects. The Ad5-nCoV vaccine induces higher neutralizing antibodies percentage in individuals with prior COVID-19 than those without prior COVID-19 (median [IQR]: 98% [97-98.1] vs. 72% [54-90], respectively; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, a natural infection (before vaccination) induces more neutralizing antibodies percentage than immunized individuals without prior COVID-19 (p < 0.01). No patient had vaccine-severe adverse effects. The age, antidepressant, and immunosuppressive treatments, reactogenicity, and history of COVID-19 are associated with impaired antibody production. The anti-Ad5 antibodies increased after 21 days of post-vaccination in all groups (p < 0.01). We recommend the application of a booster dose of Ad5-nCoV, especially for those individuals without previous COVID-19 infection. Finally, the induction of anti-Ad5 antibodies after vaccination should be considered if a booster with the same vaccine is planned.","HernÃ¡ndez-Bello, Jorge; Morales-NÃºÃ±ez, JosÃ© Javier; Machado-SulbarÃ¡n, Andrea Carolina; DÃ­az-PÃ©rez, SaÃºl Alberto; Torres-HernÃ¡ndez, Paola Carolina; BalcÃ¡zar-FÃ©lix, Paulina; GutiÃ©rrez-Brito, JesÃºs Alberto; LomelÃ­-Nieto, JosÃ© Alvaro; MuÃ±oz-Valle, JosÃ© Francisco","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9091047","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Vaccines (Basel);9(9)2021 Sep 20.; Publication details: Vaccines (Basel);9(9)2021 Sep 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20610,""
"Anxiety, Depression and Risk of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Health Workers: The Relationship with Burnout during COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy","During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HW) have faced an extremely difficult work environment, with an increased workload and traumatic events. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HW's mental wellbeing. We analyzed the correlations between levels of burnout and other mental health disorders and we searched for the presence of specific risk factors of post-traumatic symptomatology related to the pandemic. A structured an on-line questionnaire and validated instruments were completed by a sample of HW from some hospitals in Genoa, Italy. Anxious, depressive, post-traumatic and other psychological symptoms were assessed and risk factors, related to the pandemic, were considered. Then, we investigated the correlation between levels of burnout and the risk of developing psychopathology. A total of 731 HW were screened, and we found increased levels of anxiety (61%), depression (62%), PTSD (34%) and high levels of burnout; especially emotional exhaustion (37%). A statistically significant association between burnout and insomnia, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms was demonstrated. This study indicates that during the COVID-19 pandemic, HW showed high levels of psychological distress and that burnout is an important predictor of sufferance. These findings support the idea to provide psychological and psychiatric support for HW.","Ghio, Lucio; Patti, Sara; Piccinini, Giulia; Modafferi, Cinzia; Lusetti, Eleonora; Mazzella, Massimo; Del Sette, Massimo","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189929","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 21.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 21.; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Anxiety/epidemiology; Burnout, Professional/epidemiology; Depression/epidemiology; Health Personnel; Humans; Italy/epidemiology; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20611,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Italian University Students' Mental Health: Changes across the Waves","To reduce the spread of COVID-19, the Italian government imposed a rigid lockdown and, for a whole year, continued to declare stringent rules to curb the community spread. This study provides an overview of university students' symptomatology and help-seeking behaviour before and during the pandemic. It aims to evaluate the impact of the different phases of the pandemic on students' mental health. We collected data in four-time points between March 2019 and March 2021. A total of 454 students (F = 85; M = 15) were included in the study. Students answered a socio-demographic and a standardized questionnaire (i.e., SCL-90-R) to evaluate a broad range of symptomatology. The results suggest that students experienced moderate to severe levels of depressive, obsessive-compulsive and anxiety symptomatology. About 14% of the sample met the criteria for at least one mental health disorder, but most were not receiving mental health care. During the lockdown, compared with other phases, female students reported worse symptoms in the obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism dimensions. The increasing symptomatology disappeared after the lifting of the lockdown. The results showed no difference in the male groups. Preventive and support strategies should be improved in the university context.","Di Consiglio, Micaela; Merola, Sheila; Pascucci, Tiziana; Violani, Cristiano; Couyoumdjian, Alessandro","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189897","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 Sep 20.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 Sep 20.; COVID-19; Pandemics; Anxiety/epidemiology; Communicable Disease Control; Depression/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Italy/epidemiology; Male; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Universities; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20612,""
"A One-Year Prospective Study of Work-Related Mental Health in the Intensivists of a COVID-19 Hub Hospital","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely tested the physical and mental health of health care workers (HCWs). The various stages of the epidemic have posed different problems; consequently, only a prospective study can effectively describe the changes in the workers' health. This repeated cross-sectional study is based on a one-year investigation (spring 2020 to spring 2021) of intensive care physicians in one of the two COVID-19 hub hospitals in Central Italy and aims to study the evolution of the mental health status of intensivists during the pandemic. Changes in their work activity due to the pandemic were studied anonymously together with their perception of organisational justice, occupational stress, sleep quality, anxiety, depression, burnout, job satisfaction, happiness, and intention to quit. In May-June 2021, one year after the baseline, doctors reported an increased workload, isolation at work and in their social life, a lack of time for physical activity and meditation, and compassion fatigue. Stress was inversely associated with the perception of justice in safety procedures and directly correlated with work isolation. Occupational stress was significantly associated with anxiety, depression, burnout, dissatisfaction, and their intention to quit. Procedural justice was significantly associated with happiness. Doctors believed vaccinations would help control the problem; however, this positive attitude had not yet resulted in improved mental health. Doctors reported high levels of distress (73%), sleep problems (28%), anxiety (25%), and depression (64%). Interventions to correct the situation are urgently needed.","Magnavita, Nicola; Soave, Paolo Maurizio; Antonelli, Massimo","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189888","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 Sep 20.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 Sep 20.; COVID-19; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals; Humans; Mental Health; Prospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20613,""
"Willingness to Receive COVID-19 Vaccination Among People Living With HIV and AIDS in China: Nationwide Cross-sectional Online Survey","BACKGROUND: HIV infection is a significant independent risk factor for both severe COVID-19 presentation at hospital admission and in-hospital mortality. Available information has suggested that people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) could benefit from COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is a dearth of evidence on willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among PLWHA. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among a national sample of PLWHA in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey investigated factors associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among PLWHA aged 18 to 65 years living in eight conveniently selected Chinese metropolitan cities between January and February 2021. Eight community-based organizations (CBOs) providing services to PLWHA facilitated the recruitment. Eligible PLWHA completed an online survey developed using a widely used encrypted web-based survey platform in China. We fitted a single logistic regression model to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aORs), which involved one of the independent variables of interest and all significant background variables. Path analysis was also used in the data analysis. RESULTS: Out of 10,845 PLWHA approached by the CBOs, 2740 completed the survey, and 170 had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This analysis was performed among 2570 participants who had never received COVID-19 vaccination. Over half of the participants reported willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination (1470/2570, 57.2%). Perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination were significantly associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination, including positive attitudes (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.09-1.12; P<.001), negative attitudes (aOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.97; P<.001), perceived support from significant others (perceived subjective norm; aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.46-1.61; P<.001), and perceived behavioral control (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.11-1.14; P<.001). At the interpersonal level, receiving advice supportive of COVID-19 vaccination from doctors (aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.65-2.40; P<.001), CBO staff (aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.51-2.36; P<.001), friends and/or family members (aOR 3.22, 95% CI 1.93-5.35; P<.001), and PLWHA peers (aOR 2.38, 95% CI 1.85-3.08; P<.001) was associated with higher willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination. The overall opinion supporting COVID-19 vaccination for PLWHA on the internet or social media was also positively associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.31-1.94; P<.001). Path analysis indicated that interpersonal-level variables were indirectly associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination through perceptions (ÃŸ=.43, 95% CI .37-.51; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: As compared to PLWHA in other countries and the general population in most parts of the world, PLWHA in China reported a relatively low willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination. The internet and social media as well as interpersonal communications may be major sources of influence on PLWHA's perceptions and willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination.","Huang, Xiaojie; Yu, Maohe; Fu, Gengfeng; Lan, Guanghua; Li, Linghua; Yang, Jianzhou; Qiao, Ying; Zhao, Jin; Qian, Han-Zhu; Zhang, Xiangjun; Liu, Xinchao; Jin, Xia; Chen, Guohong; Jiang, Hui; Tang, Weiming; Wang, Zixin; Xu, Junjie","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/31125","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(10): e31125, 2021 10 21.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(10): e31125, 2021 10 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20614,""
"Empathy and its associations with age and sociodemographic characteristics in a large UK population sample","OBJECTIVES: Empathy is fundamental to social cognition, driving prosocial behaviour and mental health but associations with aging and other socio-demographic characteristics are unclear. We therefore aimed to characterise associations of these characteristics with two main self-reported components of empathy, namely empathic-concern (feeling compassion) and perspective-taking (understanding others' perspective). METHODS: We asked participants in an internet-based survey of UK-dwelling adults aged &#8805;18 years to complete the Interpersonal Reactivity Index subscales measuring empathic concern and perspective taking, and sociodemographic and personality questionnaires. We weighted the sample to be UK population representative and employed multivariable weighted linear regression models. RESULTS: In 30,033 respondents, mean empathic concern score was 3.86 (95% confidence interval 3.85, 3.88) and perspective taking was 3.57 (3.56. 3.59); the correlation between these sub-scores was 0.45 (p < 0.001). Empathic concern and perspective taking followed an inverse-u shape trajectory in women with peak between 40 and 50 years whereas in men, perspective taking declines with age but empathic concern increases. In fully adjusted models, greater empathic concern was associated with female gender, non-white ethnicity, having more education, working in health, social-care, or childcare professions, and having higher neuroticism, extroversion, openness to experience and agreeableness traits. Perspective taking was associated with younger age, female gender, more education, employment in health or social-care, neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness. CONCLUSIONS: Empathic compassion and understanding are distinct dimensions of empathy with differential demographic associations. Perspective taking may decline due to cognitive inflexibility with older age whereas empathic concern increases in older men suggesting it is socially-driven.","Sommerlad, Andrew; Huntley, Jonathan; Livingston, Gill; Rankin, Katherine P; Fancourt, Daisy","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257557","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;16(9): e0257557, 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One;16(9): e0257557, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20615,""
"Depression in pregnant women with and without COVID-19","Evidence suggests that pregnant women who test positive for COVID-19 may develop more severe illness than non-pregnant women and may be at greater risk for psychological distress. The relationship between COVID-19 status (positive, negative, never tested) and symptoms of depression was examined in a survey study (May to September 2020) of pregnant women (n = 869). Pregnant women who reported testing positive for COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report depressive symptoms compared with women who tested negative (P = 0.027) and women who were never tested (P = 0.005). Findings indicate that pregnant women who test positive for COVID-19 should be screened and monitored for depressive symptoms.","Papadopoulos, Alissa; Nichols, Emily S; Mohsenzadeh, Yalda; Giroux, Isabelle; Mottola, Michelle F; Van Lieshout, Ryan J; Duerden, Emma G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1010","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BJPsych Open;7(5): e173, 2021 Sep.; Publication details: BJPsych Open;7(5): e173, 2021 Sep.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20616,""
"Problematic smartphone use and affective temperaments among Lebanese young adults: scale validation and mediating role of self-esteem","BACKGROUND: Adults all over the world face serious issues from problematic smartphone use (PSU). It influences them negatively on a cognitive, behavioral, and emotional level, as well as on their tendencies and well-being. In Lebanon, the prevalence of PSU was shown to be 20.2% within the adult population, specifically with young adults (18-34Â years old). This study investigates the validity and reliability of the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS) Arabic version. In addition, this study evaluates the association between PSU and affective temperaments and the mediating role of self-esteem in this association. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and September 2020, using a sample of community-dwelling participants aged 18 to 29Â years. The Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version was used to evaluate smartphone addiction among adolescents and adults. The five different temperaments of the patients were assessed by using the Affective temperament Scale (TEMPS-A). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was used to evaluate self-esteem. RESULTS: 461 participants were included in this study. All items of the SAS were extracted and yielded a one-factor solution with Eigenvalues > 1 (variance explained = 49.96%; &#945;Cronbach = 0.886). The confirmatory analysis results consolidated those obtained from the factor analysis. Higher depressive temperament (B = 0.46) was significantly associated with more smartphone addiction, whereas higher self-esteem (B =  - 0.28) was significantly associated with less smartphone addiction. Self-esteem was found to mediate the association between depressive and hyperthymic temperaments with smartphone addiction. CONCLUSION: This study added a better understanding of the high smartphone addiction rate among adults in Lebanon. It confirms the association between affective temperaments and PSU through the mediating effect of self-esteem on Lebanese adults.","Zeidan, Joanne; Hallit, Souheil; Akel, Marwan; Louragli, Ismail; Obeid, Sahar","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00638-y","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Psychol;9(1): 136, 2021 Sep 08.; Publication details: BMC Psychol;9(1): 136, 2021 Sep 08.; Smartphone; Temperament; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Self Concept; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20617,""
"Clinical leaders and providers' perspectives on delivering medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder in Veteran Affairs' facilities","BACKGROUND: Improving access to medication treatment of opioid use disorder (MOUD) is a national priority, yet common modifiable barriers (e.g., limited provider knowledge, negative beliefs about MOUD) often challenge implementation of MOUD delivery. To address these barriers, the VA launched a multifaceted implementation intervention focused on planning and educational strategies to increase MOUD delivery in 18 medical facilities. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a multifaceted intervention approach to increase MOUD delivery changed providers' perceptions about MOUD over the first year of implementation. METHODS: Cross-disciplinary teams of clinic providers and leadership from primary care, pain, and mental health clinics at 18 VA medical facilities received invitations to complete an anonymous, electronic survey prior to intervention launch (baseline) and at 12- month follow-up. Responses were summarized using descriptive statistics, and changes over time were compared using regression models adjusted for gender and prescriber status, and clustered on facility. Responses to open-ended questions were thematically analyzed using a template analysis approach. RESULTS: Survey response rates at baseline and follow-up were 57.1% (56/98) and 50.4% (61/121), respectively. At both time points, most respondents agreed that MOUD delivery is important (94.7 vs. 86.9%), lifesaving (92.8 vs. 88.5%) and evidence-based (85.2 vs. 89.5%). Over one-third (37.5%) viewed MOUD delivery as time-consuming, and only 53.7% affirmed that clinic providers wanted to prescribe MOUD at baseline; similar responses were seen at follow-up (34.5 and 52.4%, respectively). Respondents rated their knowledge about OUD, comfort discussing opioid use with patients, job satisfaction, ability to help patients with OUD, and support from colleagues favorably at both time points. Respondents' ratings of MOUD delivery filling a gap in care were high but declined significantly from baseline to follow-up (85.7 vs. 73.7%, p < 0.04). Open-ended responses identified implementation barriers including lack of support to diagnose and treat OUD and lack of time. CONCLUSIONS: Although perceptions about MOUD generally were positive, targeted education and planning strategies did not improve providers' and clinical leaders' perceptions of MOUD over time. Strategies that improve leaders' prioritization and support of MOUD and address time constraints related to delivering MOUD may increase access to MOUD in non-substance use treatment clinics.","Hawkins, Eric J; Danner, Anissa N; Malte, Carol A; Blanchard, Brittany E; Williams, Emily C; Hagedorn, Hildi J; Gordon, Adam J; Drexler, Karen; Burden, Jennifer L; Knoeppel, Jennifer; Lott, Aline; Sayre, George G; Midboe, Amanda M; Saxon, Andrew J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13722-021-00263-5","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Addict Sci Clin Pract;16(1): 55, 2021 09 06.; Publication details: Addict Sci Clin Pract;16(1): 55, 2021 09 06.; Buprenorphine; Opioid-Related Disorders; Veterans; Humans; Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy; Primary Health Care; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20618,""
"Perceived mental health in parents of children with rare congenital surgical diseases: a double ABCX model considering gender","BACKGROUND: Previous research has supported the utility of the Double ABCX model of family adaptation for parents in various diseases. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how raising a child with rare congenital surgical diseases impacts the mental health of both mothers and fathers. METHODS: The potential predictors of maternal and paternal mental health in a German sample of 210 parents of children with rare congenital surgical diseases were investigated. Parents were investigated cross-sectionally utilizing standardized psychometric questionnaires that assessed factors attributed to parental adaptation within the Double ABCX model. RESULTS: Stressor pile-up, family functioning, perceived stress, and mental health were positively associated with mothers and fathers. However, further analyses revealed that family functioning, social support, and perceived stress fully mediated the positive association between stressor pile-up and mental health in mothers, but not fathers. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that parental adaptation to a rare congenital surgical disease in their children may be improved by increased intra- and extrafamilial resources and decreased perceived family-related stress in mothers, but not fathers. Our results may help to identify gender-specific factors that may guide clinicians and future interventions.","Boettcher, Johannes; Zapf, Holger; Fuerboeter, Mareike; Nazarian, Rojin; Reinshagen, Konrad; Wiegand-Grefe, Silke; Boettcher, Michael","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13023-021-01998-9","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Orphanet J Rare Dis;16(1): 384, 2021 09 09.; Publication details: Orphanet J Rare Dis;16(1): 384, 2021 09 09.; Mental Health; Stress, Psychological; Adaptation, Psychological; Child; Fathers; Female; Humans; Male; Parents; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20619,""
"Tuberculosis related disability: a systematic review and meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: The sustainable development goals aim to improve health for all by 2030. They incorporate ambitious goals regarding tuberculosis (TB), which may be a significant cause of disability, yet to be quantified. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the prevalence and types of TB-related disabilities. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of TB-related disabilities. The pooled prevalence of disabilities was calculated using the inverse variance heterogeneity model. The maps of the proportions of common types of disabilities by country income level were created. RESULTS: We included a total of 131 studies (217,475 patients) that were conducted in 49 countries. The most common type of disabilities were mental health disorders (23.1%), respiratory impairment (20.7%), musculoskeletal impairment (17.1%), hearing impairment (14.5%), visual impairment (9.8%), renal impairment (5.7%), and neurological impairment (1.6%). The prevalence of respiratory impairment (61.2%) and mental health disorders (42.0%) was highest in low-income countries while neurological impairment was highest in lower middle-income countries (25.6%). Drug-resistant TB was associated with respiratory (58.7%), neurological (37.2%), and hearing impairments (25.0%) and mental health disorders (26.0%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TB-related disabilities were frequently reported. More uniform reporting tools for TB-related disability and further research to better quantify and mitigate it are urgently needed.

"[Which Digital Services do Psychosomatic Rehabilitation Patients Use During the Corona Pandemic and do Interrelations with Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms Exist?]; Welche digitalen Angebote nutzen psychisch vorerkrankte Menschen wÃ¤hrend der Corona-Pandemie und gibt es ZusammenhÃ¤nge mit Angst und depressiven Symptomen?","OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic requires numerous measures to protect against infection, such as contact reduction and adherence to hygiene and social distancing rules. The former leads to mental disorders (possibly requiring treatment) due to social isolation, the latter require adaptation in the implementation of medical therapies. With overall limited therapy capacities, the use of digital (health) applications can be of particular importance in the therapy of chronic and psychological diseases in particular. The present study investigates which health apps are being used by people with mental health problems. METHODS: 1,060 insured persons in preparation for psychosomatic rehabilitation measures were surveyed by means of an online questionnaire. Descriptive analyses, frequency analyses, and analyses of variance with post-hoc tests and correlation analyses were used for evaluation. RESULTS: Participants used on average three apps; the most common topics were ""nutrition"" (n=313), ""self-diagnosis"" (n=244) and ""relaxation"" (n=234). Female participants were more likely to use apps than male participants, and younger participants were more likely to use apps than older participants. Symptoms of anxiety were correlated to the use of digital applications, especially concerning heart rate and blood pressure monitoring, while depressive symptoms were not associated with a more frequent use of apps. DISCUSSION: Digital apps are being frequently used by people with mental health problems. Increasing acceptance of digital (health) apps has significant potential in the treatment of chronic mental illness in particular. The focus should be on individual applications with integration into the regular care process. CONCLUSION: Increasing digitalization, also in the healthcare sector, can be used to ensure care, especially in times of contact restrictions and limited human resources.","Dahmen, Alina; Keller, Franziska Maria; Derksen, Christina; KÃ¶tting, Lukas; Lippke, Sonia","https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1503-5548","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol;2021 Sep 20.; Publication details: Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol;2021 Sep 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20622,""

"[Mental health interventions for college and university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a critical synthesis of the literature]; Intervenciones para la salud mental de estudiantes universitarios durante la pandemia por COVID-19: una sÃ­ntesis crÃ­tica de la literatura","Background: College and university students are a population vulnerable to mental disorders, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their mental health has been affected by confinement, difficulties in the development of academic activities, and the demands of new pedagogical modalities. We aimed to respond to the question: what are the actions around a) promotion and prevention, b) mental symptoms care, and c) pedagogical adaptations that can be developed in order to improve the mental health of college and university students? Methods: We conducted a critical synthesis from a systematic review of the literature. A search was made for scientific articles with descriptive, analytical, empirical or evaluative designs, as well as web resources of organisations related to the topic. A synthesis was carried out based on the three aspects of the question by means of a constant comparative method, until the aggregation of actions by similarity in the actors. We anticipated low evidence quality; therefore, a standardised evaluation was not performed. Results: We explored 68 articles and 99 web resources. After reviewing the full text, 12 scientific articles and 11 web resources were included. As general guidelines, we found that the most frequent suggestion is the design of a specific structured mental health programme within universities, one that should be multidisciplinary, inclusive, dynamic and culturally sensitive. All actions taken by the university should be reported and published periodically so that students and other members of the university community are clear about them. Ideally, it is suggested to keep them until the post-pandemic period and include alumni. Regarding a) promotion and prevention, digital psychoeducation was recommended, with information about healthy lifestyles, common emotional reactions to epidemics, coping strategies and warning signs. Peer participation is suggested as a support strategy, as well as spaces for social interaction that focus not only on academic aspects but also on leisure. Screening for mental symptoms is suggested through frequent submission of online forms or mobile applications. In addition to mental health, it is important to inquire about the degree of satisfaction of basic and technology-related needs. For b) the care of mental symptoms, one of the actions commonly identified was a consulting centre that can provide mental health care by telephone, by technology, and even in person --if required --, with permanent availability with rapid response teams for crisis situations, such as suicidal behaviour and domestic violence. For c) pedagogical adaptations, fluent communication is an indispensable requirement; having clear instructions on academic activities can reduce uncertainty and therefore anxiety. The teaching and pedagogical staff at the institution can offer direct advice (via video calls or online group meetings) to provide support in study habits, degree-specific material and mental health. Conclusions: Included resources suggest the creation of a programme that specifically addresses the mental health of students. This synthesis can provide guidelines that facilitate decision-making by the university, without losing sight of the fact that the institution and the student are immersed in a complex context, with circumstances and other actors at various levels that also intervene in mental health. Research is required on the evolution of the mental health situation and the effect of the actions that are being taken.","Zapata-Ospina, Juan Pablo; PatiÃ±o-Lugo, Daniel Felipe; VÃ©lez, Claudia Marcela; Campos-Ortiz, Santiago; Madrid-MartÃ­nez, Pablo; Pemberthy-Quintero, SebastiÃ¡n; PÃ©rez-GutiÃ©rrez, Ana MarÃ­a; RamÃ­rez-PÃ©rez, Paola Andrea; VÃ©lez-MarÃ­n, Viviana MarÃ­a","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.04.007","","Country: CO; COLÃ”MBIA; COLOMBIA; COLOMBIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Colomb Psiquiatr;50(3): 199-213, 2021.; Publication details: Rev Colomb Psiquiatr;50(3): 199-213, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20624,""
"Glaucoma progression during the covid-19 pandemics","The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) provides powerful effects on all pathogenic aspects of the primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The property of this virus to initiate disseminated intravascular coagulation, damage endotheliocytes, and impair coagulation result in numerous severe complications affecting all organs and systems. This disorder provokes retinal ischemia and hypoxia and spurs apoptosis of ganglionic cells. Cytokine storm and oxidative stress resulting from the COVID-19 potentially contribute to the progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Distressing effect of the pandemic, a growing number of patients with depressive and anxiety disorders increase the risk of POAG and ocular hypertension, reduce treatment compliance, and exacerbate glaucoma course. Ophthalmic patients should be informed on potential risks and consequences of the COVID-19 and educated on the safety and efficacy of vaccination and the need for these preventive measures for elderly patients (in particular, with glaucoma). A year of the COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the attitude to many processes of doctor-patient relationships. There is a need for the development of the technologies of distant monitoring of patients with glaucoma. Â© 2021, Medicine-Inform LLC. All rights reserved.","Korelina, V. E.; Gazizova, I.

"Depression at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: A CES-D survey before and during the lockdown","On January 31, 2020, the first two cases of COVID-19 were detected in Italy;the extent and the rapidity of virus spread forced the Italian Government to take extraordinary measures to prevent contagion. In this study, we aimed to compare data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic on the depression symptomatology in a sample from the general population. We used archival data from a previous dataset we had access to, which included Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) data from non-clinical volunteers collected before (n = 151;Pre-COVID-19 group) and during (n = 352;COVID group) the pandemic. Statistical analyses compared CES-D scores yielded by the Pre-COVID-19 sample against those yielded by the COVID-19 sample. Additionally, the possible impact of demographic variables on CES-D scores before and during COVID-19 was tested. Moreover, in the COVID-19 group we found a statistically significant difference on the CES-D scores between men and women and a nearly significant relationship between age and CES-D scores. This study showed that the lockdown measures and the pandemic itself might have led to an increasing of the depressive symptoms in a non-clinical sample (and maybe in the Italian population), especially in women and youths. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Il 31 gennaio del 2020, in Italia, furono registrati i primi due casi di COVID-19;la portata e la rapiditÃ  della diffusione del virus costrinsero il governo italiano ad adottare delle misure di emergenza straordinarie per rallentare il contagio. L'obiettivo del presente studio Ã¨ stato quello di indagare la sintomatologia depressiva sperimentata da un campione proveniente dalla popolazione generale, confrontando i dati raccolti prima e durante il lockdown da COVID-19. Sono stati utilizzati dati d'archivio che includevano dati relativi alla Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) somministrata prima (n = 151;gruppo Pre-COVID-19) e durante (n = 352;gruppo COVID-19) il primo lockdown italiano a un campione non-clinico. Le analisi si sono focalizzare sul confronto dei punteggi ottenuti alla CES-D nel gruppo Pre-COVID-19 e nel gruppo COVID-19. Inoltre, Ã¨ stata valutata la possibile influenza di alcune variabili demografiche sui punteggi ottenuti alla CES-D prima e durante la pandemia da COVID-19. Inoltre, all'interno del gruppo COVID-19, sono state osservate delle differenze statisticamente significative tra i punteggi alla CES-D ottenuti da uomini e donne e una correlazione quasi significativa tra l'etÃ  dei partecipanti e i punteggi ottenuti alla CES-D. Lo studio ha rivelato che le misure restrittive e la pandemia stessa possono aver contribuito ad un incremento dei sintomi depressivi in un campione di individui non-clinici (e probabilmente nella popolazione generale italiana), specialmente nei giovani e nelle donne.

"Lessons Learned in Health Professions Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Part 1: Proceedings of a Workshop","During the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals adapted, innovated, and accelerated in order to meet the needs of students, patients, and the community. To examine and learn from these experiences, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Global Forum on Innovation in Health Professional Education convened a series of workshops, the first of which was a one-day virtual workshop on December 3, 2020. The first workshop explored lessons learned in the grand challenges facing health professions education (HPE) stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and how those positive and negative experiences might inform development of sustainable improvements in the value, effectiveness, and impact of HPE. Educators, students, administrators, and health professionals shared ideas, stories, and data in an effort to discuss the future of HPE by learning from past experiences. Topics included: evaluation of online education;innovations in interprofessional education and learning opportunities within the social determinants of health and mental health;effects on preclinical and clinical education;regulatory and accreditation changes affecting HPE;and stress and workload on students and faculty. This publication summarizes the presentations and panel discussions from the workshop.","National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, Health, Medicine, Division, Board on Global, Health, Global Forum on Innovation in Health Professional, Education","https://doi.org/10.17226/26210","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: National Academies Press; 07:13, 2021.; Publication details: National Academies Press; 07:13, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20627,""
"Mindfulness meditation based on spiritual care to reduce community anxiety due to the impact of pandemic coronavirus disease","BACKGROUND: The spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread throughout the world and has created a level of fear, uncertainty that has an impact on several aspects of life including mental health. The rapid spread of the Corona Virus or COVID-19 throughout the world has damaged the order of life starting from the economy, social, politics, education, culture, religion and health. Various efforts have been made by the Indonesian government with social distancing or physical distancing, washing hands with soap and staying active at home. Conditions that change suddenly will make people unprepared to deal with it, especially in the psychological condition of the Indonesian people who experience a lot of anxiety. AIM: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of mindfulness meditation based on spiritual care on the level of community anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This type of research uses experimental quantitative research using a randomized controlled trial research design. This research was conducted for 4 weeks in January-February 2021. The population of this study is the Surabaya community. The sampling technique used consecutive sampling technique and was divided into two groups, namely the intervention group as many as 61 respondents and the control group as many as 61 respondents. Data analysis used paired t test and independent t test with a significance value of p &lt; 0.05. This research questionnaire uses the DASS 42 questionnaire has reliability 0.82 and the validity test gets the Cronbach alpha value is 0.85. RESULTS: The average level of anxiety before doing the spiritual care-based mindfulness meditation intervention in the intervention group was 17.28 (severe anxiety) and 17.18 in the control group (severe anxiety) with p = 1.000 which means there is no difference in the average level of anxiety whereas After being given the intervention, the average level of anxiety in the intervention group was 6.03 (normal anxiety) and 18.06 in the control group (severe anxiety) with p = 0.000, which means that there is a difference in the average level of anxiety in the intervention group and the control group after being given the intervention. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness meditation based on spiritual care can reduce peopleâ€™s anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Â© 2021 Siti Nur Hasina, Iis Noventi, P. H.

"Delivery of liver services within primary care can improve treatment outcomes in persons experiencing homelessness","BackgroundPersons experiencing homelessness (PEH) often have complex health needs compounded by difficulty accessing healthcare. Liver disease is the third commonest cause for death in PEH after accidents and suicides. Some studies have identified chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in up to 50% of this population. Alcohol disorders are also extremely common.MethodsFrom June 2018, a weekly Hepatology clinic was co-located with a primary care clinic serving a population of 2,500 PEH. Blood borne virus testing, near patient HCV RNA testing, transient elastography and anti-viral drug dispensing for Hepatitis B and C was introduced. All patients with HCV were treated in line with national guidelines.ResultsBetween the period of June 2018 and November 2020, 326 patients were reviewed within the Hepatology clinic. A total of 1,236 appointments were offered with 632 attendances (51.1%).241 patients were referred due to a positive HCV Ab test. 193 were RNA positive (80%), 30 RNA negative (12.4%) and 19 had unknown HCV RNA status. Transient elastography was performed on 138 with 31 having advanced fibrosis.Treatment was initiated on 101/193 HCV RNA positive patients. 93 patients were receiving opiate substitution therapy. 65% had a co-existing mental health diagnosis whilst 24% had a significant alcohol intake, 2% were co-infected with Hepatitis B and C and 3% were co-infected with both Hepatitis C and HIV. The genotypes were 44 G1a;3 G1b;6 G2;34 G3;1 G4 and 13 unknown.There is a high rate of sustained virological response (SVR) being achieved with 61 patients having achieved SVR (82%). 13 patients needed to re-start treatment. 37 have SVR 12 pending. 3 patients have relapsed.Of the remaining 92 known RNA positive patients within the clinic, 40 identified within our service have been treated elsewhere during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. 24 SVR blood tests were performed for the patients treated in other locations. 21 patients are approved to start treatment. 9 are awaiting genotyping and transient elastography. 5 are no longer patients of the primary care clinic and attempts have been made to arrange onward referrals to Hepatology services in their new locations and 5 patients have died.ConclusionPersons experiencing homelessness often have difficulty accessing healthcare. By facilitating access to Hepatology services tailored to their needs at a site where they access primary care and receive opiate substitution therapy, favourable SVR rates can be achieved with significant risk reduction.","Hannon, Jennifer, Morgan, Helen, Boreland, Carla, Polocenkaite, Aurelia, Jerjian, Jack, Jones, Fiona, Gibbons, John, McDonald, Keith, Wilkins, Alexandre, Tanya, Oâ€™Brien, Hickey, Mary, Paul, Oâ€™Reilly, Foxton, Matthew","https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2021-BASL.42","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 3):A26-A27, 2021.; Publication details: Gut; 70(Suppl 3):A26-A27, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20629,""
"Academic mothers with disabilities: Navigating academia and parenthood during COVID-19","Academic mothers (including nonbinary, trans, and genderqueer parents) have always faced challenges in their profession due to systemic barriers and a â€œmotherhood taxâ€;however, COVID-19 has exacerbated already existing inequalities (Oleschuk,Â 2020). This study examines how the pandemic has affected academic mothers with mental health and physical disabilities, as these voices often remain hidden and unheard in academia despite increased awareness of their presence (Brown & Leigh,Â 2018;Kelly & Senior,Â 2020). Here, we share the voices of 23 participants using a qualitative methodology drawing from social justice and feminist theories to highlight the lived experience of academic mothers with mental and/or physical disabilities and their experiences as a scholar and parent during COVID-19. Understanding the lived experience of this intersectional population can provide invaluable insights into ableist privilege within higher education, especially in the context of COVID-19 which has substantially disrupted work and homelife routines.

"Portable UWB RADAR Sensing System for Transforming Subtle Chest Movement into Actionable Micro-Doppler Signatures to Extract Respiratory Rate Exploiting ResNet Algorithm","Contactless or non-invasive technology for the monitoring of anomalies in an inconspicuous and distant environment has immense significance in health-related applications, in particular COVID-19 symptoms detection, diagnosis, and monitoring. Contactless methods are crucial specifically during the COVID-19 epidemic as they require the least amount of involvement from infected individuals as well as healthcare personnel. According to recent medical research studies regarding coronavirus, individuals infected with novel COVID-19-Delta variant undergo elevated respiratory rates due to extensive infection in the lungs. This appalling situation demands constant real-time monitoring of respiratory patterns, which can help in avoiding any pernicious circumstances. In this paper, an Ultra-Wideband RADAR sensor x201C;XeThru X4M200x201D;is exploited to capture vital respiratory patterns. In the low and high frequency band, X4M200 operates within the 6.0-8.5 GHz and 7.25-10.20 GHz band, respectively. The experimentation is conducted on six distinct individuals to replicate a realistic scenario of irregular respiratory rates. The data is obtained in the form of spectrograms by carrying out normal (eupnea) and abnormal (tachypnea) respiratory. The collected spectrogram data is trained, validated, and tested using a cutting-edge deep learning technique called Residual Neural Network or ResNet. The trained ResNet modelx2019;s performance is assessed using the confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and classification accuracy. The unordinary skip connection process of the deep ResNet algorithm significantly reduces the underfitting and overfitting problem, resulting in a classification accuracy rate of up to 90%.

"â€œSunny Makes Everything Okayâ€: Therapy Dogs as a Pedagogical Tool in Sensitive Classes","Criminal justice classes often involve emotionally taxing content. Students who identify as trauma survivors are at risk of being retraumatized through such courses, which not only impedes their ability to complete the courses but may also cause deleterious health consequences. While studies have addressed sensitive and triggering content in college curricula, fewer have examined mitigation techniques. Based on observations and student feedback, this study reports on the efficacy of utilizing a trained therapy dog in criminal justice courses focused on interpersonal victimization. Data were obtained over a three year period (prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic) in higher level undergraduate criminal justice classes on child maltreatment, family violence, and victimology, during which the authorâ€™s registered therapy dog was strategically incorporated. Findings are discussed within the context of student mental health, bridging research on therapy dogs within primary and secondary education with innovative pedagogical approaches at the university level.

"Learning disruption or learning loss: using evidence from unplanned closures to inform returning to school after COVID-19","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the immediate and longer-term effects of school closures and ongoing interruptions on childrenâ€™s learning have been a source of considerable apprehension to many. In an attempt to anticipate and mitigate the effect of school closures, researchers and policymakers have turned to the learning loss literature, research that estimates the effect of summer holidays on academic achievement. However, school closures due to COVID-19 have taken place under very different conditions, making the utility of such a literature debatable. Instead, this study is based on a rapid evidence assessment of research on learning disruption â€“ extended and unplanned periods of school closure following unprecedented events, such as SARs or weather-related events. We argue that this literature provides clearer evidence on what helps children return to learning under similar conditions, and in this sense has more direct relevance for schools after COVID-19. A narrative synthesis of key recommendations is presented. Key findings are as follows: (i) that school leadersâ€™ local knowledge is pivotal in leading a return to school, (ii) the curriculum needs to be responsive to childrenâ€™s needs and (iii) that schools are essential in supporting the mental health of students. A discussion of the applicability and utility of these findings is provided in light of emerging evidence of challenges faced by schools in the context of an ongoing global pandemic and the disruption to education it continues to create.

"Student Experiences and Perceptions of Emergency Remote Teaching","In this study, student responses to a survey about COVID-19 emergency remote teaching were analyzed to gauge student perceptions of the online transition.With the hasty shift to online, the student experience was different from typical online classes that were online for the whole semester. Several key positives and negatives emerged from coding the student responses. Currently, students report significant challenges in mental health, communication with peers and instructors, and balancing home and school life (especially finding a quiet environment to study). Loss of motivation, lack of face-to-face experiences, and faulty technology were also cited as major detriments to student learning, which can be taken into consideration when constructing courses in future semesters and can benefit students in the online environment. This illustrates how important physical experiences and resources are to teaching STEMcourses. Especially in labs, being able to physically interact with the environment and talk to the professors and other students were crucial to student success. The information from this paper will help inform future decisions on online teaching and emergency remote teaching and can help educators adapt their classrooms for an enhanced online student learning experience.

"The Epidemic of COVID-19-Related Erectile Dysfunction: A Scoping Review and Health Care Perspective","Introduction COVID-19 infection is expected to be associated with an increased likelihood of erectile dysfunction (ED). Considering the high transmissibility of COVID-19, ED may be a concerning consequence for a large segment of the population. Aims To (1) summarize existing published evidence for the impact of COVID-19 on the prevalence, severity, treatment, and management of ED;and (2) identify health-related trends in the emerging literature and identify gaps in the existing research literature and make recommendations for future research needs in the area. Methods A scoping literature search was conducted on April 27, 2021. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was followed. The literature search was performed in PubMed using the terms: COVID-19, erectile, sexual, and dysfunction. A total of 693 publications were screened for relevance. Studies were appraised for their level of evidence based on study design and the rigor of methodology. Results The evidence that COVID-19 infection causes or impacts ED is compelling. Four topics emerged regarding the nature of the association between COVID-19 and ED: (1) the biological impact of COVID-19 infection on ED;(2) the mental health impact of COVID-19 on ED;(3) the impact of COVID-19 on the management of ED and access to ED treatment;and (4) health disparities and the impact of COVID-19 on ED. Long-term and well-designed studies are needed to clarify the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on ED. The pandemic exposed several vulnerabilities within worldwide healthcare and social systems. Conclusion COVID-19 has a uniquely harmful impact on men's health and erectile function through biological, mental health, and healthcare access mechanisms. As the pandemic wanes, strategies to identify long-term effects and additional health care support may be needed to adequately mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on men's health.","Hsieh, Tung-Chin, Edwards, Natalie C.; Bhattacharyya, Samir K.; Nitschelm, Krista D.; Burnett, Arthur L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sxmr.2021.09.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Sexual Medicine Reviews;2021.; Publication details: Sexual Medicine Reviews;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20638,""

"Health status of women affected by homelessness: a cluster of in concreto human rights violations and a time for action","Health problems of women experiencing homelessness are driven either from the usual background characteristics of this population, or from the homeless lifestyle. Apart from poverty and unemployment, transition to homelessness is often associated with substance abuse, history of victimization, stress, poor mental health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Water insecurity can undermine bodily hygiene and dental health, and poses a greater risk of dehydration and opportunistic infections. Exposure to extreme environmental conditions like heat waves and natural disasters increases morbidity, accelerates aging, and reduces life expectancy. Nutrition-wise, a high prevalence of food insecurity, obesity, and micronutrient deficiencies is apparent due to low diet quality and food waste. Poor hygiene, violence, and overcrowding increase the susceptibility of these women to communicable diseases, including sexually transmitted ones and COVID-19. Furthermore, established cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus are often either undertreated, or neglected, and their complications are more widespread than in the general population. In addition, lack of medical screening and contraception non-use induce a variety of reproductive health issues. All these health conditions are tightly related to the violation of human rights in this population, including the rights to housing, water, food, reproduction, health, work, and no discrimination. Thus, the care provided to women experiencing homelessness should be optimized at a multidimensional level, spanning beyond the provision of a warm bed, to include access to clean water and sanitation, psychological support and stress-coping strategies, disease management and acute health care, food of adequate quality, opportunities for employment and support for any minor dependants.","Grammatikopoulou, Maria G.; Gkiouras, Konstantinos, Pepa, Aleks, Persynaki, Angeliki, Taousani, Eleftheria, Milapidou, Maria, Smyrnakis, Emmanouil, Goulis, Dimitrios G.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2021.09.007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Maturitas;2021.; Publication details: Maturitas;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20640,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health in eye care professionals, staff and students","Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in eye care professionals, staff, and optometry students. Methods: A 23-question survey was sent through social media and email to ophthalmologists, optometrists, staff, and optometry students. Demographics, stress level before and during COVID-19, positive and negative factors which impact mental health and screening questions for depression and anxiety were collected. Results: A total of 2,134 individuals from 50 USA states and Canada responded to the survey, including 887 optometrists, 252 ophthalmologists, 794 optometry students, and 185 eye care staff (16 had missing job information). There were 1319 participants (61.8%) stated that COVID 19 had a negative impact on their mental health, vs 25.4% stating no impact and 12.6% stating a positive impact. Participants reported significantly higher stress during COVID-19 compared to before, 3.49 ( Â± 1.12) vs 2.86 ( Â± 1.02) on a scale of 1-5 (P &lt; 0.0001). The top 3 self-reported factors that have negatively impacted mental health were: worries about family /friends being infected with COVID-19, worry about being infected with COVID-19 myself, and social isolation. The top 3 activities that helped maintain mental health were: outdoor activities, family time, and exercise. Conclusion/Relevance: Overall, 38.4% of the respondent reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, or both and 61.8% reported worsening mental health during COVID-19. Female, young people, and minority (Asians) were the risk factors for depression, anxiety, and psychological stress. This study warrants further monitoring and specific interventions for eye care practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent mental health disorders.","Jain, S.

"A survey study of compliance with mask-wearing to prevent coronavirus infections among korean adults","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the actual situation of mask wearing by adults in the early stages of the coronavirus epidemic and to identify factors that influence the transition to mask wearing and establish a management plan for more effective infectious disease prevention. Methods: This study was a multinational study conducted in ten countries. Data collected in Korea were analyzed. Adults over the age of 18 in the Seoul and Gyeonggi areas were targeted, and data for 657 adults were analyzed. Results: The average score for mask-wearing compliance was 16.25, ranging from 0 to 24. There was a significant positive correlation between anxiety and depression, as well as anxiety and mask-wearing compliance. There was a significant negative correlation between depression and mask-wearing compliance. Multiple linear regression revealed that mask-wearing compliance was predicted by levels of the anxiety, depression, and education. These explanatory variables explaining the dependent variable mask-wearing compliance was 12%. Conclusion: To identify and improve factors influencing mask-wearing compliance, general characteristics including educational background of participants were identified. Psychosocial factors such as anxiety and depression should also be considered. In addition, as the level of anxiety and depression will differ for each person, differentiated interventions according to psychological state should be provided.

"Assessment of Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) prevalence in feral American mink in Iceland Case study of a pending epizootiological concern in Europe","Background: Recurring escapes or deliberate releases and subsequent infiltration or establishment of feral populations by individuals from fur farms have been commonly noted since the beginning of fur industry expansion. Once animals have invaded ecosystems adjacent to source farms escapees can change the demography of the feral populations through hybridization, outbreeding depression, competition and spreading of various pathogens which can decimate wild populations. In our study, we aimed to assess spread of Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) in the feral population of American mink (Neovison vison) in Iceland. The additional objective was to elucidate whether basic morpho-anatomical parameters (i.e., Fulton's condition factor or spleen to body weight ratio) might be used as a preliminary indicator of AMDV infection. Methods: American mink (nÂ =Â 164) were captured by professional hunters in 8 regions of Iceland. The detection of AMDV in the spleen of male and female individuals was based on PCR amplification of an NS1 gene fragment. Results: We confirmed AMDV presence in 23.8% (nÂ =Â 39) of collected samples with no significant difference in infection rate between males and females. Additionally, we revealed that the prevalence of virus in the feral population was higher closer to fur farms. However, the countrywide prevalence and direction of AMDV distribution needs to be further investigated. Comparison of condition indices in non-infected and infected animals showed significant deterioration of body and spleen parameters in the latter group. Therefore, the application of basic measurements of the American mink may be used to evaluate the health status of individuals in terms of pathogen infection. Conclusions: The study shed a new light on prevalence and distribution of AMDV in the feral population of American mink in Iceland and the results might be successfully applied to develop models to infer dynamics of various pathogens, even those latently transmitted by disease-free animals.","Panicz, Remigiusz; Eljasik, Piotr; Skorupski, Jakub; Smietana, Przemyslaw; StefÃ¡nsson, RÃ³bert A; von Schmalensee, Menja; Szenejko, Magdalena","https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12060","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PeerJ;9: e12060, 2021.; Publication details: PeerJ;9: e12060, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20643,""
"An App-Based Surveillance System for Undergraduate Students' Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Prospective Cohort Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency that poses challenges to the mental health of approximately 1.4 million university students in Canada. Preliminary evidence has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on undergraduate student mental health and well-being; however, existing data are predominantly limited to cross-sectional survey-based studies. Owing to the evolving nature of the pandemic, longer-term prospective surveillance efforts are needed to better anticipate risk and protective factors during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The overarching aim of this study is to use a mobile (primarily smartphone-based) surveillance system to identify risk and protective factors for undergraduate students' mental health. Factors will be identified from weekly self-report data (eg, affect and living accommodation) and device sensor data (eg, physical activity and device usage) to prospectively predict self-reported mental health and service utilization. METHODS: Undergraduate students at Western University (London, Ontario, Canada), will be recruited via email to complete an internet-based baseline questionnaire with the option to participate in the study on a weekly basis, using the Student Pandemic Experience (SPE) mobile app for Android/iOS. The app collects sensor samples (eg, GPS coordinates and steps) and self-reported weekly mental health and wellness surveys. Student participants can opt in to link their mobile data with campus-based administrative data capturing health service utilization. Risk and protective factors that predict mental health outcomes are expected to be estimated from (1) cross-sectional associations among students' characteristics (eg, demographics) and key psychosocial factors (eg, affect, stress, and social connection), and behaviors (eg, physical activity and device usage) and (2) longitudinal associations between psychosocial and behavioral factors and campus-based health service utilization. RESULTS: Data collection began November 9, 2020, and will be ongoing through to at least October 31, 2021. Retention from the baseline survey (N=427) to app sign-up was 74% (315/427), with 175-215 (55%-68%) app participants actively responding to weekly surveys. From November 9, 2020, to August 8, 2021, a total of 4851 responses to the app surveys and 25,985 sensor samples (consisting of up to 68 individual data items each; eg, GPS coordinates and steps) were collected from the 315 participants who signed up for the app. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this real-world longitudinal cohort study of undergraduate students' mental health based on questionnaires and mobile sensor metrics is expected to show psychosocial and behavioral patterns associated with both positive and negative mental health-related states during pandemic conditions at a relatively large, public, and residential Canadian university campus. The results can be used to support decision-makers and students during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and similar future events. For comparable settings, new interventions (digital or otherwise) might be designed using these findings as an evidence base.

"Facilitators and barriers to using telepresence robots in aged care settings: a scoping review protocol","INTRODUCTION: Social isolation is a significant issue in aged care settings (eg, long-term care (LTC) and hospital) and is associated with adverse outcomes such as reduced well-being and loneliness. Loneliness is linked with depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, weakened immune system, poor physical health, poor quality of life and mortality. The use of robotic assistance may help mitigate social isolation and loneliness. Although telepresence robots have been used in healthcare settings, a comprehensive review of studies focusing on their use in aged care for reducing social isolation requires further investigation. This scoping review will focus on the use of telepresence robots to support social connection of older people in care settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will follow Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology. The review team consists of patient partners and family partners, a nurse researcher and a group of students. In the scoping review, we will search the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, PsycINFO (EBSCO), Web of Science and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. Google and Google Scholar will be used to search for additional literature. A handsearch will be conducted using the reference lists of included studies to identify additional relevant articles. The scoping review will consider studies of using a telepresence robotic technology with older adults in care settings (ie, LTC and hospital), published in English. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since the methodology of the study consists of collecting data from publicly available articles, it does not require ethics approval. By examining the current state of using telepresence to support older people in care settings, this scoping review can offer useful insight into users' needs (eg, patients' and care providers' needs) and inform future research and practice. We will share the scoping review results through conference presentations and an open access publication in a peer-reviewed journal.","Smith, Chelsea; Gregorio, Mario; Hung, Lillian","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051769","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e051769, 2021 Sep 17.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e051769, 2021 Sep 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20645,""
"Delirium and neuropsychological outcomes in critically Ill patients with COVID-19: a cohort study","OBJECTIVE: To characterise the clinical course of delirium for patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit, including postdischarge neuropsychological outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review and prospective survey study. SETTING: Intensive care units, large academic tertiary-care centre (USA). PARTICIPANTS: Patients (n=148) with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were eligible for inclusion. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Delirium was the primary outcome, assessed via validated chart review method. Secondary outcomes included measures related to delirium, such as delirium duration, antipsychotic use, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, inflammatory markers and final disposition. Neuroimaging data were also collected. Finally, a telephone survey was conducted between 1 and 2 months after discharge to determine neuropsychological function via the following tests: Family Confusion Assessment Method, Short Blessed Test, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Cognitive Abilities 4a and Patient-Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: Delirium was identified in 108/148 (73%) patients, with median (IQR) duration lasting 10 (4-17) days. In the delirium cohort, 50% (54/108) of patients were African American and delirious patients were more likely to be female (76/108, 70%) (absolute standardised differences >0.30). Sedation regimens, inflammation, delirium prevention protocol deviations and hypoxic-ischaemic injury were likely contributing factors, and the most common disposition for delirious patients was a skilled care facility (41/108, 38%). Among patients who were delirious during hospitalisation, 4/17 (24%) later screened positive for delirium at home based on caretaker assessment, 5/22 (23%) demonstrated signs of questionable cognitive impairment or cognitive impairment consistent with dementia and 3/25 (12%) screened positive for depression within 2 months after discharge. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 commonly experience a prolonged course of delirium in the intensive care unit, likely with multiple contributing factors. Furthermore, neuropsychological impairment may persist after discharge.","Ragheb, Jacqueline; McKinney, Amy; Zierau, Mackenzie; Brooks, Joseph; Hill-Caruthers, Maria; Iskander, Mina; Ahmed, Yusuf; Lobo, Remy; Mentz, Graciela; Vlisides, Phillip E","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050045","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e050045, 2021 09 17.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e050045, 2021 09 17.; COVID-19; Delirium; Aftercare; Cohort Studies; Critical Illness; Delirium/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Patient Discharge; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20646,""
"Impact of Psychiatric and Related Somatic Medications on the Duration and Severity of COVID-19: A Retrospective Explorative Multi-center Study from the German Metropolitan Ruhr-area","INTRODUCTION: Several psychiatric and somatic medications are assumed to improve COVID-19-symptoms. These include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants as well as anticoagulants, statins, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS)-inhibitors for somatic comorbid conditions. All these agents may reduce the hyperinflammatory response to SARS/CoV-2 or the related negative cardio-cerebrovascular outcomes. METHODS: In a retrospective longitudinal, multi-center inpatient study, we sought to explore the influence of psychiatric medications on COVID-19, comprising the period from diagnosing SARS/CoV-2-infection via PCR (nasopharyngeal swab) up to the next 21 days. Ninety-six psychiatric inpatients (mean age [SD] 65.5 (20.1), 54% females) were included. The primary outcome was the COVID-19-duration. Secondary outcomes included symptom severity and the presence of residual symptoms. RESULTS: COVID-19-related symptoms emerged in 60 (62.5%) patients, lasting 6.5 days on average. Six (6.3%) 56-95 years old patients died from or with COVID-19. COVID-19-duration and residual symptom-presence (n=22, 18%) were not significantly related to any substance. Respiratory and neuro-psychiatric symptom-load was significantly and negatively related to prescription of antidepressants and anticoagulants, respectively. Fatigue was negatively and positively related to RAAS-inhibitors and proton-pump-inhibitors, respectively. These significant relationships disappeared with p-value adjustment owed to multiple testing. The mean total psychiatric burden was not worsened across the study. DISCUSSION: None of the tested medications was significantly associated with the COVID-19-duration and -severity up to the end of post-diagnosing week 3. However, there were a few biologically plausible and promising relationships with antidepressants, anticoagulants, and RAAS-inhibitors before p-value adjustment. These should encourage larger and prospective studies to re-evaluate the influence of somatic and psychiatric routine medications on COVID-19-related health outcomes.","Bonnet, Udo; Claus, BenediktBernd; Schaefer, Martin; Kuhn, Jens; Nyhuis, Peter; Scherbaum, Norbert; BrÃ¼ne, Martin; Wakili, Velat; Juckel, Georg","https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1559-3904","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pharmacopsychiatry;2021 Sep 16.; Publication details: Pharmacopsychiatry;2021 Sep 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20647,""
"Global Mental Health Research: Time to Integrate Basic Science","The Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health recommends the inclusion of research on the biological underpinnings of mental disorders as part of efforts to reduce the global burden of mental disorders. The search for defining features of mental disorders in non-Euro American settings is historically charged for the field. Yet, as illustrated by analysis of the NIMH objectives, the biological study of mental disorders cannot be scientifically sound without better inclusion of under-represented, globally diverse populations. It is time for global mental health researchers to take up the challenge and advance impactful research across the full translational spectrum.","Meffert, Susan M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00625-9","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-5, 2021 Sep 13.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-5, 2021 Sep 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20648,""
"Comparison of Characteristics of Deaths From Drug Overdose Before vs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Rhode Island","Importance: The rate of deaths from overdose has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent US overdose mortality rates have been markedly high. However, scant data are available on the causes of this increase or subpopulations at elevated risk. Objective: To evaluate the rates and characteristics of deaths from drug overdose before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, population-based cohort study used data from 4 statewide databases linked at the person level via the Rhode Island Data Ecosystem on adults with deaths due to overdose in Rhode Island from January 1 to August 31, 2019, and January 1 to August 31, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The rates of unintentional deaths from drug-related overdose during the 2019 and 2020 observation periods overall and by sociodemographic characteristics, drugs contributing to the cause of death, location of death, and socioeconomic factors were evaluated. In subgroup analyses restricted to Medicaid beneficiaries (n = 271), the proportions of deaths from overdose by behavioral health treatment and diagnosis claims in the year before death were also examined. Results: A total of 470 adults who died of drug overdose were included in the analysis (353 men [75%]; mean [SD] age, 43.5 [12.1] years). The rate of deaths from overdose in Rhode Island increased 28.1%, from 29.2 per 100 000 person-years in 2019 to 37.4 per 100 000 person-years in 2020 (P = .009). Compared with 2019, rates of deaths due to overdose during 2020 were higher among men (43.2 vs 59.2 per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 person-years; P = .003), non-Hispanic White individuals (31.0 vs 42.0 per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 person-years; P = .005), single individuals (54.8 vs 70.4 per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 person-years; P = .04), deaths involving synthetic opioids (20.8 vs 28.3 per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 person-years; P = .005), and deaths occurring in a personal residence (13.2 vs 19.7 per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 person-years; P = .003). A decrease in the proportion of deaths from overdose involving heroin (11 of 206 [5%] vs <2% [exact value suppressed]; P = .02) and an increase among persons experiencing job loss (16 of 206 [8%] vs 41 of 264 [16%]; P = .01) from 2019 to 2020 were observed. Among individuals who died of overdose and were Medicaid beneficiaries, the proportions of those aged 50 to 59 years with anxiety (11 of 121 [9%] vs 29 of 150 [19%]; P = .03), men with depression (27 of 121 [22%] vs 57 of 150 [38%]; P = .008), and men with anxiety (28 of 121 [23%] vs 55 of 150 [37%]; P = .02) increased during 2020 compared with 2019. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, during the first 8 months of 2020, the rate of deaths from overdose increased in Rhode Island compared with the same period in 2019, and several emerging characteristics of deaths from drug overdose during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic were identified. These findings may inform interventions that address macroenvironmental changes associated with the pandemic.","Macmadu, Alexandria; Batthala, Sivakumar; Correia Gabel, Annice M; Rosenberg, Marti; Ganguly, Rik; Yedinak, Jesse L; Hallowell, Benjamin D; Scagos, Rachel P; Samuels, Elizabeth A; CerdÃ¡, Magdalena; Paull, Kimberly; Marshall, Brandon D L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.25538","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(9): e2125538, 2021 09 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(9): e2125538, 2021 09 01.; COVID-19; Drug Overdose/mortality; Adult; Cohort Studies; Drug Overdose/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quarantine/psychology; Quarantine/statistics & numerical data; Retrospective Studies; Rhode Island/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20649,""

"Classification of Chest X-Ray Images using Wavelet and MFCC Features and Support Vector Machine Classifier","The shortage and availability limitation of RT-PCR test kits and is a major concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The authorities' intention is to establish steps to control the propagation of the pandemic. However, COVID-19 is radiologically diagnosable using x-ray lung images. Deep learning methods have achieved cutting-edge performance in medical diagnosis software assistance. In this work, a new diagnostic method for detecting COVID-19 disease is implemented using advanced deep learning. Effective features were extracted using wavelet analysis and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) method, and they used in the classification process using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. A total of 2400 Xray images, 1200 of them classified as Normal (healthy) and 1200 as COVID-19, have been derived from a combination of public data sets to verify the validity of the proposed model. The experimental results obtained an overall accuracy of 98.8% by using five wavelet features, where the classification using MFCC features, MFCC-delta, and MFCC-delta-delta features reached accuracy around 97% on average. The results show that the proposed model has reached the required level of success to be applicable in COVID 19 diagnosis.","Abu Owida, H.; Al-Ghraibah, A.; Altayeb, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Classification+of+Chest+X-Ray+Images+using+Wavelet+and+MFCC+Features+and+Support+Vector+Machine+Classifier","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Engineering Technology & Applied Science Research; 11(4):7296-7301, 2021.; Publication details: Engineering Technology & Applied Science Research; 11(4):7296-7301, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20654,""
"Nostalgia as a device for dealing with traumatic experiences during the COVID-19 crisis","The paper is an investigation of nostalgia in its diverse manifestations in social media, mainly Facebook, during COVID-19 crisis in Bulgaria and is based on pre-observation which shows that communication through social media at that period was largely nostalgic. The study considers nostalgia as a strategy for dealing with the 2020 state of emergency during which the lack of physical contact and social experiences can create preconditions for anxiety, depression and fear leading to traumatic consequences. The research is based on empirical material actively collected using the method of the included observation in the period from the 15th of March 2020, when the state of emergency in connection with COVID-19 was declared in Bulgaria, until the 30th of June 2020. The purpose of the paper is to present the nostalgic modes in Facebook and to reveal the reasons for their success as communicative and social messages. Applying interdisciplinary and multimodal approach the study describes the nostalgic manifestations by classifying thematically the initiatives, communication strategies and topics, oriented towards the past, as well as revealing their meaning for the society. The results show that the main role of nostalgic Facebook modes is to unite people in times of isolation, to raise their spirit and thus save them from the traumas that the COVID-19 crisis can cause. The multimodal analysis of the Facebook images from the empirical data confirms that social media and modern technologies make it possible to create `new products` based on old stories or memories that acquire a new meaning in the specific COVID-19 situation, modelled by the culture and mentality of Bulgarians in isolation.

"Child and youth mental health needs and service utilization during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the lives of children, youth, and their families and their access to mental health services through new virus containment measures, such as social distancing guidelines, school and service closures, and the emergence of online mental health services. In this study, we utilized a total of 47,417 interRAI assessments to evaluate the impact of the current pandemic on the mental health service needs and referral trends of children and youth across 55 mental health service agencies in Ontario, Canada. Child and youth assessments that were conducted in the period of March 1 to October 31 in 2018 and 2019 were compared with the same period in 2020 to assess pandemic-related differences. Findings demonstrated that mental health assessments among children and youth decreased significantly during the pandemic period, with the greatest decline observed among children from low-income neighborhoods. Results also demonstrated a change in the proportion of mental health concerns previously seen in children and youth. Specifically, referrals for anxiety, depression, self-harm, problem videogaming, and Internet use increased, whereas referrals related hyperactivity/distractibility, risk of harm to others, aggressive, and disruptive behavior decreased. A decrease in bullying and increase in domestic violence exposure was also noted during the pandemic, with no reported differences in children and youth's experiences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. The clinical implications for children, youth, and their families, especially those within more vulnerable communities, are discussed.

"Changes in mental health and well-being are associated with living arrangements with parents during COVID-19 among sexual minority young persons in the US","Sexual minority young persons may be at risk for compounding mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic due to their existing vulnerabilities for psychological inequities. Indeed, recent research has documented that sexual minority young persons are experiencing compounding psychiatric effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, researchers and practitioners have hypothesized that sexual minority youth and young adults may experience unique hardships related to their sexual and gender identities and familial conflict as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and living arrangement changes with their parents and families. This study aims to investigate whether there are changes in sexual minority (and nonsexual minority) young adults' (SMYAs') mental health and well-being among those living with and living without their parents before and after the start of COVID-19. Among a cross-sectional sample of SMYAs (n = 294;Mage = 22 years;age range = 18-26) and non-SMYAs (n = 874;Mage = 22 years;age range = 18-26) defined by whether they were living with or living without their parents before and after the start of COVID-19, we retrospectively analyzed changes in psychological distress and well-being. SMYAs who returned to their parents' homes during post-onset of COVID-19 reported greater mental distress and lower well-being, followed by those who were living with their parents both before and after the start of COVID-19. Patterns were not consistent among non-SMYAs, and lower magnitudes of change were seen. There is a significant public health need for mental health services and family education resources for supporting SMYAs in the context of COVID-19 and beyond. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Researchers and practitioners hypothesized that sexual minority youth and young adults may experience unique hardships related to family as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home orders. Our results show that both sexual minority and heterosexual young adults who consistently lived with their parents before and during the pandemic and who moved back home with their parents experienced increases in psychological distress and decreases in well-being, with greater burden seen among sexual minority young adults and those who moved back home with their parents.

"Religious education in Kazakhstan: <U+0422>he challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic","The article explores the impact of distant learning and digital technologies on the educational process in theological education institutions, as well as on religious and educational practices at religious organizations in the context of the quarantine restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kazakhstan. The research methodology consisted of semi-structed interviews with organizers and participants of distant learning, clergy, focus group method, and the analysis of digital resources. The study included religious educational institutions representing Islam, Orthodoxy, Catholicism, as well as their religious education for believers. The authors conclude that the pandemic has accelerated the process of digitalization of religion in Kazakhstan, as well as the sphere of religious education. Based on Heidi Campbellâ€™s religious-social shaping approach to technology, the authors claim that the reflection of the experience gained in distance learning by its participants expresses the process of coordinating the application of media technologies to religious education in order to legitimize their use in the Kazakhstani context. The research data reveals an ambiguous and mainly negative attitude toward distance learning among respondents which lead to the spreading of the discourse about the difficulties and limits of using new technologies for religious education with its traditional pedagogy, teaching methods and type of religious authority.

"COVID-19 preparedness and the anxiety of Thai citizens","The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought sickness and fatality to Thai citizens. In addition, it left a tremendous psychological impact on mental health as they experienced panic and anxiety about controlling situations and preserving their physical and mental well-being. This study aimed to analyze the factors influencing COVID-19 preparedness and anxiety based on groups of Thai citizens. Online questionnaires were employed to collect data from 2,768 respondents selected through convenience sampling and snowball sampling on Facebook, having shared questionnaires with 190 other users. Data were collected from March 29 to April 3, 2020. The acquired data were analyzed using percentage and logistic regression analyses. It found that the influencing factors of preparedness included citizensâ€™ sex, residing province, and work or off-house conditions. In contrast, the influencing factors of anxiety included their sex, age, residing province, and income adequacy. The results conveyed that Thai citizens were anxious about the pandemic and had been attempting to cope. In addition, issued policies should respond to the public promptly to prevent unnecessary panic and to maximize public cooperation against future situations put forth by the pandemic.

"Providing cognitive behavioral group therapy via videoconferencing: Lessons learned from a rapid scale-up of telehealth services","In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, federal, state, and local governments in the United States implemented restrictions on in-person gatherings and provided recommendations for minimum distance between individuals to minimize the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. These restrictions necessitated an unprecedented scaling up of telehealth services across the health care system, including in mental health and substance use disorder care. The learning curve for clinicians-many of whom had no prior experience with telehealth-has been steep. The rapid shift to remote services required adjusting to technical and clinical challenges as services were being provided. The lessons learned during this time have potential to continue to inform telehealth services, even after the acute need for social distancing has abated. In this article, we aim to share some of our lessons learned during this period from providing group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy. We discuss both technical and clinical challenges in conducting remote cognitive-behavioral groups via videoconferencing software, as well as successes and failures in adjusting to these challenges.

"Playing with the diary: how crafting a multimodal and sensory diary can have a positive impact on teacher wellbeing","This article uses the outcome of a small-scale research project â€“ the â€˜Diary Toolkitâ€™ (DT) â€“ to explore the creative process of crafting a multimodal, sensory diary as a positive tool for teacher wellbeing. In an educational climate facing the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DT offered an epiphanic space for teachers in England, helping them navigate their way through this highly emotional and anxious time. Indeed, against the backdrop of COVID, a hidden pandemic has arisen: a decline in teachersâ€™ mental health and wellbeing.The article situates the DT within the field of reflective practice as a creative approach, arguing that in addition to supporting teaching and learning, it can also help teacher wellbeing. To demonstrate this, some key findings from the â€˜Reimagining the Diaryâ€™ (2018) project are used, focusing, in particular, on those around choice/creativity, and structure/parameters. The article concludes by stating that the creative process of crafting a sensory and multimodal diary gives teachers the healing and nurturing space currently needed, as well as an opportunity to represent their wellbeing in multiple ways so that they can flourish inside and outside the classroom.

"Is deliberative democracy possible during a pandemic? Reflections of a bioethicist","In 1985, Governor Mario Cuomo established the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law to provide guidance on issues at the interface of medicine, ethics and the law. During its tenure, the Task Force has been the leading state-based commission in this space producing landmark reports on end-of-life care, physician-assisted suicide, genetic testing, newborn care, brain death, surrogate decision making, assisted reproduction, and ventilator allocation in pandemic flu. These documents have informed state policy, both regulatory and statutory, and had an outsized influence on policy deliberation nationwide. Despite this notable provenance, the Task Force was missing in action during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although individual members were sought for consultation, the Task Force as a whole did not meet during the entirety of the pandemic. This article will explore the consequences of this omission and argue that as a deliberative body, the Task Force should have been an essential component of statewide debate on questions of crisis standards of care, health equity, and vaccine allocation. The COVID-19 experience exposed weaknesses in New York's process of deliberative democracy in response to the pandemic. A state with a distinguished history in this interdisciplinary space was left behind with the views of important constituencies left unheard and communities unserved. Better apprehending how this abdication of responsibility occurred.

"Army home visitors' implementation of military family violence prevention programming in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","The Army New Parent Support Program (Army NPSP) provides home visitation services that promote positive parenting strategies and aims to prevent family violence for expectant military parents and military families with children from birth to age 3. Since the onset of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), Army NPSP services have rapidly adapted to a telehealth model to fit with the suggested practices of physical distancing. Employing a grounded theory approach, nine virtual focus groups with 30 Army NPSP home visitors across eight installations were conducted to examine how this rapid shift has impacted their services, practice, and professional role. The present study identified two overarching themes: (1) working with families (e.g., continued engagement with families, increased communication, shifting family needs) and (2) adjusting to telework (e.g., technology, professional collaboration and communication, professional growth). Findings from these focus groups indicated that home visitors were actively engaged with their clients and experienced both challenges and benefits of telehealth. While the rapid transition was a big change, and home visitors missed the face-to-face interactions, they expressed that they were adapting and improving their virtual service delivery with time. Increased concerns regarding families' well-being due to social and physical isolation, increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, and grief for losses due to COVID-19, along with the ability to continue connections with these highly mobile families, points to the importance of telehealth as a means to implement parenting programs vital to military family well-being.

"Mental Health Interventions in Complex Political Contexts","Global mental health specialists provide mental health (MH) services worldwide in various settings with complex humanitarian needs. Tailoring MH interventions and psychosocial support to the context and culture is essential for ensuring safe and competent services. A complex political context (CPC) is characterised by complex political dynamics, social instability and political violence resulting in gross violation of human rights and massive trauma. Examples of such settings include dictatorships, military junta and other forms of government-sponsored, sectarian or ethnic violence towards marginalised groups who are targeted, oppressed and discriminated. In some countries, receiving MH services can expose beneficiaries and put them at risk. Scaling up MH support is needed when serving persons with special needs and those at particular risk for discrimination and victimisation. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has worsened the situation and been used by unscrupulous politicians to tighten governmental control, blame already marginalised groups and deny or further limit their access to resources and health care. These guidelines aim to equip MH workers with an understanding of the professional challenges and ethical dilemmas posed by CPCs. They offer recommendations for programming and delivering MH services in CPC. Providing MH interventions in a CPC calls for special professional expertise, extensive use of supervision and peer support, and personal competencies such as self-awareness and self-care.","Cherepanov, Elena","https://doi.org/10.4103/intv.intv_14_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Intervention; 19(2):149-154, 2021.; Publication details: Intervention; 19(2):149-154, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20665,""
"""The Chinese virus"": How COVID-19's transmission context and fear affect negative attitudes toward Chinese people","This research examines the impact of COVID-19 fear on attitudes toward Chinese depending on the context of propagation of COVID-19. We predicted that COVID-19 fear was linked to negative attitudes toward Chinese people, especially when the spread of the virus was external (in China;vs. when the spread was internal with transmission within the French ingroup). We collected data online (N = 403) when COVID-19 was being transmitted externally, outside of France (Phase 1) and after transmission between French people had begun (Phase 2). We measured COVID-19 fear and attitudes toward Chinese people. Our hypothesis was supported. COVID-19 fear was linked to more negative attitudes toward Chinese people only in Phase 1.

We also discuss the potential to promote peace and reduce conflict by focusing on internal crises versus external threats.

"Intersecting losses and integrative practices: Work and mental health during the COVID-19 era and beyond","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has resulted in unimaginable loss of life coupled with the loss of livelihoods for millions of people across the globe. In this article, we discuss the unique challenges of this crisis with a particular focus on how the pandemic has led to intersecting losses that have been exacerbated by ongoing social marginalization and inequities. An integrative treatment model informed by psychology of loss theories is presented for understanding the intersecting losses evoked by the pandemic-including the loss of work and financial security, relationships and collective rituals, routines and work-life boundaries, and physical and psychological health. Innovative features of this integrative perspective include a focus on enhancing critical consciousness, the use of integrative mental health and work-based interventions, and trauma-informed care. A case example and an integrative, prevention-based intervention that focuses on both work and mental health issues conclude the article. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement This article examines the intersecting nature of losses that have been evoked by COVID-19, which encompass work and financial security, relationships and collective rituals, routines and work-life boundaries, and physical and psychological health. These losses, which have taken place amidst the continuing struggle of marginalization and social inequity, call for a concerted effort by psychology, writ large, to innovate and integrate practices and prevention efforts. New directions for integrative practices and prevention are presented in conjunction with a conceptual model that can inform future efforts to support people and communities during and after the pandemic.

"Increasing mental health service utilization in Black populations during COVID-19: Clarifying clinician responsibility","Black communities have been affected disproportionately by the negative conditions associated with COVID-19, such as higher levels of morbidity and mortality, unemployment, underemployment, food insecurity, homelessness, grief and loss, and the pandemics of intersectionality. This adversity is often associated with greater vulnerabilities in the areas of psychological functioning and wellness. Black communities have historically had negative experiences with the medical establishment. Despite recent increases, Black Americans still tend to underutilize mental health services due to many barriers, such as stigma, attitudes of mistrust, geographical inaccessibility, lack of affordable options, the availability of culturally humble mental health providers, myths of Black invincibility, and challenges navigating complex systems of care. Due to the physical and psychological impacts of the polypandemic, Black populations are in even greater need of mental health care. Additionally, there is increased risk to the mental health of Black children in relation to trauma and the suicide crisis. This article will focus on our responsibility as a clinical community to reduce and eliminate the obstacles to service utilization among Black populations using the following strategies: understanding historic cultural mistrust;enhancing the pipeline of Black psychologists;integrating cultural adaptations into therapy;acknowledgment of the suicidal crisis and impact of adverse childhood experiences among Black children and youth;affirming the importance of religious/spiritual worldview and practices;and prioritizing self-care for psychologists. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement The present study identifies multiple strategies psychologists can employ to increase mental health utilization among Black populations, particularly during COVID-19, including understanding historical cultural mistrust, enhancing the pipeline of Black clinicians, and integrating cultural adaptations into therapy. The importance of prioritizing self-care is demonstrated through findings in the literature as well as data from a predominantly Black independent practice in order to maximize client engagement.

"Training Survivors of Gender-Based Violence in the Problem Management Plus Programme in Turkey","Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict, the impact on the local population has rapidly increased, with severe consequent displacement to neighbouring countries (such as Turkey), material losses and psychological damage due to witnessing death, torture, physical and psychological abuse or surviving it, including high levels of gender-based violence. At the same time, available resources to aid impacted communities have not come close to matching need. To respond to this urgent need, the INSAN Psychosocial Support Centre in Istanbul, Turkey initiated the Safety Spark project as a capacity building project with 20 refugee gender-based violence survivors to be trained in Problem Management Plus. This is â€œa psychological intervention that aims to improve mental health, functioning and psychosocial wellbeing of adultsâ€ and thereafter to provide mental health and psychosocial support to other women survivors, thereby increasing the capacity of the community to heal itself. However, right after training, but 2 weeks before implementation sessions began, the onslaught of the coronavirus disease 2019 reached Turkey, making provision of traditional psychological support impossible. With the support of World Health Organization, an online training was added to the programme and survivors were taught to provide support remotely as well. The project is ongoing, and observed results appear to be promising. This field report provides an overview of the target population, procedures, settings and challenges faced during the training and implementation, solutions to overcome them and future recommendations.","Akbay-Safi, Sena, Tabba, Areej, Laila Ragab, Mahmoud","https://doi.org/10.4103/intv.intv_21_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Intervention; 19(2):180-186, 2021.; Publication details: Intervention; 19(2):180-186, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20669,""
"""Coming together after tragedy reaffirms the strong sense of community and pride we have:"" LGBTQ people find strength in community and cultural values during the COVID-19 pandemic","For lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people, community and cultural values have served as protective factors during large scale events such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the 2016 Orlando Pulse Nightclub massacre.

Some 81.4% (n=153) were working full- or part-time during the pandemic with low-moderate work-related risks for COVID-19 transmission (mean =2.56, min=0, max=7, SD= 2.102). The sample had a moderate household size (mean=2.64, min=1, max=6, SD= 1.363) with low levels of multi-generational living, as 10.6% (n=20) had seniors living with them. For risk of COVID-19 transmission within the home, there was a low-moderate risk (mean=1.668;min=1, max= 4, SD=.699). Only 19.1% (n=36) had COVID-19 in the past year. Both physical health status and mental/emotional health status declined during the pandemic. They had moderate mental distress (mean= 1.94;min=0;max=3, SD=1.066) in the past year-with depression (70.7%, n=133), anxiety (78.2%, n=147), and trauma (45.2%, n=85), while 43% (N=81) sought counselling. They had moderately good social support (mean = 2.71;min=0, max=4, SD=1.172), and a good quality of life (mean=4.05, min=1, max=6, SD=1.073). They reported moderately high medical mistrust (mean=3.273;min=1.50, max=5.00, SD=.7615), and 58.7% (N=127) did or would vaccinate. Scores on the new Our COVID-19 Knowledge Test (OCKT-44) produced a mean of 40.34 (min=23, max=44, SD=3.092) for excellent knowledge, and 83.8% (N=155) of would recommend the OCKT-44 to others.

"Perfectionism, general mental health, and performance in college baseball players","The purpose of this study was to try and further understanding of the relationship between perfectionism and performance, especially among an athlete population. Specifically, the aim of this study was to understand the relationship between a college baseball player's levels of perfectionism and general state of mental health, and their performance. Perfectionism was measured on three levels (Self-Oriented Perfectionism, Other-Oriented Perfectionism, Socially-Prescribed Perfectionism) using the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS);general mental health was measured using the General Health Questionnaire-9 (GHQ-9);and baseball player performance was measured using the On-Base Plus Slugging statistic. Due to the 2020 college baseball season being ended prematurely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study was limited by a shortage of information related to baseball player's performance. Therefore, two statistical analyses were performed on the data gathered. The first, integrating usable performance data, displayed no relationship between perfectionism, general mental health, and performance [R2 = .074, R2adj = -.003, F (4, 48) = .955, p = .441]. The second analysis, consisting of only perfectionism and general mental health scores, displayed a small but significant positive correlation between perfectionism and general mental health [R2 = .181, R2adj = .151, F (3, 82) = 6.037, p = .001].

"Osilodrostat: A Review of Recent Clinical Studies and Practical Recommendations for its Use in the Treatment of Cushing Disease","OBJECTIVE: Cushing disease (CD) is characterized by chronic hypercortisolism caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. Surgery remains the first-line treatment option; however, medical therapy is essential if surgery is contraindicated or fails to achieve remission or when recurrence occurs after surgical remission. Osilodrostat (Isturisa), a novel steroidogenic inhibitor, is now approved for the treatment of CD in the United States and Cushing syndrome in Europe. Herein, we review pharmacology and data on the efficacy, safety, and clinical use of osilodrostat and provide guidance on its use in treating patients with CD. METHODS: We reviewed the literature and published clinical trial data of osilodrostat use in patients with Cushing syndrome. Detailed information related to the clinical assessment of osilodrostat use, potential drug-to-drug interactions, drug initiation, dose titration, and the monitoring of drug tolerability were discussed. RESULTS: Clinical trial data demonstrated that osilodrostat, by virtue of inhibiting 11-ÃŸ hydroxylase, potently and rapidly decreased the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels and sustained these reductions, with improved glycemia, blood pressure, body weight, and quality of life as well as lessened depression. Osilodrostat may interact with certain drugs, resulting in QT prolongation, which requires careful assessment of concomitant medications and periodic monitoring using electrocardiogram, respectively. The common adverse effects include adrenal insufficiency, hypokalemia, edema, and hyperandrogenic symptoms, which can be minimized using a slower up-titration dosing regimen. CONCLUSION: Osilodrostat is an effective, new treatment option for CD, with positive effects on cardiovascular and quality of life parameters as well as tolerable adverse effects. This article provides a review of the pharmacology of osilodrostat and offers practical recommendations on the use of osilodrostat to treat CD.","Yuen, Kevin C J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eprac.2021.06.012","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Endocr Pract;27(9): 956-965, 2021 Sep.; Publication details: Endocr Pract;27(9): 956-965, 2021 Sep.; Pituitary ACTH Hypersecretion; Humans; Imidazoles; Pituitary ACTH Hypersecretion/drug therapy; Pyridines; Quality of Life; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20676,""
"Increased Blood Monocytic Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells but Low Regulatory T Lymphocytes in Patients with Mild COVID-19","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may produce a systemic disease, the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), with high morbidity and mortality. Even though we do not fully understand the interaction of innate and adaptive immunity in the control and complications of the viral infection, it is well recognized that SARS-CoV-2 induces an immunodepression that impairs the elimination of the virus and favors its rapid dissemination in the organism. Even less is known about the possible participation of inhibitory cells of the innate immune system, such as the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), or the adaptive immune system, such as the T regulatory cells (Tregs). That is why we aimed to study blood levels of MDSCs, as well as lymphocyte subpopulations, including Tregs, and activated (OX-40+) and inhibited (PD-1) T lymphocytes in patients with mild COVID-19 in comparison with data obtained from control donors. We have found that 20 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and no health history of immunosuppression had a significant increase in the number of peripheral monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSC), but a decrease in Tregs, as well as an increase in the number of inhibited or exhausted T cells, whereas the number of activated T cells was significantly decreased compared with that from 20 healthy controls. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation (r = 0.496) between the number of M-MDSC and the number of activated T cells. Therefore, M-MDSC rather than Tregs may contribute to the immunosuppression observed in patients with COVID-19.","JimÃ©nez-Cortegana, Carlos; LirÃ³, Julia; PalazÃ³n-CarriÃ³n, Natalia; Salamanca, Elena; Sojo-Dorado, JesÃºs; de la Cruz-Merino, Luis; Pascual, Ãlvaro; RodrÃ­guez-BaÃ±o, JesÃºs; SÃ¡nchez-Margalet, VÃ­ctor","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vim.2021.0044","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Viral Immunol;2021 Sep 16.; Publication details: Viral Immunol;2021 Sep 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20677,""
"Telehealth Utilization During COVID-19 Among People with Diagnosed Mental Health Conditions","Background: Despite the potential benefits and the demonstrated uptake throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, studies have found that telemental health is still underused. The objective of the study was to explore the associations between mental health diagnoses and telehealth utilization during the pandemic. Methods: The study utilized a cross-sectional survey among adult Arkansans (n = 754). Logistic regression was used to determine the association between a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression and telehealth utilization. Results: Forty-two percent of respondents reported utilizing telehealth during the pandemic. Respondents with a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression had three times greater odds of utilizing telehealth (odds ratio = 2.97) than those with no diagnoses. Discussion: Utilization of telehealth care during the COVID-19 pandemic was lower in our sample compared with other nationally representative surveys; however, utilization was higher among people with a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression. Conclusions: The results indicate the need for outreach to increase telehealth utilization.","Andersen, Jennifer A; Rowland, Brett; Gloster, Erin; McElfish, Pearl A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0356","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Telemed J E Health;2021 Sep 09.; Publication details: Telemed J E Health;2021 Sep 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20678,""
"Changes in Substance Use and Mental Health Burden among Women during the Second Wave of COVID-19 in Germany","Unlike men, who are disproportionately affected by severe disease progression and mortality from COVID-19, women may be more affected by the economic, social and psychological consequences of the pandemic. Psychological distress and mental health problems are general risk factors for increases in the use of alcohol and other substances as a dysfunctional coping mechanism. METHODS: An analysis was carried out of the female subset (n = 2153) of a population-based, cross-sectional online survey (October-December 2020), covering the ""second wave"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. RESULTS: Among women, 23% increased their alcohol use, 28.4% increased their nicotine use and 44% increased their illicit substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty percent reported major depressive symptoms and 23.4% symptoms of generalized anxiety. Generalized anxiety proved to be a significant predictor of increases in alcohol and nicotine use in logistic regression. DISCUSSION: The mental health burden remained high during the second wave of COVID-19 and alcohol, nicotine and other substance use increased. However, the association between mental health and substance use was weak. Psychological distress does not seem to be the main motivator of substance use.","Schecke, Henrike; Fink, Madeleine; BÃ¤uerle, Alexander; Skoda, Eva-Maria; Schweda, Adam; Musche, Venja; Dinse, Hannah; WeismÃ¼ller, Benjamin Maurice; Moradian, Sheila; Scherbaum, Norbert; Teufel, Martin","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189728","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 15.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 15.; COVID-19; Depressive Disorder, Major; Substance-Related Disorders; Anxiety/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Female; Germany/epidemiology; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20679,""
"From Burden to Depressive Symptoms in Informal Caregivers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Path Analysis","BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the complex relationship between the multiple determinants of the caregiving process, the caregiver burden, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a nationally representative sample (n = 798) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia from March to September 2020. A nine-section questionnaire designed for this study included the characteristics of caregivers, characteristics of care and care recipients, COVID-19 related questions, and the following standardized instruments: 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, Fatigue Severity Scale, Activities of Daily Living Scale and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. Path analysis was used for the simultaneous assessment of the direct and indirect relationships of all determinants. RESULTS: More than two thirds (71.9%) of informal caregivers experienced a burden, and more than one quarter (27.1%) had depression symptomatology. Self-rated physical health, need for psychosocial support, and caregiver burden were the main direct predictors of depression. Multiple determinants of the caregiving process had indirect effects on depressive symptomatology via the caregiver burden as a mediating factor. CONCLUSIONS: The subjective burden presented a significant risk factor for depressive symptoms in caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The provision of psychosocial support was identified as an important opportunity to reduce depressive risk in informal caregivers.","Rajovic, Tatjana; Todorovic, Natasa; Vracevic, Milutin; Rajovic, Nina; Pavlovic, Andrija; Pavlovic, Vedrana; Grbic, Igor; Sapic, Rosa; Krsmanovic, Slavica; Vukmirovic, Marijana; Stanisavljevic, Tamara; Markovic, Ksenija; Mostic, Tanja; Stanisavljevic, Dejana; Milic, Natasa","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189577","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 11.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 11.; COVID-19; Depression; Activities of Daily Living; Caregivers; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20680,""
"The Mediating Role of Resilience in the Relationship between Perceived Stress and Mental Health","The COVID-19 pandemic has created great uncertainty around the world, and due to the pandemic, nurses have been exposed to an increase in highly stressful clinical situations. This study examines the relationships between perceived stress and emotional disorders among nurses who have provided direct patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores the mediating role of resilience in these relationships. In an online cross-sectional design, we asked Spanish nurses (N = 214) to complete self-reported scales, and we performed correlation and mediation analyses between perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-4), resilience (Wagnild Resilience Scale, RS-14), wellbeing (World Health Organization Wellbeing Index, five items, WHO-5), anxiety (PHQ-2) and depression (GAD-2). The nurses self-reported moderate levels of perceived stress, considerable psychological distress and high resilience. We found resilience to be significantly negatively correlated with the reported levels of perceived stress, anxiety and depression (p < 0.001). The mediating analysis revealed that resilience played a protective role in the direct relationships of stress with depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. To conclude, our findings supported the hypothesis that resilience mediated the relationship between stress and mental health.","Lara-Cabrera, Mariela Loreto; Betancort, MoisÃ©s; MuÃ±oz-Rubilar, C Amparo; RodrÃ­guez Novo, Natalia; De Las Cuevas, Carlos","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189762","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 16.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 16.; COVID-19; Resilience, Psychological; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20681,""
"PaLS Study of Sleep Deprivation and Mental Health Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic among University Students: A Cross-Sectional Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way many people live. To assess its impact on sleep quality and quantity, blue light exposure, and the mental health of Polish university students, a cross-sectional survey was conducted. Almost half of the participants were medical students (47.62%; n = 630). The majority of students were suffering from insomnia (58.13%, n = 769). Almost every third student was sleeping less than 7 h a day (30.39%, n = 402). Our study showed that a short sleep duration correlates with poorer mental health outcomes. Respondents who declared sadness and depression were more likely to suffer from insomnia (OR = 5.6997, 95% CI: 4.3641-7.4441). Difficulty with tasks was also more likely to co-occur with insomnia (OR = 5.4723, 95% CI: 4.3007 to 6.9630). The results of this study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the deterioration of sleep quality and quantity as well as the psychological well-being of Polish students. It is important to take steps to promote proper sleeping habits to alleviate the risk of mental health disorders in this group of people.","Gruba, Grzegorz; Kasiak, Przemyslaw Seweryn; Gebarowska, Joanna; Adamczyk, Natalia; Sikora, Zuzanna; Jodczyk, Alicja Monika; Mamcarz, Artur; Sliz, Daniel","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189581","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 Sep 11.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 Sep 11.; COVID-19; Students, Medical; Anxiety; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Deprivation/epidemiology; Universities; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20682,""
"Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Uptake among Black Men Who Have Sex with Men (BMSM) in the Southern US","Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) living in the United States (U.S.) South are disproportionately affected by HIV and experience significant disparities in HIV incidence, access to HIV care, and prevention across ages and socio-economic statuses. The aim of this commentary is to critically review current literature on the state of PrEP use among BMSM in the U.S. South, including identifying barriers and facilitators to PrEP use in order to inform intervention development. Extant literature shows that despite the documented benefits of PrEP as an effective HIV-prevention method, its uptake among BMSM is limited across the U.S. South. Common barriers to PrEP uptake included stigma, homophobia, mistrust of healthcare systems, negative attitudes from healthcare providers, access and transportation issues, poverty, and misinformation about PrEP. These barriers are likely to have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited access to PrEP and other HIV-prevention programs, such as HIV testing, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and condoms for BMSM are likely increase HIV incidence in this community. Moreover, the rapid expansion of telehealth services during the COVID-19 period may offer increased opportunity to scale-up PrEP through telehealth interventions, especially if in-person services remain limited due to pandemic precautions. Given the intersectional barriers that limit the access and uptake of PrEP among BMSM, we suggest that tailored programs or interventions that seek to address PrEP disparities among Southern BMSM should adopt intersectional and interdisciplinary approaches to better understand the complex challenges of scaling up PrEP. More studies are needed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on HIV-prevention services among BMSM and to understand how to co-develop-with the BMSM community and healthcare providers-culturally acceptable interventions to reduce the identified challenges using intersectional and interdisciplinary approaches.","Adeagbo, Oluwafemi; Harrison, Sayward; Qiao, Shan; Li, Xiaoming","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189715","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 15.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(18)2021 09 15.; Anti-HIV Agents; COVID-19; HIV Infections; Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Anti-HIV Agents/therapeutic use; HIV Infections/drug therapy; HIV Infections/epidemiology; HIV Infections/prevention & control; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; United States; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20683,""

"High psychological burden of young family physicians early in the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from an exploratory survey","Background Previous pandemics such as SARS in 2002 revealed an especially high psychological burden of frontline healthcare professionals in hospitals directly involved in the treatment of confirmed cases. As family physicians are among the first exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, assessing their psychological burden and needs for support is important. Methods A web-based survey was distributed among family physicians of a German university teaching practice network. The questionnaire consisted of validated instruments to evaluate symptoms of psychological distress, i.e., the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7), peritraumatic distress inventory (PDI), and insomnia severity index (ISI). Additional self-developed items addressed sociodemographic and professional characteristics including professional duties and protective equipment available. Effects between the symptoms were examined using bivariate Pearson correlation. Results The participation rate was 31 % (36 of 116) with 33 valid cases. About 47 % (n = 17) of the respondents were 56 years old or more. 66.7 % (n = 22) physicians reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 = 10) and 51.5 % (n = 17) moderate to severe signs of anxiety (GAD-7 _ 10). Physicians with depressive symptoms showed more signs of anxiety (p &lt;.001) and insomnia (p &lt;.001). There is a negative correlation between age and severity of depressive symptoms (p =.041) and insomnia (p =.002). The regression analysis showed that younger participants were more likely to show depressive symptoms (ÃŸ = â€“.358, p =.046), even after correcting for gender (R2 =.402). Conclusions Depressive symptoms were frequent among family physicians, especially in younger physicians who were also more likely to report symptoms of insomnia. The symptoms of psychological distress are unlikely to be explained by a lack of protective equipment, because the majority had sufficient supplies. Â© 2021, Deutscher Arzte-Verlag GmbH.

"Human Resources during COVID-19: A Monthly Survey on Mental Health and Working Attitudes of Czech Employees and Managers during the Year 2020","This study investigates the effect of COVID-19 lockdowns and non-lockdown phases on managers and employees in the Czech Republic in the year 2020. The Czech Republic came through the first COVID-19 wave in spring 2020 with low case numbers, but became one of the countries with the highest case incidences in the second autumn wave in Europe. The study focused on examining the differences of perceptions on digital readiness of the company, working style, and mental health variables of working personnel in lockdown and non-lockdown phases. Data was obtained by an online survey conducted monthly from March-2020 to December-2020 with the same questions each month. Collected data consisted of respondentsâ€™ basic information on the actual situation, on perceptions on company and technology and on perceptions of the own mental state in the given month, retrieved from a pool of employees and managers from the Czech Republic machine and equipment manufacturersâ€™ industry. Statistical analysis was conducted with the Kruskal-Wallis test for ordinal variables to check for significant differences in perceptions during 2020. Results show that managers in general and telecommuting-experienced workers in particular are better able to adapt to forced home office, while telecommuting-inexperienced employees struggle to adapt positively even with increasing company support and with an increasing digital team communication.","Pfeifer, Marcel Rolf","https://doi.org/10.3390/su131810055","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(18):10055, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(18):10055, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20687,""
"Ecosystem of Environmentally Sustainable Municipal Infrastructure in the Ukraine","For the Ukrainian population, there are factors surrounding the choices and preferences one must consider when changing permanent residence. Smart residential areas should be built according to Ukrainian legislation and global innovations, which would reduce administrative dislocations, the load on megalopolises, and negative anthropogenic impacts, and should be based on the increase in energy efficiency and reducing waste. We analyzed the core principles of designing smart residential areas and concluded that constructing cutting-edge residential areas should involve private investments in order to avoid shadow schemes and irrational use of funds (in the Ukraine, the share of the shadow market is more than 50%). Research shows that, as humans inhabit a three-dimensional space, it is possible to predict migration and other permanent residence/behavioral responses, the analysis of which allows controlling migration flows and improves the conditions of Ukraineâ€™s small residential areas based on decarbonization. We conclude that energy saving systems can reduce consumption in a city by 60% and improve Ukraineâ€™s ecosystem. Research also shows that reducing â€œdislocationâ€, in terms of population density, by creating open, innovative, eco-friendly environments based on green economy principles, can provide innovative development maps and economic, social, and cultural population growth, decreasing the load on big cities/regional economies, and encourage the restoration of sales markets and production after the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a model to assess the innovativeness of residential areas, apply alternative methods of energy generation, and analyze the impact of the energy production and consumption market in Europe (with recommendations for the Ukraine). This article estimates energy intensity indicators of the gross domestic product in the Ukraine and in Europe, offering methods to decrease energy dependence and increase energy efficiency in the Ukraine, by adopting alternative energy sources (e.g., biohydrogen out of residues, air, and solar energy), and enhancing environmental legislation.","Koval, Viktor, Olczak, Piotr, Vdovenko, Nataliia, Boiko, Olena, Matuszewska, Dominika, Mikhno, Inesa","https://doi.org/10.3390/su131810223","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(18):10223, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(18):10223, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20688,""
"Coronavirus Anxiety Inventory's (CAI) Turkish Adaptation: Testing its Validity and Reliability","Understanding people's psychological reactions to the pandemic is important in controlling the spread of disease and preventing psychological disorders associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focuses on anxiety as a psychological reaction to the coronavirus pandemic. It aims to produce a Turkish adaptation of the Coronavirus Anxiety Inventory (CAI;Wheaton, Ward, Sanders, Keel, & van Meter, 2020) and examine its reliability and validity. The study participants consisted of 428 undergraduate students (335 females and 93 males) aged between 18 and 32 years. The researchers used Mplus and K programs for data analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to test the construct validity of the Turkish adaptation. Moreover, using correlation analysis. the researchers examined the relationship between CAI and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was calculated to test the reliability of the scale. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the single-factor structure of the CAI with nine items had adequate lit indices. that is, it showed good features in terms of measuring coronavirus-related anxiety. Item factor loadings changed between 0.56 and 0.81. and Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was 0.84. A statistically significant difference was found between the scores of the upper and lower 27% groups. Furthermore, statistically significant positive relationships between CAI and DASS were noted. Consequently. this study provides a number of evidences that the Turkish adaptation of CAI with nine items based on a seven-point Likert-type scale was a reliable and valid instrument for measuring coronavirus-related anxiety in undergraduate students. This research uses CAI to determine university students' anxiety levels amid the CONID-19 pandemic. The researchers suggest that particular attention should be given to a balanced distribution in terms of gender and age in future studies.","Asici, E.; Sari, H.

"Personal and occupational experiences of COVID-19 and their effects on South African health workers' wellbeing","We report findings from an online survey conducted between September and November 2020 in the Amajuba District of KwaZulu-Natal, reflecting experiences of the first COVID-19 wave. It investigated risk factors for severe COVID19, experience of COVID-19-related problems, causes of anxiety, and effects on psychological wellbeing. All Department of Health employees in Amajuba were invited to participate. Of 450 who responded, 53% were clinically practising nurses or nursing assistants, 12% operational managers or co-ordinators, 19% non-clinical support staff and 15% in other job categories;83% worked in primary care, 14% in hospitals and 3% in the district office. Personal experiences of COVID-19 were associated with worse mental health, measured with the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ12). The GHQ score was calculated from responses, on a Likert scale, to 12 questions about concentration, lost sleep, feeling useful, ability to make decisions, strain, difficulties, enjoyment, ability to face problems, losing confidence, feeling worthless, unhappiness and happiness. In a linear regression model, higher GHQ12 scores, indicating worse mental health, were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) and independently associated with reporting testing positive for COVID-19, having quarantined as a close contact of someone who tested positive, a relative or friend testing positive, a relative or friend dying due to COVID-19, and being a manager, but not with age or gender. Anxiety about COVID-19 was assessed using 15 statements we developed, informed by our work on health workers' concerns about COVID-19. This study highlights adverse effects of COVID-19 on health workers' wellbeing in a diverse, mostly primary care-based workforce. Worries and personal experiences of COVID-19 were common and associated with worse mental health.","Curran, R.; Bachmann, M.; Rensburg, A. J. van, Murdoch, J.; Awotiwon, A.; Ras, C.

"Containing COVID-19 risk in the UAE: Mass quarantine, mental health, and implications for crisis management","Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is the first global ?NASECH disaster,? owing to its natural hazard (NH) origin and unprecedented subsequent repercussions for global society (S), economy (EC), and health (H). Emergency health control measures required the implementation of compulsory mass quarantine (CMQ) or so-called periods of ?lockdown.? Yet, CMQ is an instrument with iatrogenic consequences, associated with a rise in societal levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. With a view to informing future crisis management, the study investigated sociodemographic factors associated with mental wellbeing during the March?April 2020 lockdown in the United Arab Emirates. Respondents (n?=?1585) completed self-report measures of depression (PHQ8) and generalized anxiety (GAD7). Rates of symptomatology were notably higher than those observed in similar UAE-based studies before the pandemic. Younger age, urban-dwelling, female-gender, and a history of mental health problems were significant factors linked to elevated levels of depression and anxiety. Findings emphasize (1) the crucial need for psychological intervention after disasters and (2) the importance of strengthening the nexus at the intersection of public health and disaster risk reduction (DRR). Implications are that future pandemic containment would benefit from adopting new Health?DRR paradigms and ensuring these are effectively translated into disaster policy.","Thomas, Justin, Terry, James P.","https://doi.org/1002/rhc3.12237","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20692,""

"Coping With the Pandemic: Implementing Social and Emotional Learning in the California K-12 School System","In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Among the massive shutdowns that occurred across the United States in response, all K-12 schools in California closed to protect the health of students. However, such a closure and its resulting consequences were associated with a host of negative mental health implications for youth. Furthermore, many of these youth may not have had adequate resources to tackle issues impacting their psyche in this unprecedented time. Social and emotional learning (SEL), a method in which children can acquire the knowledge and skills to understand and manage emotions, has a proven track record of positive social, emotional, educational, and career consequences. The California Department of Education should convene a task force to develop guidelines for local school districts that provide all K-12 students in the state with effective SEL to assist them in mental health recovery from the pandemic.","Varghese, Agnes M.; Natsuaki, Misaki N.","https://doi.org/10.1177/23727322211033003","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences; 8(2):136-142, 2021.; Publication details: Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences; 8(2):136-142, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20695,""
"Potential Socioeconomic Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Neural Development, Mental Health, and K-12 Educational Achievement","The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic can affect more than a child?s biological health. Lack of in-person schooling and increased stress can affect neurodevelopment, mental health, and later life outcomes, especially for students who are from low socioeconomic status (SES) households. Insights from neuroscience on child development reveal potential neural mechanisms and educational outcomes likely disrupted by the pandemic?and how this will disproportionally affect low-SES children. Three policies can combat these educational and emotional effects: increased access to online resources, investments in social-emotional health, and increased access to summer/out-of-school learning. Integrating the traditionally separate fields of neuroscience and educational research will be critical for developing and assessing the most impactful policies to improve the well-being and educational achievement of our most disadvantaged children.","George, Grace, Dilworth-Bart, Janean, Herringa, Ryan","https://doi.org/10.1177/23727322211032248","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences; 8(2):111-118, 2021.; Publication details: Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences; 8(2):111-118, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20696,""

"Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and the COVID-19 pandemic","Although the physical distance rule applied to slow the pace of the COVID-19 pandemic is an important part of the public health approach, this distance reduces positive social interactions for sexual minorities and can cause mental distress. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex (LGBTI +) people who have to stay at home are increasingly exposed to violence during pandemic. The discrimination experienced by subgroups who may have special needs within the LGBTI + group, such as young people, the elderly, those in need of care or individuals living with HIV, is multiplied throughout the pandemic and the process becomes difficult for these groups. In the epidemic, the prolongation of the psychiatric care process of trans people and the delay in starting hormone therapy disrupt the transition process and negatively affect the mental health of trans people. Considering the risks associated with the pandemic, it is important to take early measures to prevent permanent mental health problems. It is important to provide access to remote support via telemedicine. Despite the possibility of LGBTI+ youth being trapped in traumatic environments, it is critical to monitor and report domestic violence. It is necessary to attach importance to studies on multiple discrimination and to protect the health of LGBTI+ people with special needs.","Cesur, E.; Kaptan, S.; Yuksel, S.","https://doi.org/10.5505/kpd.2021.60024","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Klinik Psikiyatri Dergisi-Turkish Journal of Clinical Psychiatry; 24(3):405-412, 2021.; Publication details: Klinik Psikiyatri Dergisi-Turkish Journal of Clinical Psychiatry; 24(3):405-412, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20699,""

"Ethics and equity in the time of coronavirus","Government responses and lockdowns, even done well, have also caused increased morbidity and mortality by a reduction in patients seeking treatment for non-COVID-19 conditions, and the postponement of therapy such as surgery and preventive screening. This opportunity cost of the lockdown also includes the morbidity and mortality induced by unemployment and mental health issues. Whether these risks of lockdown are outweighed by the projected lives saved from dying of COVID-19 has still to be adequately analysed both here and overseas, but such analyses are essential in understanding the circumstances under which such measures are ethically justified. Equity of information-provision has been problematic. There have been issues of access to digital information and telehealth, especially for people who are poor or homeless.29 Understanding the risks, benefits and ethics of virtual healthcare is evolving concurrently with its widescale implementation.","Hall, K.

"Burnout and risk factors in Southeast Asian gastroenterologists: A multi-national study in the COVID-19 era","Background and Aim: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed significant stress on gastroenterologists worldwide. However, its toll on the mental health of gastroenterologists within Southeast Asia was unknown. A mixed methods, multi-national study was conducted to elucidate the prevalence of burnout and its stressors within the region. Methods: A survey was disseminated electronically to 1761 gastroenterologists via the gastroenterology and endoscopy societies of Brunei, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand from September 1 to December 7, 2020. This included the 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory to detect burnout. Ethical approval was granted. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Logistic regression identified associations between variables and burnout. Qualitative data were analyzed by content analysis method. Results: The response rate was 38.8%;66.6% reported significant stress. The regional prevalence of burnout was 17.1% although inter-country variation existed (Fig. 1A). Depression, being a trainee, public sector work, and the lack of awareness or access to mental health support services increased burnout risk significantly (Fig. 1B). The 50.1% of gastroenterologists were unaware of or did not have access to support services. The onset of depression intra-pandemic was 2.1%;the pre-pandemic prevalence was 2.2%. Stressors commonly involved service requirements (53.2%), difficult relationships with patients and relatives (23.0%), and difficult relationships with colleagues (20.5%). Specific to the pandemic, the three most common stressors were fear of getting infected (39.7%), reduced income (28.0%), and stringent infection control measures adding to workload (18.5%).

"Indian Migrant Workersâ€™ Experience During the COVID-19 Pandemic Nationwide Lockdown","This article explores the lived experiences of some Indian migrant workers (MW) during the first COVID-19 pandemic nationwide lockdown, investigating their plights from a social identity perspective. It analyses crises associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and with hunger and starvation. Drawing on a qualitative study conducted with twelve participants in the city of Pune in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra, the findings suggest that the participants? plights have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings indicate the need for policy responses to focus on addressing conditions of work, terms of employment and access to necessities for Indian MW, including ensuring conditions for a prompt job-ready recovery and mental health care after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kumar, Navin, Udah, Hyacinth, Francis, Abraham, Singh, Sanchita, Wilson, Anica","https://doi.org/10.1177/00219096211046278","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Journal of Asian and African Studies;: 00219096211046278, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Asian and African Studies;: 00219096211046278, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20704,""
"Lived experiences of critically ill patients with covid-11 after discharge from intensive care unit: A phenomenological study","Background: Understanding the experiences of ICU patients with COVID-11 helps to provide the unique care activities, improve the quality of care and promote health status, thereby creating a window for mutual understanding between the treatment team and the patients. Objectives: The present study aimed to explore lived experiences of critically ill patients with COVID-11 after discharge from intensive care units of hospitals in Iran. Methods: The present study was qualitative research with a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Participants were purposefully selected from critically ill patients with COVID-11 who were discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) and transferred to the general ward. Data were mostly collected through in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews and, in some cases, telephone calls. Data were analyzed using the method of Dickelman et al. (1196). Guba and Lincoln's (1191) criteria were used to achieve data authenticity. Results: Data were obtained from 15 COVID-11 recovered patients with a history of ICU admission. Twelve participants were female and four were male with a mean age of 26 years. The four main themes were identified along with their subthemes: Perception of death before dying (worry, helplessness, and expecting a different death), social stigma (social isolation and stigma), a nurse as a symbol of rebirth (a compassionate and supportive nurse and the supportive role of others), and meaningful life (a change in outlook on life and the manifestation of spirituality). Conclusion: The results of the present study indicated that personal thoughts such as thinking about death and social treatments such as stigma can lead to threatening physical and psychological problems in COVID-11 patients. Nurses and family members can prevent many of these problems by providing holistic care and psychological support. Apart from the challenges posed by the disease, post-recovery changes in patients' attitudes toward life can be considered as a positive point.","Nasrabadi, A.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 on the Construction Industry in Vietnam","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a wide range of socio-economic disruption, which causes devastating in numerous aspects. Our knowledge of the true health of the construction industry under the ravage of COVID-19 outbreak is largely based on very limited data. This study aims to assess the impact of pandemic on the construction industry through an investigation in Vietnam. Data were collected through 129 respondents whose online questionnaire survey completed according to their recent direct or indirect participation in delivering construction projects during the spread. The implications of COVID-19 on the construction industry were examined based on simple percentage analysis and Relative Importance Index approaches. Three principal facets of the construction industry were considered: firms' business activities, project performance, and workforce demand. The findings highlighted the multilevel, multidimensional nature of the epidemic consequences on the construction sector. Notably, the revenue and profitability, in a general sense, have decreased during the COVID-19 period, while most of the production and business costs had remained unchanged. Further, the pandemic was argued to impair construction practitioners' incomes and mental health and sabotage projects' schedule and cost. (C) 2021 Penerbit UTM Press.

"Home Thrive ScaleTM: Case Management Tool Towards Preventing Family Separation and Ensuring Children Thrive in Family-based and Alternative Care Options","Case management can be a complex process where multiple factors must be considered for the safety and well-being of a child in any care option. Miracle Foundation?s proprietary Home Thrive ScaleTM is a strengths-based assessment tool that makes it easier to identify strengths, risks and address areas of support within a family home over time. A home?s safety is measured based on five well-being domains?family and social relations, health and mental health, education, living conditions and household economy?with the child and family?s thoughts at the core. Intervention options are then offered to put assessments into action. The tool serves to both prevent family breakdowns and reintegrate children from institutions back into families (or other family-based or alternative care options). Here, we provide an overview of the tool, including its purpose, set-up and functionality within a case management system. The use of the tool is illustrated with the COVID-19 situation in India where masses of children were rapidly placed from institutions back into families without preparation.","Choudhury, Audria","https://doi.org/10.1177/23493003211042439","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Institutionalised Children Explorations and Beyond;: 23493003211042439, 2021.; Publication details: Institutionalised Children Explorations and Beyond;: 23493003211042439, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20707,""
"Youth ministry: Offering hope in a COVID-19 South Africa through community","The president of the Republic of South Africa has addressed the nation many times during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions and lockdown of 2020, and has spoken very strongly about and against the violence toward the vulnerable in our society. Whilst the COVID-19 pandemic has affected many societies, it has mainly revealed the brokenness in our society and the violence against the vulnerable on multiple levels. Arguably, a place where we can discover God is in the midst of our challenges and struggles, a place where God reveals plans and hopes for our lives. It, therefore, is in a place of hopelessness that wholeness can be discovered. This process, whilst painful, can also be transformative and even healing. This pandemic has created a context that has revealed brokenness in lives, systems and economics.

"Stop Asian Hate: The Mental Health Impact of Racial Discrimination Among Asian Pacific Islander Young and Emerging Adults during COVID-19","Research Objective There has been a documented rise of racism and hostility towards Asian Pacific Islanders (API) groups across the nation. With the anticipated population-level increase in mental health issues as a result of COVID-19, API college students are an especially high risk group to consider as API young and emerging adults tend to report similar levels of depression and anxiety symptoms compared with their peers, but underutilize service relative to their level of need. The objective of this presentation is to understand the impact of the pandemic on API mental health using large-scale data, by evaluating pre-pandemic (Fall 2019), initial months of the pandemic (March-May 2020) and recent pandemic (Fall 2020) trends in API mental health and treatment utilization, as well as discussing the public health implications in higher education settings for API student populations. Study Design Data comes from 3 administrations of the Healthy Minds Study: Sept-Dec 2019 (n=33,372 students across 32 campuses), March-May 2020 (n=12,039 students across 7 campuses) and Sept-Dec 2020 (n=15,949 students across 28 campuses). This data represents the largest and most comprehensive nationally recognized assessment of API student mental health symptoms, help-seeking behavior and experiences of discrimination directly related to COVID-19. We used bi-variate analyses to compare mental health symptoms and treatment utilization across API students who identified as international students and those who reported US citizenship or permanent residency in the US. We used cross-sectional logistic regression models to assess the association between discrimination and mental health symptoms and help-seeking behavior. Population Studied Young and emerging adults who identify as Asian or Pacific Islander and are enrolled at a college or university in the United States. Principal Findings Comparing Fall 2019 to Fall 2020, we found that API non-international students reported a 23% increase in severe anxiety, a 10% increase in moderate or severe anxiety, and a 9% increase in severe depression;API international students reported a 16% increase in severe depression and a 12% increase in severe anxiety. In Spring 2020, 22% of API students experienced COVID-related discrimination or hostility (25% in Fall 2020). COVID-related discrimination or hostility was associated with greater odds of meeting the criteria for one or more clinically significant mental health conditions [aOR: 1.83;95% CI: 1.35-2.49;p=0.000]. Treatment utilization among Asian students with at least one clinically significant mental health condition decreased by 26% between Fall 2019 and Spring 2020. Conclusions Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, both API international and non-international students reported increases in mental health symptoms and decreases in treatment utilization. Our analyses also suggest that COVID-related discrimination is correlated with greater odds of clinically significant mental health symptoms as well decreased help-seeking. Implications for Policy or Practice The racialization of COVID-19 has the potential to produce long-lasting effects on attitudes towards API populations. Culturally tailored psychoeducation, collaborative care models and active recruitment of diverse and culturally-competent mental health providers are potential avenues to facilitate help-seeking. Given the mental health challenges that API populations are facing, it will be crucial to make an active effort towards resolving mental health treatment disparities already looming in API communities.","Zhou, Sasha, Banawa, Rachel, Oh, Hans","https://doi.org/1111/1475-6773.13723","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):8-9, 2021.; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):8-9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20709,""
"Early Social Distancing Policies in Europe, Mobility Change and COVID-19 Case Trajectories: Lessons from Spring 2020","Research Objective Nonpharmacological policies aimed at improving physical distancing, such as shelter in place orders or gathering bans are a central strategy used to mitigate disease spread, particularly in the early life-course of a pandemic. We sought to assess the relationship between different types of early social distancing policies implemented across Europe, how they related to changes in population mobility and subsequent COVID-19 case growth. Study Design Data on national social distancing policies were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). For each European country we defined index dates based on the implementation of the country's first social distancing policy. We then compared the value of each mobility metric in the week after the index date versus the 7-day period extending from 9 to 2?days prior to the index date. We included a two-day washout period given the volatility that typically precedes these orders. For mobility, each country was compared to itself over time. We employed a pre-post comparison and two linear mixed-effects models to first assess the relationship between policies and observed changes in mobility, and to assess the relationship between changes in mobility and rates of COVID-19 infections in subsequent weeks. Aggregated and anonymized mobility data was obtained from Google. This data is similar to publicly accessible ?Community Mobility Reports,? with the addition of novel variables, such as relative change in the average number of hours individuals spent away from their primary place of residence. Population Studied Our analytic sample included 6075 country-day observations across 27 European countries. Principal Findings Spain saw the largest mobility decrease from the pre-COVID baseline, as measured by the time spent away from residence, with a decline in aggregate mobility of nearly 70%. Sweden had the smallest decrease with approximately a 20% decline from baseline at the end of the study period (April 12th 2020). Policies associated with the largest decline in mobility were: mandatory stay-at-home orders, followed by mandatory workplace closures, school closures and non-mandatory workplace closures. While mandatory shelter-in-place orders were associated with 16.7% less mobility (95% CI: ?23.7% to ?9.7%), non-mandatory orders were only associated with an 8.4% decrease (95% CI: ?14.9% to ?1.8%). Large-gathering bans saw the least change in mobility compared with other policy types. We, in turn, found a strong link between changes in mobility and changes in COVID-19 case growth. Overall, a 10% decrease in the average time spent away from places of residence was associated with 11.8% (95% CI: 3.8%, 19.1%) fewer new cases two weeks later. A more pronounced 50% decrease resulted in 46.6% fewer cases two weeks later (95% CI: 17.5%, 65.4%). Conclusions Social distancing policies had a significant but heterogeneous impact on mobility. Across countries studied, relative change in time spent away from home was positively associated with slowed covid-19 case growth. Implications for Policy or Practice Our findings begin to offer actionable insight into what types of early policies may have been most effective in decreasing aggregate mobility and, in turn, Covid-19 case growth. With a better understanding of policies' relative performance countries can more effectively invest in, and target, early nonpharmacological interventions.

"The Psychosocial Impact of COVID-19 on Registered Nurses","Research Objective Central the COVID-19 pandemic response are registered nurses (nurses), making life and death decisions amidst personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages and scarcity in other resources (e.g., ventilators, medications, staff). Emerging international evidence suggests nurses are at higher risk for detrimental psychosocial outcomes related to the pandemic, such as anxiety, depression, and sleep problems, compared to other clinician groups. The objective of this research is to describe the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses currently practicing in the U.S. Study Design We conducted a concurrent mixed methods study from May-August 2020. Participants were recruited through email listservs from regional professional nursing organizations, NIOSH-funded Education and Research Centers nationwide, and through social media. Through REDCap, participants completed researcher-developed sociodemographic and work characteristic questions (e.g., unit type, staffing levels, availability of PPE), and several validated instruments to measure depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire;PHQ-9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder;GAD-7), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index;ISI), and resilience (Connor Davidson Resilience Scale;CD-RISC-10). A subset of participants was purposefully selected for semi-structured individual phone interviews to achieve maximum variation. Following data collection, we randomly drew 10 participants to receive a $50 Amazon giftcard. Population Studied We recruited a sample of nurses from 36 states and the District of Columbia. The analytic sample included N=629 for the survey and N=34 for the interviews. We report only survey findings herein. Principal Findings Participants were on average 43?years old (SD 13), 92% female, and 80% White;92% were non-Hispanic. Three-quarters (76%) worked in inpatient hospital settings;20% worked in intensive care or step-down units. Approximately 70% of the sample worked day shifts and 59% worked 12-hour shifts. Out of a list of 13 common PPE items, 91% of the sample reported at least one PPE shortage since the pandemic began, and 24% reported bringing or making their own PPE for use at work. Over one in four (28%) nurses reported being unsure or planned to leave their employer in the next year. About 18% of the sample scored =?15 on the ISI, suggesting insomnia symptoms significant enough to warrant evaluation and treatment. A third of participants (34%) had scores reflecting mild anxiety, a quarter (24%) had scores reflecting moderate anxiety, and 9% scored in the range reflecting severe anxiety on the GAD-7. Reports on the PHQ-9 showed 9% of the sample with scores consistent with major depressive disorder while another 7% scored in the range consistent with other depressive disorder. Finally, the average CD-RISC score was 29, with lower scores indicating lower resilience (range 0-40). Conclusions As with other countries, U.S. nurses are facing highly stressful working conditions, with warning signals indicated in the psychosocial domains of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Overall, resilience levels are worse than pre-pandemic levels from previously published literature. Implications for Policy or Practice As healthcare organizations adapt and respond to the pandemic, priority should be given to assessing and treating the psychosocial harm to nurses. Evidence-based treatments and development of novel interventions to support this vital healthcare sector are warranted.

"â€œWe Have to Meet Those Clients Where They're atâ€ - Michigan Behavioral Health Providers' Responses to Telehealth Policy Changes during COVID-19","Research Objective To understand the impact of state and federal policy changes during the COVID-19 pandemic on use and effectiveness of telebehavioral health based on provider experience, Study Design Between July and August 2020, researchers conducted one-hour interviews with 31 Michigan-based behavioral health providers from 15 counties. These semi-structured interviews included the following topics: (1) Experience with telebehavioral health prior to, and during, the pandemic, (2) Changes in cost of, access to, and quality of care between in-person and telebehavioral health services, and (3) Telebehavioral health's impact on providers and clients. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and later analyzed with Dedoose? software to identify common themes between responses. Population Studied Interviewees included a psychiatrist, psychologists, registered nurses, clinical social workers, mental health counselors, substance use disorder counselors, applied behavior analysts, and peer support specialists. Principal Findings Telebehavioral health provision increased during the pandemic, with all interviewees reporting providing telebehavioral health services - 19 for the first time. All interviewees agreed that newly-enacted state and federal policies made it legally and financially viable to continue safely providing services during the pandemic. Fourteen interviewees reported increased job satisfaction and decreased feelings of burnout. No interviewees reported a breach of health data as a result of using non-public facing audio-visual communications. Overall, interviewees agreed telebehavioral health services were at least as effective as in-person services. Clients with certain conditions (social anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder) seemed to respond better to telebehavioral health services. Clients with other conditions (substance use disorder, developmental disabilities) responded less favorably. Thirty interviewees reported clients were satisfied with telebehavioral health services, with some clients preferring them over in-person services. Twenty-eight reported telebehavioral health reduced or removed barriers that would have otherwise prevented these clients from receiving care, such as the need to arrange for transportation, childcare, or time off from work. This resulted in decreased no-show rates and more regular contact between providers and clients. Access to care for geographically isolated populations increased when audio-only telebehavioral health was authorized;these populations used to have to travel further for care, and often lacked high-speed internet and internet-connected devices necessary for audio-visual telehealth services. Conclusions Despite telebehavioral health's effectiveness and widespread client approval, interviewees expressed that their current work with telehealth was only possible because of recent policy changes. Should those policies revert back, providers may not be able to continue to provide these services. For some clients, such as those who are geographically isolated and unable to engage with anything but audio-only telehealth, reverting these policies would mean notable barriers and/or losing access to care entirely. Implications for Policy or Practice In Michigan, policy implications for both private and public insurances include continuing audio-only telehealth authorization and improving coverage of telebehavioral health by instituting service and reimbursement parity policies. Such policies could be enacted through Medicaid plan amendments or amendments to Michigan's Insurance Code. For federal policymakers, implications include amending HIPAA to improve acceptability of non-public facing audio-visual communications and extending certain provisions of the CARES Act, such as allowing audio-only telehealth as a modality of last resort, through new laws and regulations.

"The Impact of Covid-19 on Certified Nursing Assistants in New York City: A Cross-Sectional Study","Research Objective In December 2020, the New York Times reported that nursing home (NH) residents and workers accounted for 38% of COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S. Despite this toll, research documenting the impact of the pandemic from a worker perspective is limited. Focusing on the experience of certified nursing assistants (CNAs), the primary providers of direct care to NH residents, this study examined the physical, emotional, and financial impact of COVID-19 and identified resource needs in the pandemic context. Study Design A phone survey was conducted between September and December 2020 with CNAs who are members of 1199SEIU, the largest healthcare union in the U.S. To be eligible, CNAs had to be union members and care for patients at NHs in New York City, Long Island, or the Lower Hudson Valley during the pandemic. The survey included 42 questions and focused on COVID-19 exposure, mental and physical health, family economic security, and workplace resources and training. Population Studied This study focused on 216 CNAs working for unionized NH employers in downstate New York. Principal Findings A total of 216 CNAs from 98 unique NHs participated in the study. 78% of participants were between 40?69?years old, 93% were women, 87% were Black, and 61% had more than 10?years of experience in NHs. In addition to their role as paid care providers, 81% reported providing care or financial support to family members. With regard to COVID-19 Exposure, 93% reported being tested since the beginning of the pandemic, with 33% testing positive. Significant majorities were ?very concerned? about exposing themselves (75%), family members (86%), and patients (80%) to COVID-19 given the nature of their work. With respect to Mental Health, 76% reported feeling emotionally drained and 60% reported feeling fatigued on a regular basis. 52% said support dealing with stress and anxiety would be ?very useful.? Concerning Family Economic Security, 29% said the pandemic made it harder to pay for basic needs (e.g., food, rent, etc.) and 48% said it was harder to care for family members. Majorities said help accessing affordable housing (61%), paying for food (58%), and paying for work-related transport (52%) would be ?very useful.? With regard to Workplace Resources, 81% said they currently had enough PPE, and 33% reported having to provide their own PPE at some point during the pandemic. 92% experienced patient deaths in their unit or NHs during the pandemic, while 40% said services were made available to provide support in the grieving process. With respect to Training, most were ?very interested? in training on stress management? (58%) and treating patients with COVID-19 (55%). Conclusions Our survey results show significant challenges and resource needs among unionized CNAs in downstate New York. Implications for Policy or Practice Unionized CNAs have significant resource needs in the pandemic context, and other data suggests that the needs of non-unionized CNAs may be even greater. To better support this workforce, action by public health officials and policymakers is warranted, particularly with respect to workplace safety and protection, mental health, compensation, and access to basic resources.","Pinto, Sanjay, Sterling, Madeline, Wiggins, Faith, Hall, Rebecca, Ma, Chenjuan","https://doi.org/1111/1475-6773.13806","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):41-42, 2021.; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):41-42, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20713,""
"Changes in Pediatric Hospital Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Qualitative Study","Research ObjectiveThe COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated rapid changes in healthcare delivery in the United States, including changes in the care of hospitalized children. This study aims to identify major changes in inpatient pediatric healthcare delivery and potential lessons learned.Study DesignIn this study, we conducted semi-structured video interviews. We analyzed interview data using constant comparative methods to identify major healthcare delivery changes for hospitalized children during the COVID-19 pandemic.Population StudiedWe purposefully sampled clinicians from both community and children's hospitals serving pediatric patients in the 6 U.S. states with the highest COVID-19 hospitalization rates at the onset of the pandemic (NY, NJ, DC, MA, CT, LA). We recruited 2 participants from each hospital to interview (mix of administrators, physicians, and nurses).Principal FindingsWe interviewed 24 participants from 12 hospitals and identified several themes [Table 1]. They described how hospital leaders rapidly developed policies to: 1) ensure adequate staff for surges of COVID-19 patients, 2) provide adequate care spaces and supplies, 3) direct use of personal protective equipment, and 4) guide medical management of COVID-19 patients. Hospital leaders optimized communication by conducting regular meetings to discuss the current state of the pandemic, hospital operations, and policy changes. In the setting of declining volumes of hospitalized children, clinicians newly provided care for hospitalized adults. This was facilitated by developing care teams supported by adult hospitalists, educational resources, and telehealth supports. Participants described negative impacts of the pandemic on clinicians' mental health, as well as helpful supports for clinician well-being, including mental health resources, wellness activities and spaces, and housing.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Long-Term Care Workforce","Research ObjectiveThe objective of this research was (1) to gather information about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the nursing home workforce to better understand the challenges faced by nursing homes during the early phase of the outbreak, and (2) to identify new federal and state policies and practices that have been implemented to address these challenges in nursing homes. We sought to understand the challenges nursing homes faced during the early phase of the pandemic with regard to personal protective equipment (PPE), supplies for staff and infection-control policies and procedures, as well as the ability to maintain sufficient staffing levels and manage staff turnover.Study DesignWe conducted telephone interviews with nine key stakeholders knowledgeable about nursing home responses to the pandemic. We also conducted a systematic policy review to document federal, state, and local laws and policies designed to support nursing homes during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on workforce challenges.Population StudiedInterview respondents included researchers and national association leaders representing the nursing home industry, direct care staff, and involved in long-term care policy and practice.Principal FindingsStaffing shortages and attrition due to the pandemic intensified nursing home workforce problems during the pandemic. In response to low pay, poor working conditions, and the high risk of COVID-19 infection, some nurses and certified nursing assistants left their jobs despite increased demand for their skills and expertise. The nursing home workforce also confronted new challenges during the pandemic that stemmed from a lack of critical resources, such as childcare coverage and mental health support, which escalated critical shortages of staff. The lack of a unified national testing strategy, distribution of test kits, and policies to cover cost, reportedly delayed timely testing of residents and nursing home staff early on, and hindered understanding about the risk of COVID-19 transmission.ConclusionsTo fill vacancies and provide surge support, nursing homes developed strategies to recruit new staff, while states and the federal government modified licensing and credentialing requirements and deployed nontraditional staff. Governments and nursing homes also increased wages and augmented non-wage benefits such as childcare, housing, transportation assistance, and food supports. Federal and state governments also increased access to PPE, expanded use of telehealth, created non-punitive leave policies, and monitored staff for illness.Implications for Policy or PracticeThe findings from this study point to several opportunities for further research, including examining how nursing homes have taken advantage of state and federal initiatives implemented in response to COVID-19;assessing which resources have directly impacted the capacity of the nursing home workforce;and understanding any long-lasting effects on the workforce that will remain as a result of the pandemic. It may also be informative to explore the long-term effects of the outbreak on the nursing home workforce, as the prolonged physical and emotional toll of these direct-care jobs leave the workforce prone to burnout and fatigue.Primary Funding SourceDHHS Assistant Secretary for Research and Evaluation.","Noelle, Denny-Brown","https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.13733","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):15-16, 2021.; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):15-16, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20715,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Prescriptions for Controlled Substances for Veterans with Opioid Use Disorder","Research ObjectiveVeterans with opioid use disorder (OUD) are at significant risk of overdose, unintentional death, and a wide range of negative health-related consequences. While evidenced-based treatments for OUD exist, including medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine (suboxone), there are a number of barriers preventing veterans from accessing this care. A potential avenue to increase the numbers of veterans who can access high quality mental healthcare such as MOUD is through telemental healthcare using VA Video Connect (VVC). While telehealth can mitigate this access to care issue, the opioid crisis led to the Ryan Haight Act of 2008, which mandates that the first visit with a prescriber of schedule II-IV controlled substances be conducted in person. However, due to the public health emergency caused by COVID-19, the in person requirement for controlled substances is temporarily waived.Study DesignThe aims of this project were to examine temporal changes in controlled substances from September 2019 â€“ August 2020 (6 months before and after the requirement was waived), to understand the impacts of this waiver for veterans with OUD.Population StudiedWe examined prescription information from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse for 42,579 Veterans diagnosed with OUD (91.6% male, 71% white, 16.8% black, 27% rural dwelling).Principal FindingsDuring this 12-month window, 56.6% of the sample were prescribed suboxone, 53.6% were prescribed sedatives, and 13.8% were prescribed anxiolytics. Monthly an average of 33,323 (SDÂ =Â 3190) prescriptions were filled, with an average of 1.45 (SDÂ =Â 0.08) medications prescribed per visit. As expected, the largest dip was seen in April 2020, with only 28,376 prescriptions filled, with an 1.33 prescriptions written per visit. As of August 2020, the rates for prescriptions for controlled substances had not returned to pre-COVID levels.ConclusionsThese data suggest that while telehealth is a legal option to appropriately prescribe controlled substances, it was not utilized in a way that replicated in person care. Future projects that focus on understanding and addressing barriers providers face when attempting to provide care via telehealth are an important next step. Additionally, there was no dramatic increase in prescriptions for controlled substances as a result of the Ryan Haight waiver.Implications for Policy or PracticeThese data support keeping the wavier of in person appointments in the Ryan Haight Act is one useful avenue to help providers to provide access to life saving MOUDs.Primary Funding SourceDepartment of Veterans Affairs.","Myers, Ursula, Bishu, Kinfe, Holly, Gauthier-Wetzel, Grubaugh, Anouk, Axon, R.

"Veteran Experiences with Telehealth","Research ObjectiveIn FY18-19, VA Office of Rural Health initiated a pilot program to increase access to services in underserved areas by funding 13 telehealth hubs. Understanding Veterans' experiences with telehealth hubs is essential to its delivery, especially in its scale-up nationally and in response to the pandemic in FY20. We examine characteristics and ratings of care among Veterans with telehealth hub visits compared to usual primary care (PC) during the pilot program.Our objectives are to:Understand Veteran experiences with access, care coordination, comprehensiveness and primary care provider (PCP) communication during a telehealth pilot program.Examine Veteran characteristics associated with telehealth hub visits during a pilot program.Study DesignRegression analysis of a cross-sectional data: VA Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients â€“ Patient-Centered Medical Home (SHEP-PCMH), which uses Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) questionnaires to survey Veterans on their healthcare experiences. We derived dichotomous outcomes from SHEP-PCMH composite indices, indicating optimal experiences with access, care coordination, PCP communication, comprehensiveness (based on the percentages of responses that fall in the top category (Always or Yes) and PCP rating (9 or 10 out of 10). Key predictors were telehealth hub v. usual care index visit and proportion of telehealth hub visits in 6 months prior to the index visit. Other covariates included age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, number of PC visits in past year, self-rated overall and mental health, and year of visit. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to predict optimal care experiences, controlling for demographics, healthcare use, health status and year.Population StudiedVeterans receiving care at VA PC clinics offering telehealth hub visits during FY2018-2019.Principal FindingsIn FY2018-2019, 3201 out of 57,793 Veterans had a telehealth hub index visit. Telehealth hub utilization 6 months prior to index visit: 0.25% usual care v. 83% telehealth. Compared to usual care, the telehealth hub group was significantly older (age = 65: 60% telehealth, 50.5% usual care), had fewer PC visits (0â€“1 visits: 69% telehealth, 56% usual care). In multivariate models, we failed to detect statistically significant difference between telehealth hub and usual care groups for the composite measures of Veteran experiences. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) (95% CI): 0.68 (0.12â€“3.81), 0.3 (0.07â€“1.35), 1.55 (0.48â€“4.95), 0.47 (0.18â€“1.22), and 0.66 (0.18â€“2.49) for access, coordination, PCP communication, comprehensiveness, and PCP rating, respectively. Older age and greater number of PC visits were associated with greater likelihood of optimal care ratings;fair/poor overall and mental health were associated with lower likelihood of optimal experiences.ConclusionsCompared to usual care, telehealth hub users did not differ in likelihood ratings of optimal care experience although they are distinct in their demographics and healthcare utilization. Further study is needed, since the population of telehealth hub users is quite different from usual care population during pilot program.Implications for Policy or PracticeTelehealth hub visits were not associated with decrements in care experience. Our findings suggest that Veterans' experiences with tele-health during the COVID-19 pandemic might be similar to usual care. This is of importance since the Covid-19 pandemic necessitates expanded use of virtual care to ensure patient safety.Primary Funding SourceDepartment of Veterans Affairs.","Huynh, Alexis, Rose, Danielle, Guo, Rong, Stockdale, Susan","https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.13728","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):13, 2021.; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):13, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20717,""
"Racial/Ethnic and Language Disparities in Telepsychiatry during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from an Urban Safety-Net Hospital System","Research Objective To estimate racial/ethnic and linguistic disparities in access to and utilization of outpatient mental health care before and after the rapid implementation of telepsychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design We used electronic health record data from an urban safety-net healthcare system on appointments, patient's diagnoses, demographics, location of care, and provider type. Data included outpatient mental health service use for the periods before (pre-periodÂ =Â March?June 2019) and after (post-periodÂ =Â March?June 2020) the introduction of telepsychiatry. Outcomes consisted of outpatient mental health service use and no-show visits, which were operationalized as both dichotomous and count variables. We estimated multivariable linear probability regression models (dichotomous outcome) and negative binomial regression models (count outcome). The primary term of interest was an interaction between race/ethnicity (White [referent], Black, Latino, and Asian) and time indicator (1Â =Â post-period, March?June 2019;and 0Â =Â pre-period, March?June 2020) that yielded the difference in service use between White patients and racial/ethnic minority patients. In secondary analysis, the term of interest was an interaction between language of service preference (English [referent], Spanish, Portuguese, and Haitian Creole) and time indicator. We used predictive margins methods to estimate predicted probabilities, predicted means, interpret interactions in nonlinear models, and estimate within group differences. All regression models adjusted for a rich set of covariates. Population Studied Analytic sample consisted of adults between the ages of 18?64 that received mental health services from the safety-net healthcare system under study between March 2019 and June 2020 (nÂ =Â 254,995). We further classified our population by race/ethnicity (White, Black, Latino, and Asian) and language of service preference (English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Haitian Creole). Principal Findings In adjusted results, between pre- and post-periods, all racial/ethnic and linguistic groups had significant within-group increases in access to and use of outpatient mental health care (all p?&lt;?0.05). Relative to White patients, Asian patients had a significant decrease in having any outpatient mental health visit (?1.1%, p?&lt;?0.05) and Latinos had a significant increase in the number of outpatient mental health visits per 1000 patients (+469.7, p?&lt;?0.05). Relative to English-speaking patients, Portuguese speaking patients had a significant increase in any outpatient mental health visits (+0.5%, p?&lt;?0.05). Within-group no-show rates increased significantly for White and Asian patients, but mean number of no-show visits per 1000 patients decreased significantly for all racial/ethnic groups (all p?&lt;?0.05). Conclusions Telepsychiatry provides patients a means to initiate or continue their treatment regimen while socially distancing and quarantining. This mode of mental health care also removes many of the traditional barriers to care (e.g. child care and transportation) experienced by racial/ethnic minority groups. However, disparities still remain and may have been exacerbated by the introduction of new technological barriers to care. Implications for Policy or Practice Clinicians and hospital administrators should consider the impact of digital literacy and the digital divide in the continued use of telepsychiatry. The transition to telepsychiatry highlights the need for a robust medical interpreter pool to meet the increasing patient demand.","Flores, Michael, Mullin, Brian, Creedon, Timothy, Carson, Nicholas, Cook, Benjamin","https://doi.org/1111/1475-6773.13786","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):63-64, 2021.; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):63-64, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20718,""
"Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Early Implementation of a Nationwide Telehealth Program: A Qualitative Study","Research Objective External environment is an important factor in the success of large-scale healthcare initiatives. However, there is limited understanding of how external shocks may shape early implementation. In October 2019, the VHA Office of Primary Care launched national Clinical Resource Hubs (CRHs) to provide staffing gap coverage for primary care and mental health services. Through a ?hub? and ?spoke? model, providers at 18 regional hubs deliver virtual and in-person care to patients at spoke clinics. Using CRH implementation as a case study, we consider the impact of Covid-19 on early implementation efforts. Study Design We conducted semi-structured interviews about early implementation experiences with eight program office leads and six regional hub directors from June?September 2020. Data were analyzed using a rapid analysis approach, which entailed interview summaries cross-validated by two project team members. Summaries were synthesized with consensus checks to identify major themes regarding CRH implementation from key interview domains. Data were aggregated across roles. Population Studied National program office leaders and regional hub directors involved in implementation. Principal Findings The Covid-19 pandemic was perceived as both facilitating and hindering implementation. For example, it accelerated achievement of some goals including telehealth emergency management support which was ?fast tracked? in response to the pandemic during the first year of implementation although not required until year two. Hub providers also expanded support for regional nurse advice telephone call centers (a year 3 implementation goal) during March and April. In addition, Covid-19 was recognized as a ?game changer? in terms of increasing the acceptability of telehealth as an effective mode of care among VA national offices and spoke sites during a time of restricted in-person appointments. The pandemic also posed significant implementation barriers. Hub directors reported difficulty establishing relationships at new spoke sites due to sites' focus on patient care during Covid-19 surges. Additionally, they faced collaboration challenges, such as the inability of the national program office leaders to travel in person to assist with spoke site set-up due to travel restrictions. In response to these challenges, leaders made several program modifications. Marketing efforts were broadened through increased outreach to potential spoke sites, in-person visits to establish new spoke sites were suspended in favor of virtual training, and patient care delivery was modified to include in-home telehealth visits. Respondents expected that these modifications may become permanent after Covid-19 has ended, thereby altering CRH processes. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the complex effects of Covid-19 on early program implementation, acting as both a facilitator and barrier in service provision, marketing, and training. Because some VA healthcare systems had telehealth pilot programs already in place, they may have been more ?ready? to expand virtual visits when Covid-19 struck. Implications for Policy or Practice The program modifications we identified in response to Covid-19 carry actionable lessons for healthcare organizations similarly impacted by external environmental factors. Telehealth capacity and specifically the capacity to switch from in-person to virtual modes of patient care and provider training may facilitate emergency response.

"Telemedicine Among Medicaid Beneficiaries in Community Mental Health Care during the First Three Months of the 2020 Covid-19 State of Emergency","Research Objective Little is known about the effectiveness of telemedicine for patients with serious mental illness (SMI). We sought to identify and describe characteristics of community mental health center (CMHC) SMI patients associated with treatment retention and use of telemedicine during this time. Study Design This research is an observational study of retention in services and use of telemedicine during 12/2019?6/2020 (compared to 12/2018?6/2019) in New Hampshire (NH) CMHC patients. Starting in 3/2020, patients were offered in person and/or telemedicine services based on clinical recommendation and personal choice. NH Medicaid claims provided CMHC service, diagnoses, and demographics. Quarterly use of telemedicine was categorized into &lt;25%, 25?75%, or?&gt;?75% of total services. Associations between retention and demographic variables were explored using chi-square test of independence, logistical regression and correspondence multivariate analysis. Population Studied All 16,030 NH Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI, including debilitating schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, PTSD, and anxiety/other diagnoses, who were engaged in CMHC treatment during the three months prior to the COVID-19 State of Emergency (SOE) was declared in NH. Principal Findings 81.7% of patients were retained in treatment in the quarter following the SOE declaration compared to 86.6% of patients in the 2018?2019 period. Comparing 2020 to 2019, youth demonstrated low retention rates (77% compared to 84%, respectively). In 2020, retention among patients with rural zip codes was lower than among those with urban zip codes (78.8% vs 81.2%), and among patients with PTSD (78.1%) and anxiety/ other diagnoses (76.5%) compared to schizophrenia (93.2%) and bipolar disorder (89%). All three multivariate analyses indicate that age, gender, and condition significantly predicted retention. In adjusted models, male gender, age group 18?34, and PTSD diagnosis predicted low retention. In contrast, female gender, age groups 35?54 and 55+, and schizophrenia and bipolar diagnoses predicted high retention. Similar analyses predicting level of telehealth services utilization showed: patients with &lt;25% telehealth services were more likely in the 55+ year age group and schizophrenia diagnosis group;patients with 25% to 75% telehealth services were more likely to be youth and to have PTSD;those with 75% telehealth services were more likely to be in the 18?55 age group, and to have bipolar disorder or major depression. Conclusions Telemedicine was utilized by the majority of CMHC patients in the months following the pandemic, likely supporting continuity of CMHC care for vulnerable patients with SMI. Yet, even with this substantial rollout of telemedicine, retention in treatment was less than retention in the prior year, and some sub-populations were more at risk for treatment interruptions than others. Implications for Policy or Practice Telemedicine promoted continuity of care during the pandemic but it is not clear how much telemedicine should continue after the pandemic, and for which subpopulations of people with SMI. Further research on the effectiveness and limitations of telemedicine in patients with SMI is needed to inform future policies and clinical practice.","Ainslie, Marcy, Brunette, Mary, Capozzolli, Michelle","https://doi.org/1111/1475-6773.13758","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):29-29, 2021.; Publication details: Health Services Research; 56(S2):29-29, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20720,""
"Myocarditis in pink","A 36-year-old woman, with polyallergic asthma, without known cardiovascular risk factors, accessed the emergency department for worsening dyspnoea, now present for minimal efforts, thoracic pain and cough, precipitated after non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs ingestion. Blood tests at the admission showed eosinophilic leukocytosis, elevation of troponins and inflammatory biomarkers;the electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, right bundle branch block and diffuse ST-tract depression. At first, the patient was considered as a suspected Covid positive case, despite the negative nasopharyngeal swab, because of the interstitial pneumonia showed at the chest tomography. She was transferred in the cardiological intensive setting only after having excluded viral aetiology. The cardiac ultrasound performed at the admission showed moderate-to-severe left ventricular global hypokinesia with akinesia of the interventricular septum, of the inferior and anterior medio-basal walls and lateral hypokinesia. Given the non-coronary distribution of the wall motion deficits and the plateau elevation of myocardial injury enzymes, a coronary angiogram was not performed. Being the clinical picture suggestive of acute myocardits with relevant systolic dysfunction, an emergency endomyocardial biopsy was performed, showing multifocal eosinophilic myocarditis associated with myocardial damage. Histological characteristics were compatible with hypersensitivity or immune-mediated myocarditis: microbiological and parasitological tests and the autoantibody panel resulted, however, negative. Cardiac magnetic resonance confirmed the wall motion deficits showed in the cardiac ultrasound exam, while the T1 and T2 weighted sequences showed myocardial thinning, diffuse intramyocardial oedema and a subendocardial perfusion deficit compatible with microvascular damage of the interventricular septum and of the anterior medio-basal wall. Given the clinical picture, steroidal therapy was begun, firstly intravenously, then by mouth, with improvement of the global clinical conditions. The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of multifocal eosinophilic myocarditis and eosinophilic pneumonia. After six months, the chest tomography showed resolution of the pulmonary involvement, while the cardiac magnetic resonance showed necrosis and thinning of the anterior wall and of the basal septum, with partial recovering of the global systolic function.","Scuppa, M.; Santona, L.; Caponetti, A.; Biagini, E.; GaliÃ¨, N.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/suab064","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: European Heart Journal, Supplement; 23(SUPPL C):C104, 2021.; Publication details: European Heart Journal, Supplement; 23(SUPPL C):C104, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20721,""
"A rare case of biventricular thrombosis","In March 2020, a 53-year-old woman with cardiovascular risk factors (obesity and arterial hypertension) came to the emergency room for worsening exertional dyspnoea and swollen legs for a month. She experienced an episode of right popliteal DVT during chemotherapy for a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and cardiomyopathy after the chemotherapy (LVEF 45%). The EKG showed a 2:1 atrial flutter with a HR of 120 bpm. The echocardiogram showed: a dilated RV with reduced systolic function (TAPSE 12 mm), a floating thrombus in the right atrium and 2 fixed thrombi in the RV (on the moderator band and the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve), a dilated LV with widespread hypokinesia and EF 20%, a voluminous pedunculated apical thrombus. A CT pulmonary angiogram showed: bilateral thrombosis of segmental and subsegmental branches, an RV/LV ratio &gt;1, a voluminous thrombus in the apex of the LV and 2 thrombi in the RV, total thrombotic occlusion of the right superior vena cava. A venous doppler ultrasound showed thrombosis of the right popliteal vein. She was admitted to CCU and treated with furosemide, antialdosteronic agent, ACE-inhibitor, beta-blocker, digitalis, unfractionated heparin (subsequently replaced with warfarin after 2 days of INR &gt;2). Then, he underwent: a cardiac MRI confirming the LV and RV thrombi and the depressed biventricular EF, a total body CT excluding a lymphoma's recurrence and a coronary CT angiography which did not detect coronary stenosis. Two nasal swabs were negative for SARS-Cov-2 infection. After 24 hours, the sinus rhythm spontaneously restored. After 15 days of anticoagulant therapy, the endocavitary thrombi dissolved. She was discharged after 30 days of hospitalization in stable conditions, but with the persistence of biventricular dysfunction on the echocardiogram. On the 3-month FU, the patient was in stable conditions (NYHA II);the echocardiogram showed normalization of the RV function and improvement of the LV one (EF 45%). Conclusion: This is a rare case of biventricular thrombosis with no guidelines for its treatment in the literature. The common practice consists in heparin anticoagulant therapy followed by a vitamin-K antagonist. This therapeutic regimen allowed, in this specific case, the rapid dissolution of the endoventricular thrombi.","Bongarzoni, A.; Tassinario, G.; Garagiola, M.; Capozi, A.; Mafrici, A.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/suab063","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: European Heart Journal, Supplement; 23(SUPPL C):C29-C30, 2021.; Publication details: European Heart Journal, Supplement; 23(SUPPL C):C29-C30, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20722,""

This article leverages a Feminist and Science and Technology Studies (STS) approach to elucidate how the framing of the opioid crisis shapes the interconnections that are discernable, providing a heuristic to understand the increased rates of deaths due to drug overdose during the pandemic. The narratives of people seeking treatment are analyzed through the theoretical lenses of Nelly Oudshoorn?s concept of the technogeography of care, Nancy Campbell?s concept of technologies of suspicion, and Nancy Fraser?s analysis of the US juridical-administrative-therapeutic in/justice system. This paper traces and problematizes how telecare contributes to redefining the experience of familiar places, such as home, into spaces of both care and surveillance, and how the technology of telecare presents both affordances and foreclosures to accessing care as people struggle to conform with its requirements in order to receive care. Key findings are, (1) the significance of hugs and tactile connection that is sorely missed by people using telecare for group therapy, (2) the critical importance of proximity to in-person services even while using telecare, (3) the resistance strategies of telecare users to surveillance mechanisms, and (4) the continued stigmatization of drug use and treatment acts as a key barrier to people who are striving to produce the identity of a patient who is clinically stable for take-home medication.","Caulfield, Christopher P.","https://doi.org/10.1177/00914509211046705","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Contemporary Drug Problems;: 00914509211046705, 2021.; Publication details: Contemporary Drug Problems;: 00914509211046705, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20724,""
"Child Abuse and Neglect and the Burden of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Families: A Series of Cases Consulted at the German Medical Child Protection Hotline","Key Practitioner Messages Increased stress and decreased resources during a lockdown and social distancing can augment the risk for child abuse and neglect during the COVID-19 pandemic.

LITERATURE 1.1. RESEARCH SUBJECTDue to the high rate of transmission and infection, the World Health Organization announced on March 11, 2020, that it defined the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020). COVID-19, which affects the whole world, has positive effects on some sectors. Many companies in the retailing industry encountered a significant increase in their online customer portfolio. The intensive involvement of customers in the pandemic period on online platforms has also carried product reviews or word-of-mouth communication to online platforms. During the pandemic period, the product reviews written by the consumers are expected to be affected by their mood because it has been discussed that people with negative emotions make product evaluations in order to reduce their anxiety (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004;Sundaram et al., 1998). Bujisic et al. (2019) stated that the weather changes the mood of the person, and as a result, it affects the valence of online reviews. Many studies have demonstrated that the pandemic period affects the psychological and physical states of people, especially mood, weakness, and depression (Alonzi et al., 2020;El-Zoghby et al., 2020;Somma et al., 2020). Although the effects of the pandemic period on consumer behaviour have attracted the attention of researchers (Grashuis et al., 2020;Zwanka & Buff, 2020), the effects of the pandemic period on product reviews have not been explained in the literature yet.1.2. RESEARCH PURPOSE AND IMPORTANCE During COVID-19 pandemic, the fact that people are facing death threats (Song et al., 2020) and feeling like they are caged (Fullana et al., 2020) caused a great panic in the world and so in Turkey. Economic and health concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic also resulted in negative moods in people (Duan et al., 2020;El-Zoghby et al., 2020;Van Rheenen et al., 2020). It was discussed that COVID-19 pandemic changes the decision-making processes and purchasing behaviours of the consumers (Grashuis et al., 2020;Hall et al., 2020;Zwanka & Buff, 2020). It is expected that the increased negative mood due to the pandemic would also affect the product reviews written by consumers. This research aims to examine the effect of the pandemic on product evaluations on internet platforms.1.3. CONTRIBUTION of the ARTICLE to the LITERATURE The present research explores, for the first time, the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on product reviews. Thus, the effect of the pandemic was introduced to electronic word-of-mouth communication literature. 2. DESIGN AND METHOD 2.1. RESEARCH TYPE Causal research is designed to draw inferences about the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on product reviews and to model the cause-and-effect relationship. Additionally, descriptive research is employed to understand the structure of the data set.2.2. RESEARCH PROBLEMS The research on COVID-19 pandemic is at its infant stage. Significantly, the number of studies in social sciences related to COVID-19 pandemic is very few. Little is known about consumer behaviour during COVID-19 pandemic, and it is not clear how COVID-19 pandemic affects product reviews. 2.3. DATA COLLECTION METHOD The secondary data source is used for the research analysis. 5812 online reviews were extracted for 5 different types of products (toy, skirt, framed painting, coffee-making machine, T-shirt) from Trendyol web site (a famous Turkish e-commerce web site).2.4. QUANTITATIVE / QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS Quantitative analysis was adopted. First, descriptive statistics were used to draw inferences about the data. Second, logit and probit regression analysis was employed to test the hypothesis.2.5. RESEARCH HYPOTHESES H1: Product reviews written in the period from the pandemic announcement to the normalization are more damaging than the product reviews written in the pre-pandemic period.H2: Product reviews written during the normalization period are more harmful than the product reviews written in the pre-pandemic period.H3: The product type affects the length of the product review.H4: The product reviews written in the period from the pandemic announcement to the normalization are longer than the product reviews written in the pre-pandemic period.H5: Product reviews written in the normalization period are longer than the product reviews written in the pre-pandemic period. 3. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. FINDINGS as a RESULT of ANALYSIS The descriptive statistics showed that the oldest product review among 5812 reviews in the data set was published on January 28, 2019, and the most recent on August 10 2020. Approximately 84% of the reviews in the data set received a rating of 4 stars and above. In other words, the data set contains very positive product reviews. More than 60% of the product reviews were written after the pandemic announcement. The average length of the product reviews in the pre-pandemic period is shorter than those posted after the pandemic announcement. The results of logistic regression analysis demonstrated that there is no significant difference in the number of stars received by product reviews between the period from the pandemic announcement to the normalization and pre-pandemic period. However, the probability of negative product reviews to be posted in the normalization period is higher than the product reviews before the pandemic period. The results of probit regression showed that product type affects the length of the product review posted. Additionally, the product reviews that were the least likely to belong were those which were written before the pandemic (probability = 0.308). The probability of long online reviews written in the period from the pandemic announcement to the normalization period was 0.342. Among all the periods of the pandemic, the probability of extended product evaluations written in the normalization period was highest (probability = 0.432).3.2. HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS The first hypothesis of the research is rejected because there is no significant difference between the number of stars received for product reviews written in the period from the pandemic announcement to the normalization period and those written in the pre-pandemic period. The second hypothesis is accepted since product reviews written after normalization period are more damaging than those before the pandemic announcement. The third hypothesis is accepted as the product type influences the length of the online review. The fourth and fifth hypotheses are accepted because it was found that the product reviews posted in the pre-pandemic period are shorter than the ones posted after the pandemic announcement. 3.3. DISCUSSING the FINDINGS with the LITERATURE Descriptive statistics showed that the number of positive product reviews (with a rating of 4 or more) is higher than the negative ones. This finding is in line with studies (Cabosky, 2016;Chen & Lurie, 2013) stating that individuals' tendency to write positive online reviews is higher than negative ones. The findings of the current research showed that the product reviews written after the normalization period were more negative than those in the pre-pandemic period. This result is consistent with studies in the literature (Sundaram et al., 1998;Bujisic et al., 2019) indicating that negative mood affects product reviews. According to another result of the current research, the length of product reviews was affected by the product type. This result coincides with the findings of other studies in the literature (Moore, 2015;Pan & Zhang, 2011) showing that the product type affects the length of the online review. The findings also demonstrated that the gloomy mood of people after the pandemic announcement increases the possibility of writing long online reviews. This result supports the results of studies (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004;Sundaram et al., 1998) indicating that in order to reduce their anxiety, consumers tend to write product reviews.4. CONCLUSION, RECOMMENDATION AND LIMITATIONS 4.1. RESULTS of the ARTICLEThe results showed that the pandemic period affects the valence of product reviews. Product type influen es the length of product reviews. Furthermore, in the pandemic period, consumers tend to write longer product reviews.4.2. SUGGESTIONS BASED on RESULTS This research offers implications to practitioners about the strategies that companies will follow in times of disasters such as a pandemic to guide their consumers for posting more effective and positive product reviews. In disaster situations such as pandemic,earthquake and flood that may cause negative mood in consumers, e-commerce firms can send samples with their ordered products and make their customers surprised and make them feel good. Additionally, firms can also send disinfectants or medical masks with the ordered products that may be needed especially in case of a pandemic as a feel-good gift. Nevertheless, in response to negative product evaluations to be encountered, companies may write responses showing that they evaluate the customer's complaint, understand them, and deal with them. 4.3. LIMITATIONS of the ARTICLE The data set was derived from a single e-commerce platform. Due to the effects of platform differences on product evaluations, a data set can be created by including different e-commerce platforms in future studies, and the effects of platform differences on product evaluations can be examined. Also, the present study examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on product reviews by using secondary data and could not control other factors affecting the mood of consumers. Thus, in future studies, experimental design can be used only to observe the effect of the pandemic on product reviews by controlling other factors that affect the mood of consumers.","Raife Meltem, Yetk&Iacute;N Ã–Zb&Uuml;K","https://doi.org/10.15295/bmij.v8i3.1595","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Business & Management Studies: An International Journal; 8(3):3471-3494, 2020.; Publication details: Business & Management Studies: An International Journal; 8(3):3471-3494, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20726,""

However, unexpected events and crises experienced in the career planning process significantly affect this process. The (Covid-19) pandemic has created an acute crisis in university students' career planning. The purpose of this study is to determine how the psychological resilience and hopelessness levels of university students affect their career future perceptions during the global pandemic. For this aim, data were collected through an online questionnaire from a convenient sample of 410 university students. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to evaluate the validity and reliability of the scales used in the study. Data were analyzed using structural equation models. Second-order path analysis revealed that resilience positively affected career-future perceptions, both directly and indirectly (through hopelessness). It has been determined that the level of hope positively affected the career-future perceptions;yet, it played a mediating role in the relationship between psychological resilience and career future perceptions. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","AlniaÃ§ik, Esra, Mustafa, Of, Balkas, Jale, TÃ¼lemez, Soner, * Magsud, Mirzayev, * Hazem, Alfarra","https://doi.org/10.15295/bmij.v9i1.1757","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Business & Management Studies: An International Journal; 9(1):248-266, 2021.; Publication details: Business & Management Studies: An International Journal; 9(1):248-266, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20727,""
"Variations in orthopedic trauma presentation during COVID-19 lockdown","Introduction: The first national lockdown was imposed in Ireland from 27th March 2020, to combat the spread of Coronavirus. All nonessential travel, businesses, sporting activities and schools were closed. The elderly were advised to cocoon. The roadmap to easing the restrictions started in May. The lockdown measures resulted in people spending more time indoors, with impact on social and personal wellbeing This had the potential to increase alcohol consumption, self inflicted injuries and neglect. The purpose of our study is to analyze the variations in orthopedic trauma presentations during the pandemic compared to similar period in 2018 and 2019 Method: Retrospective data was collected from Orthopedic theatre registry of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Co Louth, Ireland Patients operated by orthopedic trauma team in three months period (March, April & May) in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were selected for analysis and comparison Result: Total number of surgeries performed in March-May 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 551, 505 and 373 showing a significant reduction in 2020 as compared to previous years. Trauma surgeries performed on children in March-May 2018,2019 and 2020 were 132,131 and 90 respectively showing a similar downward trend. Surgeries were further categorized into Major +, Major, Intermediate and Minor according to their level of complexity. Although there was a significant reduction seen in Major, Intermediate and Minor surgeries, no significant difference was observed in Major + surgeries (73 in March-May 2020 vs. 79 in March-May 2019 and 57 in March-May 2018) Conclusion: Significant reduction was seen in overall trauma surgeries which is attributable to lockdown measures. The difference in trend between Major + and other categories of surgeries can be explained by the reduction in sporting injuries and injuries in children whereas no significant difference was noted in hip fractures .","Chaudhry, M.

"Reliability and validity study of the turkish version of the covid-19 peritraumatic distress index","Objective: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, affecting people world-wide, negatively affects the mental health of people. During this situation, accurate and reliable tools are needed to evaluate mental state. The aim of this study was to translate the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) into Turkish, and analyze it for validity and reliability. Methods: The original form of the CPDI was translated into Turkish using the back translation method. It was then applied to over 400 individuals, randomly selected from patients and their relatives, between the ages of 18 and 70, who presented to the outpatient clinics of Mustafa Kemal University Research Hospital. Data were collected with a demographic data form. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were done. Construct validity, item content validity index, and content validity were analyzed. Cronbachâ€™s alpha vs. Spearman-Brown reliability analyses were done. Results: Cronbachâ€™s alpha coefficient for the CPDI was found to be 0.842, which is quite high. Cronbachâ€™s alpha coefficient for the subscales ranged from 0.670 to 0.780. The Spearman-Brown reliability coefficient was 0.730. The confirmatory factor analysis revealed good fit indices (<U+03C7>2/df = 1.94;root mean square error of approximation = 0.05;Comparative Fit Index = 0.93;Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index and Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.91). The mean total score was 27.26 (SD = 12.28), while the mean subscale scores ranged from 4.83 to 10.26. Conclusion: The Turkish version of the CPDI is valid and reliable, and can be used in studies evaluating the COVID-19 peritraumatic stress.","Karadag, M.; KokaÃ§ya, M.

This study aimed to investigate COVID-19 patient narratives to reveal how their lived experiences of COVID-19 infection and quarantine shape their mental health. In-depth semi-structural interviews were conducted with 5 COVID-19 patients from Wuhan to elicit their lived experiences of COVID-19. The case reports showed that persons diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and admitted to the COVID ward developed the symptoms of anxiety, worry, low mood, frustration, irritability, stigma, distress, guilt, and loneliness. Lack of scientific information, long-term social isolation, and limited social support were the main risk factors leading to their mental health problems. The study sug-gests that timely diagnosis of patientsâ€™ mental health problems and diverse psychological interventions are needed before, during, and after their hospitalization.","Deng, Y.; Yang, J.; Wang, L.; Chen, Y.","https://doi.org/10.5152/alphapsychiatry.2021.21288","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Anadolu Psikiyatri Dergisi; 22(5):269-274, 2021.; Publication details: Anadolu Psikiyatri Dergisi; 22(5):269-274, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20731,""

"Demographic perspectives on mortality of COVID-19 and other epidemics","What would a hypothetical one million US deaths in the Covid-19 epidemic mean for mortality of individuals at the population level? To put estimates of Covid-19 mortality into perspective, we estimate age-specific mortality for an epidemic claiming for illustrative purposes one million US lives, with results scalable over a broad range of deaths. We calculate the impact on period life expectancy (down 3 years) and remaining life-years (12.3 years per death), which for one million deaths can be valued at six to 10 trillion dollars. The age-patterns of Covid-19 mortality observed in other countries are remarkably similar and exhibit the typical rate of increase by age of normal mortality. The scenario of one million Covid-19 deaths is similar in scale to the decades-long HIV/AIDS and opioid-overdose epidemics but considerably smaller than the Spanish Flu of 1918. Unlike HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics, the Covid-19 deaths will be concentrated in months rather than spread out over decades.","Goldstein, J. R.; Lee, R.

"Neuropsychiatric manifestations in COVID - 19","Objective: Coronavirus infections are known to have neuro invasive potential with consequent neuropsychiatric manifestations. Since early recognition and prompt management of neuropsychiatric manifestations in these patients have a potential to decrease overall morbidity and mortality. We analyzed COVID-19 adult patients from January 20, 2020 to June 10th, 2020. 40,469 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 among whom 9086 patients had neuropsychiatric manifestations. Background: Corona Virus 2 is a highly pathogenic coronavirus identified as causing mild to severe symptoms involving Respiratory, GI, Cardiac and tend to have neuroinvasive potential. In the largest study thus far, Mao et al reported a case series of 214 patients, where approximately one-third of these patients had neurological symptoms including stroke, encephalopathy and myopathy. We studied, 40,469 COVID-19 patients, our aim is to describe the demographics, neurological manifestations, and complications of COVID-19. Design/Methods: De-identified COVID-19 patient data was extracted using TriNetX from Jan 20, 2020 to June 10 2020. Study population included patients with age 18 years or older with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 Results: Of the total 40,469 COVID-19 patients, (22.5%) patients had neuropsychiatric manifestations. The most common neurologic manifestations included headaches (3.7%) and sleep disorders (3.4%). Other manifestations were encephalopathy (2.3%), myalgia (2.0%), pain (1.8%), loss of taste and smell (1.2%), stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1.0%), dizziness (0.9%), extrapyramidal and movement disorders (0.7%), seizures (0.6%), polyneuropathy (0.6%), and nerve root and plexus disorders (0.4%). Common psychiatric manifestations included anxiety and other related disorders (4.6%), mood disorders (3.8%). Less than 1% of all psychiatric manifestations included emotional state symptoms and signs (0.8%), suicidal ideation (0.2%). Conclusions: Potential mechanisms of neuropsychiatric manifestation include direct CNS infiltration, cytokine network dysregulation, peripheral immune cell transmigration, and postinfectious autoimmune response. Clinicians need to be aware of these manifestations in COVID- 19 patients, given the morbidity and mortality of neuropsychiatric involvement.","Veerapaneni, P.; Battini, S.; Sharma, R.; Dandu, V.; Yadala, S.; Veerapaneni, K.; Siddamreddy, S.; Brown, A.; Kapoor, N.; Kovvuru, S.; Onteddu, S.; Nalleballe, K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Neuropsychiatric+manifestations+in+COVID+-+19","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20734,""
"Acute psychosis in association of COVID19 infection: A case report","Objective: NA Background: The SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a lot of stress and fear of contracting the illness. There have been few cases describing patients presenting with psychiatric manifestations associated with COVID19 infection. Design/Methods: NA Results: We describe the case of a 26-year-old female, health care professional who was diagnosed with COVID19 infection manifested as self-resolved mild body aches, low grade fever and cough for a few days. Patient was evaluated at which time she did not require treatment;therefore, she was advised to self-isolate, which she did in a hotel for 14 days. Patient returned to work after 2 weeks of self-quarantine and resolution of her symptoms. While at work, patient had difficulty with concentration, inappropriate laughing episodes and previously recurring insomnia. She also displayed extreme anxiety towards work, dealing with COVID-19 positive patients, feeling of inadequacy, feeling guilty of spreading corona virus, crying spells, and panic attacks evidenced by palpitations, shortness of breath and restlessness. Patient was initially treated with Alprazolam, Trazodone and Escitalopram. Subsequently, patient returned with auditory hallucinations where voices were telling her that she was killing patients and that her nurse license was fake. Patient also had persecutory delusions, therefore she was afraid she may kill someone and her license will be revoked. She displayed worsening symptoms of anxiety, rapid speech, and suicidal ideations;so an inpatient admission was warranted to rule out other organic causes of acute psychosis. Workup including infectious and metabolic panel, CTH, EEG and spinal tap to rule out encephalitis or other organic causes of her symptoms were unremarkable except for persisting positive COVID 19 PCR. Consequently, she was diagnosed with acute psychosis and was successfully treated with Quetiapine, Escitalopram and Clonazepam. Conclusions: Acute psychosis is a less known complication of COVID19 infection which should be anticipated and managed appropriately to reduce morbidity.","Umanah, T.; Arshad, H.; Noor, E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Acute+psychosis+in+association+of+COVID19+infection:+A+case+report","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20735,""
"Exploratory study of acoustic neuromodulation improves pain, autonomic function, and symptoms of insomnia, stress, and anxiety in individuals with chronic pain","Objective: Evaluate the impact of Cereset Researchâ„¢ (CR), on pain, autonomic function, insomnia, stress, and anxiety for those with chronic pain. Background: Chronic pain is a worldwide crisis causing negative health outcomes, and risk for psychological disorders. Effective non-drug, noninvasive, cost-effective, durable modalities are lacking. CR is a noninvasive, closed-loop, acoustic neuromodulation technology, echoing brainwaves in real time as auditory tones. Design/Methods: 19 adults (10 females, median age 48) with chronic pain (median 5 years), and insomnia (ISI, of =8 points for =1 month), stress (PSS of =14), or anxiety (GAD-7 of =5), enrolled in this exploratory trial. Subjects received 6-12, sixty-minute sessions of tones linked to brainwaves plus continued current care. Data was collected at baseline (V1), 0-21 days (V2) after intervention, 4-7 weeks after V2 (V3), and 4-7 weeks after V3 (V4). HRV (SDNN and rMSSD) was obtained as primary outcome based on 10-minute BP and HR recordings using a continuous non-invasive blood pressure system, with change in ISI, PSS, GAD-7, CES-D, PCL-C, and MPQ as secondary outcomes. We report interim results for symptom and HRV outcomes across visits. Results: 19 subjects completed V1-V2 measures. Due to COVID-19, V1-V4=10. Median change V1 to V4 ISI:-6.5 (p=0.001);PSS score:-5.5 (p&lt;0.01);GAD-7:-6 (p&lt;0.01), CES-D:-7 (p&lt;0.01);and PCL-C:-8 (p&lt;0.01);MPQ:-8.5 (p=0.52). Mean (median) SDNN and rMSSD significantly increased by 45.7 % (30.9%) and 89.1% (47.1%) respectively from V1 to V2. SDNN improved from V1 to V4 36.6% (39.0%), p=0.02. Conclusions: Interim results suggest significant, durable reductions in self-reported scores for insomnia, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and pain in those with chronic pain. In this small cohort, many reductions were clinically meaningful and there were also trends for improved HRV. Further evaluation is needed for this scalable, non-drug intervention.","Tegeler, C.; Howard, L.; Brown, K.; Kellar, D.; Asif-Fraz, F.; Gerdes, L.; Tegeler, C.; Shaltout, H.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Exploratory+study+of+acoustic+neuromodulation+improves+pain,+autonomic+function,+and+symptoms+of+insomnia,+stress,+and+anxiety+in+individuals+with+chronic+pain","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20736,""
"Diagnostic delay due to COVID-19 pandemic-A case of primary CNS lymphoma","Objective: We describe a case of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) where diagnosis/treatment was delayed due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Background: PCNSL is a rare aggressive extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma, rapidly fatal if left untreated. Corticosteroids can alter imaging appearance of PCNSL, requiring a high index of suspicion to establish the diagnosis. Design/Methods: Delay in care with diagnosis and treatment of PCNSL in the COVID-19 pandemic setting. Results: This 51-year-old woman on prednisone and oral methotrexate for uveitis presented with nausea, vomiting, and fatigue following exposure to an individual with confirmed COVID19. Patient's Coronavirus testing was negative. She deteriorated, developing ataxia, depression, and hypersomnolence. Outpatient neurology evaluation was delayed by 2 months after symptom onset due to the pandemic. Initial MRI brain findings including T2 hyperintensities involving periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, and cerebellar hemispheres with limited enhancement led to hospitalization. Demyelinating disease was suspected, methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis were administered. Patient became increasingly somnolent with spastic quadriparesis. Hospital visitation was limited to one person, starting noon for six hours a day. Bedside rounds were often completed by that time. Patient's inability to advocate for herself due to altered consciousness likely added to diagnostic delay. Repeat MRI brain three weeks after admission demonstrated progressive white matter lesions with patchy enhancement. Brain biopsy confirmed diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), non-germinal center, double-expressor phenotype. She was started on high-dose methotrexate with signs of neurologic recovery. Conclusions: PCNSL has variable manifestations potentially mimicking a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. In this case, outpatient workup was prolonged due to COVID-19, imaging atypical from steroid treatment, patient unable to advocate for herself due to altered level of consciousness with restricted visitation during hospitalization, leading to significant diagnostic delay and development of neurologic disability.","Sener, U.; Niazi, F.; Nadkarni, T.; Lopez, K.; Ward, M.; Pawar, G.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Diagnostic+delay+due+to+COVID-19+pandemic-A+case+of+primary+CNS+lymphoma","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20737,""
"Functional Neurological Disorderin a neurological emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: To determine if the proportion of consultations from functional neurological disorder (FND) patients to a neurological emergency room changed in the months of isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: In Mexico, isolation due to COVID-19 was implemented from March 2020 to date. COVID-19 has been related to increased levels of depression and anxiety, among younger populations. It is known that functional neurological disorder patients are exposed to more stressful life events than other neurological patients. There is no data on the incidence of FND during COVID-19 pandemic. Design/Methods: Using our neurological emergency departments records from 2017 to 2020, we searched for the proportion of patients with FND who presented between March and October of 2020, the months of isolation, and compared to that same period in previous years. Results: A total of 17,861 consultations with 398 patients with FND were registered the past three years before COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 a total of 146 out of 4105 consultations were found to have a FND. The OR was 2.91 (CI: 2.32-3.64 p= &lt;0.001) for having a FND which shows a significative increase in the risk of having a FND during this period. Adjustments for gender and age didn't show differences in these results. Conclusions: The proportion of FND patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and its isolations restrictions has increased in comparison to previous years. Since COVID-19 related isolation is a (hopefully) one-time event. The temporal relationship between this situation and the increase in consultations is sugestive of causality. The adjustment to unknown yearly-variable factors by extending the comparisong to previous pasts year supports our hypothesis. Nevertheless, intrinsec limitations of this design prevents the researchers to establish a robust causal relation between both factors. Further studies are needed to assess if this increase in proportion has a direct relationship with the pandemic and/or the isolation restrictions.","Saldivar-DÃ¡vila, S.; Medina-Rioja, R.; Rodriguez-Rivas, R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Functional+Neurological+Disorderin+a+neurological+emergency+department+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20738,""
"Stroke recoveries at risk with COVID-19: A systematic review and call to action","Objective: The purpose of study is to review the current literature on concerns regarding a lack of access to post-stroke neurorehabilitation in current pandemic and its effects. Background: COVID-19 pandemic has not only had a direct impact on people's health but also has greatly influenced public access to acute and subacute therapy centers which may prevent stroke patients from receiving state-of-art rehabilitation therapy. Design/Methods: Systematic literature search on post-stroke rehabilitation limitations and its outcome due to COVID-19 pandemic. Database reviewed: PubMed, Medline, Scopus and Ovid. Results: We identified 18 articles meeting our criteria. A global study reports a lifetime risk of stroke is 24.9% with proportion of ischemic stroke being the highest at 87%. Rehabilitation is one of the key factors towards recovery and improving the quality of life. Recent data suggest there is inaccessibility towards neuro-rehabilitation services during the pandemic. Study in UK reported 39% of stroke survivors felt they did not receive enough therapies. 34% patients who had stroke prior to pandemic experienced better care as compared to now. Study in Ireland evidenced similar response with 59% survivors reported less support in pandemic. Mental health post-stroke has also taken a toll in the pandemic. A study done in Scotland reports 69% stroke survivors felt more anxious and depressed with more than 50% have had the therapy session cancelled. Similar study performed in Scotland reported 53% cancellation of rehab therapies with more than half of patients going without the necessary rehabilitation. Conclusions: Current data suggest significant deterioration in post-stroke accessibility to rehab and therapy centers. Healthcare systems should prioritize increasing provision and access to meet the unmet need for post-stroke care. While incorporating tele-visits in this pandemic one should be mindful of patients with cognitive, communication and or those less digitally literate should not be disadvantaged.","Naik, S.; Naik, S.; Madireddy, N.

"Characterization of Dietary Patterns, Cognitive Function and Mood in Diverse Populations of Cardiac Patients in the age of COVID-19","Objective: This research characterizes cardiac patients from a single center to assess cognition, mood, and diet during the COVID pandemic. Background: Individuals with cardiovascular disease are increasingly reporting changes in their diet and cognitive abilities, and these changes can be accompanied by physical, mood deficits, that may greatly impact daily activities and quality of life. Design/Methods: Telephone questionnaires were administered through the phone to 48 patients recruited from various cardiac clinics in the Rush University Health system. These tools consisted of a 42-item COVID questionnaire to assess coping, PHQ-9, 15-item MIND screener, and the telephone version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Statistical analysis was conducted via SPSS. Results: On average, participants were older (m = 69.5 Â± 9.8 years), majority white (n = 40), females (n = 42). Patients are feeling isolated (m = 3.3/5 Â± 1.2) and worried about themselves or loved ones contracting COVID (m = 3.6/5 Â± 1.0) Additionally, patients believe staying at home during COVID is very important (4/5 Â± 1.1) and would very readily take a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 offered by the government (3.6/5 Â± 1.4). Only 29% of patients believe that the flu is just as dangerous as COVID-19. PHQ-9:17, 9, and 3 patients falling into mild, moderate, and severe depression thresholds, respectively (m = 5.9/20 Â± 4.4) MIND diet screener: 81% of patient's diets have changed due to COVID (m = 8.7/14 Â± 2.2). MoCA: 52% of patients had scores below 19 (MCI) (18.6 Â± 1.9/22) with the two lowest domain scores in language & delayed recall. Conclusions: Preliminary data from this study suggests that patients are experiencing loneliness, mild depression, and worry in the ongoing COVID pandemic. Additionally, most patients have experienced a change in their diet, but exhibit moderate-to-high adherence to the MIND diet. Finally, over half of surveyed patients have mild cognitive impairment.","McNally, T.; Zimmerman, A.; Holland, T.; Agarwal, P.; Cherian, L.; Aggarwal, N.; Volgman, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Characterization+of+Dietary+Patterns,+Cognitive+Function+and+Mood+in+Diverse+Populations+of+Cardiac+Patients+in+the+age+of+COVID-19","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20740,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, physical activity and sleep in children with neuroinflammatory disorders","Objective: To assess changes in anxiety, fatigue, depression, physical activity, and sleep associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in youth with neuroinflammatory disorders. Background: Children with neuroinflammatory disorders have high rates of anxiety, depression, and fatigue, plus reduced physical activity compared to healthy counterparts. We examined whether patients with neuroinflammatory disorders would show changes in the above domains associated with COVID-19, hypothesizing poorer outcomes in patients with chronic/recurrent disease. Design/Methods: Children with neuroinflammatory disorders completed questionnaires from March-August 2020 (n=129): Screen for Childhood Anxiety and Related Disorders, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale for Children, Pediatric Quality of Life Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, and Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire. Clinical/demographic data were collected via standardized Case Report Form. We used pre-pandemic data for paired analysis where available (n=87). Results: Participants were 57% female (mean age: 13Â±4 years). Children with monophasic Acquired Demyelinating Syndrome (monoADS) engaged in moderate/vigorous physical activity a mean of 6Â±4 times/week pre-pandemic (n=61), and 5Â±4 during the pandemic (n=62). Children with chronic/recurrent neuroinflammation (crNI;Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and neuroinflammation with systemic involvement) exercised 4Â±3 times/week pre-pandemic (n=21 (14 MS)), and 4Â±2 during (n=25 (15 MS)) (monoADS vs crNI: p=0.076). Across all groups, the pandemic brought a rise in sleep time (9Â±1 versus 10Â±2 hours, p&lt;0.001), and improved sleep-rest fatigue (p=0.05). Despite this, children with MS reported more sleep-rest fatigue compared to monoADS (p=0.043). Average rates of depression and anxiety were similar pre/post-pandemic (29%/31%, p=0.507;16%/17%, p=0.857). During the pandemic, however, rates of depression/anxiety were significantly different by disease type: systemic involvement (60%/50%), MS (33%/27%), monoADS (22%/16%)(Chi-square, p=0.048/0.049). Conclusions: With the pandemic, despite increased sleep, youth with neuroinflammatory disorders continued to display high rates of depression/anxiety and reduced physical activity. There were significantly different rates of depression/anxiety between disease types. Individuals with recurrent disease had more fatigue than those with monophasic disease.","Logan, L.

"Frequency of neurological manifestations in patients with COVID 19 in acute stage and convalescence","Objective: To study the neurologic manifestations in the acute phase and convalescence of COVID-19. Background: There were the firsts reports of unexplained pneumonia from Wuhan, China, caused by SARS-CoV-2 and The World Health Organization named the disease COVID-19. Neurological manifestation increased reports, including the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system manifestations. Design/Methods: We performed a descriptive, prospective, longitudinal study at Nationale Institute of Nutrition and Medical Sciences, a COVID center in Mexico. We followed-up COVID 19 (positive PCR and hospitalization, from 23rd March until 30th June 2020). We recollected data and interviewed them in the first month after egress. Results: We included 1072, median age was 53.2 years, 65% males, risk factors were obesity/overweight 83.8%, hypertension 30.3%, diabetes 27.9%. 163 developed neurological events, 12.6% delirium, miopaty 4.1%, awakening disturbances 3.4%, seizures 0.8%, stroke 0.8% and encephalities 0.2%. 23.3% ingresed UCI, 71.8% with neurological events (p&lt;0.001), delirium was 82.8%. In the follow up, we reach out 432 (53.4%), the most common symptoms were depressive symptoms 51.2%, limb weakness 46.8%, inadequate sleep quality 63.5%, sensory involvement (parestesias 39.6%), lack of concentration 36.2%, gait abnormality 31.1%, dizziness 31.1%, taste impairment 30.8%, cephalea 27.2%, smell impairment 26.5%, tremmor 32.8%, visual impairment 17.5% and seizure 0.7%.

"A digital tele-health intervention for anxiety and stress management in younger patients with MS","Objective: To test the feasibility of a remotely delivered digital telehealth intervention targeting anxiety and stress in patients with pediatric onset MS. Background: Pediatric onset (&lt;18 years) occurs in approximately 3% of MS cases, representing the youngest affected subpopulation. Emotional distress commonly occurs in MS, and there is a need for accessible and effective interventions. Personal Zen is an app-based version of the established intervention for cognitive bias retraining.Design/Methods: Participants with confirmed pediatric onset MS were recruited for this teleintervention during routine in-person or video outpatient visits during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were provided the Personal Zen app for installation, trained on its use, and instructed to train daily (&gt;4 times a week) x four weeks. Measures of anxiety and stress were administered at baseline and repeated weekly.Results: A total n=22 participants (86.4% female, age 17.95 Â± 1.94, range 15 to 23 years) with minimal disability (EDSS range 0.0 to 2.5) were enrolled. Adherence was high, averaging 16.6 entries per participant over one month, indicating feasibility of the intervention. At study end there was a significant decrease in symptoms of anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory, 2.23Â±10.71, p=.006), depression (Beck Depression Inventory, 6.08Â±8.58, p=.025) and negative affect (4.55Â±7.88, p= .025).Conclusions: The digital telehealth intervention Personal Zen is a feasible and effective tool to reduce distress experienced by younger patients with MS, and particularly relevant as a therapeutic option in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","George, A.; Cho, H.; Krupp, L.; Dennis, T.; Charvet, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+digital+tele-health+intervention+for+anxiety+and+stress+management+in+younger+patients+with+MS","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication details: Neurology; 96(15 SUPPL 1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20743,""
"Determinants of recovery from the coronavirus disease 2019 in people with multiple sclerosis: The UK MS Register COVID-19 prospective cohort study","Objective: To assess factors associated with recovery from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) Background: It is important to understand the recovery process from COVID-19 among pwMS to identify those who are most vulnerable to the long-term sequelae of infection. Design/Methods: The UK MS Register COVID-19 study is a community-based prospective cohort of pwMS launched on March 17th, 2020. We have been collecting data from participants (n=6,618 as of October 5th, 2020) every two weeks from the time of their enrolment in the study. We ask participants about COVID-19 and follow them through their recovery. The UK MS Register holds pre-COVID-19 longitudinal and prospectively collected patient-reported data including web-based Expanded Disability Status Scale (webEDSS), MS Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. Results: Out of 709 participants with self-diagnosed COVID-19, 391 responded to the follow-up questionnaires. 76% (n=297) had fully recovered, 15.9% (n=62) had mostly recovered, and 8.2% (n=32) were still experiencing symptoms at the time of their latest follow-up. Among participants with full recovery, the median (IQR) duration of disease was 10 (6-21) days. Participants who had not recovered completely had been followed up for a median (IQR) duration of 105 (35-131) days. PwMS who had a higher webEDSS score (OR 0.78, 95%CI 0.65-0.93) or physical component of MSIS-29 score (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.96-0.98) were less likely to report a full recovery. The presence of anxiety (HADS-anxiety =11), recorded the year before the pandemic, was associated with a lower probability of complete recovery (OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.10-0.66). Demographics, diseasemodifying therapies, MS duration, or type of MS were not associated with recovery. Conclusions: Physical disability and anxiety prior to the pandemic are the main determinants of persistent COVID-19 symptoms among people with MS.","Garjani, A.; Nicholas, R.; Middleton, R.; Tuite-Dalton, K.; Hunter, R.; Nair, R.

"Cognitive and behaviorial features of COVID-19 patients in post-acute phase","Objective: To explore cognitive/behavioral features With in two months from hospital discharge in a cohort of patients with COVID-19. Background: Although the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 patients are well characterized, the psychological impact of SARS-CoV-2 has been given little attention. Design/Methods: 49 patients with confirmed COVID-19 underwent neuropsychological assessment With in two months from hospital discharge. The presence of mood alterations and/or features of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was also investigated. The total sample was split based on age (yC-19, age&lt;50: N=8;mC-19, age range 50-64: N=21;oC-19, age=65: N=20) and the frequencies of cognitive and behavioral alterations were reported for the total sample and each sub-group. Correlations were tested between neuropsychological scores and the severity of respiratory symptoms at hospital admission. Results: 5 patients (1 yC-19, 4 mC-19) presented with depressive symptoms and 9 (3 yC-19, 4 mC-9, 2 oC-19) reported PTSD features. 45% of the total sample showed executive dysfunctions and difficulties in encoding new verbal material;30% showed visuospatial difficulties, and 25% long-term verbal and nonverbal memory problems. No patients showed language disturbances. Specifically, the yC-19 group showed the worst profile, with 60-75% patients showing executive dysfunctions and encoding difficulties, 50% pure visuospatial dysfunctions and 40% primary long-term memory problems. The mC-19 group showed primary executive (&gt;40%) and visuospatial (25%) dysfunctions. 40% of the oC-19 group showed executive dysfunctions, 30% poor visuospatial abilities, and 25% long-term memory problems. The total sample showed a negative relationship between frontal executive performances and severity of acute-phase respiratory symptoms at hospital admission. Conclusions: With in two months from hospital discharge, cognitive/behavioral alterations are associated with COVID-19 infection, with more severe outcomes in the youngest group. Whether these alterations are linked with the infection itself or with its related consequences has to be determined, as well as whether they are reversible or part of a neurodegenerative process.","Canu, E.; Agosta, F.; Barbieri, A.; Bernasconi, M.

"Stress-, anxiety-, and cellphone use-induced sleep deficits and psychological conditions during the pandemic and a potential remedy","Stress-induced sleep and psychological problems are common in modern life. The rapid spread of COVID-19 and implementation of social isolation has diminished social activities, leading to major changes in daily lifestyles.Unprecedented changes, coupled with the fear induced by the pandemic, have added stress and anxiety for a large segment of the population. Interestingly, within this timeframe, there has been a significant increase in cellphone dependence, which may be linked to social isolation. These events could result in a disruption in sleep patterns and increase in psychological challenges. In this study, we surveyed 288 volunteers to gain insight into how stress, anxiety, and time spent on cellphones affected sleep and mood. In addition, we developed an herbal compound preparation, â€œSmarto-Oneâ€, which is rich in flavonoids that play a role in GABAA receptor modulation. We tested its therapeutic effects on these conditions presumably linked to social isolation. We found 1) a negative linear correlation between sleep duration vs stress level and time on cellphone. 2) a negative correlation between wake-up mood/symptoms vs stress. 3) volunteers taking Smarto-One showed substantial improvements in stress levels, hours of sleep, cellphone dependence, and wake-up mood/symptoms as compared to taking placebo. Overall, this work illustrates the value of Smarto-One as an alternative remedy for improving overall mental health and wellbeing. (Int J Biomed Sci 2021;17 (3): 40-49).","Shao, A.

"First results of factors associated with resilience and mental health of children and adolescents (9-18 years) during the first lockdown related to COVID-19 in France","Introduction - The COVID-19 pandemic, combined with school closures and the circumstances of the first lockdown in France from March to May 2020, have contributed to the exacerbation of existing social inequalities. However, currently, there is a lack of studies in France that explore the impact of living conditions on the mental health of children and adolescents during the lockdown. The objective of the present study is to assess the emotional status and levels of psychological distress of children aged 9 to 18 years old during and after the first lockdown based on their environment and living conditions, as well as to measure resilience and strategies to preserve their well-being. This study was also extended to young people living in child welfare. Methods - Data for the Confeado study were collected via an online parent and child questionnaire from 9 June to 14 September 2020, which collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions, and the impact of lockdown. Health inequalities were a key focus in the questionnaire. Psychological health was assessed using self-reported responses to psychometric scales. Bivariate analyses were performed via chi-squared tests to describe distress and emotional state and Student's t-test or ANOVA test to describe resilience, by age and sex, according to living conditions, parental characteristics, and activities. Results - In this descriptive study, 3,898 children and adolescents were included, including 81 youth in child welfare. There appeared to be a greater impact on the mental health of adolescents compared to younger children both during and after the lockdown, with girls appeared to have poorer mental health than boys. Factors associated with psychological distress include housing conditions (being confined to an urban area, in an apartment or house without a garden, not having access to an outside space in the home, living in over-occupied housing and not being able to isolate oneself), economic conditions (financial and food difficulties, a period of parental unemployment, a lack of internet connection), parental characteristics (single parent family, low level of education, workers or employees parents, foreign-born parents, lack of social support). A lack of recreational activity - increased use of social networks and screens, a feeling of being overwhelmed by school work, having a relative who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 or hospitalized due to the virus were also associated with greater distress. In contrast, higher resilience scores were associated with better living conditions, a two-parent family composition, higher levels of parental education, having social support, and participating in recreational activities during lockdown. Conclusion - Financial support for single-parent families, and maintaining recreational activities and regular outings are elements that can influence the mental health of children and adolescents during a health crisis. Support for young people whose loved ones have been infected with or hospitalized due to COVID-19 should be promoted, as well as awareness and information for parents and children the need to preserve one's mental well-being. Public policies to promote resilience must therefore be differentiated from social policies to account for social inequalities in health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vandentorren, S.; Khirredine, I.; Estevez, M.; Stefano, C. de, Rezzoug, D.; Oppenchaim, N.; Haag, P.; Gensburger, S.; Oui, A.; Delaville, E.; Gindt-Ducros, A.; Habran, E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=First+results+of+factors+associated+with+resilience+and+mental+health+of+children+and+adolescents+(9-18+years)+during+the+first+lockdown+related+to+COVID-19+in+France","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication details: Bulletin Epidemiologique Hebdomadaire|2021.

"Assessment of the perceived impact of the first lockdown (17 March-11 May 2020) on children and pregnant women's health seen in maternal and children-protection services and in day-care centres in the city of Paris, France, during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction - During the first lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic in France (17 March-11 May 2020), the National Council for Public Health (HCSP) warned about the impact of the lockdown on children's lifestyle and physical and mental health. The goal of this article is to describe the impact of the first lockdown on key indicators of the health of pregnant women and children, and to compare these indicators between populations with different characteristics. It is based on data from surveys carried out in maternal and child-protection services (PMI) in Paris and in municipal day-care centres (EAPE) by the Department of Family and Early Childhood of the City of Paris (DFPE). Materials and method - The survey of the maternal and child-protection services (EPMI) is based on forms filled by users of the services in October 2020;the day-care survey (EEAPE) is based on a form sent by email in November 2020. Two forms were developed: one for the children, filled by their parents (QE), and one for women who were pregnant or had given birth (QF). All data collected comes from the answers given by the parents or the women. Four groups are considered based on the type of housing in which the families experienced lockdown: ""in usual individual housing"" and ""in very low-income public housing"" for the EPMI;""in usual individual housing"" and ""in another individual housing"" for the EEAPE. The EPMI analysis population includes 500 children (between 7 months and 2 years old) and 956 women. The EAPE analysis includes 3,185 children. A descriptive analysis and a comparison of the characteristics between the populations of the same survey were carried out. Results - The families of the day-care survey experienced the lockdown in better conditions than in those in the maternal and child-protection services study, thanks to, on average, more spacious housing and the more frequent presence of the second parent. At least 20% of parents in the day-care survey and 25% of parents in the maternal and child-protection services study reported a negative impact of the first lockdown on the observed indicators of children's health. In the maternal and child-protection services study, the frequency of some negative indicators was higher for families in very low-income public housing, for example sleep disorder or difficulties in relationship with children whereas in the day-care survey the frequency of some of these disturbances was lower for families outside their usual housing. Among pregnant women, at least 68.8% were ""particularly worried"" during the first lockdown, and health appointments were cancelled for 29.5% of them. Conclusion - The first lockdown had an overall negative impact on the health of children and pregnant women. This impact appears to have differed depending on the conditions in which the confinement was experienced.","Carayol, M.; Berraute, E.; Jung, S.; Ledour, V.; Merle, S.; Stark, A.; Marmier, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Assessment+of+the+perceived+impact+of+the+first+lockdown+(17+March-11+May+2020)+on+children+and+pregnant+women's+health+seen+in+maternal+and+children-protection+services+and+in+day-care+centres+in+the+city+of+Paris,+France,+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: GIM; Publication details: Bulletin Epidemiologique Hebdomadaire;2021.; Publication details: Bulletin Epidemiologique Hebdomadaire;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20750,""

"Changes in the Practice of Electroconvulsive Therapy in Poland: A Nationwide Survey Comparing Data Between 2005 and 2020","Background: The use and the characteristics of the practice of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in Poland have not been evaluated since 2005, when a nationwide survey revealed its rare utilization (0.11 patients/10,000 inhabitants/year). The aims of this study were to determine the current use of ECT and to compare the findings with those of the previous survey. Methods: Two questionnaires were sent to all 48 inpatient psychiatric centers in Poland. The first one - to units providing ECT to explore its practice, and the second - to units not performing ECT to explore the reasons for not using this treatment. Results: Nineteen (39.6%) of all psychiatric inpatient centers confirmed the use of ECT. The utilization rate was 0.13 patients/10,000 inhabitants. Similar to the findings from 2005, the main indications were affective disorders, and bitemporal electrode placement was the dominant method used for the delivery of ECT. Age-based and titration-based methods were applied exclusively in 50% and 25% of the centers, respectively (compared with 15% and 35% in 2005, respectively), while both methods were used in the remaining 25%. Improvements in safety were reflected by the use of comprehensive pre-ECT evaluation and treatment monitoring. None of the centers used sine-wave devices; this contrasts with their use by 29% of the centers in 2005. The main reasons for not using ECT were insufficient funding and a lack of experienced staff. Conclusion: The frequency of ECT use in Poland remains very low. In view of the improvement in the quality of health services in the past decade, such a markedly rare use of an effective treatment was unexpected. There is an urgent need of education to create more positive attitude towards ECT among health professionals and among public, and to increase the training of mental health professionals in ECT.","Antosik-WÃ³jcinska, Anna Z; Dominiak, Monika; Mierzejewski, Pawel; Jazdzyk, Piotr; Gazdag, Gabor; Takacs, Rozalia; Wichniak, Adam","https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S296210","","Country: NZ; NOVA ZELÃ‚NDIA; NEW ZEALAND; NUEVA ZELANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat;17: 605-612, 2021.; Publication details: Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat;17: 605-612, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20758,""
"Quality of Life, Sleep Quality, Depression, Anxiety, Stress, Eating Habits, and Social Bounds in Nurses during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Qatar (The PROTECTOR Study): A Cross-Sectional, Comparative Study","There have been numerous concerns regarding the physical and mental health of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression potentiated nurses' vulnerability to poor eating habits. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the differences between nurses' characteristics with COVID-19 facility designation, and sleep quality, depression, anxiety, stress, eating habits, social bonds, and quality of life. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, comparative study. METHODS: An online survey was sent using the corporation's email to nurses working in three hospitals in Qatar from September to December 2020. One of them is a designated COVID-19 facility. The sleep quality, depression, eating habits, social bonds, and quality of life were measured using The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), Emotional Eater Questionnaire (EEQ), Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS-3), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF), respectively. RESULTS: A total of 200 nurses participated in the study (RR: 13.3%). No statistically significant association was found between designated facility (COVID-19 vs. not COVID-19) or nurses' characteristics and ISI categories (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.54, 2.44). Nurses working in COVID-19 facilities had increased odds of having higher EEQ categories by 2.62 times (95% CI 1.18, 5.83). Similarly, no statistically significant associations were found between any of the nurses' characteristics and OSSS-3 categories. On the other hand, no statistically significant associations were found between any of the nurses' characteristics and QOL domains except for the gender and social relationships' domain. CONCLUSION: Overall, the quality of life of nurses in Qatar is on a positive level whether they are assigned to a COVID-19 facility or not. Although no significant difference was found with regard to the sleep quality, stress, anxiety, depression, and eating habits between nurses in a COVID-19 facility and in a non-COVID-19 facility, special interventions to diminish stressors need to be implemented and maintained.","Nashwan, Abdulqadir J; Villar, Ralph C; Al-Qudimat, Ahmad R; Kader, Nisha; Alabdulla, Majid; Abujaber, Ahmad A; Al-Jabry, Mahmood M; Harkous, Michel; Philip, Anite; Ali, Raed; Chandra, Prem; Yassin, Mohamed A; Shraim, Mujahed; Singh, Kalpana","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jpm11090918","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Pers Med;11(9)2021 Sep 15.; Publication details: J Pers Med;11(9)2021 Sep 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20759,""
"Accidental Ixazomib Overdose in a Patient With Multiple Myeloma","Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy. Ixazomib is the first oral proteasome inhibitor approved in the United States for the management of multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior treatment. The availability of oral chemotherapeutic agents for the management of multiple myeloma has made it easier for patients who do not have to come to the hospital for chemotherapy infusions. However, many barriers are associated with oral chemotherapy, and one of them is a misinterpretation of instruction which can have deleterious effects. In this case report, we present a case of a 69-year-old male with multiple myeloma who accidentally took ixazomib daily for 3 days instead of the weekly regimen and thus coming into the hospital with an overdose. In this report, we focus on the adverse effects associated with ixazomib toxicity and how to manage the adverse reactions. Although there is no antidote available for ixazomib, supportive care is very essential in these patients.","Sampat, Parth J; Bisen, Maneesh; Srivastava, Nimisha; Rao, Suman; Gentile, Teresa","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/23247096211013230","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep;9: 23247096211013230, 2021.; Publication details: J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep;9: 23247096211013230, 2021.; Antineoplastic Agents; Boron Compounds; Glycine/analogs & derivatives; Multiple Myeloma; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents/poisoning; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects; Boron Compounds/poisoning; Boron Compounds/therapeutic use; Drug Overdose; Glycine/poisoning; Glycine/therapeutic use; Humans; Male; Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20760,""
"Roles of Family Stress, Maltreatment, and Affect Regulation Difficulties on Adolescent Mental Health During COVID-19","This study examines the indirect effects of affect dysregulation and suppression on the associations between family stress from confinement, maltreatment, and adolescent mental health during COVID-19. We examined both adolescent and caregiver perspectives to yield a more well-rounded understanding of these associations than afforded in previous research. Using both adolescent (N = 809, Mage = 15.66) and caregiver (N = 578) samples, family stress from confinement,Â exposure to physical and psychological maltreatment, affect dysregulationÂ and suppression, and youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms were measured in the summer of 2020, following three months of stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19. Affect dysregulation partially accounted for the associations between family stress from confinement and psychological maltreatment on both internalizing and externalizing symptoms for youth and caregiver report. Suppression partially accounted for the associations between family stress and maltreatment on internalizing and externalizing symptoms in the youth sample, but only for internalizing symptoms in the caregiver sample. Understanding family predictors of adolescents' mental health concerns and their underlying mechanisms, affect dysregulation and suppression, can inform mental health interventions during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Craig, Stephanie G; Robillard, Christina L; Turner, Brianna J; Ames, Megan E","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10896-021-00320-2","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Fam Violence;: 1-13, 2021 Sep 15.; Publication details: J Fam Violence;: 1-13, 2021 Sep 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20761,""
"Fear of COVID-19, Anxiety and Depression in Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension during the Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the physical and mental health of people around the world. This may be particularly true for patients with life-threatening diseases. We analyzed the level of fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S), the prevalence of anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) in pulmonary arterial and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (PAH and CTEPH) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this multicenter prospective study, 223 patients (63% females, 66% PAH) with age range 18-90 years were included. The fear of COVID-19 was high, at a mean level of 18.9 Â± 7.4 points. Anxiety (HADS-A &#8805; 8 points) was diagnosed in 32% of all patients, depression (HADS-D &#8805; 8 points) in 21%, and anxiety or depression in 38%. FCV-19S was higher in woman and in elderly people (p = 0.02; p = 0.02, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, FCV-19S higher than the median increased the odds ratio of anxiety, but not of depression (R 6.4 (95%CI 2.0-20.0), p = 0.002; OR 1.9 (0.9-3.9), p = 0.06, respectively). History of COVID-19 increased risk of both HADS-A and HADS-D. Patients with PAH and CTEPH, especially woman over 65 years and those who had been infected with COVID-19, may need additional psychological support due to fear of COVID-19, anxiety or depression.","Wieteska-Milek, Maria; Szmit, Sebastian; Florczyk, Michal; Kusmierczyk-Droszcz, Beata; Ryczek, Robert; Dzienisiewicz, Milena; Torbicki, Adam; Kurzyna, Marcin","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm10184195","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Clin Med;10(18)2021 Sep 16.; Publication details: J Clin Med;10(18)2021 Sep 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20762,""
"Biomarkers of Post-COVID Depression","The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading around the world and 187 million people have already been affected. One of its after-effects is post-COVID depression, which, according to the latest data, affects up to 40% of people who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection. A very important issue for the mental health of the general population is to look for the causes of this complication and its biomarkers. This will help in faster diagnosis and effective treatment of the affected patients. In our work, we focused on the search for major depressive disorder (MDD) biomarkers, which are also present in COVID-19 patients and may influence the development of post-COVID depression. For this purpose, we searched PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar scientific literature databases using keywords such as 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'depression', 'post-COVID', 'biomarkers' and others. Among the biomarkers found, the most important that were frequently described are increased levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble interleukin 6 receptor (sIL-6R), interleukin 1 ÃŸ (IL-1ÃŸ), tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), interferon gamma (IFN-ÃŽÂ³), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 2 (IL-2), soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R), C-reactive protein (CRP), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), serum amyloid a (SAA1) and metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, as well as decreased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tryptophan (TRP). The biomarkers identified by us indicate the etiopathogenesis of post-COVID depression analogous to the leading inflammatory hypothesis of MDD.","Lorkiewicz, Piotr; Waszkiewicz, Napoleon","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm10184142","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Clin Med;10(18)2021 Sep 14.; Publication details: J Clin Med;10(18)2021 Sep 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20763,""

"Characterization and Identification of Variations in Types of Primary Care Visits Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Catalonia: Big Data Analysis Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the care model of health systems around the world upside down, causing the abrupt cancellation of face-to-face visits and redirection of the model toward telemedicine. Digital transformation boosts information systems-the more robust they are, the easier it is to monitor the health care system in a highly complex state and allow for more agile and reliable analysis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze diagnoses from primary care visits and distinguish between those that had higher and lower variations, relative to the 2019 and 2020 periods (roughly before and during COVID-19), to identify clinical profiles that may have been most impaired from the least-used diagnostic codes for visits during the pandemic. METHODS: We used a database from the Primary Care Services Information Technologies Information System of Catalonia. We analyzed the register of visits (n=2,824,185) and their International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnostic codes (n=3,921,974; mean 1.38 per visit), as approximations of the reasons for consultations, at 3 different grouping levels. The data were represented by a term frequency matrix and analyzed recursively in different partitions aggregated according to date. RESULTS: The increase in non-face-to-face visits (+267%) did not counterbalance the decrease in face-to-face visits (-47%), with an overall reduction in the total number of visits of 1.36%, despite the notable increase in nursing visits (10.54%). The largest increases in 2020 were visits with diagnoses related to COVID-19 (ICD-10 codes Z20-Z29: 2.540%), along with codes related to economic and housing problems (ICD-10 codes Z55-Z65: 44.40%). Visits with most of the other diagnostic codes decreased in 2020 relative to those in 2019. The largest reductions were chronic pathologies such as arterial hypertension (ICD-10 codes I10-I16: -32.73%) or diabetes (ICD-10 codes E08-E13: -21.13%), but also obesity (E65-E68: -48.58%) and bodily injuries (ICD-10 code T14: -33.70%). Visits with mental health-related diagnostic codes decreased, but the decrease was less than the average decrease. There was a decrease in consultations-for children, adolescents, and adults-for respiratory infections (ICD-10 codes J00-J06: -40.96%). The results show large year-on-year variations (in absolute terms, an average of 12%), which is representative of the strong shock to the health system. CONCLUSIONS: The disruption in the primary care model in Catalonia has led to an explosive increase in the number of non-face-to-face visits. There has been a reduction in the number of visits for diagnoses related to chronic pathologies, respiratory infections, obesity, and bodily injuries. Instead, visits for diagnoses related to socioeconomic and housing problems have increased, which emphasizes the importance of social determinants of health in the context of this pandemic. Big data analytics with routine care data yield findings that are consistent with those derived from intuition in everyday clinical practice and can help inform decision making by health planners in order to use the next few years to focus on the least-treated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lopez Segui, Francesc; Hernandez Guillamet, Guillem; PifarrÃ© Arolas, HÃ©ctor; Marin-Gomez, Francesc X; Ruiz Comellas, Anna; Ramirez Morros, Anna Maria; Adroher Mas, Cristina; Vidal-Alaball, Josep","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29622","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e29622, 2021 09 14.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e29622, 2021 09 14.; COVID-19; Pandemics; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Data Analysis; Humans; Primary Health Care; SARS-CoV-2; Spain/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20765,""
"Overview of Technologies Implemented During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Scoping Review","BACKGROUND: Technologies have been extensively implemented to provide health care services for all types of clinical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. While several reviews have been conducted regarding technologies used during the COVID-19 pandemic, they were limited by focusing either on a specific technology (or features) or proposed rather than implemented technologies. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide an overview of technologies, as reported in the literature, implemented during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) Extension for Scoping Reviews. Studies were retrieved by searching 8 electronic databases, checking the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews (backward reference list checking), and checking studies that cited included studies (forward reference list checking). The search terms were chosen based on the target intervention (ie, technologies) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). We included English publications that focused on technologies or digital tools implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide health-related services regardless of target health condition, user, or setting. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data from eligible papers. We used a narrative approach to synthesize extracted data. RESULTS: Of 7374 retrieved papers, 126 were deemed eligible. Telemedicine was the most common type of technology (107/126, 84.9%) implemented in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the most common mode of telemedicine was synchronous (100/108, 92.6%). The most common purpose of the technologies was providing consultation (75/126, 59.5%), followed by following up with patients (45/126, 35.7%), and monitoring their health status (22/126, 17.4%). Zoom (22/126, 17.5%) and WhatsApp (12/126, 9.5%) were the most commonly used videoconferencing and social media platforms, respectively. Both health care professionals and health consumers were the most common target users (103/126, 81.7%). The health condition most frequently targeted was COVID-19 (38/126, 30.2%), followed by any physical health conditions (21/126, 16.7%), and mental health conditions (13/126, 10.3%). Technologies were web-based in 84.1% of the studies (106/126). Technologies could be used through 11 modes, and the most common were mobile apps (86/126, 68.3%), desktop apps (73/126, 57.9%), telephone calls (49/126, 38.9%), and websites (45/126, 35.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Technologies played a crucial role in mitigating the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We did not find papers describing the implementation of other technologies (eg, contact-tracing apps, drones, blockchain) during the first wave. Furthermore, technologies in this review were used for other purposes (eg, drugs and vaccines discovery, social distancing, and immunity passport). Future research on studies on these technologies and purposes is recommended, and further reviews are required to investigate technologies implemented in subsequent waves of the pandemic.","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Hassan, Asmaa; Abuelezz, Israa; Ahmed, Arfan; Alzubaidi, Mahmood Saleh; Shah, Uzair; Alhuwail, Dari; Giannicchi, Anna; Househ, Mowafa","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29136","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e29136, 2021 09 14.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e29136, 2021 09 14.; COVID-19; Telemedicine; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Technology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20766,""
"Perceptions and Feelings of Brazilian Health Care Professionals Regarding the Effects of COVID-19: Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey","BACKGROUND: The importance of health professionals has been recognized in COVID-19 pandemic-affected countries, especially in those such as Brazil, which is one of the top 3 countries that have been affected in the world. However, the workers' perception of the stress and the changes that the pandemic has caused in their lives vary according to the conditions offered by these affected countries, including salaries, individual protection equipment, and psychological support. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the perceptions of Brazilian health workers regarding the COVID-19 pandemic impact on their lives, including possible self-contamination and mental health. METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in Brazil by applying a 32-item questionnaire, including multiple-choice questions by using the Google Forms electronic assessment. This study was designed to capture spontaneous perceptions from health professionals. All questions were mandatory and divided into 2 blocks with different proposals: personal profile and COVID-19 pandemic impact. RESULTS: We interviewed Brazilian health professionals from all 5 Brazilian regions (N=1376). Our study revealed that 1 in 5 (23%) complained about inadequate personal protective equipment, including face shields (234/1376, 17.0%), masks (206/1376, 14.9%), and laboratory coats (138/1376, 10.0%), whereas 1 in 4 health professionals did not have enough information to protect themselves from the coronavirus disease. These professionals had anxiety due to COVID-19 (604/1376, 43.9%), difficulties in sleep (593/1376, 43.1%), and concentrating on work (453/1376, 32.9%). Almost one-third experienced traumatic situations at work (385/1376, 28.0%), which may have led to negative feelings of fear of COVID-19 and sadness. Despite this situation, there was hope and empathy among their positive feelings. The survey also showed that 1 in 5 acquired COVID-19 with the most classic and minor symptoms, including headache (274/315, 87.0%), body pain (231/315, 73.3%), tiredness (228/315, 72.4%), and loss of taste and smell (208/315, 66.0%). Some of their negative feelings were higher than those of noninfected professionals (fear of COVID-19, 243/315, 77.1% vs 509/1061, 48.0%; impotence, 142/315, 45.1% vs 297/1061, 28.0%; and fault, 38/315, 12.1% vs 567/1061, 53.4%, respectively). Another worrying outcome was that 61.3% (193/315) reported acquiring an infection while working at a health facility and as expected, most of the respondents felt affected (344/1376, 25.0%) or very affected (619/1376, 45.0%) by the COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, the health professionals were exposed to a stressful situation and to the risk of self-contamination-conditions that can spell future psychological problems for these workers. Our survey findings showed that the psychological support for this group should be included in the future health planning of Brazil and of other hugely affected countries to assure a good mental health condition for the medical teams in the near future.","CorrÃªa, Roberta Pires; Castro, Helena Carla; Quaresma, Bruna Maria Castro SalomÃ£o; Stephens, Paulo Roberto Soares; Araujo-Jorge, Tania Cremonini; Ferreira, Roberto Rodrigues","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/28088","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(10): e28088, 2021 Oct 22.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(10): e28088, 2021 Oct 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20767,""

"Which resources help young people to prevent and overcome mental distress in deprived urban areas in Latin America? A protocol for a prospective cohort study","INTRODUCTION: Improving the mental health of young people is a global public health priority. In Latin America, young people living in deprived urban areas face various risk factors for mental distress. However, most either do not develop mental distress in the form of depression and anxiety, or recover within a year without treatment from mental health services. This research programme seeks to identify the personal and social resources that help young people to prevent and recover from mental distress. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cross-sectional study will compare personal and social resources used by 1020 young people (aged 15-16 and 20-24 years) with symptoms of depression and/or anxiety and 1020 without. A longitudinal cohort study will follow-up young people with mental distress after 6 months and 1 year and compare resource use in those who do and do not recover. An experience sampling method study will intensively assess activities, experiences and mental distress in subgroups over short time periods. Finally, we will develop case studies highlighting existing initiatives that effectively support young people to prevent and recover from mental distress. The analysis will assess differences between young people with and without distress at baseline using t-tests and &#967;2 tests. Within the groups with mental distress, multivariate logistic regression analyses using a random effects model will assess the relationship between predictor variables and recovery.

"Children's and adolescents' experiences with functional abdominal pain: a qualitative study in Norway","OBJECTIVE: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common during childhood and adolescence. When a somatic diagnosis is excluded, the healthcare system often terminates contact with the patient. The aim of the present study was to learn more about children's and adolescents' experiences with, and reflections on, the causes of their abdominal pain and what could possibly help them. DESIGN: The study has a qualitative design. Interviews with open questions were carried out by the first author. The conversations were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed by means of qualitative content analysis. SETTING: Children and adolescents referred from general practitioners located in urban and rural regions in two municipals in Norway. In 2016 and 2019, we had interviewed these children's parents about their child's abdominal pain. In spring 2020, the children and adolescents were interviewed. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve children and adolescents aged 10-18 years with FGIDs. RESULTS: Eight of the children and adolescents had recovered from their abdominal pain, while four still had symptoms. They felt frustrated by not having a diagnosis and by the lack of available treatment. Some who had been absent from school for weeks to months felt isolated and depressed. Focusing on positive thoughts and activities was reported to improve the pain. The abdominal pain could be considered a manifestation of mental problems. CONCLUSIONS: Thinking differently about the symptoms reduced the FGIDs for the children and adolescents. The treating physicians as well as parents and teachers need to help the child focus on changing the mindset of pain.","Brodwall, Anne; Brekke, Mette","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048949","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e048949, 2021 Sep 13.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e048949, 2021 Sep 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20770,""
"Airborne infection risks of SARS-CoV-2 in US schools and impacts of different intervention strategies","The potential airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has triggered concerns as schools continue to reopen and resume in-person instruction during the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is critical to understand the risks of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission under different epidemiological scenarios and operation strategies for schools to make informed decisions to mitigate infection risk. Through scenario-based analysis, this study estimates the airborne infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 in 111,485 U.S. public and private schools and evaluates the impacts of different intervention strategies, including increased ventilation, air filtration, and hybrid learning. Schools in more than 90% of counties exhibit infection risk of higher than 1%, indicating the significance of implementing intervention strategies. Among the considered strategies, air filtration is found to be most effective: the school average infection risk when applying MERV 13 is over 30% less than the risk levels correlating with the use of increased ventilation and hybrid learning strategies, respectively. For most schools, it is necessary to adopt combined intervention strategies to ensure the infection risk below 1%. The results provide insights into airborne infection risk in schools under various scenarios and may guide schools and policymakers in developing effective operations strategies to maintain environmental health.","Xu, Yifang; Cai, Jiannan; Li, Shuai; He, Qiang; Zhu, Siyao","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103188","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sustain Cities Soc;74: 103188, 2021 Nov.; Publication details: Sustain Cities Soc;74: 103188, 2021 Nov.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20771,""
"Connections Before Curriculum: The Role of Social Presence During COVID-19 Emergency Remote Learning for Students","This study examined the student experience (n=507) during emergency remote learning at a medium-sized private southeastern university during the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging the Social Presence Model (SPM) as a guiding framework. Tensions were high at this critical time as students were stressed with financial burdens, supply shortages, overlapping work and educational schedules, and shared technological resources and physical spaces. Therefore, this study helps educators better understand students' emotional needs and experiences during the March 2020 lockdown transition to remote learning. Specifically, examining the student experience in a time of crisis offers critical lessons about the importance of connectedness, online readiness, cultivating relationships, adaptability during transitions, and class interaction. The data revealed the depth of anxiety felt by students and suggests the need for increased empathy, communication, interaction, and flexibility from their instructor and course community to proceed with academic coursework, particularly for first-year college students. The findings elevate the importance of social presence as a literacy for learning in any modality, underscore the need to support the mental health of our students, and stress the urgency for online and remote learning readiness for current and future public emergencies.","Ensmann, S.; Whiteside, A.; Gomez-Vasquez, L.; Sturgill, R.","https://doi.org/10.24059/olj.v25i3.2868","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Online Learning; 25(3):36-56, 2021.; Publication details: Online Learning; 25(3):36-56, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20772,""
"Impact of coronavirus disease-19 lockdown on psychological and mental health status among residents of Delhi-National Capital Region","Aim and Objectives: The present study was taken to find the impact of social lockdown on the psychological and mental health of the participants and to find out the differences between different sex, age groups, and occupations.

"Young Peopleâ€™s Rights and Mental Health During a Pandemic: An Analysis of the Impact of Emergency Legislation in Scotland","Emerging evidence indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic and government measures put in place in response to this have had a detrimental impact on young peopleâ€™s mental health. A childrenâ€™s human rights-based approach was taken to examine the impact of the legislative and policy measures that were implemented in Scotland in response to the pandemic on childrenâ€™s rights related to their mental health. Key concerns were identified around childrenâ€™s rights to access mental health services and information, participation in decision-making and non-discrimination of vulnerable groups. Although the analysis focussed on Scotland, recommendations to protect these rights are likely to be relevant to other countries following similar approaches as lockdown restrictions are eased, or in the event that stricter local or national measures are required again to curb rising infection rates or subsequent wave(s).","McMellon, Christina, MacLachlan, A.","https://doi.org/10.1177/11033088211032783","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Young : Nordic Journal of Youth Research; 29(4_suppl):S11-S34, 2021.; Publication details: Young : Nordic Journal of Youth Research; 29(4_suppl):S11-S34, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20774,""
"In-Situ exploration of emotion regulation via smart clothing: an empirical study of healthcare workers in their work environment","Healthcare personnel suffer from an increased risk of stress, burnout, and depression due to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies show that interactive smart textiles help people alleviate their emotions. In this research, we investigate how to utilise interactive textiles to help healthcare workers mitigate their negative feelings. We have designed a smart t-shirt that encourages its wearers to perform body movements to enhance their positive emotions, stimulated by vibrotactile and audio feedback mechanisms. We demonstrate our smart t-shirtâ€™s utility by asking healthcare workers (including physicians and nurses) to use it for five consecutive days. Our prototype design supports using it anywhere, including work, home, and other places. We evaluated our smart t-shirt prototype for emotion regulations at work for healthcare workers through an in-situ user study conducted at three hospitals. Results show that using the smart t-shirt positively impacts the healthcare workersâ€™ immediate emotion regulation when they experienced emotion fluctuation and provided a more positive attitude towards their work. We conclude by analysing the potential factors that influence emotions and outline the design space of e-textiles for emotion regulation in real-life use.

"Impact of covid-19 pandemic on well-being and mental health of business community","People around the world of developing countries have faced severe issues during this long pandemic outbreak, and harshly affected mentally, economically and socially. Financial pondering and worries have caused serious psychological and mental health problems among the people whatever is their income. Well-being and metal health of business community are the target constructs of this article to be discussed. The present study was aimed to investigate the demographical backgrounds in relationship to well-being, mental effects and financial causes. An online self-administered data was collected from a sample of population (n=100) in Timergara, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. We developed a study with psychometric properties of major scales included well-being, impact event on depression anxiety stress scale (DASS). The event impact was significantly, and negatively associated with wellbeing (r = -.43, p&lt;.01), and positively associated with stress (r = .60, p&lt;.01), anxiety (r = .60, p&lt;.01) and depression (r = .58, p&lt;.01).

"COVID-19 and the Paradox of Visibility: Domestic Violence and Feminist Caring Labor in Canadian Shelters","[...]anti-violence organizations are once again being pushed into an alliance with the state, which, as Bumiller's historical analysis suggests, comes with consequences that require critical consideration and investigation.10 COVID-19 AND THE HYPERVISIBILITY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE The hypervisibility of domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic is directly related to the advent of the home as a space vital to maintaining the health of the population and the paradox this creates for abused women. The isolation of victims with abusers, combined with sudden surges in unemployment, income loss, and mental health conditions are all factors experts consistently link to increasing an abused woman's risk of serious injury and death.11 The heightened and long overdue concern for the realities of domestic violence victims have now become regular features in Canadian government and media discourse, particularly since the April 2020 mass shooting in Nova Scotia, which is being linked in part to the shooter's misogyny and history of violence against women.12 The recognition that efforts to fight the pandemic are simultaneously creating a perfect storm of conditions that bolster the power and control of abusers is translating into a re-envisioning of shelter work as an essential, yet emergency service. [...]the production of domestic violence as a public health emergency grants the problem a ""curious visibility,"" one that overlooks its ""everydayness"" and the ongoing structural oppressions that fuel gender-based violence.14 The result is the continued obscuring of feminist caring labor as a critical form of intervention under ""normal"" conditions and its contemporary construction as an emergency, rather than essential service, in government discourse. [...]some shelters are full and have been unable to accept new referrals.20 Melpa Kamateros, an executive director of a shelter in Montreal, Quebec, explained that while limited shelter space is not a new problem, physical distancing measures have prevented shelters from opening extra spaces, which has created ""a vicious cycle"" of increasing referrals and declining capacity to accommodate.21 Following public health guidelines of physical distancing can","Quinlan, Andrea, Singh, Rashmee","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+and+the+Paradox+of+Visibility:+Domestic+Violence+and+Feminist+Caring+Labor+in+Canadian+Shelters","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Feminist Studies; 46(3):572-582,744,746, 2020.; Publication details: Feminist Studies; 46(3):572-582,744,746, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20777,""

Aim: The current study aimed at measuring the level of burnout among Jordanian nurses and physicians working in King Abdullah University Hospital, north of Jordan. Method: The study adopted the quantitative research approach through performing a crosssectional descriptive study. A convenient sample of 124 physicians and nurses was recruited in this study. The Oldenburg Burnout Inventory developed by Demerouti E and co-authors, (2003) and consists of (16 items) was used as a data collection tool in this study. Results: The results of the study showed that the level of burnout among Jordanian nurses and physicians working in the frontline during the COVID-19 outbreak, in King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH), had a moderate level of burnout, the burnout score (2.3) was slightly higher than the cut-off value (2.25). The participants indicated they do not find their work to be a positive challenge (1.81 +/- 0.55), and they could not manage the amount of their work well (1.95 +/- 0.74). In addition, it was reported that they need more time than needed in the past to relax and feel better (1.99 +/- 0.66), and they did not find new and interesting aspects in their work during COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusion: This study reported that the level of burnout among frontline nurses and physicians during COVID-19 outbreak are significantly exposed to get higher levels of burnout, getting tired is the main prevalent aspect during this period. Further survey studies should be performed to measure the level of burnout among nurses and physicians in the frontline during COVID-19 outbreak.","Mutleq, A.; Alghazo, M.; Al-Faouri, I.; Alarsan, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=BURNOUT+AMONG+JORDANIAN+FRONTLINE+PHYSICIANS+AND+NURSES+DURING+COVID-19+OUTBREAK","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: New Armenian Medical Journal; 15(2):64-68, 2021.; Publication details: New Armenian Medical Journal; 15(2):64-68, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20779,""

"Parenting practices of Spanish families during the coronavirus lockdown period","Introduction. One of the many measures used to reduce the spread of the coronavirus pandemic was the confinement of Spanish families at home for several weeks, without school attendance or contact with people outside the nuclear family. Studies carried out worldwide show that this type of measure and the crisis context can have serious negative consequences for the mental health of children and their families, which could be mitigated by parenting practices that follow a positive parenting model. Method. 336 mothers and fathers with children aged 2 to 8 years answered a questionnaire about parenting principles (Parenting Pentagon Model) applied during the lockdown. A descriptive analysis of results from the whole sample was performed, taking into account families' sociodemographic variables that may also be moderators of the parenting practices applied. Results. According to families' responses, parenting practices during the lockdown were generally in line with indications of the positive parenting model. The most frequent parenting principles reflected were those related to unconditional love, followed by encouraging independence and adherence to rules. Slight differences were found in parenting practices in relation to the parent's or the child's sex, the parent's or child's age, and parents' educational level. Discussion and conclusions. Parents gave great importance to unconditional love over the other aspects of parenting during the lockdown, although all the principles were rated highly. This might mean that parents had a positive perception of their parenting practices during the lockdown, close to the experts' recommendations. We recommend further inquiry into family practices that are applied during periods of crisis and stress, such as the current pandemic, in order to design preventive and intervention strategies that provide all necessary support and ensure the mental health of children.","Montesino, S.

"Domestic Violence and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 lockdown, the advent of working from home, and other unprecedent events have resulted in multilayer and multidimensional impacts on our personal, social, and occupational lives. Mental health conditions are deteriorating, financial crises are increasing in prevalence, and the need to stay at home has resulted in the increased prevalence of domestic violence. In Bangladesh, where domestic violence is already prevalent, the lockdown period and stay-at-home orders could result in more opportunities and increased scope for perpetrators of domestic violence. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence and pattern of domestic violence during the initial COVID-19 lockdown period in Bangladesh and the perceptions of domestic violence survivors with regard to mental health care. METHODS: We conducted this cross-sectional web-based study among the Bangladeshi population and used a semistructured self-reported questionnaire to understand the patterns of domestic violence and perceptions on mental health care from August to September 2020. The questionnaire was disseminated on different organizational websites and social media pages (ie, those of organizations that provide mental health and domestic violence services). Data were analyzed by using IBM SPSS (version 22.0; IBM Corporation). RESULTS: We found that 36.8% (50/136) of respondents had faced domestic violence at some point in their lives; psychological abuse was the most common type of violence. However, the prevalence of the economical abuse domestic violence type increased after the COVID-19 lockdown was enforced. Although 96.3% (102/136) of the participants believed that domestic violence survivors need mental health support, only 25% (34/136) of the respondents had an idea about the mental health services that are available for domestic violence survivors in Bangladesh and how and where they could avail mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: Domestic violence is one of the most well-known stressors that have direct impacts on physical and mental health. However, the burden of domestic violence is often underreported, and its impact on mental health is neglected in Bangladesh. The burden of this problem has increased during the COVID-19 crisis, and the cry for mental health support is obvious in the country. However, it is necessary to provide information about available support services; telepsychiatry can be good option for providing immediate mental health support in a convenient and cost-effective manner.","Rashid Soron, Tanjir; Ashiq, Md Ashiqur Rahman; Al-Hakeem, Marzia; Chowdhury, Zaid Farzan; Uddin Ahmed, Helal; Afrooz Chowdhury, Chaman","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24624","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e24624, 2021 Sep 13.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e24624, 2021 Sep 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20783,""
"Education and the fourth industrial revolution: Lessons from COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted educators to rethink educational practices, especially with regard to technology. The COVID-19 pandemic is a huge challenge to education systems around the world. This Viewpoint offers guidance to teachers, institutional heads, and officials on addressing the crisis. This study investigated technology use in teaching during the COVID-19 lockdown in Malaysia, focusing on technology-based teaching methods, modifications necessitated by this new teaching style, and challenges teachers faced when using technology. Using purposive sampling, a qualitative study was undertaken with a sample of 10 English language teachers from Arabic schools in Malaysia. The results indicated that a digital leap occurred in education during the COVID-19 lockdown because teachers had to quickly adapt to a more technology-based teaching style. The challenges teachers faced included managing virtual classes, ensuring reliable Internet connections, overcoming a lack of preparedness and low digital competence, and dealing with students' mental health. Such changes in teaching methods have created new roles for teachers while also increasing their acceptance of e-learning and remote learning. The contribution of this research is to provide a holistic picture of remote education activities during the pandemic period to establish a linkage between the online teaching-learning process during the COVID-19 outbreak as to ensure the resumption of teaching-learning education as a normal course of procedure in the education system. Despite the human suffering brought by the pandemic, the new norms of education during COVID-19 generally have some pockets of excellence to drive the education into the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Cependant, jâ€™ai observÃ© que ce nouveau modÃ¨le de soins ne servait pas au mieux les intÃ©rÃªts de tous mes patients.

Ce nâ€™est pas parce quâ€™un service est offert pour un motif non urgent ou qui nâ€™engage pas le pronostic vital que ce service nâ€™est pas essentiel. Plusieurs facteurs sont susceptibles de restreindre lâ€™accÃ¨s aux soins de santÃ© des victimes de violence conjugale : les coÃ»ts, la crainte des prÃ©jugÃ©s et de la discrimination, les tactiques de contrÃ´le des partenaires violents et un faible sentiment dâ€™efficacitÃ© personnelleNote de bas de page 6Note de bas de page 7Note de bas de page 8. Les mesures dâ€™urgence qui ont dÃ» Ãªtre prises pour freiner la pandÃ©mie ont accentuÃ© la vulnÃ©rabilitÃ© Ã  la violence conjugale, en raison des crises crÃ©Ã©es par les pertes et suppressions dâ€™emplois et en raison Ã©galement de lâ€™isolement social dÃ» la distanciation physique obligatoire. MalgrÃ© lâ€™augmentation anticipÃ©e du nombre dâ€™incidents en lien avec la violence conjugale, les services dâ€™intervention dâ€™urgence ont constatÃ© une diminution du nombre de victimes qui demandent de lâ€™aide, probablement en raison de leur crainte de sâ€™exposer et dâ€™exposer leurs proches au virus et Ã©galement car elles se retrouvent coincÃ©es avec leur agresseurNote de bas de page 9.

En outre, les victimes de violence conjugale qui appartiennent Ã  des communautÃ©s ethniques marginalisÃ©es sont susceptibles dâ€™Ãªtre davantage mÃ©fiantes vis-Ã -vis des autoritÃ©s policiÃ¨res, du fait que les policiers infligent des sanctions financiÃ¨res en cas de non-respect du confinement, et ces perceptions nÃ©gatives du systÃ¨me judiciaire se traduisent souvent par une mÃ©fiance Ã  lâ€™Ã©gard des institutions mÃ©dicalesNote de bas de page 12Note de bas de page 13. Les activitÃ©s cliniques en santÃ© sexuelle et reproductive ont Ã©tÃ© maintenues pour les victimes de violence familiale, afin de repÃ©rer les dommages collatÃ©raux de lâ€™isolement social attribuable Ã  la pandÃ©mieNote de bas de page 14. Toutefois, si lâ€™accÃ¨s Ã  son fournisseur de soins chroniques est limitÃ©, une patiente victime de violence conjugale risque de ne pas vouloir se confier pour obtenir de lâ€™aide Ã  un professionnel quâ€™elle ne connaÃ®t pas. Elle peut craindre par exemple un rendez-vous prÃ©cipitÃ© et un manque de comprÃ©hension des professionnels dans les Ã©tablissements de soins aigus. De plus, elle peut se sentir coupable dâ€™accaparer le personnel des services dâ€™urgence, dÃ©jÃ  au maximum de leur capacitÃ©. Elle peut se sentir mal Ã  lâ€™aise Ã  lâ€™idÃ©e dâ€™aborder des sujets sensibles dans un cadre inconnu, surtout sur un brancard dans le couloir ou au sein dâ€™un service dâ€™urgence bruyant oÃ¹ la confidentialitÃ© est limitÃ©e. Les mÃ©decins de tous les secteurs offrant des soins aux malades chroniques devraient Ãªtre encouragÃ©s Ã  considÃ©rer leurs services comme essentiels si leurs patients risquent dâ€™Ãªtre victimes de violence en raison des mesures de confinement en place. La gestion des problÃ¨mes de santÃ© chroniques implique un suivi Ã  long terme, souvent sur plusieurs annÃ©es, ce qui crÃ©e une alliance thÃ©rapeutique entre le mÃ©decin et son patient et peut inciter ce dernier Ã  demander de lâ€™aide en temps de crise. Cette alliance est gÃ©nÃ©ralement le reflet de la qualitÃ© de la communication entre le patient et le fournisseur de soins de santÃ©, il suppose une relation personnelle et un travail de collaborationNote de bas de page 15. La relation entre patient et mÃ©decin Ã©tant au cÅ“ur de leur rÃ´le, les mÃ©decins de famille Ã©tablissent souvent des alliances de ce type avec leurs patients, grÃ¢ce Ã  une coordination globale des soins qui ne se limite pas Ã  la maladieNote de bas de page 16Note de bas de page 17. Les alliances entre patient et professionnel les plus frÃ©quentes, hors contexte de la santÃ© sexuelle ou reproductive, relÃ¨vent par exemple du traitement Ã  long terme des endocrinopathies, des maladies auto-immunes ou inflammatoires, des maladies rÃ©nales chroniques et des affections respiratoires ou cardiaquesNote de bas de page 15. Lâ€™approche que nous proposons ici est susceptible de se rÃ©vÃ©ler utile dans le contexte dâ€™une relation dÃ©jÃ  en place avec une patiente ayant confiÃ© des antÃ©cÃ©dents de violence et dâ€™abus. Dans le cadre de la restructuration des soins de santÃ© pendant la pandÃ©mie, les mÃ©decins qui connaissent des patients ayant Ã©tÃ© victimes de violence familiale devraient, dans la mesure oÃ¹ la logistique le permet, prÃ©voir au moins une consultation en personne avec chacun dâ€™eux. La plupart des mÃ©decins ont sans doute dÃ©jÃ  abordÃ© la possibilitÃ© pour leurs patients dâ€™obtenir de lâ€™aide mais, souvent, ces discussions demeurent superficielles et se limitent Ã  encourager la personne Ã  recourir aux ressources communautaires, sans compter que de nombreux mÃ©decins doivent composer avec une lourde charge de travail et ne ressentent en eux pas la confiance nÃ©cessaire pour aider ces patientsNote de bas de page 6. Pourtant, les interventions rÃ©pÃ©tÃ©es dâ€™un mÃ©decin en qui le patient a confiance, dans un environnement sÃ»r, sont opportunes et perÃ§ues favorablement par le patient, Ã  la diffÃ©rence des appels tÃ©lÃ©phoniques de suiviNote de bas de page 18. Dans ce contexte, la consultation en personne ne vise pas Ã  dÃ©celer la violence conjugale, car la patiente a dÃ©jÃ  divulguÃ© cette information, mais plutÃ´t Ã  Ã©valuer sa maladie chronique et Ã  lui offrir dâ€™Ãªtre mis en relation avec des ressources spÃ©cialisÃ©es en violence conjugale durant lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie et la crise sanitaire psychosociale. Si la personne a besoin dâ€™un plan de protection, le mÃ©decin doit demeurer conscient des limites de son expertise en matiÃ¨re de violence conjugale et juger de la pertinence de communiquer avec dâ€™autres professionnels. Depuis le dÃ©but de la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19, de nombreux Ã©tablissements ont mis en place une Ã©quipe de soutien social en cas de crise, que les travailleurs de la santÃ© qui ont besoin de conseils et dâ€™expertise peuvent consulter pour aider leurs patients. Voici quelques conseils pratiques et des exemples de points Ã  aborder pendant lâ€™Ã©valuation en personne avec une victime de violence conjugale : * Pour vos patients qui maÃ®trisent mal la technologie ou qui ont un accÃ¨s limitÃ© Ã  un ordinateur, prÃ©voyez du temps pendant la rencontre pour leur fournir lâ€™adresse de lâ€™hÃ´pital et des refuges les plus proches de leur domicile ainsi que dâ€™autres ressources telles que les centres culturels communautaires. Imprimez leur au besoin des cartes de ces emplacements. Veillez Ã  leur fournir des donnÃ©es Ã  jour sur ces ressources et Ã  leur indiquer tout changement opÃ©rationnel/organisationnel en lien avec la pandÃ©mie. * Lors de la planification du prochain rendez-vous de suivi,demandez Ã  votre patiente quel est le meilleur moment pour lâ€™appeler afin quâ€™elle soit seule pour discuter de ses problÃ¨mes de santÃ©. * Dans les Ã©tablissements oÃ¹ les notes mÃ©dicales sont encore manuscrites, assurez-vous que le scÃ©nario de protection Ã©tabli avec votre patiente soit retranscrit en format Ã©lectronique et comprÃ©hensible pour tout professionnel de la santÃ© au cas oÃ¹ elle doive se prÃ©senter aux urgences. Cela permet aussi de garantir Ã  la patiente quâ€™elle nâ€™aura pas Ã  fournir de longues explications lors du triage, surtout si son agresseur lâ€™accompagne. * PrÃ©cisez Ã  votre patiente la date et lâ€™endroit exact dans les dossiers oÃ¹ le scÃ©nario de protection est classÃ©. Elle pourra ainsi le signaler discrÃ¨tement et rapidement au personnel de triage. * VÃ©rifiez la liste des rendez-vous annulÃ©s et celle des patients qui ne se sont pas prÃ©sentÃ©s Ã  un rendez-vous, afin de vous assurer que ces derniers nâ€™ont pas Ã©tÃ© retirÃ©s de la liste dâ€™attente Ã  votre insu. En effet, certains Ã©tablissements autorisent un nombre limitÃ© dâ€™annulations, de rendez-vous manquÃ©s ou de tentatives de report, Ã  la suite de quoi ils suppriment automatiquement la personne des listes. * Ã‰vitez de dÃ©crire ces patientes comme victimes de violence conjugale Ã  votre personnel administratif. De nombreuses personnes concernÃ©es par cette situation ne dÃ©sirent pas ce type dâ€™Ã©tiquette, et de multiples raisons peuvent justifier par ailleurs une consultation en personne, comme la nÃ©cessitÃ© dâ€™un examen physique si on dÃ©cÃ¨le un signal dâ€™alarme lors dâ€™un entretien en tÃ©lÃ©santÃ© (comme, en neurologie, une perte de vision transitoire accompagnÃ©e dâ€™un mal de tÃªte). Il nâ€™est donc pas nÃ©cessaire de prÃ©ciser au personnel non mÃ©dical et au personnel non impliquÃ© dans le plan de soins dâ€™un patient la raison dâ€™une visite confidentielle. AprÃ¨s cette consultation en personne, le mÃ©decin va pouvoir dÃ©cider de la frÃ©quence du suivi mÃ©dical et de ses modalitÃ©s. Toutefois, si le maintien du contact avec une patiente relÃ¨ve du contexte de violence familiale, il serait pertinent dâ€™orienter celle-ci vers des experts en violence conjugale, plus Ã  mÃªme de faire valoir la nÃ©cessitÃ© de soins. Si la patiente et le mÃ©decin prÃ©fÃ¨rent poursuivre les soins en tÃ©lÃ©santÃ©, le mÃ©decin peut envoyer une lettre Ã  la patiente avec une date provisoire de rendez-vous en personne aprÃ¨s la pandÃ©mie. La patiente peut placer cette lettre bien en vue, pour rappeler Ã  tous les membres du foyer quâ€™elle est suivie par un professionnel de la santÃ© qui compte Ã©valuer son bien-Ãªtre et procÃ©der Ã  un examen aprÃ¨s la pandÃ©mie. Selon Mechanic et SchlesingerNote de bas de page 19, Â« le succÃ¨s des soins mÃ©dicaux dÃ©pend avant tout de la confiance des patients envers le fait que leurs mÃ©decins [â€¦] accordent la plus haute prioritÃ© au bien-Ãªtre de leurs patients Â». Comme il faudra probablement du temps aux autoritÃ©s de santÃ© publique pour mettre en place des initiatives visant Ã  rÃ©duire les rÃ©percussions sexospÃ©cifiques de la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19, nous devons veiller Ã  ce que nos populations de patients vulnÃ©rables ne soient pas nÃ©gligÃ©esNote de bas de page 20. MalgrÃ© les dÃ©fis Ã©thiques posÃ©s par les mesures dâ€™urgence liÃ©es Ã  la COVID-19 et la recherche dâ€™un Ã©quilibre entre sÃ©curitÃ© publique et soins axÃ©s sur le patient, nous devons reconnaÃ®tre les situations oÃ¹ nous sommes appelÃ©s Ã  prendre la dÃ©fense de nos patients, en particulier de ceux qui ne le font pas ou ne sont pas en Ã©tat de le faire. En tant que fournisseurs de soins de premiÃ¨re ligne, nous devons exposer notre point de vue aux autoritÃ©s de santÃ© publique, notamment en ce qui concerne les facteurs principaux susceptibles dâ€™influencer la dÃ©cision dâ€™offrir des consultations en personne pendant la pandÃ©mie. Ces facteurs vont souvent au-delÃ  des questions pratiques habituelles sur la nÃ©cessitÃ© dâ€™un examen physique ou la facilitÃ© dâ€™accÃ¨s dâ€™un patient Ã  la technologie requise pour les soins virtuels. Dans cet article, je tiens Ã  souligner lâ€™importance de maintenir un contact mÃ©dical, en particulier une consultation en personne dans la mesure du possible, avec les victimes de violence conjugale ayant dÃ©jÃ  rÃ©vÃ©lÃ© subir des actes violents. Ce contact est particuliÃ¨rement prÃ©cieux lorsquâ€™une alliance thÃ©rapeutique a Ã©tÃ© Ã©tablie avec une patiente, par exemple au fil de la prise en charge dâ€™une maladie chronique. Bien que cet article soit rÃ©digÃ© du point de vue dâ€™une pratique en mÃ©decine des cÃ©phalÃ©es, les questions quâ€™il soulÃ¨ve sont applicables plus largement, au-delÃ  de la spÃ©cialitÃ© de la clinique, de la rÃ©partition par sexe des patients ou du manque de personnel dÃ» au redÃ©ploiement occasionnÃ© par la COVID-19. Les mÃ©decins qui travaillent dans les secteurs non essentiels Ã  lâ€™intervention directe contre la COVID-19 et dont les activitÃ©s cliniques ont Ã©tÃ© modifiÃ©es devraient envisager de maintenir leurs services en tant que soins essentiels pour ce groupe de patients. Comme de nombreux services sociaux communautaires enregistrent une augmentation importante des dÃ©lais dâ€™attente, il est important de rester flexible envers nos patients. En outre, le mÃ©decin traitant du patient doit participer, si le patient y consent, au plan de soins. Il nâ€™est cependant pas rare que le clinicien responsable du traitement dâ€™une maladie chronique, en particulier en cas de maladies complexes de niveau tertiaire, ait une alliance thÃ©rapeutique plus forte avec le patient en raison des contacts mÃ©dicaux frÃ©quents que cela implique. Enfin, dans le cadre de lâ€™amÃ©lioration souhaitÃ©e par les autoritÃ©s de santÃ© publique en matiÃ¨re de restructuration des soins de santÃ© durant la pandÃ©mie, les mÃ©decins sont invitÃ©s Ã  collaborer avec dâ€™autres Ã©quipes institutionnelles spÃ©cialisÃ©es lorsque leur expertise sâ€™avÃ¨re limitÃ©e, en particulier avec le personnel psychosocial, dans le but dâ€™aider les populations marginalisÃ©es et vulnÃ©rables. Cette collaboration peut sâ€™avÃ©rer particuliÃ¨rement profitable aux victimes de violence conjugale, dans la mesure oÃ¹ un scÃ©nario de protection bien conÃ§u tient compte de la dynamique complexe des situations dâ€™abus, au-delÃ  de lâ€™expÃ©rience de la violence.

"Physical activity as protective factor against COVID-19 disease","The Coronavirus Pandemic has forced millions of people around the world to look at home. This resulted, as a consequence, in a remodelling of the lifestyle;in this scenario the correct nutrition combined with regular physical activity becomes fundamental for health. Although the sedentary lifestyle of a few weeks involves risks such as lowering the immune system, it favours overweight and obesity, high blood pressure, metabolic disorders, depression and anxiety, and in some subjects they react to the risk of onset of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other diseases. The importance of healthy lifestyle is crucial to prevent also viral infection. Indeed, as reported by many data literature, during lung infections, IL-6 and TNF-a create the pathway between adipose tissue and lung system demonstrating the important involvement of adipose tissue in lung diseases. In obese condition, adipose tissue endocrine function is altered. There is an imbalance in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-a and anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10. In the light of these evidences, the immune response is influenced by nutritional status and by physical activity which are able to reduce pro-inflammatory mediators and increase anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10. In addition, the power of viral infection is influenced by host predisposition. For these reasons, a correct lifestyle, and physical activity are a valid strategy in the prevention and treatment of not metabolic diseases also of inflammatory diseases Â© Faculty of Education.

"Facilitating the employment of people with mental health diffi culties in Ireland","The promotion of practices supporting positive mental health at work is increasingly important on employers' agendas. However, within the HRM literature there is a relative dearth of research on how employers can facilitate reintegration into the workplace or first-time employment for employees with mental health issues. Publicly funded supports are emerging as a strategy that can provide targeted supports to both workers and employers. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of this approach by undertaking triadic research with employers, healthcare professionals, and workers using the service in the Irish context. We make recommendations regarding the enhancement of opportunities currently available to those with a mental health difficulty to return to and remain in employment. The paper contributes to our understanding of the nature of supports required to successfully facilitate employing or re-integrating those with a mental health disability or history of mental health problems into the workplace.","Tighe, Margaret, Murphy, Caroline","https://doi.org/10.2478/ijm-2021-0003","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Irish Journal of Management; 40(1):13-26, 2021.; Publication details: Irish Journal of Management; 40(1):13-26, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20787,""
"The Effects of COVID-19 Lockdown on Health and Psychosocial Functioning in Older Adults Aged 70 and Over","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a state-imposed lockdown in the UK;there are many psychosocial consequences of pandemics, with older adults potentially at an increased risk. The current study assessed psychosocial functioning in a sample of older adults in the UK with baseline data collected pre-lockdown and follow-up 12 weeks later during lockdown. Thus, allowing investigation of the effect of COVID-19 and associated lockdown on psychosocial well-being. Thirty-five older adults (Mean age = 76.06, sex = 12 males) participated in this repeated measures study. A final follow-up was then conducted post-lockdown to capture any factors that were viewed as helpful to well-being during lockdown. From pre- to during lockdown, perceived stress, well-being, depressive symptoms, mood disturbance and memory were all significantly worsened. There were significant improvements in self-reported physical health symptoms, social interaction, time spent engaging in physical activity and certain aspects of relationship quality. Follow-up showed that well-being, depression and mood were still negatively affected post-lockdown. Given the sample were all â€˜healthyâ€™ at baseline in comparison to established norms, there may be greater impairment in more vulnerable populations. Support for older populations is needed to mitigate the negative effects shown, particularly in light of the endurance of some of these effects post-lockdown.

"International Survey on the Use of Emerging Technologies Among Forensic and Correctional Mental Health Professionals","Although the global diffusion of e-mental health has increased in recent years, research on the use of technologies in criminal justice settings is limited. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted an international online survey (N = 555) of forensic and correctional mental health professionals from Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and 20 additional countries. Telecommunication technologies and mental health platforms had the highest numbers of users, the broadest scope, and the largest increase in use due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In contrast, the use of social media and advanced technologies was lower, narrower in scope, and remained the same or decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondentsâ€™ age, professional discipline, country, and clinical setting significantly predicted total technology use in clinical practice.

We measured the study-related burnout of college students during that period and compared it with previous related researches. The study found that there was no significant change in the study-related burnout between online education and offline education. However, the new online teaching mode still caused some new problems in the different groups. The overall level of burnout of girls was almost equal to that of boys, and the score girls have in the dimension of emotionally depressing was higher. The burnout level of freshmen was the highest among the four grades which indicated that online education might hinder their understanding of professional knowledge. The burnout level of rural students was higher than that of urban students. In order to effectively reduce the study-related burnout level of college students receiving online education, game-based teaching provides a solution. At the same time, the equipment and network problems of students in rural areas can not be ignored.

"Delivering well-being through the coronavirus pandemic: the role of human resources (HR) in managing a healthy workforce","Purpose: This paper examines how human resources (HR) professionals in the UK have supported employee wellbeing during the coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic. It considers the extent to which HR professionals were prepared for the crisis and their readiness in supporting the wellbeing of their people. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 senior HR professionals working across the public and private sectors in the UK. Using an in-depth interview structure, the research explored how respondents both reacted to and managed the crisis in their respective organisations. Template analysis was used to analyse the data allowing a certain degree of fluidity in the establishment of ordered relationships between the themes. Findings: This study finds that business continuity plans turned out to be useless during the pandemic because they focussed on data, not people. It highlights the tension between home-working and burn-out as online presenteeism increased due to staff changing their behaviour in response to self-surveillance. The paper emphasises the importance of soft skills and authentic leadership and the tensions in respect of equity. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted with HR professionals in the UK, not internationally. Although the sample did include HR professionals from across the public, private and third sectors, the experience may not be representative of all those working in HR. Originality/value: This research found that those organisations that had engaged in business continuity planning prior to the pandemic focussed on the retrieval and accessibility of data rather than people. This prioritises staff as a resource rather than emphasising people as an organisation's most valuable asset. Furthermore, the study found that staff worked harder and for longer periods of time as a consequence of self-imposed surveillance. Organisational responses were contradictory as despite implementing well-being strategies to promote physical and mental health, there was little evidence of an effective response to this online presenteeism.

"An organizational analysis of how managers must understand the mental health impact of teleworking during COVID-19 on employees","Purpose: The unimagined workplace disturbance caused by the Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has made many organizations virtual or telework driven workplaces, often without the infrastructure and systems in place to support employees facing these sudden workplace changes (Burrell, 2020). Many stressors accompanied this transition, to include lack of childcare, home-school responsibilities and layoffs and business closings. These stressors have perpetuated concerns for the job and financial security for all workers (Fox, 2020), leading some employees to struggle with the work-life balance out of concern for being laid off due to perceived low productivity (Fox, 2020). This study aims to explore those manifestations. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research case study explores the impact COVID-19 induced telework has on their job satisfaction, mental well-being and aspects of organizational commitment to fill a gap in the literature concerning emerging workplace dynamics due to COVID-19 for small real estate businesses in the USA. Findings: The results of this qualitative research case study provide knowledge and information about the need for small businesses to be resourceful and resilient in the way that they support and engage remote workers. This qualitative research case study explores the impact COVID-19-induced telework has on their job satisfaction, mental well-being and aspects of organizational commitment for small real estate businesses. The analysis of current work-life structures through a qualitative lens provides trends among workers to gain a greater perspective of the current accelerators and barriers to worker success in a COVID-19 teleworking environment. Originality/value: This qualitative research case study explores the impact COVID-19 induced telework has on their job satisfaction, mental well-being and aspects of organizational commitment to fill a gap in the literature concerning emerging workplace dynamics due to COVID-19 for small real estate businesses. The value of this research is that majority of the participants were African-Americans, which represents a participant group that is highly under researched.

"Decoding the global trend of â€œvaccine tourismâ€ through public sentiments and emotions: does it get a nod on Twitter?","Purpose: This paper aims to fill the major research gap prevalent in the tourism literature on the new form of tourism branching out from the COVID-19. While there are newspaper reports mentioning about the governmentâ€™s reaction to vaccine tourism, there is no such study or report that tries to understand what the global masses feel about it;thus, a preliminary investigation of the social sentiment and emotion accruing around vaccine tourism on Twitter is carried out. Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study serves as a preliminary investigation of the social sentiment and emotion accruing around vaccine tourism on Twitter and tries to categorise them into eight basic emotions from Plutchik (1994) â€œwheel of emotionsâ€ as joy, disgust, fear, anger, anticipation, sadness, trust and surprise. The results are presented through data visualisation technique for analysis. The study makes use of R programming languages and the extensive packages offered on RStudio. Findings: A total of 12,258 emotions were captured. It is evident that Vaccine Tourism has got maximum of positive sentiments (28.14%) which is almost double of the negative sentiment (14.05%). It is visible that the highest sentiment is â€œtrustâ€ (12.74%) and is followed by â€œfearâ€ (8.97%). The least visible sentiment is â€œsurpriseâ€ (4.32%). Polarity has been found for maximum tweets as positive (55.52%) which yet again surpasses negative polarity (33.7%), and neutral polarity is the least (10.67%). Research limitations/implications: It can be said that people bear a positive emotion regarding vaccine tourism such as â€œtrustâ€ and â€œjoyâ€ which also denotes a positive sentiment score for testing polarity. But there are still concerns of high prices of the packages, fear-prevalent people to step out, and the uncertainty of right precautionary measures being taken still puts vaccine tourism under the radar of doubt with a fourth population having negative and neutral sentiments each. This is indicative with â€œfearâ€ being the second highest emotion to the users. There are mixed emotions for vaccine tourism, but positive dominates the results. Practical implications: The study attempts to see the global reaction on social media on vaccine tourism trend for giving food for thought to marketers. It can be said that Asians can be the target group. Originality/value: To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, there is no study that addresses the new trend of â€œVaccine Tourismâ€ or attempts to understand the emotions and sentiments of people globally.

"Dangerous liaisons? Applying the social harm perspective to the social inequality, housing and health trifecta during the Covid-19 pandemic","Global rates of excess mortality attributable to the Covid-19 pandemic provide a fresh impetus to make sense of the associations between income inequality, housing inequality and the social gradient in health, suggesting new questions about the ways in which housing and health are treated in the framing and development of public policy. The first half of the paper uses a social harm lens to examine the threefold associations of the social inequality, housing and health trifecta and offers new insights for policy analysis which foregrounds the production, transmission, and experience of various types of harm which occur within the home. The main body of the paper then draws upon the outcomes of an international systematic literature mapping review of 213 Covid-19 research papers to demonstrate three specific harms associated with stay-at-home lockdowns: (i) intimate partner and domestic violence, (ii) poor mental health and (iii) health harming behaviours. The reported findings are interpreted using a social harm perspective and some implications for policy analysis are illustrated. The paper concludes with a reflection on the efficacy of social harm as a lens for policy analysis and suggests directions for further research in housing studies and zemiology.

"Trends in Substance Use in Two United States Communities during Early COVID-19 Lockdowns Based on Wastewater Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic provoked community anxiety and stress-related disorders and increased drug-related emergency admissions and overdose deaths. The unprecedented disruption in transportation and stay-at-home orders caused a global disruption in the supply and distribution of drugs that impacted both prescription and illicit drug users. In this study, the trend in consuming 10 major illegal drugs and 19 prescription drugs of potential abuse was determined during the early four months of the COVID-19 pandemic in two communities in western Kentucky and northern Tennessee using wastewater-based epidemiology. The hydrocodone consumption rate increased by 72% (up to 430 mg/d/1000 people) in both communities that aligned with convenient opioid access through teleprescription-approved refills. However, a limited supply and a consequent increase in the cost of drugs significantly curtailed the consumption of illicit stimulants (methamphetamine, 16%;cocaine, 42%). Moreover, the increased use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants suggests elevated community anxiety that overall warrants robust neuropsychiatric screening and treatment programs. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to determine trends in consumption of diverse illicit and prescription drugs during the stay-at-home early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in United States communities.

"Editorial: How ai can help developing countries post covid-19","The onslaught of COVID-19 has hit the developing world with ferocity, India being the most recent example. To that end, some pundits argue that the impact of the pandemic will result in the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression. Preliminary estimates suggest that the plague could cost the global economy nearly $11 trillion over the next several years. This downturn will have a disproportionate impact on developing countries since they have fewer resources, including infrastructure and access to the new COVID-19 vaccines, to address this dual economic and health threat.

"A qualitative assessment of psycho-educational videos for frontline COVID-19 healthcare workers in Mexico; EvaluaciÃ³n cualitativa de videos psicoeducativos para personal de salud de primera lÃ­nea ante el COVID-19 en MÃ©xico","Abstract  Introduction Frontline COVID-19 healthcare workers (FLHCWs) are at a high-risk of suffering occupational stress- and trauma-related mental health problems, including burnout and compassion fatigue (B&CF). Given the time limitations (due to their heavy workloads) and need to minimize face-to-face interventions (in order to avoid contagions), psychological interventions for FHCWs should be as brief and remote as possible.  Objective To evaluate the usability and clarity of evidence-based psycho-educational videos to prevent B&CF, to deal with uncooperative, hostile, and anxious patients and relatives, and to use personal protective equipment (PPE), from the perspective of Mexican FLHCWs.  Method Based on a convenience sampling by intensity approach, videos were distributed requesting feedback based on specific questions through WhatsApp to FLHCWs. Field notes were used to triangulate the information.  Results Content analysis of feedback from a final sample of 24 participants &#8210;75% women, 42 Â± 8.4 years old&#8210; yielded three general thematic categories and seven subthemes: 1. content evaluation, which included three subthemes: utility, pertinence, and practicality; 2. dissemination and other needs, with two subcategories: willingness to share and receive more videos (other needs); and 3. format aspects, also comprising two subthemes: attractiveness and duration. All participants found the videos content very beneficial, relevant, and applicable to the workplace and even in their everyday personal and family life, and were willing to share them and to receive more videos on other issues, including strategies to manage problems related to isolation.  Discussion and conclusion Escalation of this remote preventive intervention to other COVID-19 centers and future similar epidemics is recommended.; Resumen  IntroducciÃ³n Los trabajadores de la salud de primera lÃ­nea (TSPL) ante el COVID-19 presentan alto riesgo de desgaste profesional y fatiga por compasiÃ³n (DP&FC).

"Depressive Symptoms Among Older Adults Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVES: It is a concern that public health measures to prevent older people contracting COVID-19 could lead to a rise in mental health problems such as depression. The aim of this study therefore is to examine trends of depressive symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large cohort of older people. DESIGN: Observational study with 6-year follow-up. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: More than 3000 community-dwelling adults aged &#8805;60Â years participating in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). METHODS: Mixed effects multilevel models were used to describe trends in depressive symptoms across 3 waves of TILDA: wave 4 (2016), wave 5 (2018), and a final wave conducted July-November 2020. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), with a score &#8805;9 indicating clinically significant symptoms. RESULTS: The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms at waves 4 and 5 was 7.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.5, 7.9] and 7.2% (95% CI 6.5, 8.0), respectively. This more than doubled to 19.8% (95% CI 18.5, 21.2) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no change in CES-D scores between waves 4 and 5 (ÃŸÂ = 0.09, 95% CI -0.04, 0.23), but a large increase in symptoms was observed during the pandemic (ÃŸÂ = 2.20, 95% CI 2.07, 2.33). Age &#8805;70Â years was independently associated with depressive symptoms (ÃŸÂ = 0.45, 95% CI 0.18, 0.72) during the pandemic but not from wave 4 to 5 (ÃŸÂ = 0.09, 95% CI -0.18, 0.36). Living with others was associated with a lower burden of symptoms during the pandemic (ÃŸÂ =Â -0.40, 95% CI -0.71,Â -0.09) but not between waves 4 and 5 (ÃŸÂ =Â -0.40, 95% CI -0.71,Â -0.09). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates significant increases in the burden of depressive symptoms among older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly those aged &#8805;70Â years and/or living alone. Even a small increase in the incidence of late life depression can have major implications for health care systems and societies in general. Improving access to age-attuned mental health care should therefore be a priority.","Briggs, Robert; McDowell, Cillian P; De Looze, CÃ©line; Kenny, Rose Anne; Ward, Mark","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2021.09.003","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Am Med Dir Assoc;2021 Sep 13.; Publication details: J Am Med Dir Assoc;2021 Sep 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20801,""
"Suicide ideation during the COVID-19 outbreak in German university students: Comparison with pre-COVID 19 rates","Introduction: An increase of suicidal thinking within the COVID-19 pandemic has been postulated. Yet, direct comparisons with pre-COVID-19 rates are missing. Methods: The present study investigated whether levels and rates of suicidal ideation have changed between 2016 and 2020. Data of NÂ =Â 664 university students (five cohorts: 2016: nÂ =Â 105, 2017: nÂ =Â 117, 2018: nÂ =Â 108, 2019: nÂ =Â 154, 2020: nÂ =Â 180) were collected by online surveys. Results: The rate of students suffering from suicidal ideation was twice as high in 2020 than in previous years. Furthermore, levels of suicidal thinking and of depression were higher in 2020 than in 2019 and 2016. Limitations: The sample size of the current study was rather modest and suicide ideation was assessed with a single item only. Conclusions: The rate of students suffering from suicidal ideation was twice as high in 2020 than in previous years. Help-lines and online counselling should be promoted to the public and the possibilities of telepsychotherapy for suicidal people should be used and expanded.","Brailovskaia, Julia; Teismann, Tobias; Friedrich, SÃ¶ren; Schneider, Silvia; Margraf, JÃ¼rgen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100228","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord Rep;6: 100228, 2021 Dec.; Publication details: J Affect Disord Rep;6: 100228, 2021 Dec.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20802,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Psychotherapy Participation Among Individuals With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Enrolled in Treatment Research","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many aspects of daily life and required a rapid and unprecedented shift in psychotherapy delivery from in-person to telemental health. In the present study, we explored the impact of the pandemic on individuals' ability to participate in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) psychotherapy and the association between the impact of COVID-19 impact on health and financial well-being and psychotherapy participation. Participants (N = 161, 63.2% male, Mage = 42.7 years) were United States military veterans (n = 108), active duty military personnel (n = 12), and civilians (n = 6), who were participating in one of nine PTSD treatment trials. The results indicate a predominately negative COVID-19 impact on therapy participation, although some participants (26.1%) found attending therapy sessions through telehealth to be easier than in-person therapy. Most participants (66.7%) reported that completing in vivo exposure homework became harder during the pandemic. Moreover, the impact of the pandemic on PTSD symptom severity and daily stress were each associated with increased difficulty with aspects of therapy participation. The findings highlight the unique challenges to engaging in PTSD treatment during the pandemic as well as a negative impact on daily stress and PTSD severity, both of which were related to treatment engagement difficulties.","McLean, Carmen P; Back, Sudie E; Capone, Christy; Morland, Leslie; Norman, Sonya B; Rauch, Sheila A M; Schnurr, Paula P; Teng, Ellen; Acierno, Ron","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jts.22718","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Trauma Stress;2021 Jul 22.; Publication details: J Trauma Stress;2021 Jul 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20804,""
"Effect of a Telecare Case Management Program for Older Adults Who Are Homebound During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial","Importance: Older adults who are homebound can be difficult to reach owing to their functional limitations and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving their health needs unrecognized at an earlier stage. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of a telecare case management program for older adults who are homebound during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was conducted among 68 older adults in Hong Kong from May 21 to July 20, 2020, with a last follow-up date of October 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria were being 60 years or older, owning a smartphone, and going outside less than once a week in the previous 6 months. Interventions: Participants in the telecare group received weekly case management from a nurse supported by a social service team via telephone call and weekly video messages covering self-care topics delivered via smartphone for 3 months. Participants in the control group received monthly social telephone calls. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the change in general self-efficacy from before the intervention to after the intervention at 3 months. Self-efficacy was measured by the Chinese version of the 10-item, 4-point General Self-efficacy Scale, with higher scores representing higher self-efficacy levels. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: A total of 68 participants who fulfilled the criteria were enrolled (34 in the control group and 34 in the intervention group; 56 [82.4%] were women; and mean [SD] age, 71.8 [6.1] years). At 3 months, there was no statistical difference in self-efficacy between the telecare group and the control group. Scores for self-efficacy improved in both groups (ÃŸ = 1.68; 95% CI, -0.68 to 4.03; P = .16). No significant differences were found in basic and instrumental activities of daily living, depression, and use of health care services. However, the telecare group showed statistically significant interactions of group and time effects on medication adherence (ÃŸ = -8.30; 95% CI, -13.14 to -3.47; P = .001) and quality of life (physical component score: ÃŸ = 4.99; 95% CI, 0.29-9.69; P = .04). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, participants who received the telecare program were statistically no different from the control group with respect to changes in self-efficacy, although scores in both groups improved. After the intervention, the telecare group had better medication adherence and quality of life than the control group, although the small sample size may limit generalizability. A large-scale study is needed to confirm these results.

"Cognitive Remediation in Virtual Environments for Patients with Schizophrenia and Major Depressive Disorder: A Feasibility Study","Standard approaches to cognitive remediation can suffer from limited skill transferability to patients' life. Complex virtual environments (VEs) enable us to create ecologically valid remediation scenarios while preserving laboratory conditions. Nevertheless, the feasibility and efficacy of these programs in psychiatric patients are still unknown. Our aim was to compare the feasibility and efficacy of a novel rehabilitation program, designed in complex VEs, with standard paper-pencil treatment in patients with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. We recruited 35 participants to complete a VE rehabilitation program and standard treatment in a crossover pilot study. Twenty-eight participants completed at least one program, 22 were diagnosed with schizophrenia and 6 with major depressive disorder. Participant's performance in the representative VE training task significantly improved in terms of maximum achieved difficulty (p &#8804; 0.001), speed (p < 0.001) and efficacy (p &#8804; 0.001) but not in item performance measure. Neither the standard treatment nor the VE program led to improvement in standardized cognitive measures. Participants perceived both programs as enjoyable and beneficial. The refusal rate was higher in the VE program (8.6%) than in the standard treatment (0%). But in general, the VE program was well-accepted by the psychiatric patients and it required minimal involvement of the clinician due to automatic difficulty level adjustment and performance recording. However, the VE program did not prove to be effective in improving cognitive performance in the standardized measures.","PlechatÃ¡, AdÃ©la; HejtmÃ¡nek, LukÃ¡s; BednÃ¡rovÃ¡, Martina; FajnerovÃ¡, Iveta","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179081","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 08 28.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 08 28.; Cognitive Remediation; Depressive Disorder, Major; Schizophrenia; Depressive Disorder, Major/therapy; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Pilot Projects; Schizophrenia/therapy; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20807,""
"Implementing Digital Trainings within Medical Rehabilitations: Improvement of Mental Health and Synergetic Outcomes with Healthcare Service","The need for new technologies in healthcare services has been stressed. However, little is known about the effectiveness of digital interventions integrated in psychosomatic rehabilitation processes. Data from 724 patients from psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics were analyzed with regard to the effectiveness of digital trainings indicated by a change in symptoms related to depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness from pre- to post-rehabilitation. Rehabilitation satisfaction was examined in association with reaching rehabilitation goals and satisfaction with communication. A mixed repeated measures analyses of covariance, analyses of covariance, and hierarchical stepwise regression analyses were performed. Results indicated a superior effectiveness for the intervention group receiving all offered digital treatments in addition to the regular face-to-face rehabilitation program with regard to symptoms of depression (F (2674) = 3.93, p < 0.05, ÃŽÂ·p2 = 0.01), anxiety (F (2678) = 3.68, p < 0.05, ÃŽÂ·p2 = 0.01) post-rehabilitation, with large effect sizes for both depression (d = 1.28) and anxiety (d = 1.08). In addition, rehabilitation satisfaction was positively associated with reaching rehabilitation goals and perceived communication with healthcare workers. Digital interventions appeared effective in supporting mental health of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients' post-rehabilitation. These findings support the inclusion of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary digital and face-to-face treatment programs and call for more implementations of new technologies in a context of complexity to improve health and healthcare service.","Keller, Franziska Maria; Dahmen, Alina; Derksen, Christina; KÃ¶tting, Lukas; Lippke, Sonia","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178936","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 08 25.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 08 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20808,""
"How covid-19 affected burnout and job satisfaction levels among the healthcare provider in jordanian hospitals","Objective: This study aims to establish how Covid-19 affected the burnout and job satisfaction levels among the health care Provider in Jordan hospitals. Methods The online survey questionnaire was distributed to 160 nurses, doctors, medics, and specialists, and only 152 responses were filed in the Google form from healthcare workers from Jordan hospitals. The survey questions wanted answers related toestablishing job satisfaction and burnout levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire also contained questions investigating the nurses' and doctors' demographic, work-related variables, and personal experiences. Additionally, the basic needs at the workplace were investigated, and the world Health Organization-5 well-being index was established through the questionnaires. Different statistics measurements were used. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize both the background information about the healthcare providers and burnout levels. Results from the 152 healthcare professionals filed their responses, 32.6% were males, and the rest were females. Approximately48%.13% and 16% were nurses, doctors, and pharmacists. Burnout was caused by exhaustion, depression, anxiety, and overtime working time. 7% of the nurses were satisfied with the work, while 72.5% were not satisfied. Approximately 24% of the male healthcare providers demonstrated resilience in employment, while 5% of the female healthcare professionals demonstrated burnout and total withdrawal due to the scourging effects of covid-19 (Abujilban et al., 2021). The healthcare providers that received psychological support from their families seemed strong and suffered lower burnout levels. The fear of infection created anxiety that led to stress, and finally, the burnout levels shot high. Conclusions Covid -19 led to increased levels of burnout and lack of job satisfaction. The hospitals in Jordan were not prepared, and the fear of nurses and doctors getting infected created more anxiety. The healthcare motivation and energy to work reduced to a bare minimum.","Amer, B.

"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on doctoral studentsâ€™ thesis/dissertation progress","Aim/Purpose The purpose of this study was to document the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic for doctoral students who were proposing, conducting, or writing up their doctoral thesis, dissertation, or other culminating project. Background For doctoral students, the process of designing, implementing, and writing a culminating project is a key part of the learning experience. These projects typically require students to direct their own learning and to manage setbacks, obstacles, and challenges as they arise. During the COVID-19 pandemic, doctoral students around the globe had to undertake this key learning experience in the context of a global crisis. Methodology During August and September 2020, 235 doctoral students from around the world completed an online questionnaire consisting of demographic questions and three open-ended questions about their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis involved several cycles of In Vivo Coding of the data, which yielded codes, categories, and eventually themes. At each stage, the researchers collaborated to generate the codes, and the categories and themes arose through several rounds of discussion. Contribution Our study adds to the small body of knowledge on doctoral studentsâ€™ experiences from around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying categories of experience through qualitative, open-ended survey questions. The study highlights doctoral studentsâ€™ challenges and how these were either exacerbated or mitigated by pandemic-induced changes. Findings Our survey respondents described impacts on their culminating projectsâ€™ progress in five major categories: research design, access to resources, workload, mental health, and finances. Recommendations The five categories of impacts emerging from our participantsâ€™ responses may for Practitioners be useful for faculty and administrators of doctoral programs to consider in reviewing their programsâ€™ responses to the pandemic and making future plans for providing academic continuity in crisis situations as well as re-evaluating the priorities and structures of doctoral program to better support students overall moving forward. Recommendations Further research is needed to better understand how the pandemic impacted in-for Researchers dividual studentsâ€™ research and writing processes, including adaptive strategies. Impact on Society Institutions need to be aware of systemic strain on doctoral students under the best of conditions and be especially aware of the impacts of a crisis and plan contingencies to assist students with a focus on the areas of research design, access to resources, workload, mental health, and finances. Future Research Future research should seek out additional perspectives of male doctoral students. Additionally, data capturing perspectives from students at other points in time are needed as the pandemic continued to unfold after this studyâ€™s data collection period.

"Electrocardiographic findings of COVID-19 patients and their correlation with outcome;a prospective cohort study","Introduction: Being infected with COVID-19 is associated with direct and indirect effects on the cardiopulmonary system and electrocardiography can aid in management of patients through rapid and early identification of these adversities. Objective: The present study was designed aiming to evaluate electrocardiographic changes and their correlation with the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This Prospective cohort study was carried out on COVID-19 cases admitted to the emergency department of an educational hospital, during late February and March 2020. Electrocardiographic characteristics of patients and their association with in-hospital mortality were investigated. Results: One hundred and nineteen cases with the mean age of 60.52Â±13.45 (range: 29-89) years were studied (65.5% male). Dysrhythmia was detected in 22 (18.4%) cases. T-wave inversion (28.6%), pulmonale P-wave (19.3%), left axis deviation (19.3%), and ST-segment depression (16.8%) were among the most frequently detected electrocardiographic abnormalities, respectively. Twelve (10.1%) cases died. There was a significant correlation between in-hospital mortality and history of diabetes mellitus (p=0.007), quick SOFA score &gt; 2 (p&lt;0.0001), premature ventricular contraction (PVC) (p=0.003), left axis deviation (LAD) (p=0.039), pulmonale P-wave (p&lt;0.001), biphasic P-wave (p&lt;0.001), inverted T-wave (p=0.002), ST-depression (p=0.027), and atrioventricular (AV) node block (p=0.002). Multivariate cox regression showed that history of diabetes mellitus, and presence of PVC and pulmonale P-wave were independent prognostic factors of mortality. Conclusions: Based on the findings of the present study, 18.4% of COVID-19 patients had presented with some kind of dysrhythmia and in addition to history of diabetes, presence of PVC and pulmonale P-wave were among the independent prognostic factors of mortality in COVID-19 patients.

"Capacity development among skilled and highly skilled unemployed persons in Pretoria, Gauteng, in order to improve their employability and self-employability","One of the objectives of some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is to assist unemployed persons to become employed or self-employed. In Pretoria, Gauteng, one such NGO gives training and support to unemployed persons with the purpose of capacitating them in certain areas of need. This exploratory research was aimed at determining how skilled and highly skilled unemployed persons involved in this NGO's programme view their own ability to become employed or self-employed. The capacity approaches of Sen and Kolbe served as theoretical frameworks for this study. Interpretivism as a research philosophy and a phenomenological approach guided the study. Interpretivism, phenomenology and a qualitative research method were therefore used. Two semi-structured focus group interviews were used to obtain rich data from the participants. Forty-two unemployed persons were involved in the NGO programme at the time, and eleven persons volunteered to participate in the study. Seven persons with a post-school qualification participated in one focus group interview, and four persons with a Grade 12 certificate in the other. The purpose of this division was to attain a wide variety of perspectives in the dynamics of each focus group interview. The trustworthiness of the data was essential;this was achieved by considering credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data into meaningful themes and categories. Saturation of data was taken into consideration. Verbatim extracts were used to substantiate the themes. The themes yielded by the findings were categorised according to Kolbe's capability approach based on the three faculties of the mind (cognitive, affective and conative), as well as the strategies to develop capacity. The findings can be summarised in three main themes, namely the cognitive, or thoughts (self-image, new thinking, skills);the affective, or emotions (motivation, negative emotions relating to relationships, dealing with depression and despondence);and strategies to develop capacity (recognised prior learning and job shadowing). The conative part of Kolbe's approach did not feature in the findings. Recommendations were drafted by combining the findings of the study and the literature review. This combination resulted in the development of a framework to improve employability and self-employability of the skilled and highly skilled unemployed persons. This framework consisted of the ""what"" (capacities) that should be developed and the ""how"", that is, strategies to follow in order to develop the capacities ofthe skilled and highly skilled unemployed persons. Training in making online job applications, writing a curriculum vitae, computer skills, how to brand and market oneself, how to network, job interviewing and entrepreneurship should be offered. Coaching and mentoring should be made available, especially to persons who want to be self-employed. Financial assistance should be considered as start-up funds for a new business venture. To improve employability and self-employability, the cognitive, affective and conative parts of the person should, therefore, be taken into consideration when developing personal capacity. It is recommended that, in future research, this study be extended to other skilled and highly skilled unemployed persons and to unskilled unemployed persons in South Africa. The constraints on employability and the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic on unemployment in South Africa should also be researched.

Die bevindinge kan in drie hooftemas saamgevat word, naamlik die kognitiewe, of denke (selfbeeld, nuwe denke en vaardighede);die affektiewe, of emosies (motivering, negatiewe emosies ten opsigte van verhoudings);en strategieÃ« om kapasiteit te bou (erkenning van vorige leer en werkskaduwing). Die konatiewe (strewe, gedrag) as deel van Kolbe se teorie is nie in die narratiewe gevind nie. Op grond van die navorsingsbevindinge en die literatuur is 'n raamwerk saamgestel om die ""hoe"" (watter strategieÃ«) en die ""wat"" (watter kapasiteit) van kapasiteitsontwikkeling van geskoolde en hooggeskoolde werklose persone uit te lig.

"Living with long COVID","One in five people have symptoms that persist after 5 weeks, and one in ten have symptoms for 12 weeks or longer after an acute COVID-19 infection (Office for National Statistics [ONS], 2020). NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2020) defines this condition as post-COVID syndrome or long COVID. Common symptoms vary from fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations, insomnia and anxiety and depression and encompasses a plethora of debilitating symptoms (Dani et al, 2021). The new guideline for NICE (2021) recommends that patients presenting with new or ongoing symptoms 4 weeks or later after an initial COVID infection should have the investigations done to rule out acute, life-threatening complications or identify any unrelated diagnosis (NICE, 2021). Garg et al (2020) suggests that long COVID is a multisystem syndrome and needs a multifaceted approach to tackle the physical, cognitive, psychological, social, and vocational aspects of this condition. This article looks at the literature about long COVID and suggests there is a clear pathway for treatment in primary care. Certainly that all physicians should be equipped to recognise long-COVID and provide supportive management (Dani et al, 2021).","Duncan, Debbie Louise","https://doi.org/10.12968/jprp.2021.3.9.362","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Journal of Prescribing Practice; 3(9):362-368, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Prescribing Practice; 3(9):362-368, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20815,""
"An ornithological walk to improve the well-being of mental health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: A pilot study","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed many routines worldwide and has also affected the mental health of psychiatric patients and mental health professionals. One of the suggested methods for mental health improvement is more intensive contact with nature, including birdwatching as a hobby. Material and methods: After an ornithological walk in February 2021 for 5 psychiatrists and psychotherapists, in spite of unfavourable weather, all participants very positively evaluated the impact of birding on their well-being, mood and subjective evaluation of stress level. Results: Particularly important is an observation that the pandemic reality forced the whole society, including mental health professionals, to limit their behaviours and attitudes to very â€œadultâ€ and responsible ones. Everyday life was reduced to functioning based on a very concrete approach to reality while abandoning activities that stimulate imagination (travels, theatre, arts). The ornithological walk allowed participants to abandon the pandemic reality and enter the space of playfulness, fantasies and childhood experiences. It enabled immersion in a friendly â€œmother-worldâ€ in which sensory perceptions proved to be important: smell, touch (â€œrush of airâ€), feeling of space. Birds were perceived not only as direct objects of observations but also as symbols of freedom, energy and lightness. Conclusions: Despite the small group size, ornithological walks are recommended as a nature-based intervention exerting a positive influence on the mental health of psychiatrists and psychotherapists. It is also believed to positively affect the management of their patients, although this and many other aspects require further research.","Murawiec, S.; Tryjanowski, P.; Nita, A.","https://doi.org/10.5603/PSYCH.a2021.0024","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Psychiatria; 18(3):190-195, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatria; 18(3):190-195, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20816,""
"Advances in telepsychiatry related to the COVID-19 pandemic","The article presents progress, limitations and potential challenges in the field of telepsychiatry in the world and in Poland caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic as collective social experience has led to numerous negative consequences, but at the same time has contributed to progress in some areas of life. Such field is telemedicine, especially telepsychiatry. Stress related to social limitations, trauma related to developing COVID-19, as well as increasing number of reports on neurotrophic effect of SARS-CoV-2 increase the risk of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders. Thus, during the pandemic, the demand for availability of psychiatric care increases. At the same time, most of existing forms of psychiatric care carry the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Therefore, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote contacts in psychiatry were recommended. These forms were already known and widely used in some highly computerized health care systems (especially with low population density and / or low availability of psychiatrists). However, for most systems, the COVID-19 pandemic and the sudden need to intensify remote contacts with patients with mental disorders poses major logistical challenge. Telepsychiatry has numerous advantages and disadvantages. The pandemic caused necessity to adapt to new conditions and became huge source of urgent actions by groups of specialists developing standards for the diagnosis and treatment of people with mental disorders in countries where this form was not considered to be equivalent of stationary visits before. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was sudden leap in progress in the field of telepsychiatry, which requires in-depth research to develop or modify standards of remote care for patients with mental disorders.","SokÃ³l-Szawlowska, M.","https://doi.org/10.5603/PSYCH.a2021.0018","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Psychiatria; 18(3):206-211, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatria; 18(3):206-211, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20817,""
"Association of fear of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors (PB) against COVID-19 in Iran","Introduction: The world is currently experiencing a pandemic of COVID-19. The pandemic may affect physical and mental health. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the fear of COVID-19 and study the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors against COVID-19. Material and methods: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study to evaluate the fear of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors against COVID-19 among the volunteer population in Golestan Province, Iran in May 2020 and June 2020. The online questionnaire included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and the prevention behaviors against COVID-19, which are used to assess the fear and prevention behaviors of the population, respectively. The data were presented by mean and frequency. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with Fear of COVID-19 at a significant level of 0.05 in Stata 14. Results: A total of 734 of the 900 individuals contacted completed the survey, with a participation rate of 81.5%. The mean age of the participants was 33.97 Â± 10.68 years and 375 (51.9%) were females. The mean Fear of COVID-19 score in the participants was 19.69 Â± 5.96. There was a significant positive correlation between Fear of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors (r = 0.19, p &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed participants with a higher perceived threat of COVID-19, women, married participants, health workers and people with underlying diseases had higher levels of fear of COVID-19. Conclusions: The fear of COVID-19 in Iranian society is high, which indicates the need to pay attention to the mental health in pandemic conditions. Appropriate intervention action can be designed and implemented according to the factors that affect fear. In addition, it should be noted that people with less fear are less likely to observe the COVID-19â€™s preventative behaviors.","Charkazi, A.; Ahmadi-Livani, M.; Nori, A.; Foroughi, A.; Mosazadeh, H.; Rahimi, A.; Ghelichi-Ghojogh, M.; Kalteh, E.

"Neuropsychiatric complications related to COVID-19: Clinical review","COVID-19 is a disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-19 virus which was first detected in 2019. Since then it has spread around the world, leading to the declaration of the coronavirus pandemic by the World Health Organization. The course of infection may take a wide variety of forms from asymptomatic to severe with the presence of numerous complications that can lead to death. Symptoms of infection may affect various organs and systems, especially the respiratory system. In our article, we will focus on the neuropsychiatric consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most frequently reported neurological symptoms include headache (3.7â€“70.3%) and chronic fatigue (53.1â€“53.6%). The dominant psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depressive symptoms (4.6â€“37.86%). At the moment, however, the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-19 infection are still unknown, therefore further observation and research in this direction is necessary.","Mosiolek, J.; Jakubczak, P.; Mosiolek, A.","https://doi.org/10.5603/PSYCH.2021.0022","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Psychiatria; 18(3):232-240, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatria; 18(3):232-240, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20819,""
"Psychological impact of managing COVID-19 patients among doctors: A pre- And post-survey study","Objective: In any struggling healthcare system, it is always the frontline workers â€“ doctors, nurses, and paramedical staffâ€”that are affected first. This study aimed to assess the psychological impactâ€”anxiety, stress, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)â€”among doctors working in COVID-19 wards and the underlying triggers in a public hospital in Karachi. Methods: Pre- and post-survey methodologies were adopted. Post-graduate trainees working in COVID-19 isolation facilities from April till September 2020 were interviewed before starting their one-month rotation and after completing it. The psychological impact was assessed using two standard instrumentsâ€”Depression Anxiety and Stress 21 (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Data were entered and analyzed through SPSS version 22.0. Results: For 100 doctors, the mean score for stress, anxiety, stress, and depression on DASS-21 and PTSD on IES-R significantly increased after the rotation (p &lt; 0.01). The mean score of depression and IES-R was higher in younger (&lt;28 years) doctors (p = 0.05). Married doctors scored higher on anxiety and IES-R (p = 0.05). Doctors who were not willfully performing their duties scored worse on all measures of DASS-21 and IES-R (p &lt; 0.01). Doctors facing family resistance scored significantly higher on stress, anxiety, and IES-R (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Working in COVID-19 facilities is imparting a negative impact on the psychological health of doctors. Healthcare administration should be aware of this psychological distress and should introduce mental health aid at administrative levels to prevent a mental health epidemic among care providers.

"The mental state of Americans amid the COVID-19 crisis: How socially vulnerable populations face greater disparities during and after a crisis","The coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) public health crisis has accentuated divides and caused millions of Americans to suffer from increased mental health challenges. Although these challenges are seen throughout the country, socially vulnerable populations including frontline workers, older adults, and children, among others, face increased risk of mental health issues. There has been a notable mental health crisis in the country due to the isolation, stay-at-home orders, and preventive measures put in place to curb the spread. This study investigates the mental health challenges that socially vulnerable populations often face during crises and presents the factors affecting these populations during (and following) the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on an analysis of these factors, several recommendations are made to aid emergency managers, public health officials, policymakers, and academics in better addressing mental health challenges as we continue to battle COVID-19 and in preparation for future public health crises.

"Converging impact of the ongoing conflict and COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and substance use disorders in Ukraine","Since the Russian annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the subsequent occupation of parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukraine has been facing increasing security and healthcare challenges. The seven-year war in East Ukraine has led to a rise in substance and alcohol use and increasing addiction rates among veterans, internally displaced persons, and civilian survivors. This article examines the combined impact of the ongoing Russoâ€“Ukrainian conflict and COVID-19 pandemic on substance use in Ukraine. It also gives an overview of the institutions in place to monitor and improve mental health in the country. The article highlights the urgent need for further funding and research on substance and alcohol addiction, with vulnerable populations affected by the conflict during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frontline healthcare workers in this region should anticipate an increased burden of patients suffering from substance use disorders who are in need of emergency management intervention and proper behavioral health referrals.

"How right now: The role of social determinants of health as they relate to emotional well-being amidst the COVID-19 pandemic","Pandemics are stressful times, full of uncertainty and fear. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many Americans have experienced feelings of stress, grief, and loss. How Right Now (HRN) â€“ and its Spanish-language counterpart, QuÃ© Hacer Ahora (QHA) â€“ is an evidence-based, culturally-relevant communication campaign designed to promote and strengthen the emotional well-being and resiliency of populations adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with support from the CDC Foundation, the campaign aims to help all Americans but has a specific focus on some of the disproportionately affected groups, including adults over 65 and their caregivers, individuals with pre-existing physical and mental health conditions, people experiencing violence, and those experiencing economic distress. Based on rapid, but robust, formative research, HRN offers audience-centric messages representing the real, everyday experiences and emotions that these audiences are having and addresses them in actionable ways. These include messages that address the social and structural barrier that disproportionately-affected groups have been facing long before the pandemic â€” and which are felt more acutely now. This paper provides an overview of the rapid, mixed-method, culturally-responsive formative research process undertaken to inform the development of HRN. Specifically, it describes how HRNâ€™s disproportionately-affected audiences describe and discuss their emotiona well-being during COVID-19 through the lens of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). We introduce a secondary theory, Vital Conditions for Health and Well-Being (VCHW), which conceptualizes holistic well-being and the conditions that give rise to it and identifies levers for community change and improvement. Data collection methods included an environmental scan (n=700 publications);social listening (n=1 million social media posts);partner needs-assessment calls (n=16);partner-convened listening sessions with community members (n=29), online focus groups (n=10), and a national probability survey (n=731), all in English and Spanish. Findings suggest that HRNâ€™s priority audiencesâ€™ emotional well-being and SDOH are interconnected. Disruptions in SDOH du to the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to emotional well-being challenges (e.g., anxiety) for HRNâ€™s priority audiences. While some disruptions may lead some people to adapt, connect with others, and be more resilient, there is a disparate impact of emotional well-being amid COVID-19 for those already experiencing disparities linked to SDOH. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of disproportionately affected populations through the lens of SDOH is vital to identifying the kinds of supports and services â€“ like How Right Now/QuÃ© Hacer Ahora â€“ required for these populations.

"Resilience in real time: Parents of youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) summer 2020 psychosocial experiences","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacts parents, people with health risks like diabetes, and those with fewer financial resources. Minorities face particularly negative outcomes of the pandemic, and racial tensions after George Floyd's murder may have worsened effects. We examined group differences by race/ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES) in depressive symptoms and protective factors in parents of children with T1D in summer 2020. Methods: Participants were n=100 parents (98% mothers) of youth with T1D (60% female, M age=6.7Â±1.6 yrs, M T1D duration = 2.9Â±.5 yrs), who completed a behavioral RCT =6 months prior. In July/July 2020, parents selfreported on awareness of how to obtain housing/financial/food resources (Protective Factor Survey Concrete Support [PFS-CS] subscale) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression [CESD]). Race/ethnicity (66% non-Hispanic white, 12% non-Hispanic Black, 11% Hispanic, 11% other) and health insurance (33% public, 67% private) were reported at RCT enrollment. We ran ANOVAs and Pearson correlations to compare CES-D and PFS-CS by demographic groups. Results: PFS-CS scores differed significantly by race/ethnicity and insurance status, both p&lt;.01. Hispanic (M=1.6Â±0.5) and non-Hispanic Black (M=1.6Â±0.6) parents had higher CS than non-Hispanic white parents (M = 1.3Â±0.3). Those with public insurance (M = 1.6Â±0.5) had higher CS than those with private insurance (M = 1.3Â±0.3). Higher CS correlated with lower CES-D, r = -.26, p = .05. CES-D did not differ across groups. Conclusion: Racially/ethnically diverse and lower SES parents of children with T1D reported more knowledge about how to access useful resources. This may have buffered against elevated mood symptoms during cooccurring major societal and public health stressors in 2020. Highlighting sources of support and resilience may be a useful strategy in strength-based interventions for parents of children with T1D.","Jones, J. N.; Carreon, S. A.; Rooney, K.; Wang, C.

"The negative psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mothers of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): a cross-section study","Background: ADHD is an important cause for psychiatric care as one of the most prominent neurodevelopmental conditions. Being an ADHD childâ€™s parent is a daunting and sometimes stressful job that becomes more challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative consequences. This cross-sectional study was applied to 54 mothers of ADHD children and adolescents;the data of the ADHD children and adolescents have been registered before the lockdown on their regular follow-up visits on the child and adolescentâ€™s clinic of the psychiatry department. Data of the study were collected through an electronic Google form included a COVID-19 questionnaire, The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scaleâ€”21 Items (DASS-21) (Arabic version), and Connersâ€™ Parent Rating Scale Revised-short version (CPRS-48). We aimed to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms among the mothers of ADHD children and adolescents during COVID-19 outbreaks and determine the relationship between these symptoms and the changed circumstances that occurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, also with the behavioral problem of their children that may deteriorate by their mothersâ€™ psychological state. Results: Most of our participants were from the low socioeconomic class and were married. In total, 29.6% of the mother of ADHD children had confirmed COVID-19 cases among their family members, while 11.1% of our subjects lost a family member due to this epidemic, 22% of our sample lost their work because of COVID-19. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has a big financial drawback on the family of our participants by a percentage of 31.5%. We noticed that 48.1% of our sample documented domestic violence toward them compared to before COVID-19. A total of 92.6% of the mothers who participated in our study assessed the period of change and restrictions as being very demanding. We found that 74.1% of ADHD patients were not compliant with their medications than before the epidemic. Also, we found that the mothers of ADHD children have bigger challenges in managing the childâ€™s meals, structured activities, and sleep compared to before COVID-19. We showed that 53.7% of the mothers had depressive symptoms, 61% had anxiety symptoms, and 53.7% had stress symptoms. These symptoms were statistically associated with the lost family member due to COVID-19, the financial drawbacks of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the domestic violence toward mothers, compared to before COVID-19, the non-compliance of their children on the medications compared to before COVID-19, the presence of confirmed COVID-19 cases among family members, motherâ€™s assessment of the period of change and restrictions as being very demanding compared to before COVID-19, and the non-compliance of their children on the medications compared to before COVID-19 as well as the increased behavioral symptoms of their children. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic has psychological influences on mothers of children with ADHD. A significant number of them may have depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms that could affect their childrenâ€™s compliance with the medication and, consequently, their symptomatology.

"A health and justice lab to address cancer related health disparities and social determinants of health in marginalized communities: The Cancer Health Justice Lab","Background: The cancer health justice lab [CHJL] formed in 2019, is a multidisciplinary lab comprised of underrepresented undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students and diverse professionals in public health, social work, nutrition, medicine, nursing, and criminal justice. Using a social determinants of health framework, CHJL focuses on mentoring and training students from underrepresented backgrounds to increase participation in cancer health disparities research and practice. Methods: In collaboration with the Northeast Regional Alliance HCOP Academy Program (NERA), a program that supports minority and economically disadvantaged undergraduate and high school students interested in health careers, and the Rutgers Bloustein School of Public Policy and Planning, CHJL recruits 3-4 interns per semester. Didactics include leading journal clubs focusing on social determinants of health, health disparities, adverse childhood experiences, and health equity topics. Responsibilities include developing, designing, and implementing a community-based initiative that serves vulnerable populations, grant writing, and peer-reviewed article publications in high impact journals. Results: CHJL currently has 24 members - 14 members are active, including seven interns. Two former interns have been hired as research assistants and are currently pursuing a master's degree in public health. Past members are pursuing postgraduate level education in public health and biomedical sciences. CHJL has generated seven peer-reviewed articles on areas including: systematic reviews of digital cancer education, mental health and social ties of people who are incarcerated and implementing evidence-based practices in state prisons. Current projects include research to understand smoking and vaping behaviors among sexual and gender minority groups;Cancer 101 videos, a short video on COVID-19 for Spanish speakers;auto-complete searches language bias in COVID-19, medication-assisted treatment in jails, group-based counseling, and smoking cessation treatment in prisons, and colorectal cancer screening in urban populations. Conclusion: CHJL addresses health inequities through education, mentoring, advocacy, training, and research. It serves as a model to increase diversity in the health-related workforce and a mechanism for historically underrepresented groups in medicine and public health to contribute to science. This multidisciplinary approach may be useful in educating the next generation of public health and health-related professionals. Furthermore, CHJL could serve as a venue to reduce social isolation and feelings of otherness that may contribute to health inequities.","Smith, N.; Malarkey, S.; Valera, P.; Alzate-Duque, L.; Baquerizo, H.","https://doi.org/10.1158/1538-7445.AM2021-2554","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Cancer Research; 81(13 SUPPL), 2021.; Publication details: Cancer Research; 81(13 SUPPL), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20828,""
"Mental Health in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Impact on Well-Being Across the Athlete-Collegiate Career","In reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictive policies altered student-athletesâ€™ academic and athletic life. Sparse research has investigated the pandemicâ€™s effect on student-athlete mental health in terms of both negative (e.g., depression, anxiety) and positive (e.g., well-being, quality of life) dimensions. This study explored the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and quality of life among National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I student-athletes at different stages of their collegiate career. Ninety-nine student-athletes (Mage = 19.7 years, SD = 1.5) completed assessments on their mental health. Regression analysis revealed experiences directly related to COVID-19 did not affect general well-being or quality of life, but anxiety, depression, and significant insomnia did. Social well-being was lower for student-athletes closer to graduation (e.g., juniors, seniors), independent of reported anxiety and depression levels. These findings highlight the importance of psychosocial support, particularly in times of crisis, and indicate that tailored support might be beneficial at later stages of the collegiate years.","Schary, David P.; Lundqvist, Carolina","https://doi.org/10.1123/jcsp.2021-0041","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology; 15(3):249-267, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology; 15(3):249-267, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20829,""
"A Time for Clinical Transformation: Emerging Implications From COVID-19 for Athlete Transition Research and Clinical Practice","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes to the structure of sport and the experiences of athletes. In this commentary, we consider how these changes, including schedule disruptions and the early termination of careers, have contributed to a reconsideration of how athlete transition should be defined, examined, and intervened upon. We outline our rationale for this proposed reconfiguration, including implications for researchers and practitioners working with athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. For researchers, we recommend updating the transition definition, reconsidering the measurement of salient transition-related variables, and utilizing study designs/methods that best facilitate this work. For practitioners, we recommend considering the dynamic nature of transition within holistic athlete care, building momentum on mental health destigmatization achieved during the pandemic, athlete transition education, and clinician advocacy for transition-related resources for athletes. Ultimately, we hope this work will spark continued innovations in athlete transition research and practice moving forward.","DeFreese, J.

"Integrating Praxis Through the Research Process: Caregivers for Older Americans During the COVID-19 Pandemic","While applied anthropological research is sometimes envisioned as a linear process, we present an alternative view based on our research with frontline workers providing long-term care (LTC) for older adults during COVID-19. We completed a rapid qualitative assessment in central North Carolina from May to November 2020. We conducted data analysis as we continued to collect data and implemented activities and interventions along the way. We report emerging findings that included the deleterious effects of isolation on older adults in both congregate and community-based LTC, the value of creatively using technology as an avenue for communication and engagement, the importance of leadership and flexibility, as well as an abundance of mental health struggles LTC workers faced in caring for older adults during COVID-19. We present how we were able to address these in a variety of ways during the inductive research process because of iterative analysis that occurred alongside continued data collection.

"Understanding the Impact of COVID-19 on Economy and Environment in the Asia-Pacific Region","The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked longstanding and competing interests of the economy and environment. In January 2020, countries across the globe began implementing various levels of safety measures to slow the spread of the virus. Safety measures have run the gamut of restrictions: physical distancing guidelines, proper handwashing practices, and the use of face masks are on the lower end of the restriction spectrum, while travel restrictions, business closures, and country-wide lockdowns are instances of more stringent measures. Policy responses have drastically differed among governments across the globe, but the economic strife has plagued countries regardless of their COVID-19 response plan. Lockdowns in the first half of 2020 impeded economic activity, leading to a reduction in industrial activity and hence emissions. During this time period, observations from publicly available satellite sensors have shown that concentrations of various atmospheric pollutants, nitrogen dioxide especially, have decreased. The Asia-Pacific region was no exception, with China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand all experiencing slowdown in growth and large reductions in various economic sectors. Using these five Asia-Pacific countries, we will analyze how government policy, lockdowns, and travel restrictions implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak have slowed economic growth in the transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors, and in turn, impacted air quality and water quality. Conclusions and statistical significance of our analysis comparing coronavirus-related policies and their effect on economic growth and environmental health will help drive future decisions made by policymakers should another pandemic or similar global crisis arise.

"Web-based monitoring of the psychological distress facing Covid-19 in relation to quality of life and social adjustment in young adults","Several recent studies have considered the relationships among quality of life, social adaption, anxiety, depression, and psychological distress in pandemics. A primary aim of the current study was to explore the relationships among the aforementioned psychological dimensions and worries about Covid-19. Furthermore, we aim to highlight the features of young people potentially at risk of psychological distress during the pandemic. The assessment was conducted by a web-based survey, useful in preserving individuals' health against the virus circulation. 185 young individuals (under 30 years old), residing in Sardinia (an Italian island characterized by low indices of virus circulation) participated to the survey completing five questionnaires (RDI, STAS, STAI, WHOQOL, SASS) and a group of items inquiring the knowledge and the worries about pandemic. By the application of linear correlations, principal component analysis, cluster analysis and discriminant analysis, we highlighted the role played by each dimension on participants' self-reported well-being;moreover, we identified four clusters of subjects with different psychological reactions in pandemic as well as the groups of people with higher risk of distress. The suggestions of these results regarding current research trends and clinical opportunities are debated. Â© 2021 IEEE.","Marconi, P. L.; Agus, M.; Mascia, M.

"Intelligent Blockchain for Internet of Things Based Healthcare Management","Healthcare sector is transforming expeditiously to provide patient-centric treatments to recoup their health. Recently, COVID-19 has shaken the world with its spread and the world economy has seen the worst phase in life because of this pandemic. Monitoring a COVID-19 infected patient closely is not possible as significant distance should be maintained between the doctor and patient in order to avoid the spread of the virus. Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to address this apprehension. This cutting edge technology has the potentialto play vital role in the pandemic management with its ability to remotely trace, track and monitor the virus infected patients. Artificial intelligence (AI)is capable of providing support in risk analysis, spread patterns and medical advancements. The advantages of integrating AI with IoT and methodologies used for pandemic management are prototyped in this paper. The applications of these technologies in different phases of COVID-19 pandemic management life cycle are discussed. In specific, emphasis is made on the effective utilization of technology to provide patient-oriented treatment for faster recovery of the patients. The use of technology in the pandemic management embellishes the frontline warriors and healthcare industries in combating with theCOVID-19 pandemic.

"Exploring opioid addictions and responsibilities: almost lost in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to highlight the overshadowing of the opioid crisis due to Covid-19 pandemic. Opioids are affecting increasing numbers as the current opioid overdose death rate is increasing to 209 per day. While there appears light shining on the end of the Covid-19 pandemic with the advent of a fourth vaccine, there is no such light for the opioid epidemic. Based on a sample of 603 relatively educated adults in NE Ohio, the health harm caused by both crises, prescribing physician blaming, high levels of income loss and physical and emotional burdens shared by the respondents were obvious and striking. Design/methodology/approach: Using Bertram et al. (2014) theory of the blame model, the number of results concerning gender and personally involvement of friends and family members, including men empathy increased with greater knowledge of numbers of addicted opioid users in their personal contracts. Findings: Unfortunately, many women had to remain home taking care of children and elderly loved ones at greater percentages than their male counterparts may account for less empathy as such addicted users have become a burden to economically impaired families. This tendency for placing blame for circumstances with twin crises appears to follow a relatively predictable path as modeled by Bertram et al. (2014) (i.e. denial, justification and excuse). Originality/value: These are few studies that are studying the amplification effects of the Covid-19 pandemic context on the current opioid crisis. Â© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Smith, A.

"Sino-Western rivalry in the COVID-19 â€œvaccine warsâ€â€“A race to the bottom?","PurposeThis paper analyses the escalating Sino-Western race to develop a safe, efficacious and durable vaccine (i.e. â€œGoldilocks COVID-19 vaccineâ€). It argues that such efforts would be considerably more effective if there is greater international cooperation instead of the corrosive rivalry driven by misplaced nationalism.Design/methodology/approachThis study deploys a case-study approach, supported by literature on existing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development efforts.FindingsDespite the seeming success of recent COVID-19 vaccines, their actual efficacy is far from certain. Moreover, access to these vaccines would not be equitable internationally. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that their unique properties make storage and distribution prohibitively expensive, and international mechanisms to provide distribution to economically depressed regions are non-existent.

"A novel modularized intervention to improve sleep in older hospitalized veterans","Introduction: Disturbed sleep in hospitalized patient populations is a highly prevalent phenomenon, with patients commonly reporting problems with shorter sleep duration, more frequent awakenings, and overall poorer sleep quality during hospital stay compared to at home. Sleep disturbance during hospitalization is especially problematic as sleep is associated with both physical and psychological well-being. Poorer sleep has been found to impact recovery outcomes in a number of patient populations including mild traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, and most recently, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The current analyses examined pilot data from a novel brief modularized sleep intervention implemented with older adult Veterans living on a subacute rehabilitation unit. Methods: Participants were screened for sleep problems upon admission to the unit. Veterans who screened positive were invited to participate in the sleep intervention. Components of the intervention were selected based on screener responses and included group sleep hygiene psychoeducation, environmental accommodations (e.g. ear plugs, eye mask, soothing music), and CPAP use education. Measures completed at pre- and post- intervention assessed sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), global health functioning (PROMIS Global Health Scale), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9). Pre- and post- scores were compared using paired sample t-tests. Two samples t-tests compared change scores in PHQ-9 between groups. Results: A total of 33 Veterans were included in the analyses (Mage = 69.6, 3 female, intervention group n = 21). Participants showed a trend toward decreased PHQ-9 scores following the intervention (t(16) = 1.58, p = 0.100). There were no significant effects of the intervention on sleep quality or global health. Compared to the non-intervention group, the intervention group showed greater decrease in PHQ-9 scores at the time of post-intervention (t(25) = .828, p = .025). Conclusion: Preliminary data suggests that a brief modularized sleep intervention may benefit depressive symptoms for older adults during hospitalization. Additional research is needed to better understand the impact of a brief intervention on self-reported sleep quality during the hospitalization period.","Li, Y.; Miller, M.; Torrence, N.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.752","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A294, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A294, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20839,""
"Relationships between sleep and psychological adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Disruption of daily routines (employment, social interaction, health behaviors) during the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to psychological distress (worry, rumination), likely impacting sleep-related behaviors. This study evaluated change in psychological adjustment and insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The sample included 192 adults from Utah who completed three data collection cycles across 9 consecutive months to assess self-reported depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8). Insomnia was measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Data were analyzed using mixed-effect modeling and adjusted for anxiety and depression to determine their independent effects on insomnia symptoms. Spaghetti plots examined mean changes over time and significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Average anxiety, depression, and insomnia severity scores were aggregated for each month. Results: As participants' symptoms of anxiety and depression increased in severity, insomnia symptoms increased similarly. Over half of participants reported clinically significant ISI scores (59.38%). In both the random intercept and random slope models, there were significant independent effects of anxiety on insomnia severity (F=20.69;p&lt;0.0001) and significant effects of depression on insomnia severity (F=87.44, p&lt;0.0001). While the change in insomnia severity over time was on the boundary of statistical significance (F=3.54;p=0.0618), dropping from 15.17 (April) to 12.58 (December), our longitudinal analyses revealed no significant difference for the effect of anxiety or depression in predicting insomnia severity over time. Participants' monthly averages varied for sleep and psychological scores (ISI) from 12.58 to 16.07 (SD=3.76 to 6.34 for December and September, respectively), (GAD-7) from 3.47 to 6.39 (SD=3.36 to 5.26 for December and June, respectively), and (PHQ-8) 4.47 to 6.10 (SD=4.65 to 4.39 for December and June, respectively). Conclusion: Results demonstrate high prevalence of insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and underscore the importance of examining mental health functioning and psychological resiliency on sleep in order to enhance prevention efforts in response to a significant stressor.","Gilles, A.; Qeadan, F.; Baron, K.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.723","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A283, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A283, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20840,""
"A pandemic's impact on nightmare frequency","Introduction: Nightmares have been defined as bad dreams that produce awakenings and have content which can be recalled upon awakening. Frequent nightmares have been linked to many negative outcomes, such as depression and suicide. Research has demonstrated that stress can impact the likelihood and frequency of nightmare occurrences. Furthermore, extreme stress (such as trauma) can produce chronically recurring nightmares. Given the rise in societal stress as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, one could expect an increase in nightmares within the general population. With this in mind, our project sought to examine if nightmares are occurring more frequently during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Our project measured sleep quality and disordered symptoms in N = 2,126 undergraduate college students from the years 2017 to 2020 via online surveys. Data from 2020 was only gathered after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic (which was defined as March 11th 2020). Nightmares were assessed with a self-report questionnaire which asked, â€œhave you experienced a nightmare within the past monthâ€, to which respondents could respond with â€œyesâ€, â€œnoâ€, or â€œunsureâ€. Prior to this question participants were told a nightmare is being defined as a bad dream that wakes one up and has remembered dream content upon awakening. Frequencies between years were compared using ANOVA techniques. Results: In regard to the percentage of our sample that reported a nightmare during the previous month, the year 2020 was significantly higher (41.1%;F = 10.27, p &lt; 0.001) than all other years assessed (2017 = 27.0%;2018 = 25.3%;2019 = 31.7%). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between any of the pre-Covid-19 years. Conclusion: In 2020, A higher percentage of students reported experiencing a nightmare within the past month than any of our other captured years. Given our 2020 data only assessed students post the start of the pandemic, the significant increase of nightmares experienced by our sample could be related to stress produced by the Covid- 19 pandemic. Considering that nightmares have been found related to several negative outcomes, such as depression and suicide, both assessment of, and treatments for nightmares may be especially needed during our current climate.","Youngren, W.; Gratton, M.; Hamilton, N.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.719","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A281, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A281, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20841,""
"Sleeping well during a pandemic: The role of various forms of social support in protecting against insomnia","Introduction: Social support from friends, family, and significant loved ones is critical to sustaining mental health during crises. During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the populace has had to restrict many aspects of normal social contact. Consequently, social isolation and accompanying feelings of loneliness have spiked. There has also been a contemporaneous increase in the rates of insomnia. Considering this correlation, we investigated the potential role of various types of social/emotional support on the severity of insomnia. We hypothesized that greater social support from family, friends, and significant loved ones would all contribute to lower insomnia during the pandemic. Methods: During October 2020, 1020 participants (58.2% female) completed an online survey that included the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), a measure of social support, and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a measure of insomnia. The severity of insomnia was predicted using multiple linear regression, with the three sources of support from the MSPSS (family, friend, and significant other) entered stepwise. Results: All three sources of support were significantly correlated with lower ISI scores (family, r=-.163, p= p = 1.6x10-7;friend, r=-.125, p=6.5x10-5;significant other, r=-.095, p=.002). However, when all three variables were entered into stepwise regression, only increased familial support was significantly associated with lower insomnia levels (R2 = 0.027, ÃŸ =-.163, p = 1.6x10-7). In contrast, neither the support of friends nor support from significant others added any additional predictive power once family support was in the model. Conclusion: While perceived social support from friends and significant others was correlated with lower insomnia, we found that ISI scores were most significantly associated with perceived family support. In fact, once family support was accounted for, other sources of support did not account for additional variance. Ongoing family support plays a critical role in mental health and wellbeing, which is clearly demonstrated in the quality of sleep. During the social distancing imposed by the pandemic, it is vital that we find creative ways to maintain familial social support. Future work may benefit by examining the association between the use of electronic technologies to sustain social support and sleep outcomes.","Jankowski, S.; Cloonan, S.; Grandner, M.; Killgore, W.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.715","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A280, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A280, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20842,""
"Loneliness and lockdowns: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on insomnia symptoms","Introduction: Insomnia is a critical health issue that has serious consequences for both psychological and physical health. These consequences have become even more exacerbated during the course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as fears of the virus continue to grow and community lockdowns persist. Loneliness has also become a growing mental health concern as a result of the pandemic, and previous research has identified COVID-19 loneliness as a contributing factor to higher rates of insomnia. The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between insomnia, loneliness, and lockdown orders across the first 6-months of the pandemic. We hypothesized that being lonely and under lockdown would lead to greater insomnia, even after controlling for anxiety, and this would become more pronounced over the course of the pandemic. Methods: 6,101 English-speaking adults from across the U.S. (18-84 years old;53.6% female) completed an online, monthly, cross-sectional (~1000 participants per month), battery of assessments that included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), UCLA Loneliness Scale - Version 3, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD 7), demographic questions, and a COVID-19 questionnaire between April 2020 and September 2020. A 2 (lonely vs. not lonely) x 2 (lockdown vs. no lockdown) x 2 (Time 1 April-June vs. Time 2 July-September) ANCOVA was conducted to determine the effects of these variables on insomnia, while also controlling for anxiety symptoms. Results: Significant main effects of lockdown status, F(1,8) = 22.72, p &lt; .001, time, F(1,8) = 4.94, p = .026, and loneliness, F(1,8) = 65.18, p &lt; .001, were observed, as a well as a significant interaction effect between lockdown status and time, F(1,8) = 8.47, p = .004, after controlling for anxiety. Conclusion: Overall, lonely people under lockdown had the highest levels of insomnia at both Time 1 and Time 2. Non-lonely people consistently had lower levels of insomnia than lonely people across the 6-month period;however, being under lockdown also contributed to higher levels of insomnia regardless of loneliness, which increased with each passing month of the pandemic. Loneliness and lockdowns each appear to be independently associated with elevated insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cloonan, S.; Grandner, M.; Killgore, W.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.714","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A279, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A279, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20843,""
"Insomnia as a risk for PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated attempts to curb its spread have led to a significant increase in mental health issues. Evidence suggests that sleep provides a protective resilience against the adverse effects of stress. Moreover, sleep disruption is often considered the â€œhallmark symptomâ€ of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here we hypothesized that insomnia would increase during the first six months of the pandemic, and that higher insomnia would be associated with elevated rates of PTSD. Methods: A total of 6,190 adults ranging in age from 18 to 84 years (53.6% female), completed an online cross-sectional survey at one of six time points between April and September 2020 (~1,000 per administration). Instruments included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Primary Care PTSD Checklist (PC-PTSD), and the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5). Standard clinical cutoffs were used for ISI (=10) and PCL-5 (=38). Data were analyzed with analysis of variance, chi-square contingency tables, and bivariate correlations. Results: Over the first six-months of the pandemic, PTSD increased with each passing month on both the PC-PTSD (p=.001) and PCL-5 (p&lt;.0001). Similarly, ISI scores increased month-by-month (p&lt;.0002). Insomnia scores were highly correlated with PCL-5 PTSD scores (r=.62, p&lt;.0001), even when sleep items on the scale were excluded (r=.60, p&lt;.0001). Finally, the rate of PTSD remained below 5% across all months for those without insomnia, but among those with insomnia, the prevalence of PTSD increased between May (26% positive) and September (40% positive), representing an increase of 56% over the data collection period (interaction p=.0004). Conclusion: Both insomnia and PTSD have increased dramatically over the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, insomnia appears to be highly linked with the emergence of PTSD during this time. While it is not possible to make causal attributions from these cross-sectional findings, the steadily increasing rates of PTSD over time only among those with insomnia, raise the possibility that sleep disruption could act as a diathesis for the development of PTSD symptoms in response to the pandemic. Addressing insomnia during the pandemic may be an important aspect of maintaining psychological resilience in the populace.","Killgore, W.; Cloonan, S.; Taylor, E.; Grandner, M.; Dailey, N.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.713","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A279, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A279, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20844,""
"COVID-19 risk perception, sleep health and peritraumatic distress among New Yorkers: The NYU COVID-19 mental health study","Introduction: Long-term exposure to pandemics like COVID-19 may increase psychological distress (e.g., peri-traumatic and post-traumatic distress) and sleep problems. Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. Methods: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. Results: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228);PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = -.630(12.7);p &lt; .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71);p &lt;.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. Conclusion: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.","Blanc, J.; Seixas, A.; Bubu, O.; Briggs, A.; Compas, A.

"Sleep and mental health in college students before and during the initial COVID-19 shutdown","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unparalleled impact on college students. Following the initial and abrupt shutdown of campuses in March 2020, several investigators assessed the immediate effects on University students. Early reports found that college students reported a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression, sedentary behavior, and sleep problems. Most were conducted outside the U.S. Data from U.S. college students are critical to identify which areas are should receive resources and interventions as the U.S. continues to experience exponential COVID cases along with continued remote learning, social restrictions and/or lockdowns. Methods: Students enrolled in the Spring 2020 semester (18 years of age +) were invited to participate in an online survey (April - May 2020). A final sample of 491 completed the entire survey (length ~45 minutes) which asked about sleep quality, psychological stress, depression, and exercise.Paired t-tests were conducted to compare pre- COVID and during COVID data. Results: There were significant differences in sleep onset latency (26.44 Â± 23.53 min vs 32.06 Â± 26.88 min;t = -3.81, P &lt; .001), sleep duration (7.30 Â± 1.45 hours vs 7.63 Â± 2.07 hours;t = -2.23, p = 0.027) and overall sleep quality (6.29 Â± 3.29 vs 7.44 Â± 3.86;t = -7.26, p &lt; .001), as well as depression scores (IDS no sleep questions) (5.61 Â± 4.18 vs 17.59 Â± 5.45;t = -54.9, P &lt; .001). There was no difference in perceived stress (28.03 Â±5.27 vs 28.39 Â±5.53, t = -1.49, p = .138). Exercise (vigorous, moderate and walking) all decreased with regards to days and time spent, (all P's &lt; .001), whereas minutes sitting significantly increased (426.50 Â± 239.88 vs 542.26 Â± 249.63, p &lt; .001). Conclusion: These data empirically support the claim that the pandemic is having a significant negative impact on physical and mental health among college students. In the best of times, college students have irregular sleep patterns and significant depression, but these behaviors are worsened under government restrictions. These findings underscore the need to prioritize prevention and intervention of modifiable behaviors, especially if the pandemic extends into 2021.","Okun, M.; Walden, A.; Feliciano, L.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.704","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A275-A276, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A275-A276, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20846,""
"Daily associations between adolescent sleep and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Sleep disturbances after a trauma forecast mental health difficulties such as post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). COVID-19 has resulted in numerous stressors for youth (e.g., school closures, social isolation) that directly disrupt sleep and may have negative mental health consequences. However, investigations of sleep and adverse events in youth have primarily been limited to months or years after a trauma has occurred. How adolescent sleep patterns and mental health intersect during an ongoing adverse experience is unknown. Methods: Adolescents from the United States (N = 503;80.9% female;13-18 years) participated in an online daily diary study within 3 weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency. Participants completed one week of twice daily reports (5406 observations) on their nightly sleep (sleep timing, sleep quality, sleep onset difficulties, and nightmares) and daytime mental health symptoms (COVID-19 PTSS, positive affect, negative affect, and loneliness). Results: Mixed models adjusting for age, sex, and socioeconomic status indicated that cyclical, bidirectional effects emerged, with daytime mental health symptoms predicting same-night sleep disturbances, and sleep disturbances predicting next-day mental health. Greater PTSS predicted sleep onset difficulties (Estimate = .02, SE = .004, t = 5.56 p &lt; .001) and sleep onset difficulties predicted nextday PTSS (Estimate = .35, SE = .17, t = 2.04, p &lt; .05). Greater daytime negative affect predicted greater nightmares (Estimate = .07, SE = .01, t = 4.97, p &lt; .001), and nightmares predicted marginally more nextday negative affect (Estimate = .07, SE = .04, t = 1.66, p = .09). PTSS (Estimate = .01, SE = .003, t = 3.47, p &lt; .001) and negative affect (Estimate = .05, SE = .03, t = 2.06, p &lt; .05) both predicted poorer sleep quality the following night. Conclusion: Findings suggest that mental health symptoms during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with increased sleep disturbances. In turn, these sleep disturbances predict increased mental health symptoms. Overall, results provide a greater understanding of youth sleep patterns during COVID-19 and how sleep disturbances may inhibit resilience in the context of an ongoing stressor.","Palmer, C.; Oosterhoff, B.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.699","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A274, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A274, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20847,""
"Sleep quality, depression and anxiety in a community sample of Habana, Cuba during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: The 2020 Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected and killed millions of persons. To avoid virus spread, stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures were implemented worldwide. These measures have caused changes in work schedules and, subsequently, sleep habits. This study aims to examine sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression in a random community in Havana, Cuba during the pandemic lockdown period. Methods: This a descriptive cross-sectional study performed in a randomly selected neighbourhood, via direct door-to-door survey.

"Quality of sleep is the only predictor of suicide during COVID-19 lockdown in university students?","Introduction: COVID-19 epidemic led to great psychological and social stress, related to anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, suicidal risk and behavior, and changes in daily routine. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown in Italian students. We focused on perceived sleep quality, anxiety and depression symptoms, and mostly on risk of suicide. Methods: A total of 307 students (mean age 22.84Â±2.68) completed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). In our study, we focused on item 9 of BDI-II, that is related to suicide. We divided our sample on presence or absence of suicidal ideation based on this item. Results: We found that 30.1% showed depressive, while 38.2% anxious symptoms. Concerning item 9 of BDI-II (suicidal thoughts or wishes), 84.7% answered that they do not have any thoughts of killing themselves, while 15.3% answered that they have some suicidal ideation. Concerning sleep variables, we found that 58% of our sample showed a PSQI total score higher than 5 (poor quality of sleep), and a global worsening in sleep quality and increase of insomnia both in student with and without suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Our results on risk of suicide are in line with literature. Recent reviews focused on suicidal ideation in medical students found that depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation are common among medical students, finding a prevalence of suicidal ideation of 11%. Several studies suggest that sleep disorders are a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Our findings show that sleep cannot considered a predictive factor of risk of suicide during health emergency, because the risk is polyfactorial.","Castelnuovo, A.; Mombelli, S.; Bottoni, D.; Somma, A.; Fossati, A.; Ferini-Strambi, L.; Marelli, S.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.694","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A272, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A272, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20849,""
"Sleep education and sleep outcomes in the time of COVID-19 in Mexico","Introduction: This study examines computer-mediated sleep education for health providers enrolled in a certified diabetes educator program in November 2020 in Mexico. Methods: Data derived from pre/post ratings assessed knowledge of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), short sleep duration (SSD), circadian rhythm disorders (CRD), and drowsy driving (DD) on a 5-point Likert-like scale, and five true/ false questions regarding misconceptions about sleep. Outcomes included self-reported sleep problems among providers since the onset of the March 2020 Covid-19 surge in Mexico. Pre/post means were compared with paired t-tests using SPSS (V25) with significance set at p&lt;0.05. Results: Volunteer participants (N=23;83% women;52% nutritionists;48% health providers) were recruited from the fall semester 2020 diabetes educator certificate program. Means with standard deviations showed significant learning for all sleep disorders following the training (OSA: 3.1Â±1.0 to 4.4Â±0.78;Insomnia: 3.2Â±0.85 to 4.3Â±0.82;RLS: 2.1Â±1.2 to 4.2Â±0.95;SSD: 2.7 Â±1.1 to 4.4Â±0.72;CRD: 2.6Â±1.2 to 4.4Â±0.73;DD: 2.6Â±1.1 to 4.4Â±0.78, all p&lt;.0001). The total pre- to post-scores (Range=0 to 30) for sleep disorders moved from 16.3Â±5.7 to 26.3Â±4.4, p&lt;.0001. Participants demonstrated improved, but borderline significant findings regarding misconceptions about sleep from pre-to post-testing, p=.07. Of the 23 respondents, 18 (78%) reported sleep problems specific to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in Mexico. Of the 18 providers, 13 reported insomnia symptoms, while five indicated short sleep due to double shift work, anxiety and depression, or poor sleep quality. Conclusion: Participants (78%) reported sleep problems;particularly insomnia associated with anxiety, depression, poor sleep quality and extended shift work since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings are consistent with global studies of Covid-19 and sleep of health care workers. Online participants' significant learning for all sleep disorders was coherent with in-class learners (N=173). Pre-topost analyses of misconceptions about sleep, particularly sleep needs for adults and that daytime sleep can make up for lack of nighttime sleep, however, were not significant for these learners compared to the in-class learning groups.","Baldwin, C.; GamiÃ±o, S.

"Sleep latency, pre and peri-COVID-19 experiences and PTSD symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 mental health study","Introduction: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals' sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. Methods: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%);mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 Results: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = -.630(12.7);p &lt; .001];factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-COVID-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831);p = &gt;.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. Conclusion: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.","Rogers, A.; Blanc, J.; Seixas, A.; Nunes, J.; Casimir, G.; Jean-Louis, G.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.683","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A267-A268, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A267-A268, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20851,""
"Comparison of telemedicine and in-person psychotherapy for CPAP adherence in a population of veterans","Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the second most common sleep disorder among Veterans and carries risk of serious health complications when untreated. The gold standard for OSA treatment is Positive Airway Pressure (PAP). However, adherence to PAP therapy is chronically low. Interventions to enhance adherence include education, practical support, and psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing have been shown to improve CPAP usage by approximately 1 hour per night. Telemedicine-delivered CPAP education and telemonitoring-with-feedback has demonstrated improved adherence in patients with OSA. Our study evaluated the effectiveness of a telemedicine group psychotherapy intervention for Veterans diagnosed with OSA and found to be nonadherent to CPAP therapy. The intervention is delivered in four weekly 60-minute sessions. Methods: We identified a cohort of 29 patients who participated in the intervention via telemedicine from April 2020 - September 2020 (Telemedicine Psychotherapy cohort). The cohort was compared to a historical control of 35 patients who participated in the in-person group psychotherapy from April 2019 - September 2019 (In-Person Psychotherapy cohort). Through retrospective chart review, we analyzed baseline and post-intervention data from both cohorts. Demographics collected included age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, zip code, as well as medical and mental health comorbidities. Data collected from the medical record included: OSA severity, pre- and post-psychotherapy 90-day average nightly CPAP usage (in minutes), number of psychotherapy classes attended (out of 4) and number of sleep clinic visits at 90-days post-psychotherapy. We used descriptive statistics to provide summary data of this sample and t-test to evaluate Veteran's average CPAP usage per night and number of sleep clinic visits at 90-days post-psychotherapy between cohorts. Results: Compared to a cohort of in-person group psychotherapy to improve CPAP adherence, a telemedicine-based cohort demonstrated improvement in 90-day average nightly CPAP usage by an average of 76 minutes per night. (p=0.08) Additionally, patient engagement with the sleep clinic at 90 days following completion of telemedicine psychotherapy was significantly higher compared to in-person psychotherapy (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: In a haphazardly-collected convenient sample of veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine psychotherapy led to improved CPAP usage. Veterans who underwent telemedicine intervention also significantly increased engagement with the sleep clinic.","Keer, N.; Sharma, P.; Shrestha, R.; Freire, A.; Robinson, K.; Morris, K.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.681","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A267, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A267, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20852,""
"Predictors of sleep health among older adults during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Since the first COVID-19 case was reported in January 2020 in the United States, there have been more than 18.8 million cases and 330,000 deaths. In order to minimize the risk of potential COVID- 19 transmission, many states instituted stay at home orders and closed churches, gyms, and other places that older adults often participate in social gatherings. Little is known about sleep health among older adults during this time. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between older adult's personal factors, health behaviors, and sleep health during the initial months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Adults age 60 and older participated in an online anonymous survey recruited through email lists of community senior organizations and university alumni using a snowball approach. Personal factors included age (years), gender (female=0, male=1), living situation (living alone=0, living with others=1), education (=12 years = 0, &gt;12 years = 1), and income (75000=1), and depressive symptoms (CESD-10). Health Behaviors included moderate physical activity (0=none, 1=yes), smoking (0=no, 1=yes), drinking (number of drinks). Sleep Health was assessed using the multidimensional SATED scale (Satisfaction, Alertness, Timing, Efficiency, and Duration). Backward stepwise regression analysis was used to test if personal factors and health behaviors significantly predicted participants' sleep health. Results: Participants included 509 adults (392 Females;mean age=75.6 years;SD=5.0;range 63-93 years). The majority were white (n=466;92%) and 93% (n=471) had a college education. Seventy-four percent (n=71) participated in moderate exercise, 94% (n=478) did not smoke, and 58% (n=286) did not report drinking alcohol. Sleep Health was variable with 179 (36%) reporting poor sleep health (mean=7.4;SD=2.1). Regression results indicated that gender, years of education, living situation, income, depressive symptoms and moderate exercise explained 17% of the variance in sleep health (R2=0.169, F,6=14.4, p=0.000). Conclusion: These findings suggest that many older adults experienced poor sleep health associated with depressive symptoms and exercise participation during the initial months of the pandemic. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of the pandemic on the sleep health of older adults.","Lorenz, R.; Stallings, D.; Palmer, J.; Lach, H.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.676","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A265, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A265, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20853,""
"Increased nightmares during the COVID-19 pandemic: Exploring the role of resilience and emotions","Introduction: COVID-19 had a tremendous impact on many aspects of our lives and has caused an increase in stress and mental health issues in many people. We have recently found that there was an increase in nightmares during the pandemic in young adults. Since emotions have been associated with both resilience and nightmares, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of resilience and emotional changes in the increase in nightmares observed during the pandemic, in a group of young adults. Methods: Resilience, emotions and nightmares were assessed using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10, the Differential Emotions Scale-IV and an adapted version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Measures were administered to 209 young adults (18-25 years old, 76.1% females). Hierarchical multiple regression models were computed to examine the unique contribution of changes in positive and negative emotions during the pandemic to the increase in nightmares during the pandemic. Analyses were controlled for nightmares and emotions prior to COVID-19, and for gender. The sample was separated in two groups: resilient and less resilient young adults. Results: Results show that in less resilient young adults, nightmares prior to COVID-19 (ÃŸ=.79, p&lt;.001) and increase in negative emotions (ÃŸ=.21, p=.033) significantly predicted nightmares during the pandemic and explained 67.0% of their variance. In resilient young adults, nightmares prior to COVID-19 (ÃŸ=.56, p&lt;.001) and gender (ÃŸ=-.15, p=.04) significantly predicted nightmares during the pandemic and explained 52.0% of the variance. Conclusion: Our results show that increase in negative emotions during the pandemic is associated with an increase in nightmares in less resilient young adults, but not in resilient young adults. Furthermore, our results show that in resilient young adults, being a woman is associated with an increase in nightmares during the pandemic. These results suggest that resilience may be a protective factor in managing the impact of negative emotions on nightmares, but only in men.","Potvin, J.; Socarras, L.

"Characteristics of respondents to a virtual trial of a digital behavioral treatment for insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Rates of sleep disturbance and sleep medication use have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, at a time when face-to-face delivery of behavioral insomnia treatments is severely limited. To support research during the pandemic, the FDA released guidelines promoting the use of â€œalternative methodsâ€ to conduct trials in a virtual or decentralized manner. Currently, few data exist regarding the impact of virtual trial enrollment during a pandemic. This abstract presents data from a decentralized, open-label, single-arm real-world clinical trial of the Somryst prescription digital therapeutic for insomnia, which provides insight on who seeks care for insomnia using virtual research methods. Methods: In alignment with FDA guidance, the DREAM trial began enrolling patients in March, 2020 with an expected final sample size of 350 adults (Clinical Trial # NCT04325464). This abstract presents data from participants seeking enrollment into the trial via an online screening. Demographic and sleep variables were collected to confirm eligibility. Results: Of 1,063 respondents, the majority were female (62%) and the most common age brackets were ages 30-39 (22%);40-49 (20%);and 50-59 (20%). Most respondents (63.8%) did not report being under the care of a healthcare provider for their insomnia. Respondents reported sleep problems for an average of 12.9 years;sleep problems 5 nights/week;and sleeping an average of 5.4 hours/night. Geographic diversity was high with respondents from 45 states and Washington DC. Of those passing initial screening (N=270), 5.5% reported having another diagnosed sleep disorder, 14.4% reported a comorbid psychological condition, 58.9% reported taking a medication for insomnia, and 30.7% reported taking a medication for depression. Using the Insomnia Severity Index, 16.7% had subthreshold/mild insomnia (score 8-14), 60.0% had moderate insomnia (score 15-21), and 23.7% had severe insomnia (score &gt; 21). Conclusion: Respondents to this decentralized trial reported moderate-severe, long-lasting insomnia with high rates of medication use for sleep and depression. Results demonstrate that virtual trials can quickly draw a highly geographically diverse research population, overcoming logistical challenges inherent in a pandemic and resulting in recruiting appropriate, but more geographically diverse, samples than those typically observed in randomized trials of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).","Thorndike, F.; Saver, K.; Braun, S.; Williams, K.; Xiong, X.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.662","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A259-A260, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A259-A260, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20855,""
"Improved sleep after a brief intervention for insomnia mediates improvements in depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: The COVID-19 Pandemic and mitigation efforts have led to drastic increases in acute insomnia symptoms, which left untreated may contribute to increased risk for other negative mental health outcomes, including depression. However, the impact of treating acute insomnia symptoms on future depression outcomes remains unknown. Moreover, whether sleep improvements as a result of an insomnia treatment mediate subsequent reduction of depression symptoms similarly remains unknown. Methods: At this writing, 44 individuals experiencing insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index;ISI = 10) that began during the COVID-19 pandemic have been randomized to receive a brief, telehealth Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) waitlist control. Treatment was delivered in 4 sessions over a 5-week period. CBTI is the gold-standard behavioral intervention for chronic insomnia and has been applied successfully via telemedicine. Outcome measures were depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) minus the sleep item and insomnia symptom severity as measured by the ISI. Both outcome measures were collected at baseline (week 0), throughout treatment phase (weeks 2-6), and at the post-treatment (week 7). Linear mixed models determined the impact of treatment on depression and insomnia symptom severity. Mediation was tested using the MacArthur framework. Results: There was a significant Group x Time interaction, with CBTI leading to a greater rate of improvement in ISI (b = -1.14, p &lt; 0.001) and PHQ-9 (b = -0.61, p = 0.002) than the control. Critically, the rate of improvement in insomnia symptoms to the last session of treatment, was associated with the subsequent improvement in depressive symptoms post-treatment (b = 2.06, p = 0.017). In contrast, depressive symptom improvement was not associated with insomnia symptom improvement (b = 4.28, p = 0.102). Conclusion: This preliminary data suggests that brief CBTI can reduce pandemic onset insomnia and other depressive symptoms. The preliminary mediation results further suggest that sleep may be an important treatment target for reducing situational depressive symptoms and supports the need to examine the physiological mechanisms of sleep using high-density EEG in a larger sample.","O'Hora, K.; Lopez, M.; Morehouse, A.; Cordero, A.; Osorno, R.; Manber, R.; Goldstein-Piekarski, A.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.661","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A259, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A259, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20856,""
"Chronotype associations with insomnia, depressive symptoms, and changes in sleep and health behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Evening chronotype (i.e., night owl preference) is associated with worse insomnia and depressive symptoms, and poorer health behaviors. The aim of this study was to examine the association between chronotype and these symptoms and health behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic quarantine. Methods: An online survey, distributed internationally via social media from 5/21/2020-7/1/2020, asked adults to report sociodemographic/economic information, changes in sleep (midpoint, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, time-in-bed), and health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary screen time, and outdoor light exposure patterns) from prior to during the pandemic, chronotype preference (definitely morning [DM], rather more morning [RM], rather more evening [RE], or definitely evening [DE]), and complete the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). Multinomial logistic regression and ANCOVA models, adjusting for age and sex, examined associations of chronotype with COVID-19 pandemic related impacts on sleep, depressive symptoms, and health behaviors. Results: A subsample of 579 participants (M age: 39y, range: 18-80;73.6% female), currently under quarantine and neither pregnant nor performing shift work, represented each chronotype evenly (~25%). Participants delayed their sleep midpoint by 72.0min (SD=111.5) during the pandemic. DE chronotypes had a greater delay than morning types (MÂ±SD DE: 91.0Â±9.0 vs. RM: 55.9Â±9.2 & DM: 66.1Â±9.3;p=0.046) with no significant change in other sleep patterns relative to other chronotypes. However, DE and RE chronotypes had greater odds of reporting that their new sleep/wake schedule was still not consistent with their â€œbody clockâ€ preference relative to morning types (X2[15]=54.8, p&lt;0.001), reported greater ISI (F[3,503]=5.3, p=.001) and CES-D-10 scores (F[3,492]=7.9, p&lt;.001), and had greater odds for increased or consistently moderate-to-high sedentary screen time (X2[12]=22.7, p=0.03) and decreased physical activity (X2[12]=22.5, p=0.03) than DM chronotype. There was no significant difference in change in outdoor light exposure by chronotype (X2[12]=12.1, p=0.43). Conclusion: In an international online sample of adults under COVID-19 pandemic quarantine, evening chronotypes, despite taking the opportunity to delay sleep to match biological clock preference, reported their sleep/wake schedules were still inconsistent with personal preference, and reported greater insomnia and depressive symptoms, and odds of engaging in poorer health behaviors than morning chronotypes.","Petrov, M.; Buman, M.; Epstein, D.; Youngstedt, S.; Hoffmann, N.; Mattingly, J.; Hasanaj, K.; Jiao, N.; Kasraeian, K.; Sominsky, A.; Stievater, E.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.658","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A258, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A258, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20857,""
"Self-isolation due to COVID-19 was not associated with changes in depression, sleepiness, and insomnia in Shiga prefecture, Japan","Introduction: We aimed to analyze the changes in depression, sleepiness, insomnia, and sleep habits in relation to the degree of self-isolation due to COVID-19 pandemic. A state of emergency was declared for the whole of Japan on 7 April 2020. People in Shiga prefecture were recommended to stay at home and refrain from moving to other prefectures from 8 April to 31 May 2020. Methods: We enrolled 54 patients who regularly visited the sleep outpatient clinic in Shiga University of Medical Science Hospital, Japan. We compared the sleep habits, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9: PHQ-9), insomnia (Athens Insomnia Scale: AIS), and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale: ESS) of patients, one year before (from April to July 2019), during (May 2020) and six months after (Nov 2020) the self-isolation period due to the COVID-19. We conducted repeated measures ANOVA to examine changes. Results: PHQ-9 (3.89Â±0.64, 3.65Â±0.62 and 3.52Â±0.66: p=0.410), AIS (4.78Â±0.59, 4.65Â±0.57 and 4.63Â±0.57: p=0.843) and ESS (7.93Â±0.76, 7.07Â±0.68 and 7.00Â±0.73: p=0.088) were not significantly different among three visits.

"The association between sleep and psychological distress among New York healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Healthcare workers (HCWs) treating patients with COVID-19 report high rates of acute stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms. We examined whether sleep disturbances were associated with psychological distress in New York City (NYC) HCWs during the initial peak of COVID-19 in-patient admissions (April 9 - May 11, 2020). Methods: HCWs (physicians, nurses, and advanced practice providers) completed a web-based survey which screened for acute stress (4-item Primary Care PTSD screen), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), and anxiety (2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale). Past week insomnia symptoms were assessed with a modified item from the Insomnia Severity Index (5-point Likert Scale: none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe). Insomnia was defined as having â€œmoderate, severe, or very severeâ€ symptoms. Short sleep (SS) was defined as self-reported sleep duration &lt;6 hours per day. Poisson regression analyses predicting psychological distress from SS and, separately insomnia. adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, clinical setting (COVID-focused or not COVID-focused), physician vs. nonphysician status, and redeployment status, were performed. Results: Data included 813 HCWs (80.6% female, 59.0% White, 75.6% worked in a COVID-focused setting). Mean sleep duration was 5.79 Â± 1.22 hours/night. The prevalence of SS and insomnia were 38.8% and 72.8%;the prevalence of acute stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety were 57.9%, 33.8% and 48.2%, respectively. Having SS, vs. not was associated with acute stress (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.31), depressive symptoms (PR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.02), and anxiety (PR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.74). Presence of insomnia symptoms vs. â€œnone or mildâ€ was associated with acute stress (PR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.57, 2.34), depressive symptoms (PR: 3.13, 95% CI: 2.16, 4.52), and anxiety (PR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.86, 3.11). Conclusion: Among NYC HCWs, sleep disturbances, including SS and insomnia symptoms during COVID-19 are common. In our study, SS and insomnia were associated with acute stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety in HCWs, however further research on whether a bidirectional relationship exists between sleep and psychological distress during the COVID19 pandemic are still needed.","Diaz, F.; Bramley, S.; Venner, H.; Shaw, K.; McMurry, C.; Cornelius, T.; Schwartz, J.; Shechter, A.; Abdalla, M.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.648","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A254, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A254, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20859,""
"Coping strategies moderate the effect of perceived stress on sleep and health in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is an enormous stressor that can impact various dimensions of health, including sleep health. Older adults may be particularly vulnerable. Coping strategies to manage stress can also impact health outcomes by modifying the relationships between perceived stress and health outcomes. This study examined concurrent and longitudinal associations between perceived stress and sleep health, mental health, physical health, and overall perceived health outcomes among older adults. We also examined whether coping strategies moderate these associations. Methods: Older adults (n = 115;Mage = 68.62, 58.3% female) reported perceived stress (PSS), coping strategies (Brief COPE), global sleep quality (PSQI global sleep quality score and dichotomous good/ poor sleep quality), depressive symptoms (CES-D), and perceived mental, physical, and overall health (RAND-12) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The number of individuals with poor sleep quality was greater during the COVID-19 pandemic than before (50% vs. 36.5%). Participants also reported poorer physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. Hierarchical linear regression and hierarchical logistic regression revealed that higher perceived stress was crosssectionally associated with poorer sleep (e.g., higher total PSQI score and dichotomous sleep quality category). Higher perceived stress was associated with worse depressive symptoms and global mental health concurrently and longitudinally. Coping strategies moderated the relationships between perceived stress and physical health and overall perceived health. For example, higher perceived stress was associated with poorer overall perceived health for those who have lower problem-focused coping-but not for those with higher problemfocused coping-both concurrently and longitudinally. Conclusion: Perceived stress influences cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of sleep health and general health among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coping strategies can moderate the effects of perceived stress on health outcomes. Older adults may benefit from prevention and intervention strategies targeting stress management and problem-focused coping strategies.","Tracy, E.; Chin, B.; Lehrer, H.

"Remotely delivered yoga NIDRA for insomnia and anxiety during COVID-19","Introduction: Insomnia and related anxiety affect 30 - 50% of the US adult population. These conditions often coexist, and contribute to increased mortality from depression, heart disease, and stroke. The current COVID-19 pandemic has heightened anxiety and sleeplessness, and 53% of US adults report the pandemic has affected their mental health. There is a need for research into therapies for anxiety and insomnia that can be delivered remotely for increased accessibility to reach more individuals in need. Methods: To contribute to this need, we examined the effects of remotely delivered Yoga Nidra (translated to mean â€œyogic sleepâ€), a guided meditation practice, on anxiety and sleep. The practice was delivered in real-time before bed, or asynchronously via an online REDCap-based platform, once per week for 16-weeks from April to July (during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic). Results: Seventy-four individuals joined the study, of whom 71% reported subthreshold insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index score of 14 Â± 4), and 74% reported anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Index score of 10 Â± 5). Seventy-one (96%) participants accessed the asynchronous recordings. Remote delivery of this practice proved very feasible, with no adverse events reported, and although we provided no monetary compensation, 50% of our sample still completed a postintervention survey. Further, 52% of n=25 respondents who completed both pre- and post-intervention sleep surveys reported decreased sleep onset latency (SOL) the following day, with a mean decrease of 10 minutes (95% CI = -19.0, -0.5) for all respondents, and strongest change (-34 min;p=.017) measured for those who reported SOL between 30-120 min at baseline. Overall state anxiety was decreased by 41% for n=32 respondents who completed pre-post State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) surveys surrounding a single practice (average score of 47 Â± 11 before practice vs. 27 Â± 8 after practice, p&lt;.0001). Conclusion: Remotely delivered Yoga Nidra is feasible to deliver, and demonstrates potential benefits for anxiety and insomnia, warranting additional research.

"Adolescent sleep variability, social jetlag, and mental health during COVID-19: Findings from a large nationwide study","Introduction: Adolescents are vulnerable to short, insufficient sleep stemming from a combined preference for late bedtimes and early school start times, and also circadian disruptions from frequent shifts in sleep schedules (i.e., social jetlag). These sleep disruptions are associated with poor mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted education nationwide, including changes in instructional formats and school schedules. With data from the Nationwide Education and Sleep in TEens During COVID (NESTED) study, we examined whether sleep variability and social jetlag (SJL) during the pandemic associate with mental health. Methods: Analyses included online survey data from 4767 students (grades 6-12, 46% female, 36% non-White, 87% high school). For each weekday, participants identified if they attended school in person (IP), online-scheduled synchronous classes (O/S), online-no scheduled classes (asynchronous, O/A), or no school. Students reported bedtimes (BT) and wake times (WT) for each instructional format and for weekends/ no school days. Sleep opportunity (SlpOpp) was calculated from BT and WT. Weekday night-to-night SlpOpp variability was calculated with mean square successive differences. SJL was calculated as the difference between the average sleep midpoint on free days (O/A, no school, weekends) versus scheduled days (IP, O/S). Participants also completed the PROMIS Pediatric Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms Short Form. Data were analyzed with hierarchical linear regressions controlling for average SlpOpp, gender, and school-level (middle vs high school). Results: Mean reported symptoms of anxiety (60.0 Â±9.1;14%<U+2267>70) and depression (63.4 Â±10.2;22%<U+2267>70) fell in the at-risk range. Shorter average SlpOpp (mean=8.3Â±1.2hrs) was correlated with higher anxiety (r=-.10) and depression (r=-.11;p's&lt;.001) T-scores. Greater SlpOpp variability was associated with higher anxiety (B=.71 [95%CI=.41- 1.01, p&lt;.001) and depression (B=.67 [.33-1.00], p&lt;.001) T-scores. Greater SJL (mean=1.8Â±1.2hrs;94% showed a delay in midpoint) was associated with higher anxiety (B=.36 [.12-.60], p&lt;.001) and depression (B=.77 [.50-1.03], p&lt;.001) T-scores. Conclusion: In the context of system-wide education changes during COVID-19, students on average reported at-risk levels of anxiety and depression symptoms which were associated with greater variability in sleep opportunity across school days and greater social jetlag. Our findings suggest educators and policymakers should consider these sleep-mental health associations when developing instructional formats and school schedules during and post-pandemic.","Wong, P.; Wolfson, A.; Honaker, S.; Owens, J.; Wahlstrom, K.; Saletin, J.; Seixas, A.; Meltzer, L.; Carskadon, M.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.237","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A95, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A95, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20862,""
"COVID-19 related worries and sleep disturbances in patients previously hospitalized with COVID-19 illness","Introduction: In patients hospitalized for COVID-19 illness, sleep disturbances after discharge may impact quality of life and prognosis. We examined the relationship of COVID-19-related worries with sleep disturbances in patients three months after COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 illness completed a survey three months post-discharge (n=153). We measured COVID- 19-related worry along two domains: worry directly related to the disease (COVID-illness worry) and worry related to the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic (COVID-impact worry). COVID-illness worry included worry regarding: 1) getting COVID again, 2) dying from COVID, 3) family members getting COVID, 4) losing a loved one to COVID, 5) unknowingly infecting others with COVID, 6) having significant financial burdens because of COVID. COVID-impact included worry regarding: 1) employment loss, 2) not having enough food, 3) not having access to medical care/medications, 4) not having access to mental health care/medications, 5) reduction in interactions with other people, 6) separation from family members, 7) being lonely. Patients rated how much they worried about each item on a 4-point scale (not at all, a little, moderately, extremely). Scores on each domain were summed to reflect overall severity. Past month sleep was assessed for insomnia symptoms (none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe) and self-reported sleep duration. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of COVID-illness worry and COVID-impact worry, separately, with sleep measures, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and presence of persistent COVID-related symptoms. Results: The prevalence of insomnia (moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms) and short sleep duration (&lt;6 h/day) was 47.0% and 39.2%, respectively. COVID-illness worry severity was significantly associated with presence of insomnia (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.13-3.23, p=0.016) and short sleep (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.25-3.86, p=0.006). In a separate model, COVID-impact worry severity was significantly associated with presence of insomnia (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.23-3.19, p=0.005) and short sleep (OR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.26-3.55, p=0.005). Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are common among patients previously hospitalized with COVID-19 illness, and COVID-19 related worries are associated with insomnia and short sleep. Additional research is needed to determine whether addressing COVID-19 related worries reduces sleep disturbance, which in turn may promote post- COVID recovery.","Shechter, A.; Abdalla, M.; Raju, D.; Kronish, I.; Liyanage-Don, N.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.232","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A93, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A93, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20863,""
"COVID stress and sleep disturbance among a racially/ethnically diverse sample of adolescents: Analysis from the nested study","Introduction: Using data from the Nationwide Education and Sleep in TEens During COVID (NESTED) study (N=6,578), we investigated if race/ethnicity (64.6% were White and 35.4% identified as a racial/ ethnic minority, mixed, or â€œotherâ€) and community social vulnerability affected the association between COVID stress and sleep disturbance. Methods: Data on sociodemographic factors (age, race, sex, grade, zip code [for neighborhood social vulnerability index, SVI]), COVID-related stress, depression, anxiety, instructional format (online, in-person, or hybrid), and sleep disturbance (PROMIS Pediatric Sleep Disturbance) were captured through an online survey. Descriptive and inferential analyses (Hierarchical Binary Logistic Regression (HBLR), SPSS v. 25) in 4171 adolescents examined associations between sleep disturbance and COVID-related stress, adjusting for race, sex, SVI, grade level, learning format, household density, and mental health factors. Results: Sleep disturbance was prevalent among adolescents (89% above average, T-score &gt;50);about two-thirds (64.4%) reported greater stress due to the pandemic. Compared to White (88.5%) adolescents, sleep disturbance was more common in Black (91.2%), Hispanic (90.5%), American Indian/Alaska native (95.1%), and Mixed (92.3%) and less common in Asian (83.9%) adolescents. Chi-square analysis indicated that both race/ethnicity (-2 = 14.96, p&lt;.05) and SVI (-2 = 8.34, p&lt;.05) had an effect on sleep disturbance. HBLR analysis indicated that compared to pre-pandemic, adolescents reporting â€œlittle stressâ€ (OR=.70, 95% CI= .49-.99, p=.04) or â€œthe â€same amount of stress' (OR=.64, 95% CI= .47-.89, p=.007) had lower odds of sleep disturbance. Higher depression (OR=1.06, 95% CI=1.04-1.07, p&lt;.001) and anxiety (OR=1.05, 95% CI=1.04-1.07, p&lt;.001) symptoms increased odds of sleep disturbance, while male gender lowered odds of sleep disturbance (OR=.11, 95% CI=.015-.86, p&lt;.05). Overall, race/ethnicity (p=.44) and SVI (p=.45) did not independently predict sleep disturbance. Race/ethnicity stratified analyses indicated that for Black and Hispanic adolescents, being in grades 11/ 12 and depression predicted sleep disturbance;and for Asian adolescents SVI and anxiety predicted sleep disturbance. Conclusion: COVID-related stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with sleep disturbance. We observed differences in sleep disturbance across racial/ethnic groups and neighborhood social vulnerability strata, for specific racial/ethnic groups.","Seixas, A.; Honaker, S.; Wolfson, A.; Wahlstrom, K.; Owens, J.; Wong, P.; Saletin, J.; Tsvetovat, M.; Carskadon, M.; Meltzer, L.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.231","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A92-A93, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A92-A93, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20864,""
"The association of prior mental health conditions with COVID-19-related sleep changes","Introduction: Among persons with mental health conditions, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep health is underexplored. The present study investigated whether sleep changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic differed among individuals with mood and/or anxiety disorders compared to individuals without these disorders. Methods: A 25-minute online survey, distributed globally to adults aged &gt;18y through social media advertising from 5/28/2020- 7/10/2020, examined the association of mental health diagnoses with COVID-19 related sleep changes. Participants reported prior history of mood and anxiety disorders, and pre-COVID-19 and current sleep patterns including bedtime, wake time, total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE:[TST/time in bed*100%], and nightmare frequency/wk. ANOVA models comparing mental health disorder groups (no diagnoses, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, mood and anxiety disorders) on mean differences in sleep changes were conducted. Results: Among 1,048 participants, 71.5% reported no prior mood and/or anxiety disorders9.3% reported anxiety disorders only, 4.3% reported prior mood disorders only, and 14.9% reported both mood and anxiety disorders. There were significant group differences in total sleep time (F (3,670)=4.6, p=0.003) and sleep efficiency (F (3,670) =2.8, p=0.038) such that individuals with both mood and anxiety disorders experienced greater decreases in total sleep time (Mean Difference: 39.0min, SE=13.0) and sleep efficiency (Mean Difference=3.8%, SE=1.6) compared to individuals without any mood or anxiety disorders. In addition, the model for nightmare frequency per week was significant (F(3,654)=5.6, p=0.001) such that individuals with both anxiety and mood disorders (Mean Difference=1.1, SE=0.4) and individuals with mood disorders only (Mean Difference=1.1, SE=0.4) reported greater increases in nightmare frequency compared to participants without any mood or anxiety disorders. There were no group differences in bedtime and wake time.

"Poor sleep as a predictor of COVID-19 related stress, fear and sadness in young adolescents: A longitudinal study","Introduction: Adolescence is a transitional life-stage accompanied by large biopsychosocial changes and greater psychophysiological vulnerability. Global events like the COVID-19 pandemic may increase vulnerability to depression and anxiety in this population. Poor sleep is often associated with depression, and both sleep and mood have been shown to be strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with most studies focusing on adults. The current study investigates psychological distress in young adolescents during the pandemic, and specifically, whether poor sleep before the pandemic predicts psychological distress. Methods: Self-report data were analyzed from 3099 adolescents (9-10 years at baseline) in the population-based, demographically diverse, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study across three pre-pandemic annual visits and 3 monthly time points during the COVID-19 pandemic (ages 11-13 years). At each assessment, children and their guardians completed questionnaires including those about sleep, environment, and psychological wellbeing. Gradient Boosted Tree machine learning algorithms were used to identify the strongest predictors of pandemic-related psychological distress in individuals. We trained models using pre-pandemic sleep measures along with demographics, economic, and social measures during the pandemic. We evaluated the performance of the models using area under curve (AUC) metrics and interpreted the models by using the recently proposed SHapley Additive exPlanations methodology. Results: Pandemic-related perceived stress, fear and sadness were accurately detected with our classifiers (AUC = 0.83 for perceived stress, AUC = 0.73 for fear, AUC = 0.79 for sadness). Across all models, shorter sleep duration, prolonged sleep onset latency, and longer time between waking and getting out of bed predicted greater distress. Moreover, female sex, and pandemic-related factors, including greater family conflict, fewer economic resources, and more screen time contributed to prediction performance in all three models. Conclusion: Findings highlight the importance of addressing sleep problems and ensuring sufficient sleep duration in children to protect against the psychological impact of major life events, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the long-lasting effects of sleep, it would be crucial to improve sleep health by targeted prevention, intervention and increased awareness among adolescents.","Kiss, O.; Alzueta, E.; Yuksel, D.; Durley, I.; Volpe, L.; Dulai, T.; Arra, N.; Obilor, T.; Pohl, K.; De Zambotti, M.; Baker, F.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.226","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A90-A91, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A90-A91, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20866,""
"Digital media use and sleep in college students during COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: To address the growing sleep deficiency epidemic in college students, more research is needed on recent factors that might affect sleep, such as the digital media use in this young adult population. Furthermore, sleep and the use of digital media can be heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to examine the use of digital media during the pandemic, and its relationship with sleep disturbance, social isolation, physical and mental health in college students. Methods: An online survey was sent out to college students enrolled in an urban university. Validated questionnaires including PROMIS (Sleep Disturbance, Global Mental Health, Global Physical Health, Social Isolation), Nighttime Media Usage, and Internet Addition Test were included in the survey. In addition, focus groups were conducted with a subsample of survey respondents to elicit a comprehensive understanding of how digital media use in daily life influences sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection was conducted during June to December 2020. Results: A total of 358 students completed the online survey. Sleep disturbance was significantly related to greater digital media use for recreational purposes two hours before bedtime (62.6Â±28.1 minutes, r=0.110, p=0.046), and a higher frequency of playing games (r=0.148, p=0.007) and using social media after going to bed (r=0.142, p=0.10). Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with social isolation (r=0.251, p&lt;0.001), poor global physical health (r=-0.186, p&lt;0.001) and mental health (r=-0.376, p&lt;0.001), and lower GPA (r=-0.167, p=0.004). Additionally, seven focus groups were conducted in a total of 32 students, suggesting that the increase in free time from the COVID-19 pandemic led to greater digital media use, compromising sleep duration and quality. With the increase of screen time also came feeling of guilt and anxiety which often led to greater awareness and self-control around media use. Conclusion: Nighttime digital media use during the challenging pandemic time has a significant impact on poor sleep, which may lead to decreased academic performance, greater social isolation, and poor physical and mental health in college students. Effective interventions targeting digital media use are needed to improve sleep in this population.","Li, W.; Ye, L.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.223","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A89-A90, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A89-A90, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20867,""
"Changes in dream recall during the COVID-19 pandemic: Associations with sleep, stress and dream content","Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals have faced unprecedented events, which are often stressful. Stress has an important impact on dreams, and stress-induced sleep difficulties may also impact dream recall. The present study evaluated associations between sleep, stress and dream content on dream recall during the pandemic. Methods: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants were asked if they remember more, fewer or about the same amount of dreams as before the pandemic. They were also asked whether the pandemic was associated with more stress, a more regular schedule, improved sleep, worse sleep, more early insomnia, more middle-of-the-night insomnia, more sleepiness, and more naps. They also completed the Insomnia Severity Index, Fatigue Severity Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Brief Index of Sleep Control, Assessment of Sleep Environment, GAD-7 anxiety scale, and PHQ9 depression scale. Multinomial logistic regressions examined correlates of increased or decreased recall (versus same), adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Results: Those who experienced greater schedule regularity were less likely to report decreased recall (RRR=0.50,p&lt;0.0005), as were those who reported sleep improvement (RRR=0.48,p=0.006). Those whose sleep worsened were more likely to report both increased (RRR=1.64,p=0.003) and decreased (RRR=2.16,p&lt;0.0005) recall. Those suffering maintenance insomnia were more likely to report both increased (RRR=1.70,p=0.001) and decreased (RRR=2.68,p&lt;0.0005) recall, as did those who reported more daytime sleepiness (Increased RRR=1.57,p=0.006;Decreased RRR=1.94,p=0.001). Those whose dream content was more negative were more likely to report both increased (RRR=4.05,p&lt;0.005) and decreased (RRR=3.35,p&lt;0.0005) recall, as did those who reported less negative content (Increased RRR=4.20,p&lt;0.0005;Decreased RRR=5.05,p&lt;0.0005). Similarly, those who reported more positive dream content reported both increased (RRR=17.37,p&lt;0.0005) and decreased (RRR=7.14,p=0.02) recall, as did those who reported less positive content (Increased RRR=4.49,p&lt;0.0005;Decreased RRR=5.59,p&lt;0.0005). Less recall was associated with greater insomnia severity (RRR=1.08,p=0.001), fatigue (RRR=1.04,p=0.001), sleepiness (RRR=1.09,p=0.01), COVID stress (RRR=1.67,p=0.03), anxiety (RRR=1.08,p=0.01), and depression (RRR=1.06,p=0.007), worse sleep environment (RRR=1.06,p=0.005), and less sleep control (RRR=0.56,p=0.001). Conclusion:: The results of this survey suggest that a sudden decrease in dream recall in reaction to a new stress could be considered as a pejorative indicator regarding sleep quality and mental health.","Wills, C.; Kennedy, K.; Bastien, C.; Ruby, P.; Killgore, W.

"Nightmare content during the COVID-19 pandemic: Influence of COVID-related stress and sleep disruption","Introduction: Nightmares are often associated with psychiatric disorders, though acute stress can also induce them. This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced the frequency and content of nightmares. Methods: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants were asked the degree to which they agree with statements including that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they have greater general stress, worse overall sleep, and more middle-of-the-night insomnia. They were also asked if they experienced nightmares during the pandemic on a range of topics, including confinement, claustrophobia, suffocation, oppression, drowning, failure, helplessness, natural disasters, anxiety, evil forces, war, domestic abuse, separation from loved ones, totalitarian regimes, being chased, dangerous animals, sickness, death, COVID- 19, and apocalypse. Logistic regression analyses examined each nightmare content as outcome and increased stress, worse sleep, and more middle-of-the-night insomnia as predictors, adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Results: Those who reported greater general COVID-related stress were more likely to have nightmares about confinement (OR=1.66,p&lt;0.03), failure (OR=1.64,p&lt;0.005), helplessness (OR=2.89, 0&lt;0.0005), anxiety (OR=2.37,p&lt;0.0005), war (OR=3.42,p&lt;0.0005), separation (OR=2.23,p&lt;0.0005), totalitarianism (OR=3.78,p&lt;0.003), sickness (OR=1.92,p&lt;0.003), death (OR=1.66,p&lt;0.01), COVID (OR=1.96,p&lt;0.01), and apocalypse (OR=2.92,p&lt;0.0005). Those who reported worsened sleep were more likely to have nightmares about confinement (OR=1.80,p&lt;0.003), oppression (OR=2.99,p&lt;0.0005), failure (OR=2.12,p&lt;0.0005), helplessness (OR=1.67, 0&lt;0.0005), disaster (OR=1.86,p&lt;0.005), anxiety (OR=1.97,p&lt;0.0005), evil forces (OR=1.56,p&lt;0.02), war (OR=2.08,p&lt;0.002), domestic abuse (OR=2.22,p&lt;0.009), separation (OR=2.01,p&lt;0.0005), totalitarianism (OR=3.39,p&lt;0.0005), sickness (OR=1.74,p=0.003), death (OR=2.03,p&lt;0.0005), COVID (OR=2.15,p&lt;0.001), and apocalypse (OR=1.86,p&lt;0.006). Those who reported worsened middleof- the-night insomnia were more likely to have nightmares about confinement (OR=1.60,p&lt;0.01), oppression (OR=1.97,p&lt;0.002), failure (OR=2.00,p&lt;0.0005), helplessness (OR=1.60,p&lt;0.001), disaster (OR=1.52,p&lt;0.04), anxiety (OR=2.27,p&lt;0.0005), war (OR=2.10,p&lt;0.001), domestic abuse (OR=1.74,p&lt;0.04), separation (OR=1.86,p&lt;0.0005), totalitarianism (OR=1.87,p&lt;0.03), sickness (OR=1.80,p&lt;0.001), death (OR=2.00,p&lt;0.0005), COVID (OR=1.68,p&lt;0.009), and apocalypse (OR=1.65,p&lt;0.01).

"COVID-19 pandemic sleep disturbances related to stress experiences at the US-Mexico border","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many individuals at the vulnerable US-Mexico border region in a variety of ways. Fear, worry, and stress have increased for many, as has poor sleep. The present study evaluated the degree to which worsened sleep due to the pandemic impacted stress experiences. Methods: Participants were N=155 individuals who completed the Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NOCHES) and were contacted about completing a COVID sub-study (95% Hispanic/Latino). They were asked the degree to which their sleep worsened due to the pandemic. They also reported the degree to which they agreed with statements regarding various pandemic-related stress experiences. These included infection-related stresses, stresses about community impact, personal psychosocial stresses, stresses about consequences of potential infection, media and society-related stresses, feelings of safety, and how the pandemic has impacted home life. Ordinal logistic regressions were used to determine whether changes in sleep were associated with agreement with statements about pandemic-related stress experiences, adjusted for age, sex, financial status, education, and mental health (PHQ4). Results: Those who perceived that their sleep worsened were more likely to report greater endorsement of beliefs that they were infected (ordinal Odds Ratio [oOR]=2.82,p&lt;0.0005), they could possibly be infected (oOR=1.98,p=0.003), they feared testing (oOR=1.94,p=0.006), COVID- 19 would impact their community (oOR=1.75,p=0.017) and would do so for a long time (oOR=1.90,p=0.006), they experience more general (oOR=4.10,p&lt;0.0005), financial (oOR=3.15,p&lt;0.0005), food-related (oOR=2.97,p&lt;0.0005), housing-related (oOR=2.14,p=0.002), familyrelated (oOR=2.53,p&lt;0.0005) and relationship (oOR=3.37,p&lt;0.0005) stress, their shopping was impacted by scarcity (oOR=1.76,p=0.014), and they are at high risk for COVID (oOR=1.87,p=0.008). Furthermore, media coverage of COVID-19 had increased their stress (oOR=2.46,p&lt;0.0005), there is too much panic about COVID-19 (oOR=1.67,p=0.032), and they themselves are scared of getting COVID-19 (oOR=1.95,p=0.005), worried about the future (oOR=1.71,p=0.022), feel less secure (oOR=0.59,p=0.028), are thriving less (oOR=0.40,p&lt;0.0005), and their mental health is not improving (oOR=0.46,p=0.002). Conclusion: Worse sleep due to the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased reports of stresses across a wide range of domains.

"COVID-19 pandemic sleep changes related to social and financial impacts at the us-mexico border","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major impacts to social and financial status for many people, including those living in the vulnerable US-Mexico border region. This study examined relationships between changes in sleep and perceived impacts to social and financial stability due to the pandemic. Methods: Participants were 155 individuals who completed the Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NOCHES) and were contacted about completing a COVID sub-study (95% Hispanic/Latino). Participants were asked if the COVID-19 pandemic was causing them to feel more socially isolated, negatively impacting their finances, causing increased worry about finances, affecting their primary job, causing a job loss, and impacting their belief life will one day return to normal. In addition, they were asked to report the degree to which they experienced pandemic-related changes to sleep, including a regularity, overall improvement/worsening, initial and middle-of-the-night insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and napping. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomics, and mental health (PHQ4). Results: Those who kept a more regular schedule had lower odds of endorsing isolation (OR=0.32,p&lt;0.0005) and higher odds of believing things will return to normal (OR=1.67,p=0.041). Those whose sleep improved also had lower odds of feeling isolated (OR=0.40,p=0.005). Those with worsened sleep had increased odds of feeling isolated (OR=2.14,p=0.023), experiencing a financial impact (OR=1.85,p=0.016) and increased financial worry (OR=1.71,p=0.033), and lower odds of believing things will return to normal (OR=0.53,p=0.012). More initial insomnia was associated with isolation (OR=3.62,p=0.001), financial impact, (OR=1.89,p=0.015), financial worry (OR=1.87,p=0.016) and job impact (OR=1.95,p=0.010). More middle-of-the-night insomnia was associated with financial worry (OR=1.82,p=0.016) and job impact (OR=1.93,p=0.009). More sleepiness was associated with job loss (OR=1.84,p=0.043). More napping was associated with financial impact (OR=1.89,p=0.017) and worry (OR=1.88,p=0.017), impact to job (OR=1.89,p=0.016) or lost job (OR=1.81,p=0.041), and decreased likelihood of believing things will return to normal (OR=0.45,p=0.003). Conclusion: Pandemic-related stress was linked with sleep disturbances. Worse sleep was indicative of increased social isolation, greater financial fears, more job-related impacts and less of a general sense that things would return to normal.","Arce, R.; Valencia, D.; Ghani, S.; Delgadillo, M.; Madhivanan, P.; Krupp, K.; Ruiz, J.; Seixas, A.; Jean-Louis, G.; Killgore, W.; Wills, C.; Grandner, M.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.199","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A80-A81, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A80-A81, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20871,""
"COVID-19 pandemic sleep and dreams at the us-mexico border","Introduction: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the border region is not well-described, including the impact of pandemic-related sleep disturbances on dream experiences, despite frequent reports of meaningful changes to dreams in the population. Methods: Participants were 155 individuals who completed the Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NOCHES) Study and a COVID sub-study (95% Hispanic/Latino). Participants were asked whether, as a result of the pandemic, they have experienced more schedule regularity, improved/worsened sleep, more initial or middleof- the-night insomnia, more sleepiness, and more napping. They were also asked whether they experienced more, fewer, or the same amount of dreams in general, positive dreams, and negative dreams. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine overall, positive, and negative dream recall (more or less vs same) as outcome and perceived change in sleep as independent variable, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomics, and mental health symptoms (assessed with PHQ4). Results: Those who reported more schedule regularity were less likely to report more negative dreams (Relative Risk Ratio [RRR]=0.40, p=0.010). Those who reported improved sleep were also more likely to report more positive dreams (RRR=3.97, p=0.004). Those with worsened sleep were more likely to report fewer dreams overall (RRR=2.23, p=0.037), fewer positive dreams (RRR=2.24, p=0.003) and more negative dreams (RRR=3.69, p&lt;0.0005).

"COVID-19 pandemic nightmares at the us-mexico border","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted individuals in many ways, including anecdotal reports of nightmares. However, little data exists regarding the experience of COVID-related nightmares, especially among the distressed population at the US-Mexico Border. This is especially relevant given the clinical importance of nightmares as risk factors for poor mental health and sleep disturbances. Methods: Participants were N=155 individuals who completed the Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NOCHES) and were contacted about completing a COVID sub-study (95% Hispanic/Latino). Participants were asked for the number of nightmares that they have experienced since the pandemic started. They were also asked whether they had nightmares about confinement, claustrophobia, suffocation, oppression, drowning, failure, helplessness, natural disasters, anxiety, evil forces, war, separation from loved ones, being chased, sickness, death, COVID, and apocalypse. They were also asked whether they experienced, due to the pandemic, increased general, financial, food, housing, familial, relationship, and media-related stress. Each of these items was coded from 0 ('Strongly Disagree') to 3 ('Strongly Agree'), with total scores ranging from 0-21. Regression analyses (linear for frequency and binary logistic for content) examined stress score as independent variable, adjusted for age, sex, financial status, education, and mental health (PHQ4). Results: Those who experienced greater pandemic-related stress reported more nightmares (age/sex-adjusted B=0.23, p&lt;0.0005, fully-adjusted B=0.23, p&lt;0.0005). They were also more likely to have nightmares about confinement (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.69, p=0.008), suffocation (OR=1.41, p=0.020), failure (OR=1.23, p=0.049), being chased (OR=1.24, p=0.013), sickness (OR=1.26, p=0.022), and COVID (OR=1.37, p=0.003). Conclusion: Those who experienced more pandemic-related stress reported more nightmares, even after adjusting for depression/anxiety symptoms. In addition, those with more pandemic-related stress were more likely to have nightmares about COVID itself, as well as confinement and suffocation, being chased, failure, and sickness in general. Perhaps efforts to reduce pandemic-related stress will reduce these nightmare experiences, which may have beneficial effects on other areas of mental health.","Begay, T.; Valencia, D.; Ghani, S.; Delgadillo, M.; Bastien, C.; Madhivanan, P.; Krupp, K.; Ruiz, J.; Killgore, W.

"Sleeping through a pandemic: Sleep health in adults around the world during the COVID-19 lockdown","Introduction: The novel COVID-19 disease rapidly escalated into a global pandemic affecting people around the world. While communities imposed mitigation measures to stop the spread of the disease, the mass (home) confinement in addition to the uncertainty of the pandemic led to drastic changes in all aspects of life, including sleep. Sleep health is strongly linked with mental and overall health and could play a protective role against the development of mental distress during the pandemic. Here, we investigated sleep health in a global multicultural sample of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We surveyed 6,882 adults (18-94 years) across 59 countries about their sleep health (RU-SATED scale), sleep behaviors, demographics, pandemic-related factors, and mood between late April and early May 2020. A hierarchical stepwise multiple linear regression was performed to investigate correlates of sleep health. Results: Compared with pre-pandemic times, more than one third of the sample reported an increase in sleep disturbances, and more than half of the sample shifted their sleep schedule towards later bedand wake-up times. Better sleep health was associated with being partnered, older age and living in a higher-income country (p&lt;.001). Poorer sleep health was associated with a stricter level of quarantine, and other pandemic-related factors including being laid off from job, financial strain, or difficulties with transitioning to working from home (R2=.116, p&lt;.001). Domestic conflict emerged as the strongest correlate of poorer sleep health in the regression model. Greater depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with a poorer sleep health (p&lt;.001). In a global comparison, Latin Americans reported the lowest sleep health scores. Conclusion: Our findings highlight how sleep behavior has changed during the international quarantine- and isolation measurements and show the association between pandemic-related factors and poor sleep health, which, in turn, is closely linked with poorer mental health. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining good sleep health during the pandemic, since poorer sleep health may trigger or exacerbate mental disorders. Maintenance of good sleep health should be incorporated into public health messages aimed at helping people maintain optimal mental and physical health during major stressful life events like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yuksel, D.; McKee, G.; Perrin, P.; Alzueta, E.; Caffarra, S.; Ramos-Usuga, D.; Arango-Lasprilla, J.

"Sleep variability and affect dynamics among college students during COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Sleep disturbance is a transdiagnostic risk factor that is so prevalent among emerging adults it is considered to be a public health epidemic. For emerging adults, who are already at greater risk for psychopathology, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted daily routines, potentially changing sleep patterns and heightening risk factors for the emergence of affective dysregulation, and consequently moodrelated disturbances. This study aimed to determine whether variability in sleep patterns across a 3-month period was associated with next-day positive and negative affect, and affective dynamics, proximal affective predictors of depressive symptoms among young adults during the pandemic. Methods: College student participants (N=20, 65% female, Mage=19.80, SDage=1.0) wore non-invasive wearable devices (the Oura ring https://ouraring.com/) continuously for a period of 3-months, measuring sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, total sleep, and time spent in different stages of sleep (light, deep and rapid eye movement). Participants reported daily PA and NA using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule on a 0-100 scale to report on their affective state. Results: Multilevel models specifying a within-subject process of the relation between sleep and affect revealed that participants with higher sleep onset latency (b= -2.98, p&lt;.01) and sleep duration on the prior day (b= -.35, p=.01) had lower PA the next day. Participants with longer light sleep duration had lower PA (b= -.28, p=.02), whereas participants with longer deep sleep duration had higher PA (b= .36, p=.02) the next day. On days with higher total sleep, participants experienced lower NA compared to their own average (b= -.01, p=.04). Follow-up exploratory bivariate correlations revealed significant associations between light sleep duration instability and higher instability in both PA and NA, whereas higher deep sleep duration was linked with lower instability in both PA and NA (all ps&lt; .05). In the full-length paper these analyses will be probed using linear regressions controlling for relevant covariates (main effects of sleep, sex/age/ethnicity). Conclusion: Sleep, an important transdiagnostic health outcome, may contribute to next-day PA and NA. Sleep patterns predict affect dynamics, which may be proximal predictors of mood disturbances. Affect dynamics may be one potential pathway through which sleep has implications for health disparities.","Mousavi, Z.; Lai, J.; Yunusova, A.; Rivera, A.; Hu, S.; Labbaf, S.; Jafarlou, S.; Dutt, N.; Jain, R.; Rahmani, A.; Borelli, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.192","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A78, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A78, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20875,""
"Changes in sleep hygiene and sleepiness following social distancing related to COVID-19","Introduction: It was expected COVID-19 would result in changes that could impact sleep hygiene and sleep. We examined sleep hygiene and symptoms of disrupted sleep through late April and May and demographic and psychological variables related to vulnerability/ resilience to negative outcomes. Methods: Participants (Part1: N=180, Part2: N=64;ages 18-85) solicited from a college (students, faculty/staff, alumni, parents) and local community (churches, community centers, libraries) completed a 30-minute survey (measures: sleep hygiene (SH), symptoms of sleep disruption, mental health, personality, social distancing, COVID-19 impact/experience, and demographics) for possible prizes. Part 1, April 20th-May 12th, participants answered trait questionnaires and state questionnaires for before and during social distancing, then repeated state questionnaires two weeks later (Part 2). Results: Following initial COVID related changes, 66.1% of participants reported worsening symptoms of sleep disruption, 27.9% reported no change, and 6.3% reported improvements. 40.3% reported worsening SH, 53.5% no change, and 6.3% improvements. At 2-week follow-up, 30.4% of participants shifted from reporting no change to SH improvements over baseline. Overall, participants showed significant worsening of symptoms of sleep disruption (sleepiness, moodiness, avolition, cognitive impairments) and SH behaviors (less consistent bed- and wake-times, more frequently staying too long in bed, more pre-bed alerting activities, more bedtime negative emotion, more use of bed for purposes other than sleep, more active technology use) (d's from .23-1.00). Worsening sleep hygiene with COVID-19 was significantly predicted by younger age (r(157)=.164, p&lt;.05), more avoidant coping (r(151)= -.337, p&lt;.05), lower life satisfaction (r(156)=.200, p&lt;.05) and greater impact/experience of COVID-19 (r(150)= -.270, p&lt;.05). Symptoms of sleep disruption showed similar, but larger, relationships. Conclusion: Initial social distancing may have disrupted routines, added stress, and resulted in worsened sleep and sleep hygiene. Over time some adapted and improved, but most did not. Our results suggest change, especially crises such as a pandemic, may alter established behavior for the worse and/or add significant stress. Without intervention, even the robust, i.e., young, may suffer. Variables identifying those more vulnerable to disrupted sleep following change and those more likely to experience worsening sleep may help identify targets for future interventions.","Peszka, J.; Mastin, D.; Kennedy, L.; Sestir, M.; Harsh, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.188","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A76, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A76, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20876,""
"Mental health clusters during COVID-19 pandemic are associated with multiple dimensions of sleep in a sample of pregnant women","Introduction: Sleep and mental health have a bidirectional relationship. During pregnancy, poor sleep health, depression and stress are common and have been associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional physical and psychological risk factors, due to high mortality rate, and economic and social repercussions. This study examines whether prenatal maternal mental health clusters are associated with multiple dimensions of sleep during pregnancy in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: From June-December 2020, participants were recruited as part of the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) Cohort at Columbia University (N=188;at recruitment gestational age: 32.2Â±8.2 weeks;age: 32Â±6.75 years;N=74 Hispanic, N=65 White non-Hispanic, N=27 Black/African American, N=22 other). Survey data on maternal depression (PHQ-9), perceived stress (PSS), Covid-related stress, and sleep health (PSQI) were collected. Using hierarchical clustering, we created maternal mental health clusters (MMHC). Regressions analyses were implemented to estimate the associations between multiple dimensions of sleep based on MMHC. Results: \We derived three MMHC: Low-risk (no depression, no Covid-stress, low-moderate perceived stress), Covid-stress (no depression, moderate Covid-stress, low-moderate perceived stress) and high-risk (moderate depression, moderate Covid-stress, moderate to high perceived stress). Maternal age, gestational age, income, and race were not significantly different across clusters. The Covid-stress cluster compared to the low-risk cluster reported worse subjective sleep quality (ÃŸ=0.34Â±0.11, p=0.0025), longer sleep latency (ÃŸ=0.44Â±0.13,p&lt;0.000), more sleep disturbances (ÃŸ=0.67Â±0.18, p=0.004) and an overall higher PSQI score (ÃŸ=0.32Â±0.13,p=0.017). Compared to the low-risk group, the high-risk group reported worse subjective sleep quality (ÃŸ=0.96Â±0.3,p&lt;0.000), longer sleep latency (ÃŸ=0.79Â±0.13,p&lt;0.000), shorter sleep duration (ÃŸ=0.67Â±0.18,p=0.0003), lower sleep efficiency (ÃŸ=0.67Â±0.25,p=0.008), more sleep disturbances (ÃŸ=0.59Â±0.10, p&lt;0.000), higher daytime dysfunction (ÃŸ=0.85Â±0.10, p=0.000) and an overall higher PISQI score (ÃŸ=1.15Â±0.16, p&lt;0.000). Conclusion: Our results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health profiles during pregnancy, with evidence of a high-risk cluster presenting Covid-stress and depressive symptoms and a Covid-stress cluster presenting Covid-stress without depressive symptoms in a multi-ethnic sample of pregnant women. Both were associated with poorer sleep health outcomes compared to the low-risk cluster. These results have important implications for screening and treatment for the sleep health and obstetric communities during these unprecedented times.","Lucchini, M.; Firestein, M.; Shuffrey, L.

"Sleep among youth during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences between summer and school-year","Introduction: Insufficient sleep is highly prevalent among school-age youth and adolescents, which has been exacerbated by the COVID- 19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether sleep during COVID-19 varies based on whether school is in session. We examined the sleep of school-age youth and adolescents during COVID-19 and described changes in rates of insufficient sleep from summer (Time 1) to school year (Time 2). We further examined whether insufficient sleep is associated with mental health service utilization. Methods: Adults in Southwestern Pennsylvania with children under 18 years old in their household completed a repeated cross-sectional electronic survey. The survey was designed to assess usage of, and unmet need for, health and social service resources, among other health behaviors. As responses were anonymous with no longitudinal linking, we used descriptive statistics and Chi-Square tests to examine our aims at each time point. Insufficient sleep was operationalized as &lt;9 hours (school-age youth) and &lt;8 hours (adolescents) of sleep duration, per National Sleep Foundation standards. Results: Data were analyzed from n=97 school-age youth and n=83 adolescents at Time 1, and n=77 school-age youth and n=82 adolescents at Time 2. Most school-age youth (76.3%) obtained sufficient sleep at Time 1, which was maintained at Time 2. However, while 75.6% of adolescents obtained sufficient sleep at Time 1, that number fell to 63.3% at Time 2. Youth with insufficient sleep were more likely to utilize mental health services than those obtaining sufficient sleep at a borderline level of statistical significance (p-value = 0.097), after controlling for age group. Conclusion: The rate of insufficient sleep among adolescents during COVID-19 is meaningfully higher than non-COVID, school-year rates recently reported among adolescents. Youth with insufficient sleep are more likely to utilize mental health services, though the direction of causality in that association is unknown. Future work should focus on strategies for increasing access to sleep promotion programs that support sleep health and mental health during a time of great stress.","Levenson, J.; Ray, K.; Lavage, D.; Wehrer, E.; Miller, E.","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.185","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A75, 2021.; Publication details: Sleep; 44(SUPPL 2):A75, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20878,""
"A prospective study on anxiety and blood pressure levels in haemodialysis patients during COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has currently been one of the leading causes of psychosocial stress worldwide. We hypothesized that possible changes in anxiety status might affect blood pressure in haemodialysis (HD) patients during COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Seventy one prevalent HD patients were included in this prospective study. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were applied to assess psychological status of the patients. Peridialysis blood pressure measurements were performed and average of 6 consecutive HD sessions' pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure measurements were used for statistical analyses. All assessments were performed both at the beginning (March) and after ending (June) of the partial lock-down, which was officially instituted by the Government in parallel with the status of the pandemic in Turkey. RESULTS: Mean age (Â±SD) was 59.2Â±14.8 years and 52% of the patients were female. Dose of medications including antihypertensives, dry weight, interdialytic weight gain, and Kt/Vurea were stable during the study period. STAI-state score was higher in March than that in June (44.6Â±12.6 vs 42.3Â±11.5, respectively, p=0.047), whereas HADS-anxiety, HADS-depression, and STAI-trait scores were not different. Predialysis systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in March than in June (127.9Â±20.3 vs 124.8Â±22.8 mmHg, respectively, p=0.029). Change in state anxiety score from March to June was remarkable particularly in patients not taking a betablocker (49.3Â±9.6 to 43.8Â±11.1, p=0.001) and in patients younger than the median age of 64 years (48.6Â±12.8 to 45.3Â±12.5, p=0.029). Change in blood pressure level from March to June was found to be significant only in patients not taking a beta-blocker (123.4Â±20.2 to 118.2Â±20.6 mmHg, p&lt;0.001), while did not reach a statistically significant level in the others. CONCLUSION: Our findings, though need to be confirmed by further studies, revealed an association between a higher state of anxiety and a higher blood pressure level in HD patients in COVID-19 pandemic era, which was remarkable particularly in patients not taking a beta-blocker.","Sadioglu, R.

"Psychological repercussions of the lockdown and the covid-19 epidemic in hemodialysis patients and caregivers in France","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The health crisis linked to the COVID-19 epidemic has required lockdown measures in France and changes in practices in dialysis centers. The objective was to assess the depressive and anxiety symptoms during lockdown in hemodialysis patients and their caregivers, to assess their coping strategies during this period and to assess the symptoms of depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress beyond confinement. METHOD: We sent, during lockdown period, between April and May 2020, selfquestionnaires to voluntary subjects (patients and caregivers), treated by hemodialysis or who worked in hemodialysis in one of the 14 participating centers in France. We analyzed their perception of dialysis sessions (beneficial or worrying), their stress level (VAS rated from 0 to 10), their anxiety and depressive symptoms (HADS). Factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression were analyzed with multiple logistic regression models. We will look for associations between coping strategies, participant characteristics and symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression using chi-square tests. A second questionnaire was sent out in October to collect symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress beyond confinement. Symptoms will be described and factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression will be analyzed with multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: 669 patients and 325 caregivers agreed to participate. 70% of participants found it beneficial to come to dialysis during confinement. The proportions of subjects with a stress level = 6 linked to the epidemic, confinement, fear of contracting COVID-19 and fear of infecting a loved one were respectively 23.9%, 26.2%, 33.4% and 42%. 39.2% presented with certain (13.7%) or doubtful (19.2%) anxious symptoms. 21.2% presented a certain (7.9%) or doubtful (13.3%) depressive symptomatology. Age, gender, history of psychological disorders and perception of dialysis sessions were associated with levels of stress, anxiety and depression. 685 subjects participated in the second part of the study (68.9% of the participants of the first part). Analyzes of this data are in progress. CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period, in France, the majority of hemodialysis patients and caregivers found it beneficial to come to dialysis. One in 3 subjects had anxiety symptoms and one in 5 subjects had depressive symptoms. It will be interesting to investigate if there was an association between the coping strategies implemented by the participants and their level of stress, anxiety and depression during confinement and to analyze the evolution of the anxiety-depressive symptoms over time.","Prezelin-Reydit, M.; Guerraoui, A.; Dolley-Hitze, T.; Vendrely, B.; Chantrel, F.; Kolko-Labadens, A.; Azzouz, L.; Bouillier, M.; Pelletier, S.; Fessi, H.; Cile Vigneau, C.; Combe, C.; Caillette-Beaudoin, A.; Chauveau, P.; Lasseur, C.; Idier, L.","https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab098.0025","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation; 36(SUPPL 1):i466, 2021.; Publication details: Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation; 36(SUPPL 1):i466, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20880,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on symptoms of anxiety and depression and health-related quality of life in older patients with chronic kidney disease","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for a severe course of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and vulnerable to mental health problems. We aimed to investigate prevalence and associated patient (demographic and clinical) characteristics of mental wellbeing (health-related quality of life [HRQoL] and symptoms of depression and anxiety) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in older patients with advanced CKD. METHOD: An ongoing Dutch multicentre prospective cohort study enrols patients of =70 years with an eGFR &lt;20 mL/min/1.73m2 from October 2018 onward. With additional questionnaires during the pandemic (May-June 2020), disease-related concerns about COVID-19 and general anxiety symptoms were assessed crosssectionally, and depressive symptoms, HRQoL, and emotional symptoms longitudinally. RESULTS: The 82 included patients had a median age of 77.5 years (inter-quartile range 73.9-82.1), 77% was male and none had tested positive for COVID-19. Crosssectionally, 67% of the patients reported to be more anxious for COVID-19 because of their kidney disease, and 43% of the patients stated that their quality of life was reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 1). Higher COVID-19-related stress was associated with a lower education level (p=0.036), and patients who reported to feel more down due to COVID-19 were more often female (p=0.020). Anxiety scores were higher among females compared to males (median 4.0 [IQR 3.0-9.0] versus 2.0 [0.0- 6.0], p=0.020), and weakly associated to a decline in eGFR (correlation coefficient 0.197, p=0.023). MO505 Figure 1: Respondents' agreement to the COVID-19 related statements. Questions were scored on a scale from 1 'totally disagree' to 5 'totally agree'. Mean score for question 1 was 3.6 (IQR 2.8-5.0) n=82, question 2 mean 2.7 (IQR 1.0-4.0) n=82, question 3 mean 2.3 (IQR 1.0-4.0) n=82, question 4 mean 2.7 (IQR 1.0-4.0) n=81.Compared to pre-COVID-19, presence of depressive symptoms had increased (11% to 22%;p=0.022) and physical HRQoL declined (40.4610.1 to 36.1610.4, p&lt;0.001). Mental HRQoL (50.369.6 to 50.469.9;p=0.913) and emotional symptoms remained similar. Males showed a greater decline in physical HRQoL (mean -5.3, SD 8.5) compared to females (mean -0.9, SD 5.7;p=0.039). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that older patients with advanced CKD suffered from disease-related anxiety for COVID-19, increased depressive symptoms, and reduced physical HRQOL during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on this vulnerable patient group extends beyond increased mortality risk, and awareness of mental health problems during the pandemic is essential. More indepth investigation on disease-related COVID-19 concerns and its implications for the CKD population is needed.","Voorend, C.; Van Oevelen, M.; Nieberg, M.; Meuleman, Y.; Franssen, C.; Joosten, H.; Berkhout-Byrne, N.; Abrahams, A.

"Renal angina index in adult critical care patients in a population from bogotÃ¡-Colombia","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clinical outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in ICU mainly depend on opportune preventive strategies. Thus, early identification of AKI is mandatory, and alternative diagnostic strategies become plausible: one of them, Renal Angina Index (RAI), described by Matsuura1, predicts the development of AKI KDIGO 2-3, at 7th day after admission to the intensive care unit according to a cut-off point &gt;6 on a scale with a 'creatinine score' (determined by the difference in serum creatinine between that at ICU admission and the first 24 hours in the ICU) and the impact of the patients medical history. 1Kidney Int Rep (2018) 3, 677-683. Our aim is to describe predictive capacity of the Renal Angina Index (RAI) in adult critical care patients in our population. METHOD: We retrospectively selected from our Critical Care Nephrology database adult patients admitted in any of our hospitals ICU between February to August 2020, excluding those at admission with diagnosis of AKI, serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl, or those receiving dialysis (acute or chronic) or kidney transplantation. We defined AKI according to KDIGO criteria. The RAI score was defined as the worst condition score multiplied by the creatinine score. The performance of the RAI score was assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis power to detect a difference of 0.2 between the area under the curve (AUC), under the null hypothesis of AUC = 0.5 (no diagnostic accuracy). The optimal cut point was estimated with the Youden method. RESULTS: From 1204 new ICU patients, we included 372 patients (women 40.3%), with mean age 60.9 (18-98) (table 1). Main indication for ICU admission was medical conditions. Mean APACHE II was 22.9, hemodinamic support was required in 41,1% patients, mechanical ventilation in 58.6% patients and diabetes mellitus was present in 21.5% patients. AKI KDIGO 2-3 developed in 26.8% of patients. Mean creatinine at admission was statistically different in patients with AKI (CI 0.95 - 0.51 - -0.15 mg/dl, p=0.0004). The requirement of hemodynamic (p = 0.003) and ventilatory support (p = 0.009), sepsis (p = 0.003), and COVID-19 (p = 0.03) were more frequent in patients who developed AKI. Renal replacement therapy was required in 39 (60%) of patients with severe AKI (incidence 10,5%). RAI cutt-off point determined by Youden method in the overall sample was 24, being significantly higher in patients who developed AKI (16.54 Vs 7.47, CI 0.95 -13.5-4.99, p &lt;0.001). A cut-off point of 24 was required for the Best predictive capacity for severe AKI, with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio of 34%, 94%, 5.5 and 0.7 respectively. CONCLUSION: In our population, RAI score requires a cutoff point much higher than that originally described to predict the development of severe AKI.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mood status and treatment adherence in patients with fabry disease","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fabry disease is a rare metabolic disorder, lifelong enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A (agalsidase) constituted the cornerstone of disease-specific therapy. COVID-19 pandemic and epidemic control measures including lockdowns impaired access to health care services. We examined the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on mood status and management of Fabry disease patients. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study between October 2020 and December 2020. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate the mood statuses of FD patients and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4) to assess patient adherence.We also examined age and sex-matched control group to compare mood status. RESULTS: A total of 68 (Male 48.5 %, mean age 37.0) FD patients were under regular follow-up in our institution, 59 of those patients were taking ERT every other week. Two of our patients had reported having a COVID-19 infection, and both of them recovered. 25 patients reported to miss an ERT for a median of one dose, 16 of these 25 patients have reported that they did not come to the hospital because of infection fear. Half of the patients had adopted home-based infusion;they arranged a nurse for homebased infusion therapy by their own means. According to MMAS-4 FD patients had good adherence to their therapy (Median score 0, range 0-2). Mood status of FD patients and controls are shown in Table 1. Both HADS depression and anxiety scores were higher in the control group compared to FD patients. Additionally, abnormal scores were more prevalent for HADS depression scores in controls (Figure 1). CONCLUSION: We found that the mood status of FD patients was better than the control group. Traumatic growth may be an important factor to explain this finding. Their adherence to therapy was good. Home-based therapy was the preferred method by the patients. Government-supported home therapy programs might be beneficial for FD patients to increase adherence to the therapy.

"â€˜Stay Safe-Feel Positiveâ€™ on the frontline: An online positive psychology intervention for police officers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The current study investigated the effectiveness of an online Positive Psychology group intervention for police officers intending to mitigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to enhance their personal strengths and resilience. Participants were 95 Greek police officers, assigned to the intervention (n =Â 49) and the control (n =Â 45) group. All participants completed an online questionnaire at four time-points. The results indicated a significant increase in the intervention groupâ€™s empathy, resilience, and positive emotions, as well as a significant decrease in fear of the coronavirus, negative emotions, loneliness, depressive symptoms and anxiety emotions compared to the control group. Changes remained significant in the long-term. The intervention assisted police officers in developing their personal strengths in a difficult period, indicating that personal growth can be triggered even in adverse situations.

"Phase-based approaches for treating complex trauma: a critical evaluation and case for implementation in the Australian context","Phase-based approaches are a recommended treatment option for individuals with complex trauma histories;however, this is based on a limited body of empirical evidence. Phase-based approaches often involve two stages of treatment, with one focusing on safety and stabilisation and phase two on trauma memory processing. Historically, the Australian Better Access Scheme offered a government rebate for up to 10 group and 10 individual psychological sessions annually. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the number of rebated individual sessions has been increased to 20 through June 2022. Combining individual and group session rebates, phase-based approaches that include both treatment modalities represent a feasible and accessible treatment option for complex trauma. Delivering phase one in a group milieu and providing individual treatment during phase two may be cost effective and optimise outcomes by leveraging the benefits of group and individual treatment for complex trauma. This article aims to provide an overview of the psychological impact of complex trauma, to highlight barriers to seeking mental healthcare, and to critically evaluate phase-based approaches for treating complex trauma. We highlight gaps in the research, followed by a discussion regarding the benefits and limitations of using this approach in the Australian mental health care system. &lt;bold&gt;Key points&lt;/bold&gt; &lt;bold&gt;What is already known about this topic:&lt;/bold&gt; (1) Individuals with complex trauma face barriers when seeking psychological treatment in Australia, including the affordability of specialised mental health care. (2) The number of Medicare-rebated sessions provided by the Better Access Scheme to treat mental health problems is at times inadequate, and clients bear the burden of cost for extra treatment. (3) Despite garnering support from trauma experts, phase-based treatments for trauma related disorders have promising but limited empirical support.

"Addressing the Mental Health of Black Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the world. However, a particular group has felt the effects of the pandemic to an extraordinarily greater degree: Black older adults. This conceptual paper applies the law of small effects theory to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the mental health and well-being of Black older adults. It explores factors such as health and healthcare disparities, geographic factors, cultural factors, and other components of the Black older adult experience in the context of COVID-19. The conclusions and implications address how the subfields within gerontology and geropsychology can aid Black older adults moving forward, things to consider as the pandemic persists, and considerations following its conclusion.","McDuffie, D.

"Adolescent-Parent conflict in the era of â€˜TikTokâ€™: Case reports from Nepal","Background TikTok is a recent type of video-sharing and lip-syncing online platform that is influencing adolescents rapidly and is likely to surge in view of increased use of smart-phones, internet use, â€˜Lockdownâ€™ period due to COVID-19pandemic and increasing online transactions, teachings and daily affairs worldwide. Case presentation Two teenaged girls from southern Nepal brought by their parents with problematic use of TikTok and behavioural problems that followed .They were engrossed in the mobile application that resulted in impairment at a personal, social, educational and family functioning.In addition to that, parents did not accept it on cultural grounds. However, patients did not consider it problematic .Gradually, they developed symptoms of depression, conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder but did not fulfill criteria of any disorder. The provisional diagnosis of Behavioural addiction was considered and Cognitive behavioural therapy planned. These cases posed diagnostic dilemma, challenging treatment sessions and partial success. Conclusions The line between normal and abnormal use of such mobile application is hazy in context of its social acceptability and growing use. The conflict appeared between traditional values and modern means of entertainment poses therapeutic challenge. Authors advise parental involvement, psychotherapeutic means, behavioral therapy and a collaborative approach with adolescents rather than pharmacotherapy for comprehensive treatment.","Gupta, Anoop Krishna, Upreti, Dikshya, Shrestha, Shuva, Sawant, Sandesh, Karki, Utkarsh, Shoib, Sheikh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100219","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders Reports;: 100219, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders Reports;: 100219, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20887,""
"Psychological Status in the First-Line Medical Staff Fighting Against COVID-19 in Sichuan (Low-Risk Regions):Â A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study","Background: The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the world has brought great challenges to Medical system. Medical Staff are facing nonnegligible psychological pressure. The psychological status of medical staff in high-risk regions is widely concerned, but there are few studies in low-risk regions. The study focuses on the psychological status of medical staff and influencing factor during COVID-19 epidemic in low-risk regions. Methods: An online questionnaire survey was conducted for 839 medical staff of several hospitals in Sichuan Province from Feb.4 2020 to Feb.25 2020. The questionnaires include self designed questionnaire, Symptom Checklist 90(SCL-90), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) and social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). We did single factor analysis on various factors first, then doing multi factor analysis to get the influencing factors of abnormal psychological status. Results: Out of the first-line medical staff who participated in the survey, 149(17.8%) screened abnormal psychological status, (15.3%) for physical discomfort, (14.5%) for depression, (12.2%) for fear and (16.9%) for hostility such as irritation, fatigued, etc. Participants who had insomnia, contact history of COVID-19 patients, negative coping style, low social support were more likely to be psychological abnormality. After adjusting for gender, age and education, it was found that insomnia (OR 4.58, 95% CI 3.06â€“6.87, p = 0.000), negative coping style (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.08â€“1.20, p = 0.000), are risk factors of abnormal psychological status. Meanwhile, positive coping style (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90â€“0.97, p = 0.000), good subjective support (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74â€“0.96, p = 0.014) and high utilization of support (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76â€“0.97, p = 0.015) are protective factors of psychological status in the first-line medical staff. Conclusions: The first-line anti-epidemic medical staffs in low-risk regions have high rate of abnormal psychological status, especially those with insomnia, low social support and negative coping style. Governments and local health authorities should take timely intervention measures to alleviate symptoms and provide psychological support.

"The Deficient Psychological Status of Male Medical Staff in Designated Hospitals During the Early Stage of the COVID-19","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is a new acute respiratory infectious disease, which has strong infectivity and general susceptibility. Medical staff participating in COVID-19 are facing enormous mental and psychological pressure. In the early stage of the outbreak, in order to control the epidemic, the COVID-19 designated hospital was established to receive suspected and confirmed patients. This study focused on the mental health status of medical staff in designated hospitals at the early stage of the epidemic. We aimed to provide better psychological assistance for medical staff in designated hospitals. Methods: This study was conducted by using symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) through network survey from Feb.4 2020 to Feb.25 2020. The mental health of medical staff in the COVID-19 designated hospital and non-designated hospital in Sichuan Province was investigated. Furthermore, the two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the impact of the designated hospital and the non-designated hospital and gender on the mental health status of medical staff under the epidemic effect. Results: A total of 948 valid questionnaires were collected. 252 medical staff in designated hospitals completed the questionnaire, including 46 males and 206 females. A total of 696 questionnaires were completed by non-designated hospitals, including 124 males and 572 females. The designated hospital and non-designated hospital were divided into two groups. The group main effects analysis was used to analyze 10 factors of SCL90 in the two groups. The results showed that all factors of SCL90 of medical staff in designated hospitals were higher than those in non-designated hospitals. It includes somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostile, phobic, paranoia and psychotic factors. There were interaction effects among the factors of SCL90. The results of post examination showed that there was no gender difference among medical staff in non-designated hospitals. Among the medical staff in designated hospitals, the score of male is higher than that of female. Compared with non-designated hospitals, there are significant differences in interpersonal sensitivity, somatization, anxiety, psychotic, paranoia and the total score of SCL-90 between designated hospitals and non-designated hospitals. There was no significant difference in SCL-90 score between designated hospitals and non-designated hospitals. Conclusions: In the early stage of the outbreak of covid-19, the mental health status of male medical staff in designated hospitals needs more attention, especially in their emotion, interpersonal relationship and physical symptoms. The government should provide them with timely and feasible psychological intervention.

"Confinement and chronic pain patient","The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic throughout the world has driven governments to adopt extraordinary measures and to impose a quarantine on the population. The daily restrictions imposed by this confinement, experienced abruptly by millions, could in some ways be likened to those already experienced by patients with chronic pain: a disrupted lifestyle with increased restrictions and fewer activities, and insecurity and uncertainty about the futureâ€¦ However, we have been able to observe that the COVID-19 confinement has complicated the organisation of chronic pain patientsâ€™ daily lives. Already confined due to their pain, quarantine conditions shut these patients up even more, in restrictive conditions that are out of keeping with their pre-epidemic lifestyle, resulting in increasing pain intensity for some, and reactivating frequently associated mental health vulnerability.","Hirsch, F.; Bourdette, M.; Barfety-Servignat, V.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.douler.2021.06.005","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Douleurs; 22(4):159-162, 2021.; Publication details: Douleurs; 22(4):159-162, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20890,""
"Indoor soundscapes at home during the COVID-19 lockdown in London â€“ Part II: A structural equation model for comfort, content, and well-being","The present work constitutes the sequel to the analysis of data from an online survey administered to 464 home workers in London in January 2021 during the COVID-19 lockdown. Perceived affective quality of indoor soundscapes has been assessed in the survey through a previously developed model, as the combination of two perceptual dimensions, one related to comfort (a comfortable â€“ annoying continuum) and the other to content (a full of content â€“ empty continuum). Part I of the study reported on differences in comfort, content, and soundscape appropriateness based on the activity performed at home during the lockdown, i.e. working from home (WFH) and relaxation. Moreover, associations between soundscape dimensions and psychological well-being have been highlighted. Part II of the study deals with the exploration of the influences of several acoustical, building, urban and person-related factors on soundscape dimensions and well-being. A mixed-method approach has been adopted by combining multivariate regression of questionnaire scores with the qualitative analysis of spontaneous descriptions given by respondents. Results showed that several sound sources, urban features, housing characteristics, working modes and demographic factors can influence (positively and negatively) soundscape dimensions differently depending on the task at hand. Notably, the perceived dominance of neighboursâ€™ noises during relaxation, moderated by noise sensitivity, and the number of people at home were common factors negatively affecting both comfort and well-being, that partially explained the association between comfortable indoor soundscapes and better mental health. The discussion points out the importance of considering the different impacts that acoustical factors (e.g. sound typology), building (e.g., house size), urban (e.g., availability of a quiet side), situational (e.g., number of people at home), and person-related factors (e.g., noise sensitivity) can provide on building occupants depending on the specific activity people are engaged with at home and the opportunities to foster peopleâ€™s well-being through building, urban and acoustic design.","Torresin, Simone, Albatici, Rossano, Aletta, Francesco, Babich, Francesco, Oberman, Tin, Stawinoga, Agnieszka Elzbieta, Kang, Jian","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2021.108379","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Applied Acoustics; 185:108379, 2022.; Publication details: Applied Acoustics; 185:108379, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20891,""
"Sustainable Management of Biomedical Waste During COVID-19 Pandemic","Biomedical waste is a hazard to worldwide communal environmental health. Productive biomedical waste administration is the need of great importance and a prompt order that needs to be addressed. Different stakeholders, for example, worldwide associations, government bodies, the scholarly community, biomedical waste treatment facilities and advancement suppliers are working inseparably to deal with the high amounts of biomedical waste created across the world. Appropriate biomedical waste (BMW) organization in understanding to the specified standard was one of the disregarded parts of medical care for quite a long time, particularly in non-developing nations like India. In the midst of the COVID infection 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the situation may deteriorate as confirmed by some underlying encounters, with heaps of personal protective equipment (PPE) collecting in the medical clinics. As is apparent from the current circumstance of the pandemic, essential disease control rehearses are the solitary measures for regulation. Appropriate garbage removal is a necessary piece of these control measures. There may be a genuine danger of spreading coronavirus whenever utilized covers, gloves, and other personal protective equipment are not handled and discarded appropriately. Also, household waste (e.g., tissues, face masks, gloves) puts waste management laborers at expanded health hazard. The COVID-19 pandemic and legislative strategies to contain the spread of virus have caused a universal financial downturn and have likewise produced a gigantic measure of biomedical waste. The arrangement was incredibly impacted by dispensable plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPE) and single-use plastics by online shopping for a large portion of the fundamental need. The utilization of PPEs and single-use plastics during the pandemic builds the amount of biomedical waste. Larger boundary of mobile services should be sustained, especially during the pandemic, which can be significant for the developing nations where the medical waste removal conveniences are restricted. The mobile services are helpful for the crisis circumstance as well as be utilized as an essential reinforcement limit.

"Socio-economic Insinuations and Air Quality Status in India Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","In India, â€œJanta Curfewâ€ with complete lockdown was imposed on 22 March 2020 to culminate the disease spread of COVID-19. Nationwide lockdown has created a socio-economic crisis, which has led to many human problems such as loneliness, mental depression, anxiety and domestic violence. The country witnessed the downfall in economic progress due to complete shutdown of industrial, commercial, transportation and other business ventures. On the contrary, lockdown facilitated our environment to restore its aesthetic value. The review beholds an objective to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on socio-economic effects and air pollution level in India. The study includes comparative change in air quality during lockdown periods (22 Marchâ€“14 April, 15 Aprilâ€“03 May, 4â€“17 May and 18â€“31 May 2020) against the same duration of 2019 and before lockdown periods in 2020. Air quality index was improved by &amp;gt;35% in 2020 compared to 2019 of same duration. Northern part of the country showed maximum reduction in air pollutantsâ€™ level compared to southern part. Aerosol, PM2.5, PM10, NOx, NO2, NO, SO2 and CO showed subsequent reductions in their levels during compared to before lockdown;however, O3 level showed an increasing trend across the lockdown duration. Multivariate analysis showed a strong correlation of wind speed with total number of COVID-19 cases;however, ambient temperature exhibited a strong correlation with air pollutants. The chapter thus emphasizes upon the establishment and implementation of strict air control measures by government, policymakers and stakeholders with public participation for air quality improvement and long-term restoration of ecosystem in India.

"The Territory Requires Coherent Work: The Role of Interregional Interactions in Economic Recovery (To the 100th Anniversary of IG Aleksandrovâ€™s Work â€˜Economic Regionalization of Russiaâ€™)","The coronavirus pandemic has acted as a catalyst for discussions on the choice of economic policies for recovery from the crisis. This research focuses on one of the aspects of this problem, aiming to analyse interregional interactions, the activation of which can become a driver of growth. Based on the idea of â€˜double circulationâ€™ from the Chinaâ€™s 14th Five-Year Plan, we demonstrate that Russia also has the ability to shift the focus of economic policy towards expanding the domestic market and developing ties between regions. The paper draws parallels between the early 1920s and 2020s. It is noted that the need to overcome economic depression was determined by justifying close cooperation of individual regions in Russia. The article describes the use of interregional interactions as a tool for spatial development based on the existing federal strategic plans. The study demonstrates that that the task of strengthening interregional interactions is only briefly touched upon in the plans. However, it is important to note that this process balances the constraints and opportunities for the development of the whole country. The analysis of the spatial marketsâ€™ hierarchy in the context of economic macroregions revealed their incomplete nature as complete economic systems. The obtained results show that in order for the idea of macro-regions to actually work, real interregional projects should appear inside of these macro-regions. It is determined that on the international level the demand for special tools for enhancing interregional interactions is gradually growing. The author proposes measures based on successful examples to support such interregional interactions in Russia. Finally, the author concludes that in the current situation the increase in interregional interactions can positively affect the economic development of Russia as well as create new spatially distributed value-added chains.

"The lifestyle of Brazilian medical students","Discussion The results reinforce the importance of adhering to as many lifestyle pillars as possible to preserve emotional wellbeing during periods of stress such as those experienced during the pandemic. the coviD-19 pandemic has grown exponentially worldwide since December 2019.1 Brazil implemented social distancing on 13 March 2020,2 which caused increasing distress and directly affected individuals mental health,3 work structures, lifestyles and interpersonal relationships.2 The lifestyle medicine pillars are based on healthy eating, routine exercise, stress management, avoidance of risky substances, positive relationships and better sleep.4 People who adopt healthy lifestyle pillars have a longer life expectancy, free from major chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, when compared with people who do not adopt healthy lifestyle pillars.5-8 Spirituality helps individuals to develop a sense of purpose in life and has been shown to equip individuals with highly effective strategies for coping with stress.9 Considering the pandemics impact on health behaviours, people will likely change how they deal with each pillar. Sleep is an essential biological function that mediates and reflects psychosocial functioning and quality of life.13 Its chronic restriction and poor quality influences wellbeing and mental health.14 In the present study, 60% of the students already had regular- or poor-quality sleep before the pandemic, similar to the Ribeiro et al study.15 This similarity can be explained by the heavy academic schedule of medical students.16 As expected, 34.5% of the students reported that their sleep quality worsened during the pandemic, similar to results seen in a Greek study.17 In contrast, approximately 36% of students in the present study reported improved sleep quality during the social distancing period, possibly because their time to rest increased as a result of reduced external activities. Physical activity reduces depression and anxiety,18 stabilises mood and improves cognition.19'20 In Brazil, 47% of the population is insufficiently active.21 However, almost 80% of the students in this study were previously physically active, but only 39.1% met the criteria for sufficient activity.22 Home isolation has previously been shown to profoundly decrease moderateto-intense physical activity levels and increase sedentary behaviour.23'24 In the present study, 33% of students worsened in the physical exercise pillar. Diverging from the present sample, men in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, had approximately 38% more opportunities to exercise during the quarantine period than women.25 However, a study of Italian university students concluded that females (approximately 22 years of age) who were previously active were more likely to reach the recommended levels of physical activity during the pandemic.26 Although 55% of students in this study self-reported a previously good or very good quality of eating, 43% of students' eating habits worsened.","Kobbaz, Tiago Mansur, Bittencourt, LetÃ­cia Ayd, Pedrosa, Bianca Vianna, Fernandes, Beatriz da Motta, Marcelino, Leonardo Demier, de Freitas, Bernardo Pires, Maciel, NatÃ¡lia, Rothfuchs, Ana Paula, Magalhaes, Elisa da Silva, Saud, NathÃ¡lia Salim, Vidigal, Alexia Soares, Miura, Bruna Yumi GonÃ§alves, Rodrigues, Joao Fernando Cunha, MÃ¼ller, Ully Morize, Silva, LuÃ­za de Almeida, Cobas, Roberta Arnoldi, Nishijuka, FÃ¡bio Akio, Barbato, Kelly Biancardini Gomes","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+lifestyle+of+Brazilian+medical+students","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Australian Journal of General Practice; 50(9):668-672, 2021.; Publication details: Australian Journal of General Practice; 50(9):668-672, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20901,""

"Expanding the Curriculum in a School of Public Health","Public health education has long been concentrated in a core set of public health disciplines such as epidemiology, biostatistics, and environmental health. Despite leaps forward in our understanding of the myriad influences on public health, little has changed in the organization of our educational systems. One issue brought to the forefront of public consciousness by the COVID-19 pandemic is the importance of leisure experiences, such as nature walks, to mental and physical well-being. In this descriptive best practice article, we discuss our approach to expanding the notion of a school of public health and provide examples of how disciplines and subjects outside of the ""norms"" of public health education, including leisure studies, can help better prepare students for their future in the field. Leisure studies is just one of many subject areas that can add value to public health pedagogy, and we envision many other subject areas and departments integrating into schools of public health in the future.","Jordan, Evan J; Young, Sarah J; Menachemi, Nir","https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.700638","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Front Public Health;9: 700638, 2021.; Publication details: Front Public Health;9: 700638, 2021.; COVID-19; Public Health; Curriculum; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health/education; SARS-CoV-2; Schools; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20907,""
"The Persistence of the Impact of COVID-19-Related Distress, Mood Inertia, and Loneliness on Mental Health During a Postlockdown Period in Germany: An Ecological Momentary Assessment Study","BACKGROUND: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 increased mental health problems globally. However, little is known about mental health problems during a low-incidence period of the pandemic without strict public health measures. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate whether COVID-19-related risk factors for mental health problems persist beyond lockdown measures. We targeted a vulnerable population that is at risk of developing low mental health and assessed their daily dynamics of mood and emotion regulation after a strict lockdown. METHODS: During a postlockdown period in Germany (between August 8, 2020, and November 1, 2020), we conducted an ecological momentary assessment with 131 participants who experienced at least mild COVID-19-related distress and loneliness. To estimate negative mood inertia, we built a lag-1 three-level autoregressive model. RESULTS: We found that information exposure and active daily COVID-19 cases did not have an impact on negative mood amid a postlockdown period. However, there was a day-to-day carryover effect of negative mood. In addition, worrying about COVID-19, feeling restricted by COVID-19, and feeling lonely increased negative mood. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health of a vulnerable population is still challenged by COVID-19-related stressors after the lifting of a strict lockdown. This study highlights the need to protect mental health during postpandemic periods.","Haucke, Matthias; Liu, Shuyan; Heinzel, Stephan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29419","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(8): e29419, 2021 Aug 26.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(8): e29419, 2021 Aug 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20908,""
"Experience of and Worry About Discrimination, Social Media Use, and Depression Among Asians in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has spurred increasing anti-Asian racism and xenophobia in the United States, which might be detrimental to the psychological well-being of Asian people living in the United States. OBJECTIVE: We studied three discrimination-related variables, including (1) experience of discrimination, (2) worry about discrimination, and (3) racism-related social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic among Asians in the United States. We examined how these three variables were related to depression, and how the association between racism-related social media use and depression was moderated by personal experience of and worry about racial discrimination. METHODS: A web-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted. A total of 209 people (mean age 33.69, SD 11.31 years; 96/209, 45.93% female) who identified themselves as Asian and resided in the United States were included in the study. RESULTS: Experience of discrimination (ÃŸ=.33, P=.001) and racism-related social media use (ÃŸ=.14, P=.045) were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Worry about discrimination (ÃŸ=.13, P=.14) was not associated with depression. Worry about discrimination moderated the relationship between racism-related social media use and depression (ÃŸ=-.25, P=.003) such that a positive relationship was observed among those who had low and medium levels of worry. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided preliminary evidence that experience of discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic was a risk factor of depressive symptoms among Asian people in the United States. Meanwhile, racism-related social media use was found to be negatively associated with the well-being of US Asians, and the relationship between social media use and depression was significantly moderated by worry about discrimination. It is critical to develop accessible programs to help US Asians cope with racial discrimination both in real lives and on social media during this unprecedented health crisis, especially among those who have not been mentally prepared for such challenges.","Pan, Shuya; Yang, Chia-Chen; Tsai, Jiun-Yi; Dong, Chenyu","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29024","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e29024, 2021 09 01.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(9): e29024, 2021 09 01.; COVID-19; Racism; Social Media; Adult; Asian Americans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; United States/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20909,""
"Associations of household food insufficiency with childhood depression and anxiety: a nationwide cross-sectional study in the USA","OBJECTIVE: Household food insufficiency (HFIS) is a major public health threat to children. Children may be particularly vulnerable to HFIS as a psychological stressor due to their rapid growth and accelerated behavioural and cognitive states, whereas data focusing on HFIS and childhood mental disorders are as-yet sparse. We aimed to examine the associations of HFIS with depression and anxiety in US children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The 2016-2018 National Survey of Children's Health, a nationally-representative study. PARTICIPANTS: Primary caregivers of 102 341 children in the USA. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician diagnosed depression and anxiety were assessed by questionnaires administered to primary caregivers of 102 341 children. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated adjusted OR (aOR) for current depression or anxiety associated with HFIS measured through a validated single-item instrument. RESULTS: Among children aged 3-17 years, 3.2% and 7.4% had parent-reported physician-diagnosed current depression and anxiety, respectively. Compared with children without HFIS, children with HFIS had approximately twofold higher weighted prevalence of anxiety or depression. After adjusting for covariates, children with versus without HFIS had a 1.53-fold (95% CI 1.15 to 2.03) and 1.48-fold (95% CI 1.20 to 1.82) increased odds of current depression and anxiety, respectively. Associations were slightly more pronounced among girls (aOR (95% CI): depression 1.69 (1.16 to 2.48); anxiety 1.78 (1.33 to 2.38)) than boys (1.42 (0.98 to 2.08); 1.32 (1.00 to 1.73); both P-for-interaction <0.01). The associations did not vary by children's age or race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: HFIS was independently associated with depression and anxiety among US children. Girls presented slightly greater vulnerability to HFIS in terms of impaired mental health. Children identified as food-insufficient may warrant mental health assessment and possible intervention. Assessment of HFIS among children with impaired mental health is also warranted. Our findings also highlight the importance of promptly addressing HFIS with referral to appropriate resources and inform its potential to alleviate childhood mental health issues.","Zheng, Siwen; Ngo, Amanda L; Forman, Michele R; Barcellos, Anna L; Liao, Lauren; Ferrara, Assiamira; Zhu, Yeyi","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054263","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e054263, 2021 09 07.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e054263, 2021 09 07.; Anxiety; Depression; Anxiety/epidemiology; Anxiety Disorders; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; United States/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20910,""

"VIRFIM: an AI and Internet of Medical Things-driven framework for healthcare using smart sensors","After affecting the world in unexpected ways, the virus has started mutating which is evident with the insurgence of its new variants. The governments, hospitals, schools, industries, and humans, in general, are looking for a potential solution in the vaccine which will eventually be available, but its timeline for eradicating the virus is yet unknown. Several researchers have encouraged and recommended the use of good practices such as physical healthcare monitoring, immunity boosting, personal hygiene, mental healthcare, and contact tracing for slowing down the spread of the virus. In this article, we propose the use of smart sensors integrated with the Internet of Medical Things to cover the spectrum of good practices in an automated manner. We present hypothetical frameworks for each of the good practice modules and propose the VIrus Resistance Framework using the Internet of Medical Things (VIRFIM) to tie all the individual modules in a unified architecture. Furthermore, we validate the realization of VIRFIM framework with two case studies related to physical activity monitoring and stress detection services. We envision that VIRFIM would be influential in assisting people with the new normal for current and future pandemics as well as instrumental in halting the economic losses, respectively. We also provide potential challenges and their probable solutions in compliance with the proposed VIRFIM.","Khowaja, Sunder Ali; Khuwaja, Parus; Dev, Kapal; D'Aniello, Giuseppe","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06434-4","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Neural Comput Appl;: 1-18, 2021 Sep 02.; Publication details: Neural Comput Appl;: 1-18, 2021 Sep 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20912,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian residential aged care facility (RACF) workforce","Objective: We conducted a survey to understand the challenges faced by the staff of residential aged care facilities (RACF), during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: In the current pandemic, the RACF workforce has been required to work under stressful conditions, with immense mental and physical pressures, resulting in anxiety and stress felt towards their jobs. Study design and methods: We electronically surveyed both clinical and non-clinical staff at public and private RACFs in Australia in June and August 2020. The survey asked a mix of openended and closed questions about preparedness for the pandemic, information flow, experience with personal protective equipment (PPE), management of suspected COVID cases, restrictions on visitors, and impact on RACF staff personal and home life. Quantitative data were analysed in SPSS;qualitative data using content analysis. Results: We received 371 responses: 198 from clinical staff and 168 from non-clinical staff. Respondents were between 20-71 years old, and 87% were female most commonly from Victoria (28%) or New South Wales (28%). The majority (80%) felt that Australian RACFs were well-prepared for the pandemic and 87% agreed that relevant healthcare authorities were contactable for information needed. A total of 37% reported challenges in estimating and ordering appropriate quantities of protective equipment. Ninety percent of facilities reported screening residents for possible symptoms and 77% introduced precautions or quarantine measures to protect residents. Most participants (98%) reported their RACF implemented restrictions on visitor access and 43% reported unfair or abusive treatment by family or friends of the residents. Commonly reported personal impacts included: workload increase, stress, emotional toll, family issues and fatigue. Support from colleagues as well as training, de-brief sessions and frequent meetings were identified as helpful facilitators during this time. Conclusion: We identified a wide range of practices and coping strategies among Australian RACFs. Whilst a majority of respondents reported coping well, a large proportion reported struggling both mentally and physically. Factors reported as helpful by the respondents may assist RACFs in planning for future pandemics. Implications for research, policy and practice: Understanding the challenges faced by all levels of staff within RACFs may aid decision-makers on a range of different levels - researchers, aged care providers, local/regional/state health departments and national leaders within government to help inform the development of interventions that may help the sector to recover, as well as prepare for potential future outbreaks. Of particular importance, are interventions or initiatives that focus on supporting the physical and mental health of staff i.e. those that prevent or minimise worker fatigue, emotional burnout and stress. What is already known about the topic? Nursing staff in Australian RACFs did not feel prepared for the COVID outbreak in their workplace. Early in 2020, RACF nurses experienced a greater overall workload and some had their staff hours reduced by their employers due to financial constraints caused by the outbreak. What this paper adds This paper offers a comprehensive insight into how RACF staff coped both individually and as part of the facility overall during the COVID crisis. It identified that a commonly reported source of stress was first-hand verbal abuse from family or friends of residents in response to visitor and lockdown restrictions implemented by the authorities. The paper highlighted that whilst the majority of respondents felt that RACFs were well prepared for managing residents during the pandemic, some facilities experienced significant problems with workloads, PPE and human resourcing. Furthermore, the survey showed that on an individual level, some staff experienced significant mental and physical stress during the outbreak.","Krzyzaniak, N.; Scott, A.

"Nursing in the time of COVID-19: exploring nurse preparedness early in a global pandemic","Objective: To obtain Australian nurses' perspectives regarding COVID-19 preparedness early in the pandemic. Background: In March 2020 Australia experienced a rise in COVID-19 cases and was bracing itself for the worst, having witnessed China, Europe and America's earlier exposure to the outbreak. On 14 March 2020 an Australian nurse set up a Facebook page called "" Nursing in the time of COVID- 19: A clinical forum"" allowing colleagues to share information about COVID-19. This presented an ideal opportunity to survey nurses' preparedness for the pandemic. Study design and methods: Anonymous web-based survey disseminated between 9 April-4 May 2020 via the Facebook page. Results: A total of 214 nurses responded to the survey of whom 85% were direct care clinical staff and 29 (13.5%) had cared for a COVID-19 patient. Prevalent feelings regarding COVID-19 were anxious, overwhelmed, vulnerable, engaged and interested. The strongest sources of information regarding COVID-19 were published academic articles, WHO/ CDC and similar authorities, employer leaflets/ guidance and Facebook. The strongest needs/expectations identified by the respondents were education and information, access to mental health counselling, provision of additional health workers to support nurses, and supplemental pay rise. Respondents identified work-related training specific to COVID-19, revision of skills and competencies and upskilling to do tasks previously not familiar to the participant of particular benefit. Nurses who had cared for COVID-19 patients expressed a stronger interest in receiving a supplemental pay rise for risk exposure, a stronger sense that they and their employer were ready to care for COVID-19 patients yet expressed less appreciation for mental health counselling compared to nurses who had not yet cared for COVID-19 patients. Discussion: The perspectives of Australian nurses are generally similar to nurses in other countries. However, we report some variations between nurses who have and have not cared for COVID-19 patients. We identify the levels of concern as well as those supportive actions that are most appreciated by nurses responding to COVID-19 specifically, these same findings could be applied to other major events generally. Conclusion: The timing of this survey allowed us to explore the perspectives of Australian nurses during the early pandemic vulnerability period without the benefit of hindsight. Despite thinking the Australian experience was going to be worse than it was, Australian nurses showed relative confidence in their own and their employers' readiness and this was most obvious in nurses who had cared for COVID-19 patients. What is already known about the topic? Nurses around the world have voiced anxiety and concern about the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it may have on them personally and professionally. Nurses have access to informal networks, social media, media, employer guidelines and other professional and academic sources of information to stay informed and up-to-date with current information on COVID-19 that may help to allay their concerns. What this paper adds The perspectives of Australian nurses early in the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to how prepared they felt at the time and where they were obtaining information to help guide their thinking and their practice. A synopsis of the role and benefits of a social media platform to allow nurses to share thoughts, articles of interest and experiences of COVID-19. Opinions vary based on whether a nurse had already cared for a COVID-19 patient or not.","Williams, G.; Gunn, A.; Sweeny, A.","https://doi.org/10.37464/2020.383.238","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing; 38(3):59-65, 2021.; Publication details: Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing; 38(3):59-65, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20915,""
"The Evaluation of the News Related to Coronavirus in National Media before and after the First Declared Case in Turkey","Objective: We aimed to investigate the content of Covid-19 news in the media before and after the declaration of the first Covid-19 case in Turkey, as well as the compatibility of their medical massages with World Health Organisation (WHO) data. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, Covid-19 news in Turkey's most visited webpages of five newspapers and five internet news sites was examined retrospectively for two months categorized as the periods of one month before and one month after the first Covid-19 case declaration in Turkey. The news was evaluated according to their content, sources, content and headline compatibility, evidence and accuracy levels in terms of WHO reports, its potential to evoke social negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, panic, and to produce negative bias against China. Statistical analysis was performed by using the SPSS 21 program and the results were expressed as numbers and percentages. Results: It was determined that in total of 7915 news, the most content was about the protection and prevention methods. In the news before and after the first case declaration in Turkey, the content-headline incompatibility rates were 50,8% and 1,1%;incompatibility rates of the medical information in the news with WHO reports were 7,1% and 2,9%;the rates of referencing were 74,3% and 66,9%, the rates of the news having the potential to produce anxiety and fear in the reader were 56,9% and 19,6% and to produce prejudice and negative attitudes towards China were 19,7% and 4,6%, respectively. Conclusions: It seems that the declaration of the first Covid-19 case changed the news making pattern of the media to a more responsible behaviour for the public. We suggest that it is a rational approach to use the power of the media correctly in enhancing public awareness towards Covid-19 pandemic.","Muratdagi, G.; Darol, E.

"Assessment of Knowledge, Attitude, and Perception towards COVID-19 Vaccine among the General Population in the Hail Province, KSA","Aim: Coronavirus infection has caused disease at the pandemic level with several deaths worldwide and affected all aspects of human life. One way to minimize virus transmission and its effects is to perform mass vaccination within the general population so that herd immunity is developed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, low health literacy and vaccine hesitancy are potential threats in achieving this. The present study is designed to measure the Knowledge, Attitude, and Perception levels towards COVID-19 and assess public perception and acceptance levels of the vaccine among the general population in the Hail province of Saudi Arabia. Methods: A bilingual, community-based questionnaire, consisting of the respondents' socio-demographic profile, COVID-19 knowledge, and attitude & perception towards COVID-19 vaccination, was circulated using different social media platforms. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS software. Results: Appropriate knowledge level was found in 74.8% of the respondents, whereas inappropriate knowledge levels were observed in females and participants with non-health-related occupations and were inversely related to willingness to the vaccine. More than 60% of the respondents had a negative attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine, as only 51% were willing to get vaccinated. A negative attitude was significantly associated with female respondents. Conclusion: Our study reports a high knowledge level among the respondents in the Hail province. However, there is also a decreased willingness to be vaccinated, suggesting that more vaccine and health literacy seminars should be conducted to generate awareness among the general population in the Hail province, KSA.","Khaja, A.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on suicide attempts in the Republic of Serbia","Introduction/Objective Previous studies suggest that the number of suicides and suicide attempts will increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frequency and characteristics of suicide attempts in the Republic of Serbia. Methods The study observed two periods: the period from March to August 2020 (the COVID period) and the same period of the previous year (the non-COVID period). The observation during the mentioned periods encompassed patients who were examined at the Dr. Laza Lazarevic Clinic for Mental Disorders in Belgrade due to suicide attempts (1987 persons during COVID period and 2300 persons during the non-COVID period). Results Concerning suicide attempts, a statistically significant difference between the observed periods was registered in respect to the total number of monthly clinical examinations, monthly distribution of suicide attempts, patients' gender and age, mode of suicide attempt, and the diagnostic category. Binary logistic regression determined that statistically significant factors that can influence the suicide attempt were year, months, patients' gender and age, and diagnostic category. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic creates the increased exposure of the people to suicide risk factors, which points to the significance of consistent monitoring of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter.","Stasevic-Karlicic, I.; Djordjevic, V.; Dutina, A.; Stasevic, M.; Janjic, V.; Ignjatovic-Ristic, D.; Pantic, I.","https://doi.org/10.2298/sarh210506053s","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Srpski Arhiv Za Celokupno Lekarstvo; 149(7-8):455-460, 2021.; Publication details: Srpski Arhiv Za Celokupno Lekarstvo; 149(7-8):455-460, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20920,""
"From Spectatorship to â€œSurvivorshipâ€ in Five Critical Propositions","Often theorized through the negative framework of addiction or passivity, binge-watching has been transformed into a civic duty and a mode of survival during the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploring this recent plot-twist in bingeing scholarship, this article proposes five new ways to study the most dominant spectatorial mode under corona-capitalism. These propositions include studying how the pandemic turned bingeing into an antidote to â€œlanguishing,â€ a feeling of sadness and exhortation that, if unrecognized, might lead to depression;exploring co-watching apps in order to move away from the clichÃ© of bingeing as an individual activity;unpacking the importance of narrative causality during the pandemicâ€™s prolonged structure and temporal limbo;paying close attention to interface design decisions, such as the addition of a â€œplayback speedâ€ feature to Netflix in August 2020;and, finally, demonstrating how binge-watching trains viewers to ignore their basic biological needs while turning them into unpaid laborers.","Alexander, Neta","https://doi.org/10.1525/fq.2021.75.1.52","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Film Quarterly; 75(1):52-57, 2021.; Publication details: Film Quarterly; 75(1):52-57, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20921,""
"Does marriage protect mental health? Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic","Using weekly variation from April 23 to June 23 2020, we exploit the surge in unemployment over the coronavirus pandemic to identify the effects on mental health outcomes and the role of marital status as a protective factor for households. We find that married respondents are 1â€“2 percentage points less likely, relative to their unmarried counterparts, to experience mental health problems following declines in work-related income since the start of the pandemic. Our results suggest that the combination of intrafamily substitution and the psychological benefits of marriage helps insure against unanticipated fluctuations in job and incomeÂ loss.

"The Study on Online Learning Frequency, Learning Engagement and Mental Health of College Students During COVID-19","The emergence of COVID-19 has significantly changed the teaching environment of universities resulting in lots of studies on college students' online learning engagement and learning performance. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between learning engagement and college students' physical and mental health. The aim of this study was to explore online learning frequency, learning engagement, mental health and how about the relationship between them, with the method of online questionnaire survey (N=268). The study finds that there is a significant positive correlation between positive affect and learn engagement (emotional engagement, cognitive engagement, behavioral engagement), and a significant negative correlation between negative affect and learn engagement. The study also finds some differences between students from urban and rural areas, that is mental health level of college students in urban areas is generally lower than that in rural areas, and the learning engagement of college students in urban areas are all significantly lower than that in rural areas.","Wang, W.","https://doi.org/10.1109/wiiat50758.2020.00107","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT);: 705-707, 2020.; Publication details: IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT);: 705-707, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20923,""

In addition to forums dedicated to COVID-19, we find such discussions on general question-answering forums, on a forum for teenagers, and on advice forums, specifically medical, mental health, relationship, and legal advice. Topic modelling results reveal the hardships of life during the pandemic and the effects of social distancing: fear of contracting the virus, job safety and security, loss of motivation and productivity, troubles with online activities, and dealing with those who do not follow social distancing rules.","Naseem, S.

"Remote Concurrent Engineering: A-Team Studies in the Virtual World","NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL's) Architecture Team (A-Team) has nearly a decade of experience in maturing early formulation mission and technology concepts by combining innovative collaborative engineering methods with cutting-edge subject matter expertise and advanced analysis tools in an in-person environment. When COVID-19 forced JPL's workforce to work remotely in March 2020, ATeam had to quickly pivot from an in-person collaborative environment to a remote working environment. Through introspection, careful planning, and considerable practice, A-Team was able to develop new operating procedures to effectively continue early formulation studies in a virtual environment. A-Team has held over 57 remote studies in the 10 months since the start of mandatory telework at JPL in March 2020. In the remote setting, A-Team conducts studies in half-day sessions with clients and subject matter experts (SMEs) via videoconferencing, shared computer screens, and digital collaborative tools. The key lesson is that increased staffing and planning is needed to prepare and successfully run remote A-Team studies. Remote A-Team studies require careful selection of the appropriate tools for security, accessibility, and usability within the NASA/JPL environment. Knowledge capture methods and templates need to be thought out and agreed upon in advance as there is less room for improvising in a remote format. Various communication channels have to be monitored to allow for team coordination while maintaining fruitful participant engagement during a session. In addition, technical backup for all roles within the A-Team have to be identified to allow the study to continue even if a team member's connectivity is temporarily interrupted. Finally, careful thought has to be put into methods and processes to create a collaborative environment in a virtual space such that a group of experts who are only connected via the internet can experience the creative spark and flow of a great collaborative and innovative study.","Burgin, M.

"Measuring subjective stress among young people in Hong Kong: validation and predictive utility of the single-item subjective level of stress (SLS-1) in epidemiological and longitudinal community samples","AimsBrief measurements of the subjective experience of stress with good predictive capability are important in a range of community mental health and research settings. The potential for large-scale implementation of such a measure for screening may facilitate early risk detection and intervention opportunities. Few such measures however have been developed and validated in epidemiological and longitudinal community samples. We designed a new single-item measure of the subjective level of stress (SLS-1) and tested its validity and ability to predict long-term mental health outcomes of up to 12 months through two separate studies.MethodsWe first examined the content and face validity of the SLS-1 with a panel consisting of mental health experts and laypersons. Two studies were conducted to examine its validity and predictive utility. In study 1, we tested the convergent and divergent validity as well as incremental validity of the SLS-1 in a large epidemiological sample of young people in Hong Kong (n = 1445). In study 2, in a consecutively recruited longitudinal community sample of young people (n = 258), we first performed the same procedures as in study 1 to ensure replicability of the findings. We then examined in this longitudinal sample the utility of the SLS-1 in predicting long-term depressive, anxiety and stress outcomes assessed at 3 months and 6 months (n = 182) and at 12 months (n = 84).ResultsThe SLS-1 demonstrated good content and face validity. Findings from the two studies showed that SLS-1 was moderately to strongly correlated with a range of mental health outcomes, including depressive, anxiety, stress and distress symptoms. We also demonstrated its ability to explain the variance explained in symptoms beyond other known personal and psychological factors. Using the longitudinal sample in study 2, we further showed the significant predictive capability of the SLS-1 for long-term symptom outcomes for up to 12 months even when accounting for demographic characteristics.ConclusionsThe findings altogether support the validity and predictive utility of the SLS-1 as a brief measure of stress with strong indications of both concurrent and long-term mental health outcomes. Given the value of brief measures of mental health risks at a population level, the SLS-1 may have potential for use as an early screening tool to inform early preventative intervention work.","Wong, S.

"Blessings in Disguise: Yoga and Meditation during Corona Lockdown","BACKGROUND The word Yoga originates from the Sanskrit word ""Yuj"" means to attach, join, Yoke or ""Yuj"" Samadhi. Yoga asanas twist the internal organs, strengthen muscles and increases circulation. Breathing technique and meditation also release stress and improve immunity. Health is our wealth. This difficult time can be utilized for building physical and mental health. The rule of social distancing which has been in action is a great facility that provides natural support to immune system and to build the mental health. It also gives more time to be with your family and keep yourselves occupied with productive activities. The term ""meditation"" usually refers to a formal practice that can give peace to the mind and increase awareness of our conscious, our mind and our environment. Meditation in its many forms has been practiced over millions of years by diverse groups of people in many different traditions. Previously it was practiced in the East, eventually has spread into Western countries and is increasingly augmenting therapy. These days are very difficult to manage your mind. So, meditation is the only useful activity that helps to overcome such a bad situation (corona lockdown). One should do mindful meditation daily. Encourage kids, but do not force them to do these activities. This study found that due to meditation, there is reduction in oxygen consumption, decreased heart rate, decreased respiration rate, enhanced carbon dioxide elimination, reduced cortical hormone level, decreased blood lactate levels, and increased parasympathetic activity. An overall effect of meditation is that it provides nutrition to your mind and brain. Meditation is a blessing in disguise in such crucial time. Regular practice of yoga and meditation help us to improve our quality of life. The purpose of this article is to describe what yoga and meditation are, their practices and their effects on physical and mental health.","Vagga, A. A.; Dhok, A.

"Privacy-preserving AI-enabled video surveillance for social distancing: responsible design and deployment for public spaces","Purpose The paper proposes a privacy-preserving artificial intelligence-enabled video surveillance technology to monitor social distancing in public spaces. Design/methodology/approach The paper proposes a new Responsible Artificial Intelligence Implementation Framework to guide the proposed solution's design and development. It defines responsible artificial intelligence criteria that the solution needs to meet and provides checklists to enforce the criteria throughout the process. To preserve data privacy, the proposed system incorporates a federated learning approach to allow computation performed on edge devices to limit sensitive and identifiable data movement and eliminate the dependency of cloud computing at a central server. Findings The proposed system is evaluated through a case study of monitoring social distancing at an airport. The results discuss how the system can fully address the case study's requirements in terms of its reliability, its usefulness when deployed to the airport's cameras, and its compliance with responsible artificial intelligence. Originality/value The paper makes three contributions. First, it proposes a real-time social distancing breach detection system on edge that extends from a combination of cutting-edge people detection and tracking algorithms to achieve robust performance. Second, it proposes a design approach to develop responsible artificial intelligence in video surveillance contexts. Third, it presents results and discussion from a comprehensive evaluation in the context of a case study at an airport to demonstrate the proposed system's robust performance and practical usefulness.","Sugianto, N.; Tjondronegoro, D.; Stockdale, R.; Yuwono, E.

"Yesavage's Geriatric Depression Questionnaire (GDS-VE): Analysis of its internal structure in older adults living in Buenos Aires, Argentina","Depression represents one of the most frequent and disabling mood disorders in the elderly population. To measure it, one of the most used scales is the Geriatric Depression Questionnaire, developed by Yesavage, in its abbreviated version (GDS-VE). Despite its ample acknowledgment and frequent use, an analysis of these characteristics has not yet been carried out on the Argentine population. Currently, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the isolation context, the American Psychological Association recommends adapting face-to-face to virtual practices. Given this need, the present work aims to analyze the internal structure of the GDS-VE, for pencilpaper and Internet modalities examining the metric equivalence between both of them. A confirmatory factor analysis was carried out and the internal consistency was estimated for both modalities. Factor invariance between both forms of administration was also examined. A total of 696 older adults participated and responded to the questionnaire, using two modes of administration (50% pencil-paper and 50% Internet). As a result, an adequate adjustment of the model to the empirical data was verified for both versions (pencil-paper and Internet), as well as an adequate metric invariance between them. These findings provide evidence of validity and reliability of the GDS-VE instrument on the Argentine population.","Tartaglini, M. F.; Hermida, P. D.; Ofman, S.

"The Intersectional Race and Gender Effects of the Pandemic in Legal Academia","Just as the COVID-19 pandemic helped to expose the inequities that already existed between students at every level of education based on race and socioeconomic class status, it has exposed existing inequities among faculty based on gender and the intersection of gender and race. The legal academy has been no exception to this reality. The widespread loss of childcare and the closing of both public and private primary and secondary schools have disproportionately harmed women law faculty, who are more likely than their male peers to work a ""second shift"" in terms of childcare and household responsibilities. Similarly, women law faculty were more likely to feel the effects of the financial exigencies that universities and law schools faced during the pandemic because of their disproportionate representation in non-secure, meaning non-tenure-stream, faculty positions. Furthermore, the rapid switch to remote teaching and learning, particularly during spring 2020, had a more detrimental effect on women in part because of the persistent gender bias that women law faculty, who teach a larger percentage of required and survey courses, encounter in student teaching evaluations and in part because women tend to be more engaged in the mental health and emotional caretaking of students, which significantly increased during the pandemic. Even the actions that law schools took during the pandemic to provide relief to faculty, such as automatic extensions to the tenure clock for all faculty, place women more at risk than men for harmful impacts on factors like pay equity. In all, this Essay briefly analyzes how factors such as limited childcare, remote learning, the greater caretaking needs of students, plus other pandemic-related effects, have worked to exacerbate previously existing gender and intersectional gender and race inequities between men and all women in legal academia and between white men and women of color.","Onwuachi-Willig, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Intersectional+Race+and+Gender+Effects+of+the+Pandemic+in+Legal+Academia","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Hastings Law Journal; 72(6):1703-1715, 2021.; Publication details: Hastings Law Journal; 72(6):1703-1715, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20935,""

"Comprehensive Medication Review Completion in Medically Underserved Areas and Populations","Purpose. Pharmacists provide comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs) to address provider shortages in medically underserved rural areas/populations (MUA/P). Currently, there are no studies regarding the proportions of CMRs completed directly with patients (here called, beneficiaries) from MUA/Ps themselves, or with others such as caregivers or primary care providers. Methods. This retrospective study analyzed adults in 2018 who received a CMR from a telehealth pharmacist. Chi-square tests compared differences in the proportion of CMRs completed with beneficiaries versus others. Multivariable logistic regression determined predictors of CMRs completed with beneficiaries. Findings. Of 19,655 participants, most were female (68%) and had Spanish preferred language (43%). The following had a greater likelihood of CMR completion with beneficiaries: age 65-74 years;non-rural residents;mental health prescription. These variables had less likelihood of CMR completion with beneficiaries: rural areas;men;and presence of medication nonadherence. Conclusion. The expansion of pharmacist-delivered CMRs occurred successfully in MUA/Ps. Further work is warranted to investigate the longitudinal effect on health markers.","Le, L. D.; Paulk, I. R.; Axon, D.

"Mind the Gap: Cake Cutting With Separation","We study the problem of fairly allocating a divisible resource, also known as cake cutting, with an additional requirement that the shares that different agents receive should be sufficiently separated from one another. This captures, for example, constraints arising from social distancing guidelines. While it is sometimes impossible to allocate a proportional share to every agent under the separation requirement, we show that the well-known criterion of maximin share fairness can always be attained. We then establish several computational properties of maximin share fairness-for instance, the maximin share of an agent cannot be computed exactly by any finite algorithm, but can be approximated with an arbitrarily small error. In addition, we consider the division of a pie (i.e., a circular cake) and show that an ordinal relaxation of maximin share fairness can be achieved.","Elkind, E.; Segal-Halevi, E.; Suksompong, W.; Assoc Advancement Artificial, Intelligence","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mind+the+Gap:+Cake+Cutting+With+Separation","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: 35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence / 33rd Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 11th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence; 35:5330-5338, 2021.; Publication details: 35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence / 33rd Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 11th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence; 35:5330-5338, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20939,""

"Why and how do dual users quit vaping? Survey findings from adults who use electronic and combustible cigarettes","INTRODUCTION: Most adults who use electronic cigarettes (ECs) also smoke combustible cigarettes (CCs). Quitting ECs appears common among dual users but little is known regarding adult dual users' motivations and methods to quit ECs or how this relates to quitting CCs. METHODS: We used Amazon Mechanical Turk, a web-based crowd-sourcing service, to survey 366 US adults with a history of regular EC and CC use. This analysis examined motivations and methods to quit both products among a subset of 204 (55.7%) respondents with dual use and a history of one or more attempts to quit ECs. RESULTS: Most respondents (95%) were using ECs at the time of this survey and had a lifetime median of five EC quit attempts. The most common motivations to quit ECs were health (74%), money/cost (45%), and to reduce risk of COVID-19 (25%). The most common EC quit methods were cutting down (68%), getting advice from a doctor (28%), quitting 'cold turkey' (24%), nicotine replacement therapy (24%), and switching to ECs with less nicotine (24%). Most motivations and methods to quit ECs and CCs were moderately to highly correlated, suggesting similarity in dual users' approach to quitting the two products. CONCLUSIONS: Dual users had a range of motivations and methods to quit ECs, most of which were similar to their motivations and methods to quit CCs. These findings support the need to develop treatment for adults motivated to quit ECs and demonstrate that dual users may currently engage in similar strategies to quit both products.","Klemperer, Elias M; Villanti, Andrea C","https://dx.doi.org/10.18332/tid/132547","","Country: GR; GRÃ‰CIA; GREECE; GRECIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Tob Induc Dis;19: 12, 2021.; Publication details: Tob Induc Dis;19: 12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20941,""
"[About the causes and therapy of depressive disorders in COVID-19]; O prichinakh vozniknoveniya i lechenii depressivnykh narushenii pri COVID-19","Brief information about the causes of depressive disorders in COVID-19 and general strategies of their treatment is presented. According to the biopsychosocial model of the development of mental diseases, depressive disorders in COVID-19 develop due to the toxic effect of the coronavirus on nervous system and other organism systems, possible side-effects of COVID-19 therapy, the psychogenic effect of excessive and inaccurate information about the coronavirus infection and the consequences of its spread, adverse social changes during the pandemic. If infection with the SARS-CoV-2 did not develop, depressive disorders may arise due to psychogenic information and negative social influences. If coronavirus infection is present, depressive disorders can manifest during the acute period of COVID-19 and after recovery from COVID-19. Depressive disorders may occur for the first time in a patient with COVID-19 or infection can aggravate depression that has been in remission. Care should consistently include psychosocial activities, psychocorrection and psychopharmacotherapy. For the prevention of onset of depressive disorders, it is better to implement social-hygienic and psychological-pedagogical measures. Psychotherapy and psychopharmacotherapy become more important in the development of clinically expressed depressive disorders.","Abritalin, E Y","https://dx.doi.org/10.17116/jnevro202112108187","","Country: RU; FEDERAÃ‡ÃƒO RUSSA; RUSSIA; RUSIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova;121(8): 87-92, 2021.; Publication details: Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova;121(8): 87-92, 2021.; COVID-19/psychology; Depressive Disorder; Depression; Depressive Disorder/etiology; Depressive Disorder/therapy; Humans; Pandemics; Psychotherapy; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20942,""

Moreover, it was checked whether the stress response to the epidemic in the T1DM group differed from that in the control group. This is the first study to address these questions in the type 1 diabetes population in Poland. METHODS: An e-mail was sent to all T1DM patients under the care of a diabetes clinic with information about the possibility of online consultation with a psychologist / psychiatrist, with a set of psychological tests attached. The study included 49 patients with T1DM who responded within the first month and agreed to participate in the study. 38 people from the control group were randomly recruited. Each person completed a set of psychological tools. RESULTS: In both groups, the level of stress was higher than typical for the general population in the situation without stressor. T1DM patients who have been ill for over 10 years more often cope with stress through a task-oriented approach. Patients who have been ill for less than 10 years use avoidance strategies. In the first phase of the epidemic,women with T1DM used avoidance strategies. Patients with diabetes and mental disorders react more anxiously and thus require special care in coping with diabetes.

"High Work-Related Stress and Anxiety as a Response to COVID-19 Among Health Care Workers in South Korea: Cross-sectional Online Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak had a severe impact on health care workers' psychological health. It is important to establish a process for psychological assessment and intervention for health care workers during epidemics. OBJECTIVE: We investigated risk factors associated with psychological impacts for each health care worker group, to help optimize psychological interventions for health care workers in countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Respondents (n=1787) from 2 hospitals in Korea completed a web-based survey during the period from April 14 to 30, 2020. The web-based survey collected demographic information, psychiatric history, and responses to the 9-item Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics (SAVE-9), 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales. We performed logistic regression to assess contributing factors as predictor variables, using health care workers' depression as outcome variables. RESULTS: Among 1783 health care workers, nursing professionals had significantly higher levels of depression (PHQ-9 score: meannurse 5.5, SD 4.6; meanother 3.8, SD 4.2; P<.001), general anxiety (GAD-7 score: meannurse 4.0, SD 4.1; meanother 2.7, SD 3.6; P<.001), and virus-related anxiety symptoms (SAVE-9 score: meannurse 21.6, SD 5.9; meanother 18.6, SD 6.3; P<.001). Among nursing professionals, single workers reported more severe depressive symptoms than married workers (PHQ-9 score &#8805;10; meannurse 20.3%; meanother 14.1%; P=.02), and junior (<40 years) workers reported more anxiety about the viral epidemic (SAVE-9 anxiety score; meannurse 15.6, SD 4.1; meanother 14.7, SD 4.4; P=.002). Logistic regression revealed that hospital (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.45, 95% CI 1.06-1.99), nursing professionals (adjusted OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02-1.98), single workers (adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.05-2.16), higher stress and anxiety to the viral infection (high SAVE-9 score, adjusted OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17-1.24), and past psychiatric history (adjusted OR 3.26, 95% CI 2.15-4.96) were positively associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological support and interventions should be considered for health care workers, especially nursing professionals, those who are single, and those with high SAVE-9 scores.","Ahn, Myung Hee; Shin, Yong-Wook; Suh, Sooyeon; Kim, Jeong Hye; Kim, Hwa Jung; Lee, Kyoung-Uk; Chung, Seockhoon","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25489","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(10): e25489, 2021 10 22.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(10): e25489, 2021 10 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20946,""

INTRODUCTION: A growing amount of evidence indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic influences mental health, including an increased level of perceived stress. OBJECTIVE: To develop and psychometrically investigate a pandemic-specific version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-PAN) that measures stress related to the pandemic. METHOD: Factor structure as well as convergent and divergent validity of the 10-item PSS-PAN were examined on the data set of an online survey (n = 1164; mean age: 38.57 years; standard deviation: 6.27 years; 84.2% women). RESULTS: A one-factor structure for the PSS-PAN was confirmed. The scale correlated significantly with scores on the Shortened Beck Depression Inventory (r = 0.41; n = 1164; p<0.001), the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (r = 0.46; n = 1164; p<0.001), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (r = -0.29; n = 1164; p<0.001). Women's PSS-PAN scores were significantly higher than men's (t(1162) = -7.135; p<0.001) but this difference was trivial (Cohen's d = 0.06). Further, scale scores did not differ significantly across educational attainment (F(6;1157) = 2.035; p = 0.06; ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.01). Lower middle class participants' mean scores were significantly higher than those of middle-class respondents according to the post hoc test (F(4;1159) = 3.461; p = 0.01; ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.01). PSS-PAN scores did not correlate significantly with age (r = -0.04; n = 1164; p = 0.13). Cronbach's alpha was 0.89 indicating excellent internal consistency. DISCUSSION: The PSS-PAN has a single-component structure. Moderately strong and weak correlations with other scales support its convergent and divergent validity and indicate that it is a distinct indicator of pandemic-related perceived stress.

"Cohort profile: MAVIE a web-based prospective cohort study of home, leisure, and sports injuries in France","MAVIE is a web-based prospective cohort study of Home, Leisure, and Sports Injuries with a longitudinal follow-up of French general population volunteers. MAVIE participants are voluntary members of French households, including overseas territories. Participation in the cohort involves answering individual and household questionnaires and relevant exposures and prospectively reporting injury events during the follow-up. Recruitment and data collection have been in progress since 2014. The number of participants as of the end of the year 2019 was 12,419 from 9,483 households. A total of 8,640 participants provided data during follow-up. Respondents to follow-up were composed of 763 children aged 0-14, 655 teenagers and young adults aged 15-29, 6,845 adults, and 377 people aged 75 or more. At the end of the year 2019, 1,698 participants had reported 2,483 injury events. Children, people aged 50 and more, people with poor self-perceived physical and mental health, people who engage in sports activities, and people with a history of injury during the year before recruitment were more likely to report new injuries. An interactive mobile/web application (MAVIE-Lab) was developed to help volunteers decide on personalized measures to prevent their risks of HLIs. The available data provides an opportunity to analyse multiple exposures at both the individual and household levels that may be associated with an increased risk of trauma. The ongoing analysis includes HLI incidence estimates, the determination of health-related risk factors, a specific study on the risk of home injury, another on sports injuries, and an analysis of the role of cognitive skills and mind wandering. Volunteers form a community that constitutes a population laboratory for preventative initiatives.","Castro, Madelyn Yiseth Rojas; Orriols, Ludivine; Contrand, Benjamin; Dupuy, Marion; Sztal-Kutas, Catherine; Avalos, Marta; Lagarde, Emmanuel","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248162","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;16(3): e0248162, 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One;16(3): e0248162, 2021.; Accidents, Home/statistics & numerical data; Athletic Injuries/epidemiology; Leisure Activities; Wounds and Injuries/epidemiology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; France/epidemiology; Health Status; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Wounds and Injuries/etiology; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20948,""
"Psychological problems and the associated factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown among college students in Amhara Region, Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study","OBJECTIVE: The central aim of this study was to assess the level of psychological problems among college students during school closure due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Institution-based, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Colleges in the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were college students (N=422, >18 years) who were actively enrolled in the selected colleges preceding the survey. METHODS: Data entry was done using Epi Info V.7.02 and data analysis was done using SPSS V.24.0. Variables with a p value less than 0.25 in the bivariate analysis were entered into the multivariable logistic regression model. Model fitness was checked using the Hosmer-Lemeshow model fitness test. Statistically significant level was declared at p<0.05. OUTCOME: Level of psychological problem. RESULTS: This study involved 408 students, with a response rate of 96.6%. In this study, 77.2%, 71.8% and 48.5% of students experienced depression, anxiety and stress-related psychological problems during the lockdown, respectively. The multivariable logistic regression model showed that being female (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.68, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.91), inadequate practice of prevention measures (AOR=1.74, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.02) and living in an urban residency (AOR=0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.94) were independent predictors of psychological problems among students. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that the level of anxiety, stress and depression disorders is optimally high among college students. Therefore, local governments should develop effective psychological interventions for students. Moreover, it is important to consider the educational enrolment type and the academic year of students.","Woday Tadesse, Abay; Mihret, Setegn Tarekegn; Biset, Gebeyaw; Kassa, Ayesheshim Muluneh","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045623","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e045623, 2021 09 02.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(9): e045623, 2021 09 02.; COVID-19; Pandemics; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethiopia/epidemiology; Female; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20949,""

"Mental well-being during the first months of Covid-19 in adults and children: behavioral evidence and neural precursors","Pandemics such as the Covid-19 pandemic have shown to impact our physical and mental well-being, with particular challenges for children and families. We describe data from 43 adults (31Ã¢<U+0099><U+0080>, ages = 22-51; 21 mothers) and 26 children (10Ã¢<U+0099><U+0080>, ages = 7-17Â years) including pre-pandemic brain function and seven assessment points during the first months of the pandemic. We investigated (1) changes in child and adult well-being, (2) mother-child associations of mental well-being, and (3) associations between pre-pandemic brain activation during mentalizing and later fears or burden. In adults the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety-levels was 34.88% and subthreshold depression 32.56%. Caregiver burden in parents was moderately elevated. Overall, scores of depression, anxiety, and caregiver burden decreased across the 11Â weeks after Covid-19-onset. Children's behavioral and emotional problems during Covid-19 did not significantly differ from pre-pandemic levels and decreased during restrictions. Mothers' subjective burden of care was associated with children's emotional and behavioral problems, while depression levels in mothers were related to children's mood. Furthermore, meeting friends was a significant predictor of children's mood during early restrictions. Pre-pandemic neural correlates of mentalizing in prefrontal regions preceded later development of fear of illnesses and viruses in all participants, while temporoparietal activation preceded higher subjective burden in mothers.","BorbÃ¡s, RÃ©ka; Fehlbaum, Lynn ValÃ©rie; Dimanova, Plamina; Negri, Alessia; Arudchelvam, Janani; Schnider, Cilly Bernardette; Raschle, Nora Maria","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96852-0","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sci Rep;11(1): 17595, 2021 09 02.; Publication details: Sci Rep;11(1): 17595, 2021 09 02.; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety/diagnostic imaging; Anxiety/epidemiology; Anxiety/psychology; COVID-19/diagnostic imaging; COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19/psychology; Child; Depression/diagnostic imaging; Depression/epidemiology; Depression/psychology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Stress, Psychological/diagnostic imaging; Stress, Psychological/epidemiology; Stress, Psychological/psychology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20951,""
"Mental health among clinicians: what do we know and what can we do?","Mental health and mental health disorders among clinicians remain a taboo, despite increasing evidence showing the direct impact on medical teams and patient care. This editorial is aimed at increasing awareness of mental issues amongst healthcare professionals, identifying perceived barriers to seeking help, and suggesting ways in which to seek help. Mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, are prevalent from medical school, leading to increased burnout and suicide risks at later stages of a clinician's career. There is often a reluctance to seek help, particularly amongst the surgical specialties, caused by self-criticism, lack of convenient access and the potential negative impact on medical licensure. This editorial has been written in loving memory of our colleague, friend and board member Dr. Nikolaus Veit-Rubin, who sadly passed away at the beginning of the year. It is written in the hope of highlighting the importance of maintaining mental wellbeing amongst the medical team, supporting help-seeking behaviour and changing attitudes toward mental health disorders amongst clinicians.","Patel, Mittal; Swift, Steven; Digesu, Alex","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00192-021-04805-y","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int Urogynecol J;32(5): 1055-1059, 2021 05.; Publication details: Int Urogynecol J;32(5): 1055-1059, 2021 05.; Burnout, Professional; Mental Health; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Health Personnel; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20952,""
"Domestic Violence Police Reporting and Resources During the 2020 COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Order in Chicago, Illinois","Importance: Domestic violence (DV) has become a growing public health concern during the COVID-19 pandemic because individuals may be sheltering in place with abusers and facing mounting economic and health-related stresses. Objective: To analyze associations of the 2020 COVID-19 stay-at-home (SH) order with DV police reporting and resource availability, including differences by community area racial/ethnic composition. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study assessed DV police reports (January-June 2020) obtained from the Chicago, Illinois, Police Department and DV resource availability (March and August 2020) obtained from the NowPow community resource database, both for 77 community areas in Chicago. Data were analyzed July through December 2020. Exposures: The COVID-19 SH order effective March 21, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Monthly rates of DV police reports and DV resource availability per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 persons. Results: Of 77 community areas in Chicago, 28 (36.4%) were majority Black, 19 (24.7%) majority Hispanic/Latinx, 18 (23.4%) majority White, and 12 (15.6%) a different or no majority race/ethnicity, representing an estimated population of 2Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯718Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯555 individuals. For each community area, the SH order was associated with a decrease in the rate of DV police reports by 21.8 (95% CI, -30.48 to -13.07) crimes per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 persons per month relative to the same months in 2019. Compared with White majority community areas, Black majority areas had a decrease in the rate of DV police reports by 40.8 (95% CI, -62.93 to -18.75) crimes per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 persons per month relative to the same months in 2019. The SH order was also associated with a decrease in DV resource availability at a rate of 5.1 (95% CI, -7.55 to -2.67) resources per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 persons, with the largest decreases for mental health (-4.3 [95% CI, -5.97 to -2.66] resources per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 persons) and personal safety (-2.4 [95% CI, -4.40 to -0.41] resources per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 persons). The Black majority south side of Chicago had a larger decrease in resource availability (-6.7 [95% CI, -12.92 to -0.46] resources per 100Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯000 persons) than the White majority north side. Conclusions and Relevance: In this longitudinal cohort study, the rate of DV police reports decreased after the SH order was implemented in Chicago. This decrease was largely observed in Black majority communities, whereas there was no significant change in White majority communities. These findings may reflect decreased DV incidence but may also reflect an exacerbation of underreporting. In addition, DV resource availability decreased disproportionately on the predominantly Black south side of Chicago.","Baidoo, Louisa; Zakrison, Tanya L; Feldmeth, Gillian; Lindau, Stacy Tessler; Tung, Elizabeth L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.22260","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(9): e2122260, 2021 09 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(9): e2122260, 2021 09 01.; Domestic Violence/statistics & numerical data; Police/statistics & numerical data; Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; Chicago/epidemiology; Communicable Disease Control/legislation & jurisprudence; Domestic Violence/ethnology; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20953,""

"Design and validation of a financial stress scale in Peruvian dependent workers during the COVID-19 pandemic (EFT-Cov19)","The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc in the lives of workers in different parts of the world. The instability inherent to this stage of health emergency has had repercussions on the mental health of this population. The aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a financial stress scale for Peruvian dependent workers. Observational, analytical, instrumental and cross-sectional study in 749 workers. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA), by unweighted least squares, was performed after analysis of Bartlett's test and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin coefficient (KMO). The absolute and incremental goodness of fit was determined by means of the comparative fit index (CFI) and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI). A PFA was performed after analysis of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index (KMO = 0.903) and Bartlett's test of sphericity (1751.9;gl = 36;p &lt; 0.001), which were adequate. The items converged into a single factor. The EFT-Cov19 correlated positively with the LABOR-PE (r = 0.564, p &lt; 0.01) and with a medium effect size. The reliability of the EFT-Cov19 was calculated with Cronbach's a coefficient, obtaining an acceptable value (a = 0.896;95% CI = 0.88 - 0.90). In conclusion, the EFT-Cov19 scale is a valid, reliable and adequate scale to measure financial stress in dependent workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Fatalistic ideas about the possible spread of COVID-19 according to the kind of disease the Peruvian patients suffered from","It has been observed that some groups of patients had the perception that if they fell ill from COVID-19 they could have greater complications. The aim of this study was to determine the association between fatalistic thinking about the possible infection of coronavirus according to the type of disease suffered by Peruvian patients. An analytical study of secondary data was carried out, which used a previous data to obtain respondents who had a disease (according to 9 groups/medical specialties), and cross-checked this according to fatalistic thinking (from a validated test). Of the 4483 respondents, 15% had a disease. Those with a respiratory disease perceived that they would be complicated post infection (p&lt;0.001), also those with a cancer or tumor (p&lt;0.001) or those with an endocrinological disease (p=0.002). Those who thought they would become depressed if they became ill were those with a respiratory (p=0.013) or gastroenterological disease (p=0.001).

"Influence of industrialization on environmental health: Historical vision from the industrial revolution to the COVID-19 pandemic","Environmental pollution begins with the industrial era and increases after the Second World War with the rise of technology. In the 1970s, man began to become aware of the seriousness of this progressive and irreparable damage. Ecology and related sciences are developed and actions are implemented everywhere to manage or alleviate the damage. Pollution can directly alter the components of an ecosystem, water, air or soils, but it can also occur due to the presence of unusual physical or physicochemical phenomena, such as heat or ionizing radiation. Its effects are manifested mainly by damage to ecosystems and therefore damage to the health of human beings, animals, plants, land or water (Nebel, 1999;Clark, 2003). Today the ecological disasters of London, Donora, Minamata, Chernobyl, Bophal, the Persian Gulf, the Danube originating in Baia Mare or those of oil in the seas are well known (Baxter, 1991). In Peru, we know of the environmental damage of the City of Oroya, Lake JunÃ­n, the Choropampa spill, and urban contamination by lead dust from deposits of mineral concentrates in Callao. According to the Pan American Health Organization, there are 20,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Amazon Basin (MartÃ­n, 2020). Gold miners and illegal loggers are exposing indigenous communities to considerable health risks, a situation that could have severe consequences given the poor response capacity of hospitals and health services in the region. Therefore, the spread of the virus in these communities could imply a tragedy that, in addition to the human losses, could, in turn, affect traditional knowledge and produce negative effects on the governance of the region. As a result, there could be even more deforestation in the future. Differential policies to serve ethnic populations in the region are an urgent need (Bermudez et al., 2020;VÃ©lez et al., 2020a). That is why this research set out to establish the Influence of industrialization on environmental health: Historical vision from the industrial revolution to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Questionnaire based mental health survey during covid 19 outbreak","The study is conducted among 279 people in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. This study is done during the lockdown collected the information by having a source of google form survey. This google form is created based on the GAD 7 questionnaire which consists of 7 questions related to mental health during this covid 19 pandemic. Most probable results were collected and listed out. Throughout the planet, the general public is being informed about all the physical effects of SARS COV 2 infection and steps taken to require and to stop the exposure to coronavirus and also to manage symptoms of COVID 19. However, the consequences of this pandemic on the personâ€™s psychological state havenâ€™t been studied, and still not known. As the efforts are focused on understanding epidemiology, clinical features, transmission patterns, and management of the COVID 19 outbreak, there has been little or no concern expressed over the consequences on oneâ€™s psychological state and on strategies to stop stigmatization. Peopleâ€™s behaviour may greatly affect the pandemics dynamic by altering the severity, transmission, disease flow and repercussions. This situation requires raising awareness publicly, which may be helpful to affect this calamity. This clinical study provides in depth overview of the consequences of the COVID 19 outbreak on the psychological state of an individual.","Goud, M. M.; Devi, C. B.

"Narrative review: Bidirectional association between COVID-19 and mental health disorders: A narrative review","Background: Fear, anxiety, and stress are natural reactions of the human body to unpredictable and potentially threatening conditions. Currently, individuals are encountering Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic;it is caused by a virulent, partially unknown pathogen with high transmissibility, recognized as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is conceivable to experience anxiety, stress, and subsequent mental health disorders during the pandemic. This narrative review provided a brief overview of mechanisms involved in COVID-19 and mental health disorders as well as the bidirectional association between them. Methods: Scientific electronic databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were thoroughly searched, based on different keywords in this study. Results: Lifestyle changes and isolation for breaking the chain of infection facilitate mental health disorders development more than before. Since the onset of the pandemic, the prevalence of mental health disorders has significantly increased. Moreover, studies suggested that the incidence of COVID-19 and the progression of the disease to a severe and life-threatening stage is higher in individuals with a history of mental health disorders. Inflammation is caused by, also may cause mental health disorders. Besides, COVID-19 is associated with cytokine storm and subsequent inflammation. Conclusion: There seems to be a bidirectional association between COVID-19 and mental health disorders, in which inflammation acts as an adaptor.","Talaie, H.; Hosseini, S.

"Cognitive behavioral crisis intervention model for health care professionals in Pakistan","The health care professionals (HCPs) in Pakistan are vulnerable to the negative psychological impact of the current COVID - 19 pandemic. The shortage of trained HCPs in Pakistan coupled with vulnerable infrastructure and depleted resources make the situation a source of psychological reactions like fear, anger, anxiety, and depression for HCPs during COVID - 19 outbreak. These psychological reactions are produced by the preceding thoughts and emotions according to the cognitive behavioral model. Therefore, a cognitive behavioral crisis intervention model (CBCIM) is proposed with aim of helping HCPs deal with these psychological reactions efficiently. The common components of CBCIM include the cognitive restructuring of the negative thoughts, teaching of relaxation and mindfulness exercises, the teaching of ACT - ADD approach and use of coping cards, district wise team - based act ion plan and the provision of these services to HCPs regularly even after the end of COVID - 19 pandemic.","Ahmad, Bilal","https://doi.org/10.32413/pjph.v11i1.669","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication details: Pakistan Journal of Public Health; 11(1):6-10, 2021.; Publication details: Pakistan Journal of Public Health; 11(1):6-10, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20962,""
"Comparison of sleep quality and its related factors in nurses before and at the same time with the COVID-19 epidemic","Background and Aim: Nurses are exposed to high physical and psychological problems due to high workload. The COVID-19 epidemic has negatively affected their health and especially their sleep quality. This study aimed to compare the quality of sleep and the factors affecting it among Iranian nurses before and at the same time with the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was performed on 175 frontline nurses in the fight against COVID-19 in 2020. Samples were collected using convenience sampling from two selected military and referral hospitals of COVID-19 in Tehran, Iran. Data were collected using a demographic information form and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16 software and one-sample t-test, independent t-test, and one-way analysis of variance. Results: The majority of the samples were male (64%), under 30 years old (41.4%), and with less than 10 years of clinical experience (58.9%). 96% of nurses had poor sleep quality. Comparison of the results of nurses' sleep quality with the same population before the time of the Covid-19 epidemic showed a statistically significant difference (P &lt;0.05). There was a significant difference between gender, marriage, and interest in the organization with poor sleep status (P &lt;0.05). Conclusion: According to the results, nurses did not have good sleep quality. Paying attention to the mental health of staff, especially female nurses, reducing job stress through emotional, psychological, and organizational support to improve the quality of nurses' sleep is recommended.

"Cognitive aspects of studentsâ€™ attitudes towards covid-19 vaccination","Introduction. In the context of a large-scale transmission of the new coronavirus infection, it seems very important, relevant, and useful to examine and identify psychological factors affecting the refusal to vaccinate, caused by mistrust or uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, doubts about its benefits and concerns about uncontrolled consequences. This study is the first report of the cognitive aspects of studentsâ€™ attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination that lead to their refusal to vaccinate. Methods. The study involved 76 university students (M = 20.63;SD = 2.38;56 females and 20 males). For data collection, the author used the original questionnaire, aimed at identifying subjective attitudes towards the vaccine and vaccination against COVID-19, and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale by D. K. Ahorsu et al.;data was interpreted using frequency, correlation, and P. Vergesâ€™ prototypical analyses. Results and Discussion. Against the background of a predominantly low level of COVID-19 fear, it was revealed that the majority of study participants had a negative attitude towards vaccination, expressed in their refusal of potential vaccination (63 respondents). The most frequent reasons for refusal were mistrust, fear of consequences, unreliability of the vaccine, and the presence of antibodies. It was identified that the central core of representations of the vaccine reflected formally neutral associations, lack of axiological and emotionally charged notions, absence of relevant personal meanings, whereas the periphery included important descriptors indicating ambivalent attitude towards possible consequences of vaccination. The results obtained were interpreted in the context of cognitive aberrations actualized in situations of uncertainty, including exaggeration of oneâ€™s own awareness, illusion of competence, imposed delusions, egocentric bias, illusion of control, illusory correlation, and cognitive dissonance.

"Comparison of the mental status of COVID-19 intensive care unit and general intensive care unit staff","Aim: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may predispose front-line intensive care staff to experience mental health problems. The aim of this study was to compare the COVID-19 fear experienced by COVID-19 intensive care unit staff and general intensive care unit staff, and the effects of this fear on mental health. Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 156 participants, 90 (57.7%) participants from the COVID-19 intensive care unit and 66 (42.3%) from the general intensive care unit, were included. A printed questionnaire consisting of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), and demographic data were used. Results: Female gender, being a nurse, and working in COVID-19 intensive care unit, were associated with higher depression, anxiety, and stress scores. A significant relationship was found between fear of COVID-19 and depression (<U+03C1>=0.399, p=0.044), anxiety (<U+03C1>=0.456, p=0.019), and stress (<U+03C1>=0.418, p=0.033). Furthermore, as compared to general intensive care unit staff, COVID-19 intensive care unit staff who may have high-risk contact were approximately twice times more likely to experience anxiety and fear of COVID-19 and 3.5 times more likely to suffer from depression and stress. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the mental health of intensive care staff. Attention should be paid to the mental health of females and nurses working in the COVID-19 intensive care unit. The mental health of intensive care workers should be supported to protect the health workforce.","Ã‡elik, F.; Dagli, R.","https://doi.org/10.18678/dtfd.915010","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Duzce Medical Journal; 23(2):197-204, 2021.; Publication details: Duzce Medical Journal; 23(2):197-204, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20966,""
"Opioid overdose deaths before, during, and after an 11-week COVID-19 stay-at-home order - Cook County, Illinois, January 1, 2018-October 6, 2020","This article provides estimates of the opioid-related fatal overdoses in Cook County in Illinois before, during, and after a stay-at-home order was lifted. During the 99-week period from 1 January, 2018, to 6 October, 2020, a total of 3,843 people died in Cook County due to opioid overdoses. The spike in deaths during the last 16 weeks of 2019 followed an increase of almost 10% in the previous 16 weeks. It is possible that the increase in opioid overdose deaths during the stay-at-home period was a continuation of the increases that occurred in the 16 weeks before the order was lifted. Although the mean deaths declined during the period after the order, they still remained elevated above pre-2020 levels. It might indicate a persistent upward trend in the number of overdose deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since the outbreak of COVID-19, various outreach, treatment, recovery, and education initiatives have been implemented to prevent drug-related deaths.","Mason, M.; Welch, S.

"Changes in suicide rates - United States, 2018-2019","This study described the epidemiology of suicide from 2018 to 2019. From 2018 to 2019, the suicide rate declined significantly among all persons, with decreases among males and females. Among American Indian/Alaskan Native individuals, the rate was highest in 2019. In 2019, the suicide rate among persons aged 85 years was highest among males, at 16.3 per 100,000. It was also highest among persons aged 55-64 years. The rate among females was highest among those aged 45-54 years. The suicide rate in 2019 was lowest in central metropolitan areas, with a rate of 11.9 per 100,000 residents. It increased as the urbanisation level declined. The rate remained stable in nonmetropolitan areas. In 2019, the majority of suicides were caused by firearms, with a suicide rate of 6.8 per 100,000. The rate of firearm suicides among males declined 2.9% from 2018 to 2019, and among females, the rate of suffocation decreased by 10.0%. The rate of poisoning among females decreased by 3.3%. Firearms were the most common method of suicide among all county levels in 2019. The percentage of suicides caused by firearms increased from 47.3% to 62.5% in rural areas, while the rate of suffocation and poisoning followed a similar pattern. The overall suicide rate decreased significantly in five states from 2018 to 2019. Among females, the rate declined significantly in Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia, and Massachusetts. The rate among males also declined in five states. The suicide rate declined in 2019 for the first time in 13 years, with significant declines among males and females. The rate declined in five states and in large fringe metropolitan areas. The decline in the suicide rate of gun suicides was especially encouraging. There is a link between mental illness and suicide, and it can be prevented through the identification and treatment of other risk factors. These factors include family and community barriers to suicide, employment barriers, and access to lethal means. As the world continues to grapple with the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, its long-term impacts are more critical than ever. This is evidenced by the rise in suicide rates following natural disasters and infrastructure disruption.","Stone, D. M.; Jones, C. M.; Mack, K.

"Racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence of stress and worry, mental health conditions, and increased substance use among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic - United States, April and May 2020","The prevalence of current depression, substance use, and suicidal thoughts and behavior among US adults was estimated at 28.6%, 8.2%, and 18.2%, respectively. Among the racial and ethnic groups, the highest prevalence of psychosocial stress was reported among the Hispanic adult. This study estimated the prevalence and epidemiology of suicide and depression in the USA. The prevalence of symptoms of depression, suicidal thoughts, and increased substance use were estimated to be 28.6%, 8.4%, or 18.2%, respectively. Among all respondents, the prevalence of these conditions was higher among Hispanics than among non-Hispanic Whites. Also, among those who reported suicidal thoughts/ideation, the rate was higher among Hispanics than among non-Hispanic Blacks. Among US adults, psychosocial stress was highest among those with family health problems (36.3%), isolation or loneliness (28.6%), and worries about getting sick due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Among non-Hispanic whites, stress was most common due to the spread of COVID-19. Among the factors that concern people about social determinants of health, job loss was most likely to cause stress. Not having enough food and unstable housing were also considered social determinants of health. Many mental health conditions and substance use were reported by US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of these conditions and substance use was higher among minorities. A review of the mental health outcomes data collected by other national surveys revealed potential increases in the prevalence of depression among adults. In the 2019 National Survey on Drugs Use and Health, 7.8% of US adults reported having suicidal thoughts or feelings. This figure is similar to the number of individuals who indicated having suicidal thoughts in the report released in 2019. In 2019, the percentage of people who said they did not have enough food was three times more frequently reported by African Americans and twice more frequently by Hispanics than by White persons. Stigma and discrimination can also contribute to the high rates of chronic stress among persons in minority groups. Additional measures to promote mental health in adults include screening for mental illness and substance abuse. These interventions can help identify individuals at high risk for mental illness and provide them with the support and services they need to manage their conditions. Because of the significant proportion of mental health care that happens in primary care settings, access to health care is important for addressing substance use conditions and mental health. However, racial and ethnic minority groups have experienced greater barriers to accessing health care than white individuals.","McKnight-Eily, L. R.; Okoro, C. A.; Strine, T.

"Fatigue and cognitive impairment in post-COVID syndrome: possible treatment approaches","Post-COVID syndrome can develop in all patients who have had COVID-19, regardless of the disease severity. Clinical manifestations post-COVID syndrome vary greatly, but the most common symptoms include fatigue, anxiety and depression disorders (ADDs), and cognitive impairment (CI). Objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cholytilin (choline alfoscerate) and the combined drug MexiB 6 in patients with post-COVID syndrome and fatigue, ADDs, and CI. Patients and methods. The study included 100 patients aged 22 to 71 years who have had COVID-19 5.4 months ago. Inclusion criterion: cognitive complaints, fatigue, and emotional disturbances. The evaluation included neurological exam, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), 10-words list task, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Study participants were divided into two groups. Patients who had ADDs (anxiety/depression level according to HADS =8 points;n=50) were prescribed with MexiB 6 (1 tablet three times per day). Patients with CI (mean MoCA score =25 points;n=50) were prescribed with Cholytilin (2 capsules (800 mg) in the morning and 1 capsule (400 mg) at lunchtime). The follow-up period was 60 days. Results and discussion. According to MoCA scores, a decrease in cognition was observed in 58% of participants, while 28% did not notice CI earlier. ADD fere present in 51%, and fatigue â€“ in 100% of patients. We observed a significant reduction in fatigue severity (from 62.42Â±7.18 to 52.32Â±16.36 points;p&lt;0.05) in patients prescribed with MexiB 6. The majority of patients noted a significant increase in physical activity, decreased fatigue, improvement of attention and physical well-being, and increased workplace efficiency. We also found a significant decrease in ADDs severity: ADDs either regressed completely (in 42% of participants) or became subclinical (in 48%;<U+0440>&lt;0.001). CI severity also reduced according to mean <U+041C><U+043E><U+0421><U+0410> (from 26.60Â±1.31 to 27.28Â±1.39 points;p&lt;0.05) and FAB (from 16.98Â±1.06 to 17.20Â±0.90 points;p&lt;0.05) scores. In a subgroup of patients with mild CI treated with Cholytilin mean <U+041C><U+043E><U+0421><U+0410> (from 23.50Â±0.99 to 26.36Â±1.34;<U+0440>&lt;0.001) and FAB (from 16.02Â±0.91 to 16.96Â±0.99;<U+0440>&lt;0.001) scores significantly increased. Complete regression of CI was observed in 74% of participants (<U+0440>&lt;0.001). We also found a decrease in ADDs (<U+0440>&lt;0.001) and fatigue (mean MFI-20 scores decreased from 42.28Â±10.73 to 35.60Â±8.10;<U+0440>&lt;0.001) severity in all study participants. Conclusion. Patients who have had COVID-19, regardless of the disease severity, have a high prevalence of fatigue, ADDs and CI, and MexiB 6 and Cholytilin have a potential in their treatment.","Bogolepova, A.

Methods: Respondents (n=606) completed a co-produced survey during August 2020. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Findings: Five major categories were identified: valuing support from health professionals, feeling lost in and let down by the system, the impact of restrictions to partners and others, virtual contact is not the same as in-person contact, and the need for emotional and psychological wellbeing support. Conclusion: The changes implemented may have compromised mental health and wellbeing in a critical period of vulnerability. Bringing stakeholders together can maximise learning from the emergency measures, to better inform future service provision. Work is needed to better hear from minoritised groups and ensure they are not further marginalised by changes.

"Post intensive care syndrome prevention and impact of COVID 19","In recent years, there has been a maximum increase in admissions to the intensive care unit, culminating in an exponential increase in admissions during the COVID 19 pandemic. Many patients who survived and were discharged from the intensive care unit have cognitive, physical, and psychological disorders that are reflected in the term post-intensive care syndrome. Patients and their families show symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and sleep problems. The result is that they negatively affect their quality of life. Numerous risk factors contribute to the development of this syndrome, mainly the sedation, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the length of stay in the intensive care unit. For this reason, it is necessary to take measures to prevent this syndrome including ABCDEFGH care plan, physical rehabilitation, nutritional support, and intensive care unit diaries. Care must also be given to the creation of Post Intensive care unit clinics where they have a diagnostic, therapeutic, counseling, and rehabilitation role that will act as assistants in the care of patients after discharge from the intensive care unit. Also, special care should be taken with patients who have recovered from COVID 19 whose needs are increasing and need immediate treatment. This review aims to analyze post-intensive care syndrome, prevention measures, and the impact of COVID 19. In conclusion, it is necessary to take measures to treat post-intensive care unit syndrome with early diagnosis and treatment, to reduce the adverse effects on both patients and their families.","Alefragkis, D.; Satolia, K.; Poulou, G.","https://doi.org/10.5604/01.3001.0014.9288","","Database: GIM; Publication details: Progress in Health Sciences; 11(1):112-117, 2021.; Publication details: Progress in Health Sciences; 11(1):112-117, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20973,""
"Transformation of polish ict enterprises after the covid 19","The COVID-19 epidemic has disrupted the development of the global economy. Virtually all sectors experienced a negative impact, which forced the transformation of many enterprises. In the case of the ICT sector, new environmental conditions pose a threat but also a development perspective, which forces ICT enterprises to introduce cross-cutting changes within their activities. These changes are not limited to the ICT sector but affect other economic sectors. This is related to the role that the ICT sector plays in creating innovation, building modern business models and new phenomena in the information society. The aim of the article is an attempt to characterize the conditions related to the transformation of ICT companies caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. The first part of the article defines the basic concepts of the ICT sector and characterizes its importance for the development of the economy. Then, against the background of the evolution of the ICT sector, the general characteristics of changes taking place within it are discussed. The next part of the article presents the results of the author's own research conducted among enterprises from the Polish ICT sector in 2020. The last part contains conclusions. Â© 2021.

"The Implications of Contemporary Research on COVID-19 for Volatility and Portfolio Management","This article synthesizes recent and ongoing finance and economics research on pandemic and disaster risk related to COVID-19. Characterized by pronounced market movements and extreme volatility, the unprecedented disruption to the economy in early 2020 has inspired a rich, burgeoning literature on the financial and economic ramifications of pandemic risk. Financial economists have cultivated fresh perspectives regarding the transmission of pandemic-induced uncertainty to financial markets via channels related to the beliefs and behaviors of investors as well as corporate strategies and outcomes. These findings also highlight the imperative role of government policy responses in regulating the market volatility triggered by large-scale disasters such as the pandemic. In this article, the authors take stock of this emerging literature, focusing on the implications for volatility and risk management. In doing so, they discuss the unique nature of the uncertainty induced by COVID-19 relative to that of past crises. They also review cutting-edge studies that use innovative analytical approaches and novel sources of data, offering fruitful avenues for future research. TOPICS: Tail risks, financial crises and financial market history, big data/machine learning Key Findings <U+25AA> We synthesize recent and ongoing research in the finance and economics literature on pandemic and disaster risk related to COVID-19 and discuss the implications for asset pricing, volatility, and risk management. <U+25AA> Pandemic-induced uncertainty led to extreme market movements in early 2020. We explore possible channels, such as investor beliefs and behaviors and corporate strategies, through which this risk was transmitted to the financial markets. <U+25AA> Lessons learned from the recent pandemic will continue to have implications for volatility and risk management, even after the pandemic ends.","Outlaw, Dominique, Aimee Hoffmann, Smith, Wang, Na","https://doi.org/10.3905/jpm.2021.1.282","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Portfolio Management; 47(9):159-177, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Portfolio Management; 47(9):159-177, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20975,""
"Post-COVID-19 Adaptations;the Shifts Towards Online Learning, Hybrid Course Delivery and the Implications for Biosciences Courses in the Higher Education Setting","The Covid-19 pandemic has created challenges and caused disruption across the Higher Education sector;university campuses closed, and face-to-face teaching and assessment shifted to an online format. Learning from our studentsâ€™ experience during this period will help us shape future hybrid delivery so that it best fits Bioscience students. This pedagogical study explored Aston Universityâ€™s Bioscience studentsâ€™ experiences of studying from home, and the impact of the lockdown on mental wellbeing and quality of life. 151 students completed an online survey during August 2020, which included open and closed questions. Analysis of survey data revealed that a majority of students reported positive experiences of online open-book assessments and most would welcome this format in the future. The majority of students faced no technical issues, predominantly stating that they also had good internet connectivity. Shifting to remote learning and online classrooms uncovered conflicting preferences;despite wanting more interactive lectures, only half of the students were comfortable interacting using video cameras. Free text responses provided an insight into how some students reported an inadequate home working space/environment and lacked necessary items such as a desk, highlighting how remote working may intensify social and digital inequality - particularly for students from more deprived households. Wider detrimental experiences of lockdown included dissatisfaction with access to healthcare, decreased concentration, sleeping difficulties and a decline in mental wellbeing. Education strategies going forward will need to address the mental health needs of students who have suffered during the pandemic. Our university, amongst others, is embracing hybrid course delivery, which could offer a solution to ensuring Bioscience students receive hands-on laboratory experience and face-to-face contact to remain motivated and benefit from the on-campus facilities and support, whilst allowing students some of the flexibility afforded by remote study. In the current competitive higher education market where student retention is key, it is important to consider student demographics and digital equity to ensure an appropriate approach is applied to cater for all students.

"Individualized and Phase-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for the Treatment of Early Onset Pure Dysthymic Syndrome in an Outpatient with Mixed Personality Features","Chronic forms of depression often share many features with personality dysfunction and can be difficult to treat using traditional psychotherapies. To help improve treatment outcomes, individualized psychotherapies based on the individualâ€™s specific problems and preferences that target interpersonal issues and have a longer duration of treatment have been recommended. The current case study follows a man diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder (PDD) and mixed personality features over the course of treatment that used an individualized and phase-based approach. An individualized and extended form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that shared similarities with cognitive-behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) was implemented to address the potential influence of early adverse life events, dysfunctional ways of thinking about the self and others that leads to increased depressed mood, and the influence of interpersonal situations in and outside the therapeutic relationship. Therapy was conducted in three phases (1. Psychoeducation/introduction to CBT;2. modified CBT for insomnia and behavioral activation;3. cognitive restructuring) during 32 weekly sessions over a period of nearly 11 months. Standardized measures administered over the course of treatment indicated significant reductions in depressive symptoms and improvements in self-efficacy. Qualitative reports from the client indicated improved satisfaction and quality of life as well as improved quality of relationships.","Adams, S.

"A case of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis amid the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: COVID-19 has been linked to neuropsychiatric symptoms, including delirium, depression/anxiety, PTSD, and rarely, severe neuropsychiatric impairment. However, much remains unknown. We present a case of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in a patient with concurrent COVID-19 infection. Case History: A 27-year-old male who carried diagnoses of unspecified mood versus psychotic disorder was admitted with atypical psychosis and suicidal ideation. Patient initially presented to primary care with racing thoughts, delusions, depression (PHQ-9517), anxiety (GAD-7510), and new onset cognitive symptoms along with olfactory hallucinations. He endorsed daily suicidal ideations and reported using two cellphones to block suicidal waves and enhance his memory. He was admitted to inpatient psychiatry where he exhibited disorganized behavior and paranoid delusions, and reported visual hallucinations. Initial workup of EEG, brain MRI, and TSH were unremarkable. Two months after admission, he developed sore throat and fever and tested positive for COVID-19. Patient developed streaky opacites on chest X-ray, was transferred to the ICU, and intubated due to agitation. Once extubated, he experienced repeated epileptic seizures despite multiple antiepileptics, and lumbar puncture ultimately revealed anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. Symptoms slowly improved with plasmapheresis, steroids, and Rituximab. Conclusions: Case reports suggest that some patients may present with neuropsychiatric symptoms or experience neuropsychiatric sequelae following COVID-19 infection. Infection itself can precipitate an autoimmune encephalitis and may also cause neurological damage which can unmask other neuropsychiatric conditions. This case highlights that research is needed to understand the intersection between COVID-19 infection and mechanisms implicated in other neuropsychiatric disorders, including the spectrum of autoimmune encephalitides.","Adams, C.

"The path analysis of the influence of anxiety, job burnout and self-efficacy on well-being-take the sample of college english teachers under the novel coronavirus pneumonia","Objective: Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia is spreading all over the world. Through investigating the anxiety, job burnout, self-efficacy and general well-being of the college English teachers, it is to explore the social mentality of the people under the epidemic situation, and provide evidence for improving the mental health of occupational population and formulating psychological intervention measures. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 520 college English teachers from Jilin Province(n=340) and Hubei Province(n=180) were investigated by anxiety scale, job burnout scale, self-efficacy scale and general well-being scale. Results: The detection rate of anxiety in the occupational group was 48.65%, and there was a significant difference in the scores of anxiety among the subjects of different ages(P&lt;0.05);the level of burnout were higher than the average, and the subjects of different ages were in a serious state of burnout was statistically significant (P&lt; 0.05);the general well-being of the subjects was significantly higher than that of the national norm (P&lt;0.01). Path analysis showed that anxiety, job burnout and self-efficacy were the negative and positive factors that affect general well-being, and self-efficacy played an intermediary role between anxiety, job burnout and general well-being separately. Conclusion: Under the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia it can improve the self-efficacy of occupation population, further overcome panic and learned helplessness to reduce anxiety, job burnout, enhance resilience, improve general well-being.

"Service Interruption: Managing Commitment to Community Partners during a Crisis","While the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic is the most widespread and longest lasting educational disruption of the modern era, it joins a host of other natural and human-made crises affecting university education, such as Hurricane MarÃ­a in Puerto Rico (2017), the Islamic State's closure of Al-Furat University in Syria (2014), Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans (2005), and many others. For service learning classes, generally defined as students learning as they provide service to a community partner, these large scale disruptions create special challenges even when it is possible to move classes online. The COVID-19 pandemic seriously affected the active involvement of community partners, including non-profit organizations, local schools and hospitals, and local governments. Many community organizations struggled to meet increased demand for their assistance while simultaneously cutting personnel due to budget shortfalls. In this paper, we report results from 34 survey respondents who offered service learning classes in undergraduate computer and information science during spring 2020. Despite the turmoil, only three faculty respondents lost their community partner entirely. In response to disruption, nearly half of faculty removed some of the assignments' requirements, while others made the service project optional or removed it completely. Going online negatively affected students' ability to collaborate with each other and interact with community partners, activities that are considered important for reaching learning outcomes for service learning. Nevertheless, about two-thirds of faculty reported that their students completed their service assignments and described conditions that led to or detracted from their success. Based on the findings, the authors present several implications for development of future computer and information science service learning offerings that are resilient during times of crisis.

Diary extracts were curated using Instagram Direct Messaging (DM), email and text messaging. At the end of the study, participants took part in a follow-up interview (conducted by telephone or Zoom), asking them to reflect on their diary entries.ResultsThematic analysis of diaries and interviews yielded three central themes: (1) impacts of social distancing upon mental health and emotional wellbeing;(2) impacts of the pandemic on education and school life;and (3) frustration, burden and responsibility.DiscussionThese findings highlight acute mental health impacts (loneliness, isolation, anxiety) as well as longer-term repercussions from disrupted education (missed parts of curriculum, home schooling, cancelled exams, periods of isolation) on young people aged 13â€“17 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Scott, Steph, McGowan, Victoria J.; Visram, Shelina","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-SSMabstracts.192","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A89, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A89, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20983,""
"How can we optimise the co-location of welfare rights advice in a health setting to benefit those most in need? A narrative synthesis systematic review","BackgroundFinancial difficulties can precipitate and perpetuate mental health problems and are a predictor of chronic physical illness. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis with profound health and socioeconomic impacts and the long-term consequences are yet to be seen. The poorest and most vulnerable groups are worst affected, further widening the health inequality gap. It is known that there is low uptake of universal and means-tested benefits in some communities. Various schemes have been put in place to improve uptake of benefits by co-locating welfare advice within health services. However, we need more research on how to do this most effectively to reach the populations most in need and to assess its impact on health, social and financial outcomes.MethodsWe conducted a critical systematic narrative synthesis review of relevant papers published between 2010â€“2020 using an evidence-led framework described by Rodgers et al. consisting of four elements used to characterise the approach: developing a theory;developing a preliminary synthesis;exploring relationships within and between studies;and assessing the robustness of the evidence.ResultsIn total, 16,625 participants accessed and were supported by the welfare services, with Â£19,576,223 successfully claimed as one-off payments for participants. Participants benefitted from an additional Â£2,757 household income per annum and improved financial literacy. The services across this review generated an average of Â£21.95 of social, economic and environmental return on investment per Â£1 invested. Co-located welfare advice services actively incorporate elements of proportionate universalism and target those who are most at need of this support and who would not otherwise access the services. The services raised the profile of the importance and value of addressing social determinants of health with healthcare professionals and policy makers and de-stigmatising access to welfare services and being in receipt of benefits. Access to welfare services also produced demonstratable cost savings for the NHS. Welfare services facilitated more appropriate use of NHS resources, promoting access for those who needed it but were not accessing it and reducing the burden of welfare issues on healthcare practitionerâ€™s time.DiscussionOverall, this review demonstrates significant financial gains for participants and for the first time demonstrates wider welfare benefits to participants, including access to housing, food, transport and employment. This contributes to the theory that these welfare services both directly and indirectly address social determinants of health thereby improving health and wellbeing and reducing health inequalities.","Reece, Sian, Dickerson, Josie, Pickett, Kate","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-SSMabstracts.174","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A81, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A81, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20984,""
"A comparative case study of health-justice partnerships in England: service models and implementation success","BackgroundSocial welfare legal problems are root causes of health inequality. Legal advice services can improve socio-economic circumstances and mitigate the financial and social costs of illness. With these aims, partnerships between healthcare and legal services exist across England to support patients with welfare needs. They occur in diverse health settings and take many forms. Success is markedly variable in developing collaborative working and sustaining cross-sector partnerships. This study investigates how such partnerships are implemented and what factors determine differences in implementation outcomes.MethodsA comparative case study of health-justice partnerships across England was undertaken. Services were recruited from different regions, representing diverse health settings and service models. Data were collected through: i) One-to-one semi-structured interviews with staff members and funding organisations;ii) Service records and documentation. In-depth qualitative analysis using the process tracing method was applied to each case study individually. Cross-case comparison of the resulting themes identified key patterns and determinants of implementation success.ResultsNine services participated in the study. Four were based in primary care, four in acute or specialist care (cancer services, mental health services, a childrenâ€™s hospital and an HIV clinic) and one spanned both primary and secondary care. Thirty-eight interviews were undertaken with staff members in frontline and management roles. The case studies provide detailed descriptions of service models, including: co-location or remote working arrangements, referral methods and routes, cross-sector communication and data sharing, funding and management arrangements. The partnerships had experienced different trajectories: while some were long-lived (up to two decades), others had been discontinued, cut in size or had failed to properly establish. Factors influencing sustainability included decision-making processes around funding, strategic-level support and leadership characteristics. The extent of collaborative working was highly variable and influenced by: i) willingness to engage;ii) confidence to engage;iii) ability to engage. These factors were amenable to change. All the partnerships indicated benefits for patient access to legal assistance, positive welfare outcomes, improvements in mental wellbeing and patient experience.

"The experiences of community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: preliminary findings from a qualitative study with hertfordshire cohort study participants","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic changes in peopleâ€™s lives globally. Older adults have been especially vulnerable to adverse effects from the pandemic including higher mortality and more severe disease complications. At the same time, social isolation, malnutrition and physical inactivity are serious concerns among older adults. The pandemic and associated restrictions may serve to exacerbate these issues, presenting increased risks to physical and mental health. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore how community-living older people in the UK experienced the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it impacted their health and well-being, and associated behaviours.MethodsQualitative data were collected by conducting serial telephone interviews, with an interval of approximately three months. Participants were from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study, all aged over 80 years. Discussions were audio-recorded, information related to the COVID-19 pandemic was transcribed verbatim and transcripts analysed thematically. Interviews were conducted from March to October 2020.ResultsTwelve participants were included in the study (7 men and 5 women). Data from a total of 35 qualitative interviews were used, comprising two or three timepoints per participant. Preliminary analysis identified five overarching themes: 1) shopping strategies and food accessibility, 2) limitations on activities and going out, 3) disruption to healthcare, 4) social and psychological repercussions, and 5) coping strategies. Initial findings highlight challenges associated with accessing shops, healthcare, and usual activities due to restrictions. Findings emphasize the issue of loneliness and isolation for some of the participants, especially those living alone, as well as fear of the virus, with restrictions leading to a loss of purpose for some, along with related effects on mental health (e.g. worry, anxiety). For some, these issues appeared to link to a reprioritisation of their behaviours (for example, exercise and diet were deprioritised). Coping strategies used by participants included finding ways to keep busy and to do physical activity safely, maintaining social contact online or by telephone, and having an optimistic or positive outlook, a â€˜do what you canâ€™ attitude.ConclusionAnalysis is ongoing and will further aim to explore how older peopleâ€™s experiences and behaviours might have changed over the duration of the pandemic. The findings from this study could improve understanding of how community-living older adults could be supported to be more resilient in the face of a variety of changing circumstances that might impact their health and well-being.","Bloom, Ilse, Zhang, Jean, Bevilacqua, Gregorio, Lawrence, Wendy, Ward, Kate, Cooper, Cyrus, Dennison, Elaine","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-SSMabstracts.140","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A65-A66, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A65-A66, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20986,""
"Mental health inequalities in disruptions to healthcare, economic activity and housing during COVID-19: findings from 12 UK longitudinal population surveys","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic with its associated virus suppression measures have disrupted many domains of life for many people. Increasingly it is recognised that negative disruptive impacts of the pandemic are not experienced equally and may exacerbate existing inequalities. People already suffering from psychological distress may have been especially vulnerable to disruptions. We investigated associations between pre-pandemic psychological distress and disruptions to healthcare, economic activity, and housing, and whether these associations were moderated by age, sex, ethnicity or education.MethodsData were from 59,482 participants in 12 UK longitudinal adult population surveys with both pre-pandemic and COVID-19 surveys. Participants self-reported disruptions since the start of the pandemic to: healthcare (medication access, procedures, or appointments);economic activity (negative changes in employment, income or working hours);and housing (change of address or household composition). These were also combined into a cumulative measure indicating how many of these three domains had been disrupted. Logistic regression models were used within each study to estimate associations between pre-pandemic standardised psychological distress scores and disruption outcomes. Analyses were weighted for sampling design and attrition, and adjusted for age, sex, education, ethnicity, and UK country. Findings were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis with restricted maximum likelihood. Effect modification by sex, education, ethnicity and age was assessed using group-difference tests during meta-analysis.ResultsWhile exact prevalence varied between studies, pre-pandemic psychological distress was generally more common among women, ethnic minorities, younger age groups, and those with less education. One standard deviation higher psychological distress was associated with raised odds of health care disruptions (OR 1.40;95% CI: 1.29â€“1.51;Heterogeneity I2: 79.4%) and with experiencing disruptions in two or more of the three domains examined (OR 1.22;95% CI: 1.14â€“1.31;Heterogeneity I2: 75.8%), but not specifically with disruptions to economic activity (OR 1.03;95% CI: 0.95â€“1.13;Heterogeneity I2: 89.5%) or housing (OR 1.00;95% CI: 0.97â€“1.03;Heterogeneity I2: 0.0%). We did not find evidence of these associations differing by sex, ethnicity, education, or age group.ConclusionThose suffering from psychological distress before the pandemic have been more likely to experience healthcare disruptions during the pandemic, and clusters of disruptions across multiple life domains. Individuals suffering from distress may need additional support to manage these disruptions, especially in relation to healthcare. Otherwise, considering psychological distress was already unequally distributed, the pandemic may exacerbate existing inequalities related to gender, ethnicity, education and age.","Green, Michael J.; Giorgio Di, Gessa, Maddock, Jane, McElroy, Eoin, Thomson, Ellen J.; Patalay, Praveetha, Davies, Helena L.; Mundy, Jessica, Stevenson, Anna J.; Kwong, Alex S.

"Communication across maternal social networks during the UKâ€™s national lockdown and its association with postnatal depressive symptoms","BackgroundPostnatal depression (PND) is highly detrimental for both mother and baby, with a pre-COVID-19 estimated prevalence of up to 23% in Europe. Low social support is a key risk factor for developing PND. Social distancing measures designed to limit COVID-19 transmission likely created unprecedented barriers for mothers to access social support. We explore how social support networks existed during the UKâ€™s first national lockdown amongst London mothers with infants, and their associations with postnatal depressive symptoms.MethodsUsing self-reported social network data from 162 London-based mothers with infants aged =6 months collected in May-June 2020 (during the first lockdown), we conduct a concurrent design mixed-method study. We quantitatively describe communication within maternal support networks, using quasi-Poisson regression models to analyse associations with postnatal depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). In parallel, we thematically analyse open-text data to explore and understand the experiences of mothers with infants during Englandâ€™s lockdown.ResultsQuantitative findings: Levels of depressive symptoms were high in our sample, with 47.5% of participants meeting the &gt;=11EPDS cut-off for potential postnatal depression.On average, women kept in contact with 10â€“11 people remotely (via WhatsApp, Zoom etc), and saw one family member other than their partner, suggesting high compliance with lockdown rules. The number of seen in person, and remote communication with a higher proportion of those not seen, negatively predicted depressive symptoms (RRR = 0.950 â€“ 0.996 across models). However, a higher proportion of relatives seen in person was associated with increased depressive symptoms (RRR=1.003;95% CI 1.001â€“1.006), suggesting family members may have broken lockdown rules to support mums in need. Qualitative findings: We identified four themes. Some mothers in our sample felt lockdown â€˜protectedâ€™ family time which led to better bonding, often facilitated by high levels of support from the partner (theme 1). However, many experienced the â€˜burden of constant motheringâ€™ without anyone around to help (theme 2). Mothers felt remote contact was â€˜not as goodâ€™ and led to reduced or inadequate support (theme 3). Mothers grieved for lost opportunities for them and their baby, and worried about the developmental impact on their baby (theme 4). Overall, these experiences coexisted with feelings of isolation, exhaustion, worry, inadequacy, guilt, and increased stress.ConclusionResults suggest the strict lockdown in the UK may have increased the risk of postnatal depression, reflected in the high levels of PND symptoms and poor maternal experiences in our sample.","Emmott, Emily, Myers, Sarah","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-SSMabstracts.64","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A30, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A30, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20988,""
"The mental health of UK workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal analysis of differential impacts across industries and social class categories*","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected mental health but its impacts are likely to differ across industries and social class groups. The â€˜new normalâ€™ in employment opportunities, patterns and conditions is likely to include a degree of fear, uncertainty, employment instability and job loss. It is imperative we identify and understand how workers have been disadvantaged by the pandemic and current working modes. We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of UK workers by industry and social class category and to investigate whether any observed impacts differed by age, gender, and country of residence within the UK.MethodsWe used the UK Household Longitudinal Study (Understanding Society) to analyse data from adults in paid employment, who participated in pre-COVID-19 Waves [9(2017/19) and 10/11(2018/20)] and in at least one COVID-19 wave. Our primary outcome was probable psychological distress, defined by â€˜casenessâ€™ (a score of 4+) in the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and exposures included industrial sectors (classified using the UK Standard Industrial Classification) and social class (using the Eight Class National Statistics Socio-economic Classification). We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models, adjusting for age, gender, employment type, financial situation and UK country of residence and used inverse probability weights to account for attrition and non-response, to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Subsequently, we stratified by gender, UK country of residence, and age group.ResultsOur final sample includes 44,500 observations (Pre-pandemic period=13,314, pandemic period=31,186) across 7,075 individuals. GHQ-caseness increased for workers in most industries during the pandemic;especially in â€˜Accommodation and Food Servicesâ€™ (OR:3.2;95%CI:1.9,5.4). Analysis by social class showed that â€˜Small employers and own accountâ€™ workers were the most affected (OR:2.9;95%CI:2.1,4.0). Our stratified analysis by industry demonstrated the largest increase in GHQ-caseness between the pre and pandemic periods to be by gender in the â€˜Accommodation and Food Servicesâ€™ sector (OR:9.6;95%CI:3.2,29.0 for men;OR:2.0;95%CI:1.2,3.4 for women);whereas by social class the largest increase was observed when stratifying by UK country of residence for â€˜Small employers and own accountâ€™ workers (non-England: OR:8.8;95%CI:4.1,18.8;England: OR:2.5;95%CI:1.6,3.9).ConclusionOur findings indicate that the pandemic has significantly affected the mental health of UK workers. Policies with a decentralised element are needed, prioritising support to certain industrial sectors and the self-employed/small business owners, as well as for particular demographic groups (e.g. men in the â€˜Accommodation and Food Servicesâ€™ industry) who are in an excessively high risk.","Theocharis, Kromydas, Green, Michael, Graig, Peter, Vittal, Katikereddi, Layland, Alastair, Niedzwiedz, Claire, Pearce, Anna, Thomson, Rachel, Demou, Evangelia","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-SSMabstracts.63","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A29-A30, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A29-A30, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20989,""
"Caring in the time of COVID-19, longitudinal trends in wellbeing and mental health in carers in Ireland: evidence from the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (TILDA)*","BackgroundThe initial public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland recommended that older people aged =70 years remain at home, and physically isolate from those outside their household. This may have affected both care-receipt and care-provision by the older population as maintaining these activities could be challenging with travel restrictions and recommended physical distancing. This study aimed to determine if prevalence of informal caring changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine longitudinal trends in quality of life, stress, and depressive symptoms in carers.MethodsWe analysed the COVID-19 self-completion questionnaire (SCQ) sub-study (June-November 2020) of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), a nationally representative study of people aged =50 years ongoing since 2009. A total of 3,043 participants aged =60 years were included. Participants were asked if they cared for someone during the COVID-19 pandemic, their relationship to the recipient, and number of hours/week. Outcome measures collected were CES-D8, Perceived stress Scale (PSS) and CASP12. Change in prevalence of caring from previous waves was examined. Multi-level regression analyses examined longitudinal trends in CED-D8, PSS and CASP12 scores by caring status since Wave 3 (2014), adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Analyses were conducted in Stata 14.ResultsPrevalence of informal caring tripled during the COVID-19 pandemic (15% compared to 5% in 2018). While 26% of carers reported they had stopped caring since the pandemic, most of those providing care were new carers (68% of men and 66% of women carers). Becoming a new carer during the pandemic was associated with lower CASP12 scores (ÃŸ=-0.582, 95% CI -1.018,-0.146) and higher PSS (ÃŸ=0.541, 95% CI 0.316,0.765) compared to no caring. Caring for =50 hours in the past week was associated with lower CASP12 (ÃŸ=-0.878, 95%CI -1.345,-0.412), higher PSS scores (ÃŸ=0.383, 95%CI 0.066,0.700) and higher depressive symptoms (ÃŸ=0.371, 95% CI 0.251,0.490). This association was moderated by carer status;new carers with increased hours had higher CES-D8 compared to non-carers, with no difference for those who stopped or continued caring.DiscussionThis study demonstrated that the reduction of availability of both formal and informal care for older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, led to increased caring by older household members and was associated with lower wellbeing and mental health. This study provides further evidence of the detrimental indirect effects of the pandemic for older people and emphasizes for policymakers the importance of prioritising formal and informal care arrangements for the older population.","McGarrigle, Christine, Ward, Mark, Aisling, Oâ€™Halloran, DeLooze, Celine, Kenny, Rose Anne","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-SSMabstracts.62","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A29, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A29, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20990,""
"The impacts of COVID-19 on health visiting in England: FOI and survey evidence","BackgroundHealth visiting, a universal home visiting programme for new parents, aims to prevent and reduce inequalities in child development. Health visiting in England, however, is under strain after years of funding cuts. COVID-19 has exacerbated pressures on services, due to redeployment of staff and knock-on impacts of the pandemic to families. Objectives: To evaluate how COVID-19 has impacted health visiting staff, the services they provide, and the families they serve. Also, to document the scale and variation in redeployment of health visiting staff due to COVID-19.MethodsWe used two different sources of data.Our first source is a survey of health visiting professionals. The first sweep (n=740) was carried out between 19 June-10 September 2020. Topics covered include how COVID-19 has impacted health visiting services, concerns for children and parents, and the mental and physical health of staff. The second sweep is being fielded and will capture the current lockdown.Our second source is data on health visiting staffing numbers and caseload prior to the pandemic and redeployment during the first COVID-19 wave, which we collected for n=140/151 local authorities through FOI requests. We will collect FOI data for the second COVID-19 wave.We conduct descriptive analysis and data visualisation of the survey and FOI data using Stata 16.ResultsPrior to the pandemic, in 80% of local authorities, caseloads were greater than 250 children per staff, the maximum recommended by the Institute of Health Visiting. We find evidence of widespread redeployment of health visiting staff and significant variation in the level of redeployment across local authorities. In many cases redeployment led to caseload increases. 38% of health visiting staff surveyed reported increased caseload between 19 March-3 June 2020. With growth in caseloads and face-to-face contact limited, there was widespread concern amongst health visitors that childrenâ€™s needs would be missed, particularly those of vulnerable children. Our first wave results revealed poor staff mental health. We examine the association between redeployment and local COVID-19 prevalence on physical and mental health and will analyse how mental and physical health has evolved since the first COVID-19 wave using SF-12 questionnaire data.ConclusionHealth visiting services were already stretched prior to COVID-19, and redeployment will likely have materially impacted families who rely on health visitors. With geographical variation in redeployment, familiesâ€™ access to health visitors was determined by their postcode. Increased funding for health visiting services to boost workforce size is necessary.","Conti, Gabriella, Dow, Abigail, Bassoli, Elena","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-SSMabstracts.61","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A28-A29, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 75(Suppl 1):A28-A29, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20991,""
"Identifying local authority need for, and uptake of, school-based physical activity interventions in England â€“ a cluster analysis using routine data","BackgroundSchools in England need effective, simple interventions to address shortfalls in childrenâ€™s physical activity. Areas in England where physical activity is low among children may particularly benefit from school-based physical activity interventions. Further, stark geographical inequalities for childrenâ€™s physical activity exist and have widened during Covid-19 lockdowns. The Daily Mile (TDM) is a school-based running programme that has been widely adopted across England. However, there is limited evidence of its equitability and whether it reaches children in most need. We aimed to i) identify local authorities in England with the highest need for childrenâ€™s physical activity promotion and ii) determine whether TDM reaches schools in areas of high need.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study linking routinely collected data from a range of sources including the Active Lives Surveys and national datasets. Characteristics of need were identified following a literature review to identify determinants of childrenâ€™s physical activity. Our assessment of local authority â€˜needâ€™ included measures of children and adultâ€™s physical activity and excess weight, childrenâ€™s mental health needs, access and utilisation of outdoor space for exercise, and deprivation. We grouped local authorities using a hierarchical cluster analysis. The optimal number of clusters for our data was three clusters. We estimated the association between â€˜needâ€™ and registration to TDM with a Poisson regression.ResultsWe identified three distinct clusters of need for childrenâ€™s physical activity interventions representing 4.5 million primary school children. High-need, medium- need, and low- need local authorities included 24%, 56% and 20% of 123 upper-tier English local authorities respectively. Schools in local authorities of high-need were more likely to be registered to TDM (IRR: 1.25, 95%CI:1.12â€“1.39) compared with schools in low-need local authorities, where registration to TDM ranged from one in five schools in the low-need cluster to one in four in the high-need cluster.ConclusionOur study suggests that TDM is an equitable intervention reaching schools in areas with the highest need. Areas of highest need are concentrated in particular areas in England, for example the North East. Matching public health interventions to the needs of the population is more efficient and equitable than blanket policies directed at whole populations. This identification of clusters of local authorities that share patterns of need may guide shared learning between local authorities that share similar challenges and contextual features.","Venkatraman, Tishya, Honeyford, Kate, Bina, Ram, van Sluijs, Esther M.

"Online resilience support groups during the COVID-19 pandemic: the Philippine experience","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the outcomes of an online resilience support group during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. Specifically, it described the extent to which the program improved adaptive coping, non-reactivity, resilience and well-being and decreased stress, depression and anxiety symptoms of participants. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a pretestâ€“posttest design with 53 participants. A majority of participants were female (74%) who participated in the program for 6â€“8 weeks. Scales measuring adaptive coping, non-reactivity, resilience, well-being, stress, depression and anxiety were administered before and after the completion of the modules. Findings: Results revealed significant improvements in adaptive coping particularly seeking emotional and instrumental support, active coping, and religious coping. The results also showed significant improvements in nonreactivity, psychological well-being and resilience and decrease in depression symptoms. Effect size estimates indicate medium effect sizes for well-being and nonreactivity with the other outcomes having small effect sizes. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of this study is the lack of a randomized control trial design and the lack of control for extraneous variables. Future studies using rigorous and longitudinal designs are recommended. Future studies may also examine program implementation factors such as using homogenous groups. Practical implications: In most low-income countries, the provision of mental health and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the lack of mental health professionals, issues of internet connectivity and a lack of resources and access. Online resilience support groups may provide a means to address these challenges by making mental health support more accessible and available. Social implications: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused isolation and a means to bridge this is through peer support groups. This may be especially important in collectivist cultures where social relationships serve as recovery capital. Originality/value: Although there has been a rise in the use of technology, most are in the form of individual or self-help interventions. This paper examines the feasibility of an online structured peer support group that focuses on building resilience skills. It fills a gap in the literature on online peer support groups that may be most relevant for low-income countries with a dearth of mental health specialists.

"Impact of the abcb1 drug resistance gene on complications associated with covid-19","Background: Overexpression of the ABCB1 gene has been associated with a poor prognosis in various hemato-oncological diseases due to resistance to different chemotherapy types. Usually, the gene expression is low, but drugs like steroids can stimulate it. The COVID-19 infection has affected much of the world, especially Latin America, where mortality is higher than expected, mostly due to hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Since the beginning of the pandemic, different combinations (chloroquine, azithromycin, antivirals) have been used, some with a moderate benefit (Tocilizumab, convalescent plasma) but without establishing a group that could benefit. The ATP flow pump contributes to cell detoxification, including overdosing of drugs;some drugs are substrates of this pump and modify its operation Aims: Describe the impact of ABCB1 drug resistance gene expression on mortality and ventilatory support in critically ill patients with COVID-19 Methods: Sixty-one patients (23 women and 38 men) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and included in the study. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare).RNA isolation was performed using Trizol â„¢ reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The RNA obtained's concentration and purity was measured using Nanodrop â„¢ 2000 (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, ME, USA). cDNA was synthesized from 1 Âµg of RNA using oligo (dT) and MML-V enzyme from Promega Biotech AB. The expression levels of the ABCB1 gene were determined by qPCR using the TaqMan â„¢ system (Hs01069047, Applied Biosystems, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA) and normalizing with the endogenous GUSB gene (Hs00939627) (Gene expression = 2 - <U+0394>CT, where <U+0394>CT = CT of the gene of interest - CT of the reference gene.) The expression levels were classified according to the known values in healthy donors. Results: 61 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with criteria for hospital care and supplemental oxygen. The majority were men (n = 36, 59%), obesity was the most frequent comorbidity (n = 28.45.9%), followed by diabetes (n = 22, 36.1%) and hypertension (n = 18, 29.5%). Treatment for COVID-19 included high-flow oxygen in combination with the best available therapy;8.2% (n = 5) started with hydroxychloroquine, 44.3% (n = 27) were treated with metformin hydrochloride, 36.1% with azithromycin, 55.7% (n = 34) with atorvastatin and 95.2% (n = 58) with low molecular weight heparin. During the hospital period. 49.2% (n = 30) required ventilatory support. When analyzing the expression of ABCB1, 63.9% (n = 39) had a high or absent expression, 36.1% showed a low expression. Cases with high / absent expression showed a worse prognosis compared to low expression (Log Rank = 0.000). When comparing the different risk variables, the high / absent expression of ABCB1 was a significant risk factor for death (OR 3.08, [1.02-9.26], p = 0.045) and ventilatory support (OR 2.8, [0.98-8.5], p = 0.054). Other factors such as male gender (OR 2.54 [0.89-7.27], p = 0.081) and older age (OR 5.19, [1.48-18.2] p = 0.010) were associated with a poor prognosis. Diabetes had low impact (OR 1.11, [0.38-3.22], p=0838) on prognosis Summary/Conclusion: Similar to cancer treatment, the modification of the expression of the ABCB1 gene (high or absent) impacts the prognosis of patients with severe COVID-19 disease due to the overuse of drugs.","Ramos, C.; Olarte, I.; Mendoza, I.; Martinez, A.","https://doi.org/10.1097/HS9.0000000000000566","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: HemaSphere; 5(SUPPL 2):381, 2021.; Publication details: HemaSphere; 5(SUPPL 2):381, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",20995,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Trump's Electoral Demise: The Role of Economic and Democratic Accountability","Did the COVID-19 crisis have a significant effect on Trump's electoral demise? We present survey experimental evidence on two substantial effects of the pandemic. First, information on the unprecedented economic downturn significantly depressed Trump's popular support across all partisan groups, and especially among middle-low and low-income respondents. Second, being primed on the poor public health record of the Trump administration reduced its electoral prospects among citizens between 55 and 70 years old. We conclude that the 2020 election was a normal contest compatible with theories of economic voting and political competence. Our results suggest that democratic accountability can be a powerful determinant of the fate of populist leaders once in power. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

"Promoting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: the transtheoretical model of change and social marketing approach","The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how social marketers can use the Transtheoretical Model of Change to enhance their web-based campaigns promoting mental health during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The Transtheoretical Model of Change was adapted and applied in a COVID-19 mental health context and qualitative content analysis was conducted on 20 websites promoting mental health during the Pandemic from all around the world. Results show that campaigns vary in terms of their adherence to the Transtheoretical Model of Change. Some are very consistent, whereas others could benefit from incorporating specific relevant information. Particularly, the maintenance stage of change has been ignored by most websites analyzed. Designers of such campaigns could use this paper for inspiration, to check for the completeness of their websites, and to adapt their messages while the situation unfolds and individuals move from one stage of change to the next. Incorporating knowledge from a widely used and effective theoretical model is likely to make websites more successful in helping individuals maintain their mental health during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

"COVID-Hero: Machine Learning Based COVID-19 Awareness Enhancement Mobile Game for Children","In this pandemic, children are affected heavily by lockdown and quarantine worldwide. Hence, childrenâ€™s awareness of COVID-19 and passing a joyful time at home are necessary for their mental health. In this work, we developed a mobile gaming app named COVID-Hero, which intends to learn and create awareness among children about COVID-19. Using this app, they obtain scores/points by grabbing the right objects from their superhero-shaped player, which are fun, attractive, and psychologically helpful during this pandemic. However, we designed a questionnaire and conducted a user survey of different aged people who gave their opinions about this game. Finally, numerous significant features were extracted and prioritized using machine learning regression models that enhance childrenâ€™s COVID-19 awareness and tolerable behavior in this pandemic.

"Symptom exacerbations in a mixed outpatient neuropsychiatric population during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased mental health issues worldwide. Patients with cognitive disorders may be at particular risk of neuropsychiatric decompensation. Telehealth may be an effective means of delivering care to these patients. Objective: To characterize neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations reported by patients of a neuropsychiatry outpatient practice during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate the perceived efficacy of telehealth in addressing these symptoms. Methods: Patients who completed at least one telehealth visit at our practice after March 1, 2020 were invited to enroll in this prospective, single site study. Telephone surveys were conducted assessing neuropsychiatric symptoms and satisfaction with telehealth. Descriptive statistics summarize our findings. We used Fisher's exact test to compare responses across demographic and diagnostic categories. Results: Thirty-eight patients completed the survey;31 (82%) were white, 18 (47%) were female, and median age was 61. Diagnoses included acquired brain injury (traumatic, N512, 32%;nontraumatic, N59, 24%);mild cognitive impairment (N59, 24%);dementia (N55, 13%);and other (N53, 5%). Exacerbations of anxiety (63%), irritability (61%), depression (58%), and memory impairment (58%) were most common. Symptom reports did not differ across age, race, or diagnosis, but women were more likely to report worsened memory (83% versus 35%, p=0.004), disorientation (76% versus 20%, p=0.001), and impulsivity (39% versus 5%, p=0.016). Thirtyseven patients (97%) reported overall satisfaction with telehealth. Conclusion: Multidomain neuropsychiatric symptoms increased during the pandemic in a population with access to telehealth. Women may be at greater risk. Telehealth can be an effective way to deliver care to these patients.","Kim, K.; Clayton, A.; Masurkar, A.; Marsh, K.; Gurin, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Symptom+exacerbations+in+a+mixed+outpatient+neuropsychiatric+population+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences; 33(3):246, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences; 33(3):246, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21004,""

"A case of post-COVID neuropsychiatric disorder manifesting as cotard's syndrome","Background: Cotard's syndrome is characterized by the bizarre delusion that one is dead, decaying, or nonexistent. Underlying neurological disease including neurodegenerative conditions, as well as acute medical precipitants are often implicated in its pathogenesis, even in individuals with preexisting psychiatric disorders. While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported as an acute medical precipitant of psychosis, an associated case of Cotard's syndrome has yet to be reported. Given its often multifactorial nature, the occurrence of Cotard's syndrome in COVID-19 offers an opportunity to examine a spectrum of neuropsychiatric morbidity associated with the infection and its treatments. Case History: A 57-year-old woman with bipolar I disorder stable for the preceding two years was hospitalized for severe respiratory COVID infection, treated with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and oxygen, recovered, and then subsequently developed Cotard's syndrome associated with depressed mood and catatonic features. Her course was complicated by the development of seizure activity and encephalopathy with diffuse EEG slowing. Her paranoid and nihilistic delusions were florid and protracted, lasting over a month. MRI Brain showed dense T2 hyperintensities in the bilateral subcortical and deep white matter, likely vascular in etiology. She recovered after antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant mood stabilizer treatment. Conclusion: This case describes the development of Cotard's syndrome in a post-COVID patient. The patient experienced a range of neuropsychiatric disturbances suggesting evolving underlying CNS dysfunction in the post-COVID state. Consistent with prior analyses of Cotard's syndrome, pre-existing neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative morbidity and acute medical precipitants ultimately interacted in generating the patient's presentation.","Fusunyan, M.; Cromwell, J.; Buch, K.; Chemali, Z.; Kritzer, M.

"Tinjauan sistematis: gambaran kesehatan mental perawat yang menangani pasien COVID-19","Nurses hold pivotal role during COVID-19 pandemic through providing care toward the infected patients. Various pressures experienced by the nurses while working with COVID-19 patients affected their mental health states. This systematic review attempted to describe the mental health state of nurses who specifically work with COVID-19 patients.

"Online affirmation and peer support are effective for reducing medical personnel stress in dealing with COVID-19 patients","The COVID-19 outbreak has psychological impacts on frontline medical personnel at risk of infection. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of online affirmations and peer support on medical personnel stress level in dealing with COVID-19 patients as well as social support and spiritual intelligences influence. It was a quasi-experiment with pre- and post-test administered to 25 and 30 medical personnel as the intervention and control groups respectively. The intervention was carried out on WhatsApp group for 4 weeks. The stress level pair t-test results showed p = 0.000 in the intervention group and p = 0.238 in the control while the independent t-test results showed p = 0.009. Social support did not affect medical personnelâ€™s stress (p=0.978) but the effect of spiritual intelligence was significant (p=0.000). According to the results of multiple regression test conducted using the enter method the coefficient value (r2) = 0.584. This intervention was effective in helping medical personnel to manage stress. Hence hospital managers need to carry out stress management training to maintain medical personnelâ€™s mental health.","Saleha Nurmukaromatis; Delfina Rina; Nurlaili Nurlaili; Ardiansyah Fourni; Nafratilova Mercy","https://doi.org/10.15294/ujph.v10i2.42861","","Database: Indonesian Research; Publication details: Unnes Journal of Public Health; 10(2):151-161, 2021.; Publication details: Unnes Journal of Public Health; 10(2):151-161, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21014,""

"Nutrition for elderly individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic","As Japan has been facing an increasingly aged society ahead of the rest of the world much interest has been focused on interventions for treating frailty and sarcopenia to extend healthy life expectancy in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a crisis in healthcare systems all over the world. It has had a huge impact on not only public health but also the global economy. Due to the lack of effective vaccination and pharmacological antiviral intervention pandemic control is dependent on public health measures. These measures have basically aimed to decrease social activities and face-to-face communication including the restriction of public gatherings and compulsory stay-at-home policies [1]. Even though these strategies are effective in controlling the pandemic social and economic influences have obviously affected vulnerable groups of people including elderly individuals. Therefore, it is important to enhance the effectiveness of pandemic control measures while minimizing secondary negative consequences. This article aimed to describe the importance of maintaining good nutritional and mental health for elderly individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic with a particular focus on frailty management.","Nakayama Naomi","https://doi.org/10.25220/WNJ.V04.i1.0001","","Database: Indonesian Research; Publication details: World Nutrition Journal; 4(1):i-iv, 2020.; Publication details: World Nutrition Journal; 4(1):i-iv, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21016,""

Mental disorders also occurred among students. Apart from the COVID-19 disease students also faced new learning situations where most of them used online methods. This study aimed to determine the studentâ€™s anxiety levels and health protocol behavior and to analyze the relationship between these two variables. This study used a quantitative analysis with a cross-sectional study design involving 2014 students in java. The results showed that 529% of students had a high anxiety level and most of them (528%) showed low health protocol behavior. There was a significant relationship between anxiety levels and health protocol behavior (p=00001;or=155;95% ci=130-185) meaning that respondents with a low anxiety level tended to have 155 times higher risk performing poor health protocol behavior than those with a high anxiety level.","Laksmini Puji; Yunianto Andi Eka; Muharry Andy","https://journal.stikeshb.ac.id/index.php/jurkessia/article/view/339","","Database: Indonesian Research; Publication details: Jurnal Kesehatan Indonesia; 11(3):148-152, 2021.; Publication details: Jurnal Kesehatan Indonesia; 11(3):148-152, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21017,""

"The paradox of trust: perceived risk and public compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore","Public trust in the authorities has been recognised in risk research as a crucial component of effective and efficient risk management. But in a pandemic, where the primary responsibility of risk management is not centralised within institutional actors but defused across society, trust can become a double-edged sword. Under these conditions, public trust based on a perception of government competence, care and openness may in fact lead people to underestimate risks and thus reduce their belief in the need to take individual action to control the risks. In this paper, we examine the interaction between trust in government, risk perceptions and public compliance in Singapore in the period between January and April 2020. Using social media tracking and online focus group discussions, we present a preliminary assessment of public responses to government risk communication and risk management measures. We highlight the unique deployment of risk communication in Singapore based on the narrative of â€˜defensive pessimismâ€™ to heighten rather than lower levels perceived risk. But the persistence of low public risk perceptions and concomitant low levels of compliance with government risk management measures bring to light the paradox of trust. This calls for further reflection on another dimension of trust which focuses on the role of the public; and further investigation into other social and cultural factors that may have stronger influence over individual belief in the need to take personal actions to control the risks.","Wong, Catherine Mei Ling; Jensen, Olivia","https://doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2020.1756386","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: J.

"Combination Therapy with Fluoxetine and the Nucleoside Analog GS-441524 Exerts Synergistic Antiviral Effects against Different SARS-CoV-2 Variants In Vitro","The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires efficient and safe antiviral treatment strategies. Drug repurposing represents a fast and low-cost approach to the development of new medical treatment options. The direct antiviral agent remdesivir has been reported to exert antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Whereas remdesivir only has a very short half-life time and a bioactivation, which relies on pro-drug activating enzymes, its plasma metabolite GS-441524 can be activated through various kinases including the adenosine kinase (ADK) that is moderately expressed in all tissues. The pharmacokinetics of GS-441524 argue for a suitable antiviral drug that can be given to patients with COVID-19. Here, we analyzed the antiviral property of a combined treatment with the remdesivir metabolite GS-441524 and the antidepressant fluoxetine in a polarized Calu-3 cell culture model against SARS-CoV-2. The combined treatment with GS-441524 and fluoxetine were well-tolerated and displayed synergistic antiviral effects against three circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro in the commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Thus, combinatory treatment with the virus-targeting GS-441524 and the host-directed drug fluoxetine might offer a suitable therapeutic treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Brunotte, Linda; Zheng, Shuyu; Mecate-Zambrano, Angeles; Tang, Jing; Ludwig, Stephan; Rescher, Ursula; Schloer, Sebastian","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13091400","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pharmaceutics;13(9)2021 Sep 03.; Publication details: Pharmaceutics;13(9)2021 Sep 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21025,""
"Physical and Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic among US Adults with Chronic Respiratory Conditions","Adults living with chronic respiratory diseases are at higher risk of death due to COVID-19. Our objective was to evaluate the physical and mental health symptoms among US adults living with chronic respiratory conditions. We used data of 10,760 US adults from the nationally representative COVID-19 Impact Survey. Chronic respiratory conditions were self-reported and included asthma (14.7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD (4.7%), and bronchitis/emphysema (11.6%). We used multivariable Poisson regression to evaluate physical health symptoms. We estimated associations of mental health symptoms using multinomial logistic regression. In multivariable models, adults with asthma were more likely to report physical symptoms including runny or stuffy nose, chest congestion, fever, and chills. In addition, adults with COPD were more likely to report several physical symptoms including fever (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]: 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.72), chills (aPR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.67-2.64), runny or stuffy nose (aPR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.39-2.27), chest congestion (aPR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.74-2.61), sneezing (aPR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.23-2.05), and muscle or body aches (aPR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.06-1.81). Adults with chronic respiratory conditions are more likely to report physical and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to others.

"Occupational Disruptions during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Their Association with Healthcare Workers' Mental Health","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 crisis has caused prolonged and extreme demands on healthcare services. This study investigates the types and prevalence of occupational disruptions, and associated symptoms of mental illness, among Australian frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A national cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 27 August and 23 October 2020. Frontline healthcare workers were invited to participate via dissemination from major health organisations, professional associations or colleges, universities, government contacts, and national media. Data were collected on demographics, home and work situations, and validated scales of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and burnout. RESULTS: Complete responses were received from 7846 healthcare workers (82.4%). Most respondents were female (80.9%) and resided in the Australian state of Victoria (85.2%). Changes to working conditions were common, with 48.5% reporting altered paid or unpaid hours, and many redeployed (16.8%) or changing work roles (27.3%). Nearly a third (30.8%) had experienced a reduction in household income during the pandemic. Symptoms of mental illness were common, being present in 62.1% of participants. Many respondents felt well supported by their workplaces (68.3%) and believed that workplace communication was timely and useful (74.4%). Participants who felt well supported by their organisation had approximately half the risk of experiencing moderate to severe anxiety, depression, burnout, and PTSD. Half (50.4%) of respondents indicated a need for additional training in using personal protective equipment and/or caring for patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic occurred commonly in health organisations and were associated with worse mental health outcomes in the Australian health workforce. Feeling well supported was associated with significantly fewer adverse mental health outcomes. Crisis preparedness focusing on the provision of timely and useful communication and support is essential in current and future crises.","Smallwood, Natasha; Pascoe, Amy; Karimi, Leila; Bismark, Marie; Willis, Karen","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179263","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 09 02.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 09 02.; COVID-19; Pandemics; Anxiety; Australia/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21027,""
"Racial and Gender Discrimination Predict Mental Health Outcomes among Healthcare Workers Beyond Pandemic-Related Stressors: Findings from a Cross-Sectional Survey","Racial and gender discrimination are risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes in the general population; however, the effects of discrimination on the mental health of healthcare workers needs to be further explored, especially in relation to competing stressors. Thus, we administered a survey to healthcare workers to investigate the associations between perceived racial and gender discrimination and symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and burnout during a period of substantial stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a national racial reckoning. We used multivariable linear regression models, which controlled for demographics and pandemic-related stressors. Of the 997 participants (Mean Age = 38.22 years, SD = 11.77), 688 (69.01%) were White, 148 (14.84%) Asian, 86 (8.63%) Black, 73 (7.32%) Latinx, and 21 (2.11%) identified as another race. In multivariable models, racial discrimination predicted symptoms of depression (B = 0.04; SE: 0.02; p = .009), anxiety (B = 0.05; SE: 0.02; p = .004), and posttraumatic stress (B = 0.01; SE: 0.01; p = .006) and gender discrimination predicted posttraumatic stress (B = 0.11; SE: 0.05; p = .013) and burnout (B = 0.24; SE: 0.07; p = .001). Discrimination had indirect effects on mental health outcomes via inadequate social support. Hospital-wide diversity and inclusion initiatives are warranted to mitigate the adverse mental health effects of discrimination.","Hennein, Rachel; Bonumwezi, Jessica; Nguemeni Tiako, Max Jordan; Tineo, Petty; Lowe, Sarah R","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179235","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 09 01.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 09 01.; COVID-19; Pandemics; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; European Continental Ancestry Group; Health Personnel; Humans; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; SARS-CoV-2; Sexism; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21028,""
"Health and Protective Measures for Seniors during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Opinion of Polish Society","The aim of the study was to determine the opinion of society on the individual care and protection measures towards seniors during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the relationship of opinions with demographic data, knowledge about aging and own experience in contacts with the elderly was examined. The study involved 923 attendees from Poland. The tools used to assess the research problem were: demographic characteristics, a Facts on Aging Quiz (FAQ), the author's questionnaire about preventive and protective measures for seniors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed that over 50% of participants were against designating shopping hours for seniors. The analysis showed that negative attitudes were more often expressed by women than by men; younger people and those declaring that they do not spend too much time with the elderly. In the matter of vaccination priority for the elderly, over 70% participants replied ""rather yes"" or ""definitely yes"". The use of the age criterion in situations of limited access to medications and ventilators was supported mainly by learners, with high results of the FAQ, and professionals dealing with seniors. Finally, almost 56% of participants declared that their contacts with seniors were the same as before the pandemic, while merely 1.6% indicated that they avoid contact with them entirely.","Podhorecka, Marta; Pyszora, Anna; Wozniewicz, Agnieszka; Husejko, Jakub; Kedziora-Kornatowska, Kornelia","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179230","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 09 01.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 09 01.; COVID-19; Pandemics; Aged; Attitude; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics/prevention & control; Poland/epidemiology; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21029,""
"Associations between Physical Activity, Sitting Time, and Time Spent Outdoors with Mental Health during the First COVID-19 Lock Down in Austria","Measures implemented to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have resulted in a decrease in physical activity (PA) while sedentary behaviour increased. The aim of the present study was to explore associations between PA and mental health in Austria during COVID-19 social restrictions. In this web-based cross-sectional study (April-May 2020) moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sitting time, and time spent outdoors were self-reported before and during self-isolation. Mental well-being was assessed with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, and the Beck depression and anxiety inventories. The majority of the participants (n = 652) were female (72.4%), with a mean age of 36.0 years and a standard deviation (SD) of 14.4. Moreover, 76.5% took part in &#8805;30 min/day of MVPA, 53.5% sat &#8805;10 h/day, and 66.1% spent &#8805;60 min/day outdoors during self-isolation. Thirty-eight point five percent reported high mental well-being, 40.5% reported depressive symptoms, and 33.9% anxiety symptoms. Participating in higher levels of MVPA was associated with higher mental well-being (odds ratio = OR: 3.92; 95% confidence interval = 95%CI: 1.51-10.15), less depressive symptoms (OR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.29-0.66) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 0.62; 95%CI: 0.41-0.94), and less loneliness (OR: 0.46; 95%CI: 0.31-0.69). Participants sitting <10 h/day had higher odds of mental well-being (OR: 3.58; 95%CI: 1.13-11.35). Comparable results were found for spending &#8805;60 min/day outdoors. Maintaining one's MVPA levels was associated with higher mental well-being (OR = 8.61, 95%CI: 2.68-27.62). In conclusion, results show a positive association between PA, time spent outdoors and mental well-being during COVID-19 social restrictions. Interventions aiming to increase PA might mitigate negative effects of such restrictions.","Haider, Sandra; Smith, Lee; Markovic, Lovro; Schuch, Felipe B; Sadarangani, Kabir P; Lopez Sanchez, Guillermo Felipe; Lopez-Bueno, RubÃ©n; Gil-SalmerÃ³n, Alejandro; Rieder, Anita; Tully, Mark A; Tschiderer, Lena; Seekircher, Lisa; Willeit, Peter; Grabovac, Igor","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179168","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 08 31.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 08 31.; COVID-19; Sitting Position; Adult; Austria; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21030,""
"Sleep as a Priority: 24-Hour Movement Guidelines and Mental Health of Chinese College Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Research on the combined role of 24-hour movement behaviors (sleep, sedentary behavior [SB], and physical activity) in adult mental health, though important, is in its infancy. In the context of Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines integrating quantitative recommendations for sleep, SB, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), this study aimed to examine the associations between meeting guidelines and mental health among college students. The study used a cross-sectional sample of 1846 Chinese college students surveyed online in August 2020. Through network analysis and multivariate analysis of covariance, the individual and combined associations between meeting 24-hour movement guidelines and the levels of depression and anxiety after adjusting sociodemographic factors were analyzed. Results indicated that meeting the sleep guideline had stronger associations with depression and anxiety than meeting the SB or MVPA guideline. Specifically, compared to meeting no guidelines, meeting the sleep guideline (alone or in combination with other guidelines) was associated with significantly lower levels of depression and anxiety; meeting both SB and MVPA guidelines was also associated with a significantly lower level of depression. Hence, meeting more guidelines, especially adhering to a healthy sleep routine, may play an important role in promoting the mental health of young adults.","Liang, Kaixin; de Lucena Martins, Clarice Maria; Chen, Si-Tong; Clark, Cain Craig Truman; Duncan, Michael Joseph; Bu, He; Huang, Liuyue; Chi, Xinli","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091166","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Healthcare (Basel);9(9)2021 Sep 06.; Publication details: Healthcare (Basel);9(9)2021 Sep 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21031,""
"The Impact of Economic Recessions on Depression, Anxiety, and Trauma-Related Disorders and Illness Outcomes-A Scoping Review","In the wake of a global economic recession secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic, this scoping review seeks to summarize the current quantitative research on the impact of economic recessions on depression, anxiety, traumatic disorders, self-harm, and suicide. Seven research databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science: Core Collection, National Library of Medicine PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar) were searched for keywords returning 3412 preliminary results published since 2008 in Organisation for Economic Coordination and Development (OECD)nations. These were screened by both authors for inclusion/exclusion criteria resulting in 127 included articles. Articles included were quantitative studies in OECD countries assessing select mental disorders (depression, anxiety, and trauma-/stress-related disorders) and illness outcomes (self-harm and suicide) during periods of economic recession. Articles were limited to publication from 2008 to 2020, available online in English, and utilizing outcome measures specific to the disorders and outcomes specified above. A significant relationship was found between periods of economic recession and increased depressive symptoms, self-harming behaviour, and suicide during and following periods of recession. Results suggest that existing models for mental health support and strategies for suicide prevention may be less effective than they are in non-recession times. It may be prudent to focus public education and medical treatments on raising awareness and access to supports for populations at higher risk, including those vulnerable to the impacts of job or income loss due to low socioeconomic status preceding the recession or high levels of financial strain, those supporting others financially, approaching retirement, and those in countries with limited social safety nets. Policy makers should be aware of the potential protective nature of unemployment safeguards and labour program investment in mitigating these negative impacts. Limited or inconclusive data were found on the relationship with traumatic disorders and symptoms of anxiety. In addition, research has focused primarily on the working-age adult population with limited data available on children, adolescents, and older adults, leaving room for further research in these areas.","Guerra, Olivia; Eboreime, Ejemai","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bs11090119","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Behav Sci (Basel);11(9)2021 Aug 31.; Publication details: Behav Sci (Basel);11(9)2021 Aug 31.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21032,""
"Depressive Symptoms among Individuals Hospitalized with COVID-19: Three-Month Follow-Up","Individuals affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may experience psychiatric symptoms, including depression and suicidal ideation, that could lead to chronic impairment and a reduction in quality of life. Specifically, depressive disorder shows high incidence and may lead to chronic impairment and a reduction in the quality of life. To date, no studies on the presence of suicidality and quantitative analysis of depressive symptoms and their risk factors have yet been published. In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms and related risk factors at 3 months after discharge to home care following hospitalization for COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Participants were contacted three months after hospital discharge from one of the five COVID-19 hospitals in Rome, as part of a larger project on health outcomes in COVID-19 inpatients (Long Term Neuropsychiatric Disorder in COVID-19 Project), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was administered by telephone interview. RESULTS: Of 115 participants, 14.8% (N = 17) received a PHQ-9-based diagnosis of depression, and n = 7 of them scored 1 or more on the item on suicidality. A linear regression model showed the predictive role of female sex, pulmonary chronic condition and previous mental disorder in the development of depressive disorder; the latter was confirmed also by binary logistic regression. Severity indexes of disease (length of hospitalization and intensive care treatment) were found not to be associated with the development of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: A small but clinically meaningful number of participants in the current study reported that they experienced symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation 3 months post-discharge from their COVID-19 hospitalization. In particular, given the findings that a history of prior psychiatric disorders was predictive of the development of depression symptoms, clinicians should carefully monitor for the presence of all psychiatric symptoms at follow-up visits.","Vassalini, Paolo; Serra, Riccardo; Tarsitani, Lorenzo; Koukopoulos, Alexia E; Borrazzo, Cristian; Alessi, Federica; Di Nicolantonio, Chiara; Tosato, Cecilia; Alessandri, Francesco; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; d'Ettorre, Gabriella","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091175","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Brain Sci;11(9)2021 Sep 05.; Publication details: Brain Sci;11(9)2021 Sep 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21033,""
"Prevalence of Anxiety, Depression, and Stress among Teachers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis","BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers have been accumulating adverse psychological symptoms due to the closure of educational centers and the need to adapt to different teaching modalities. METHODS: Medline and PubMed were searched for studies on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and burn-out in teachers, published from 1 December 2019 to 15 June 2021. RESULTS: In total, eight studies were included in this study. The results show that teachers report levels of anxiety (17%), depression (19%), and stress (30%). In Asia, there has been more anxiety compared to other continents. Overall, anxiety has been higher among teachers in schools compared to universities. However, stress levels have been higher among teachers in universities compared to schools. Statistically, there were no significant differences regarding gender and age in any of the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that teachers at different educational levels are experiencing adverse psychological symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that anxiety levels vary between different countries. However, more international studies are needed to fully understand the impact of the pandemic on teachers' mental health.","Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Idoiaga Mondragon, Nahia; Bueno-Notivol, Juan; PÃ©rez-Moreno, MarÃ­a; SantabÃ¡rbara, Javier","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091172","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Brain Sci;11(9)2021 Sep 03.; Publication details: Brain Sci;11(9)2021 Sep 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21034,""
"Prevention of Depression in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults: The Role of Teachers and Parents","Major depressive disorder (MDD) and other affective disorders may surreptitiously arise in children and adolescents during their school period and impair their social and educational functioning. Besides the social and personal burden, which are increased during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the onset of depression may compromise the future of the growing person with chronicity and recurrence. In this context, educatorsâ€™ training is essential to detect early the onset of a depressive disorder, to spare later consequences through the timely establishment of adequate treatment. The educational staff should receive adequate training to be able to work closely with healthcare providers and parents, thus directing the young person with an affective disorder to the right psychological and pharmacological treatment provider, i.e., a specialized psychologist or psychiatrist. The first approach should be to establish a trustful relationship with the adolescent and his/her classmates, to reduce social and self-stigma and inform about mental illness. If symptoms do not subside and the suffering child or adolescent fails to reintegrate within his/her school environment, cognitiveâ€“behavioral interventions are recommended that are individual, group, or computer-based. When needed, these should be implemented with individualized pharmacotherapy.","Del Casale, Antonio, Zocchi, Clarissa, Kotzalidis, Georgios D.; FiaschÃ¨, Federica, Girardi, Paolo","https://doi.org/10.3390/psychiatryint2030027","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Psychiatry International; 2(3):353-364, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry International; 2(3):353-364, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21035,""
"School-Based Restorative Justice: Lessons and Opportunities in a Post-Pandemic World","The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected schools and the people within them. The move to remote schooling forced practitioners of school-based restorative justice to adapt and innovate, as theory and practice had almost exclusively focused on in-person instruction. In this paper, I first review some of the challenges, adaptations, and lessons during the pandemic. I then argue that restorative justice in schools offers new and unique potential to address needs of educational communities and the students, educators, and staff within them as in-person instruction returns. Specifically, I suggest it could contribute to rebuilding social connection and community, bolstering mental health, and addressing inequities. Finally, I end with limitations and future directions for considering these extensions and evaluating their impact. School-based restorative justice alone cannot be a panacea for these issues, but could be integrated into other supports and services to address the stark needs of school communities and of the young people whose lives have been so deeply impacted by COVID-19.","Velez, Gabriel M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/laws10030071","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Laws; 10(3):71, 2021.; Publication details: Laws; 10(3):71, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21036,""

"COVID, Its Impact on the Mental Health of Caregivers in Childcare Institutions of South Asian Countries and Their Coping Techniques: Analysis of the Caregivers in Childcare Institutions Using Data from Seven South Asian Countries","Widely across the globe, COVID has placed massive strain on various parameters of life, including child protection, health, education and economic systems. Apart from these visible threats, this situation has an ongoing devastating impact on the mental health and psychological well-being of people. The word of the law enforces care and support for children with disadvantages, disabilities and vulnerabilities on caregivers, Managers and Staff, managing Alternative Care programmes, but the spirit of such child protection laws also underlines the importance of caring for caregivers, especially in childcare institutions (CCIs). The well-being of the caregivers is the cornerstone of every well-functioning childcare institution and other residential care spaces. This article is designed to document the mental health status of caregivers (residential staff staying with children), in residential care spaces in the COVID times and to determine how the new stresses impacted them and the coping patterns they acquired in current situation;across different countries of South Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.This exploratory rapid assessment project aimed to reach out to the registered childcare homes/ institutions, across the South Asian region, with the help of different NGOs, as well as Government mechanisms. The data was collected through purposive sampling and analysed quantitatively where the sample included the selected caregivers of participating CCIs across these nations. This study aimed to synthesize the responses of caregivers across the region;develop an analysis, which may help authorities to rethink, reform and strengthen the current practices, in order to develop approach-centred strategies for improving the well-being of caregivers as this has a direct bearing on the well-being of children in their care. Since the start of the COVID pandemic, for the residential caregivers, the access to external resources, including physical support from professional staff, has become restricted to bare minimum, due to lockdown and quarantine measures. Any interventions to prevent, treat and mitigate the effects of COVID among caregivers needed to be taken at the ground level by the care team management.","Modi, Kiran, Kalra, Gurneet, Prasad, Leena, Babrakzai, Najeebullah","https://doi.org/10.1177/23493003211033062","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Institutionalised Children Explorations and Beyond; 8(2):223-248, 2021.; Publication details: Institutionalised Children Explorations and Beyond; 8(2):223-248, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21038,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on early childhood reading practices","COVID-19 has changed the daily lives of families, impacted on work, social interactions, and mental health. Since spring 2020, parents have been working from home and children have been home from daycare and school. Parents are experiencing stress in an attempt to satisfy the demands of work, family, and COVID-19 concerns. Due to the fact that children have been home from daycare and school, parents have the sole responsibility of caring for and teaching their children until schools are able to fully and effectively meet the needs of educating students in an adapted format. Research provides a wealth of information documenting the advantages of parents reading to their children. Children benefit from read-alouds with parental interaction, and these benefits include an increase in oral language skills, reading comprehension, vocabulary, and an increase in motivation to read. The purpose of this study is to answer two questions: (1) Since parents were home more often with their children, were parents spending more quality time reading to their two-to four-year-old children? This can be defined as reading developmentally appropriate books to their children with their undivided attention;and (2) Since parents were home more often with their two-to four-year-old children, were parents reading more to their young children? Parents of pre-kindergarten students were surveyed to determine the answers to these questions.","Wheeler, Deborah L.; Hill, Jennifer C.","https://doi.org/10.1177/14687984211044187","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Journal of Early Childhood Literacy;: 14687984211044187, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Early Childhood Literacy;: 14687984211044187, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21039,""

"La economÃ­a mundial y sus vericuetos (incluido el coronavirus)","Abstract After the global crisis of 2008-2009, the international economy was unable to fully recover and there are indications that it is already in another depressive cycle. Based on this, the main inconveniences of worldwide economic integration are examined. In this article, cumulative trade imbalances are observed, which are already transmitting nonconformities or unsustainability to the political sphere. In the same way, financial imbalances are pointed out, whether in the least aid to developing countries, in the dangerous accumulation of corporate debts that are added to those of governments, or in the persistence of abnormal interest rates and in the instability in the valuations of stock exchanges and long-term government securities. The reduction of the rates of capital formation and the dynamic rearrangement of the industry are intermingled with other positive and negative factors of the process of integration and development of global markets. They also address the economic and social incidence of the coronavirus pandemic, and the substantive changes in US policy in its response to the anticipated downturn in the international economy and the effects of the aforementioned pandemic.","Ibarra, David","https://doi.org/10.22201/fe.24488143e.2020.50.517","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: EconomÃ­a UNAM; 17(50):3-26, 2020.; Publication details: EconomÃ­a UNAM; 17(50):3-26, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21041,""

"The Prevalence of Occupational Burnout Among Ophthalmologists: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of occupational burnout among ophthalmologists in order to better understand the mental and physical well-being of eye physicians and surgeons in the professional workplace. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Online computer databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were searched systematically and thoroughly. Conferences held through Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and Canadian Society of Ophthalmology were searched. Studies were screened using Covidence software. Data on reported burnout prevalence was extracted. STATA 15.0 was used to conduct meta-analysis.Synthesis: Our search strategy identified 318 records from online databases and 11 records from grey literature search, which were screened at 2-levels. Title and abstracts of each record were screened resulting in 24 records moving to full-text screening. Total of 9 records were utilized for quantitative analysis in the data extraction stage. Our results indicated significant professional burnout among ophthalmologists (ES = 0.41; CI: [0.26, 0.56]) with significant emotional exhaustion (ES = 0.43; CI: [0.33, 0.53]), depersonalization (ES = 0.29; CI: [0.13, 0.46]), and a low sense of personal accomplishment (ES = 0.36; CI: [0.08, 0.63]). CONCLUSIONS: Significant occupational burnout among ophthalmologists is concerning because burnout can have a negative effect on the physical and mental health of eye physicians and surgeons. It could impact productivity, cutbacks in work hours, or lead to early retirement from the profession. Contributing factors in ophthalmologist burnout including work overload need to be addressed in a timely manner.","Cheung, Ronald; Yu, Brian; Iordanous, Yiannis; Malvankar-Mehta, Monali S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0033294120954135","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Rep;124(5): 2139-2154, 2021 Oct.; Publication details: Psychol Rep;124(5): 2139-2154, 2021 Oct.; Burnout, Professional; Ophthalmologists; Burnout, Professional/epidemiology; Burnout, Psychological; Canada; Humans; Prevalence; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21043,""
"The psychobiological links between chronic stress-related diseases, periodontal/peri-implant diseases, and wound healing","Chronic stress is a relevant disease to periodontal practice, encompassing 25%-28% of the US population (American Psychological Association 2015). While it is well established that chronic psychologic stress can have significant deleterious systemic effects, only in recent decades have we begun to explore the biochemical, microbial, and physiologic impacts of chronic stress diseases on oral tissues. Currently, chronic stress is classified as a ""risk indicator"" for periodontal disease. However, as the evidence in this field matures with additional clinically controlled trials, more homogeneous data collection methods, and a better grasp of the biologic underpinnings of stress-mediated dysbiosis, emerging evidence suggests that chronic stress and related diseases (depression, anxiety) may be significant contributing factors in periodontal/peri-implant disease progression and inconsistent wound healing following periodontal-related therapeutics. Ideal solutions for these patients include classification of the disease process and de-escalation of chronic stress conditions through coping strategies. This paper also summarizes periodontal/implant-related therapeutic approaches to ensure predictable results for this specific patient subpopulation.","Decker, Ann M; Kapila, Yvonne L; Wang, Hom-Lay","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/prd.12381","","Country: DK; DINAMARCA; DENMARK; DINAMARCA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Periodontol 2000;87(1): 94-106, 2021 10.; Publication details: Periodontol 2000;87(1): 94-106, 2021 10.; Dental Implants; Peri-Implantitis; Periodontal Diseases; Dysbiosis; Humans; Periodontal Diseases/therapy; Wound Healing; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21044,""
"Mental Health in Persons With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: The Need for Increased Access to Health Care Services","Mental health problems in the general population have been reported during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; however, there were rare data in persons with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Therefore, we performed a cross-sectional study on mental health evaluated using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; depression), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7; anxiety), and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R; distress), including subscales of avoidance, intrusion, and hyper-arousal in persons with CML, non-cancer persons, and immediate family members of persons with cancer as controls (&#8805;16 years) by an online survey. Data from 3,197 persons with CML and 7,256 controls were collected. In multivariate analyses, CML was significantly associated with moderate to severe depression (OR = 1.6; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.4, 1.9; p < 0.001), anxiety (OR = 1.4 [1.1, 1.7]; p = 0.001), distress (OR = 1.3 [1.1, 1.5]; p < 0.001), and hyper-arousal (OR = 1.5 [1.3, 1.6]; p < 0.001). Moreover, delay in regular monitoring was significantly associated with depression (OR 1.3 [1.0, 1.7]; p = 0.024), anxiety (OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.8]; p = 0.044), avoidance (OR = 1.2 [1.0, 1.4]; p = 0.017), and intrusion (OR = 1.2 [1.0, 1.4]; p = 0.057); tyrosine kinase-inhibitor dose reduction or discontinuation, depression (OR = 1.9 [1.3, 2.8]; p = 0.001), distress (OR = 2.0 [1.4, 2.8]; p < 0.001), avoidance (OR = 1.6 [1.2, 2.1]; p = 0.004), intrusion (OR = 1.6 [1.1, 2.1]; p = 0.006), and hyper-arousal (OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.8]; p = 0.088).

"Effect of Psychological Stress during the COVID-19 on Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Saudi Arabia","This study aims to assess the impact of psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with irritable bowel syndrome in the Saudi Arabia. We used an online questionnaire survey shared on social media to collect data. The cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia from 1 June 2020 to 31 August 2020. Inclusion criteria were Saudi citizens aged 18 years and above. The exclusion criteria were Saudi citizens under 18 years. The data were analyzed using the SPSS program. The study included 413 participants;53.3% of participants were affected by IBS. Severe levels of stress, anxiety, and depression were reported in 10.4%, 11.1%, and 8.4% of participants, respectively. There was a significant association between stress level and IBS symptoms based on Rome IV criteria, including frequent abdominal pain (P &lt;0.000) more than 3 bowel movements per day (P &lt;0.025), and less than 3 bowel movements per week (P &lt;0.001). Anxiety level showed a significant association (P &lt;0.000) between the last IBS symptoms, in addition to abnormal stool appearance. A significant association was also reported between depression level and frequent abdominal pain and abdominal bloating (P &lt;0.000). The relationship between IBS medications and other factors that influence IBS symptom development was also considered. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychological state of many individuals, which has led to the triggering of symptoms in IBS patients. Attending to healthy habits and lifestyle, in addition to emotional and psychological support, may decrease the occurrence of IBS symptoms.","Tarbiah, N. I.; Alkhattabi, N. A.; Aldamen, S.

"The Evolution of Mental Health in Patients with Psoriasis during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health on a sample of 37 patients with psoriasis in Braila County. Methods: A cross-sectional study on a sample of 37 patients with psoriasis was conducted by questionnaires e-mailed to patients. The study was conducted between November 20th, 2020 - January 15th, 2021. Mental health was measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Assessment Scale (HAS). Data collected on predictors included, but were not limited to, sex, age, background, marital status, level of education, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, period of self-isolation, severity of psoriasis, and type of treatment for psoriasis. Results: There were 37 participants included. Factors associated with poor mental health were: place of origin (54% from urban areas), sex (62.1% women), age (67.5% between 65 and 80 years old), period of self-isolation (81% in self-isolation for more than 14 days), comorbidities (75.6% with multiple comorbidities) and form of treatment for psoriasis (48.6% are systemically administered treatment for psoriasis). Conclusions: In this sample of patients with psoriasis from Braila County who isolate or socially distance themselves, urban patients, women, elderly, those with comorbidities and those who are systemically administered treatment for psoriasis were associated with a high score on the Hamilton anxiety assessment scale. However, we have to admit that our research has some limitations. First, the number of participants included in the study was small. Secondly, we used an online way to conduct the study. Thirdly, we used a self-assessment scale to assess the anxiety symptoms of psoriasis patients, which might have some deviation from the outcome. Looking beyond the current situation, it is essential to evaluate and restructure the way we think about patient's care.","Oltenacu, R. C.; Ciubara, A. B.; Nechifor, A.; Burlea, S.

"Looking into Pandora's Box between ""Everything"" and ""But"" -Depression, Pain of Losses the Next Pandemic of Humanity?","This Article seeks to give an overview of how the pandemic has affected society throughout this period, which can be a source of many mental health problems. As in the Spanish influenza pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic and the imposition of measures of social separation, isolation and limitation of contact with other people were, and are still, a major stress factor. The stress associated with this period disrupted the functioning of people both individually and socially, being the main factor of the phenomenon called compensation.Under the current circumstances, people have a predisposition for emotional disorders such as: Anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, anger, Emotional depletion and including post-traumatic symptoms of disorder, according to recent studies by the Lancet analyzing the psychological effects of quarantine.The COVID-19 crisis has a wide range of effects on our mental and emotional health: From negative emotions with greater intensity and duration, such as anxiety and depression, to unfinished emotional mourning, linked both to the loss of loved ones and even to emotional and relational disconnection. Also, all that has happened in recent times makes us live in ""collective pain"" , we have lost our right to travel without restrictions or the freedom to participate in sad events or family and community joy, we have lost family or friends.In many cases of these losses, the strands of the dollar are also being cut, which is why people need additional support. We need to find solutions to this, because we have to deal with the natural grief caused by human disappearance, as we know it, but also an isolation characteristic of the suffering process that now overlaps the physical isolation imposed by the epidemic.Another important aspect is to prevent instability in the psycho-social element of the human Community. It is clear that there is a need to impose safety measures both jointly and individually. Psychological aspects should be addressed early, so that measures can be taken to reduce the psychological costs of pandemic, perceived isolation and to address uncertainties that can give rise to anxiety and depression. Addressing psychological issues has effects not only in the short term, motivating adherence to pandemic measures, but also in the long term, through lower incidence of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, etc. The fastest change expected after this crisis will be the individual one, each crisis is a chance for every person to look further.","Grigoras, M.; Ciubara, A.","https://doi.org/10.18662/brain/12.2/210","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Brain-Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience; 12(2):326-334, 2021.; Publication details: Brain-Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience; 12(2):326-334, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21048,""
"Emotional Exhaustion and Professional Satisfaction During Covid-19 Pandemic at the Level of Emergency Department Staff","Introduction: Burnout is a syndrome conceptualized as result of the chronic stress at the work place which wars not successfully managed. The possible negative effects on the medical staff the patients and the health institutions have generated interest and motivated the research to understand the possible causes, these ejects also influence the burnout predictors. The medical services suppliers within the emergency department have had one of the greatest exhaution occurences even before the pandemic. Being in the first line in contact with the suspected patients or confirmed with COVID-19 infection intensifies this fact. Both the working . factors (working hours, years of practice, number of treated patients, professional development activities) and the socio- demographic factors (age, sex. civil status, income. education) are associated with the exhaustion at the work place. Material and methods: I have studied a total of 120 participants, receiving 115 valid questionnaires, the answering ratio being 95,83%.This was a descriptive, multicentre, transversal study of the medical and the auxiliary staff within the department UPU-SMURD of the County Clinic Emergency Hospital ""Sf.

"Assessment of Depression in Patients with COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic is probably the greatest natural disaster of our generation and the 21st century with a great impact on mental health. The present study aims to quantify, with the help of the Beck questionnaire, the degree of depression in a group of 109 patients with moderate forms of COVID-19, hospitalised in the Second Clinic of the Clinical Hospital for Infectious Diseases St. Cuv. Parascheva Galati during the period: 1.01-30.03.2021. Of these, 35 patients (32.11%) had raging degrees of depression, and had an age and body mass index statistically significantly higher than those without depression. These patients also had statistically significantly higher Charism scores of cumulative comorbidities and required longer hospitalization than patients without depression. The severity of COVID-19 and the parentage of favorable prognosis did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups. Our study reveals a lower incidence of depression among patients with COVID-19 compared to existing studies in the literature. This can be explained the, by act that our study is conducted at the end of the first year of the pandemic when antiviral therapy schemes stabilised and population vaccination began. The high, genetic variability of the tints, which can determine at any time the appearance of new strains with greater aggression, contagion or with mutations on the spike protein, maintains the need to keep non-specific preventive measures and the mental tension related to this pathology. Thus, intrepandemic psychiatric disorders remain a major public health problem and require strong government prevention and control measures.","Baroiu, L.; Dumea, E.; Nastase, F.; Niculet, E.; Fotea, S.; Ciubara, A.

"Effervescent ferrate(VI)-based tablets as an effective means for removal SARS-CoV-2 RNA, pharmaceuticals and resistant bacteria from wastewater","Waterborne pathogens including viruses, bacteria and micropollutants secreted from population can spread through the sewerage system. In this study, the efficiency of unique effervescent ferrate-based tablets was evaluated for total RNA and DNA removal, disinfection and degradation of micropollutants in hospital wastewater. For the purpose of testing, proposed tablets (based on citric acid or sodium dihydrogen phosphate) were used for various types of hospital wastewater with specific biological and chemical contamination. Total RNA destruction efficiency using tablets was 70â€“100% depending on the type of acidic component. DNA destruction efficiency was lower on the level 51â€“94% depending on the type of acidic component. In addition, our study confirms that effervescent ferrate-based tablets are able to efficiently remove of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater. Degradation of often detected micropollutants (antiepileptic, antidepressant, antihistamine, hypertensive and their metabolites) was dependent on the type of detected pharmaceuticals and on the acidic component used. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate based tablet appeared to be more effective than citric acid based tablet and removed some pharmaceuticals with efficiency higher than 97%. Last but not least, the disinfection ability was also verified. Tableted ferrates were confirmed to be an effective disinfectant and no resistant microorganisms were observed after treatment. Total and antibiotic resistant bacteria (coliforms and enterococci) were determined by cultivation on diagnostic selective agar growth media.","Butor Å kulcovÃ¡, Andrea, TamÃ¡Å¡ovÃ¡, KatarÃ­na, Vojs StanovÃ¡, Andrea, BÃ­roÅ¡ovÃ¡, Lucia, KrahulcovÃ¡, Monika, GÃ¡l, Miroslav, KonecnÃ¡, Barbora, JanÃ­kovÃ¡, Monika, Celec, Peter, GrabicovÃ¡, Katerina, Grabic, Roman, Filip, Jan, BeliÅ¡ovÃ¡, Noemi, Ryba, Jozef, KerekeÅ¡, Kamil, Å palkovÃ¡, Viera, HÃ­veÅ¡, JÃ¡n, Mackulak, TomÃ¡Å¡","https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JWPE.2021.102223","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Journal of Water Process Engineering; 43, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Water Process Engineering; 43, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21052,""

Foram solicitados tomografia computadorizada (TC) de cranio e de torax e rotina laboratorial guiada pelo rebaixamento do nivel de consciencia. Exames de imagem evidenciaram ausencia de alteracoes intracranianas agudas e pulmao com infiltrado em vidro fosco, relativo a infeccao viral relatada. No laboratorio, foi visto anemia (Hb 9,76 g/dL), plaquetopenia (20.000/mm3), linfopenia (630/mm3), ferritina (1038 ng/mL) e d-dimero (711 ng/mL) elevados e hiponatremia (121 mEq/L). Evoluiu com recuperacao do nivel de consciencia apos correcao eletrolitica, evidenciando a causa do delirium. Apesar de suspeita clinica e epidemiologica inicial, sorologias para dengue e pesquisa de antigeno NS1 foram negativas. Frente a pancitopenia mantida nos dias seguintes, foi solicitada TC de abdome, cujo laudo nao revelou alteracoes dignas de nota. Apos cinco dias do quadro, prosseguiu com melhora clinica evidente em conduta expectante, sendo optado por alta hospitalar. Apos 10 dias, retornou para avaliacao hematologica de controle, na qual revelou Hb 10 g/dL, leucocitos 5790/mm3 e plaquetas 250.000/mm3. Diante da recuperacao da insuficiencia medular, foi reforcada a hipotese de pancitopenia secundaria a infeccao por SARS-CoV-2. Discussao: COVID-19 e a constelacao de sintomas clinicos causada pelo virus SARS-CoV-2 que geralmente corresponde a febre e doenca respiratoria. No entanto, suas manifestacoes hematologicas devem ser investigadas devido ao potencial de gravidade. As citopenias sao achados comuns na COVID-19 e tem valor prognostico adverso significativo, associadas a maior probabilidade de admissao na UTI. A fisiopatologia dessa relacao e multifatorial e pode refletir aumento acelerado de componentes inflamatorios - descrito como tempestade de citocinas, promovendo apoptose de linfocitos. Alem disso, o dano endotelial desencadeado pela inflamacao sistemica leva a trombose e ao consumo disseminado de plaquetas. O caso descrito relata uma pancitopenia apos infeccao por COVID-19, achado desafiador devido as possibilidades diagnosticas. Entre as possiveis causas estao a toxicidade medular, processos tumorais ou autoimunes e infeccoes virais. Nesse contexto, cabe lembrar da sindrome hemofagocitica - processo imunomediado caracterizado por febre, hepatoesplenomegalia, pancitopenia, hiperferritinemia, hiponatremia e hipofibrinogenemia. A sua confirmacao depende de evidencia histopatologica de hemofagocitose na medula ossea. Esse estado hiper inflamatorio pode ocorrer apos infeccao viral, ja relatado em pacientes com COVID-19. Apesar do quadro sugestivo, a hipotese tornou-se menos provavel no caso devido a ausencia de organomegalias e melhora sem quaisquer medidas terapeuticas. Conclusao: Portanto, diante da infeccao viral documentada, o mecanismo etiologico mais plausivel foi hipoplasia da medula ossea por acao direta do SARS-CoV-2.Copyright Â© 2020","Filho, R. H. T.

"Research trends in the field of ambient air quality monitoring and management in South Africa: a bibliometric review","Air pollution is a leading environmental-health challenge facing the world today. Besides, the emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic has also put some spotlight on issues related to air pollution as both attack the same human respiratory organs. The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of research performance, trends and evolution in the field of ambient air quality monitoring and management in South Africa over the last decade (2010-2021) through the application of a bibliometric approach and a data mining software VOSViewer. Findings were that there has been a steady increase in the number of ambient air quality monitoring and management publications per year. Over the period under review, 2014 contributed 14 % while 2020 contributed 27 % of the total publications. Also, the study established that throughout the period South African scientist collaborated extensively with scientists from Finland, the United States of America, France, and Switzerland. Besides increasing awareness levels in the field, the increase in studies can also assist policy formulation and development. In the meantime, the South African National government has also put in place several mitigation strategies to reduce emissions for example the enactment of ambient air quality guidelines.","Matandirotya, Newton R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envc.2021.100263","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Environmental Challenges;: 100263, 2021.; Publication details: Environmental Challenges;: 100263, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21054,""
"Role of impaired nutritional status in Sars-Cov 2 patients","Rationale: SARS-COV 2 pandemia has hit on our lives affecting our survival rate. Preliminary evidences from literature have shown that obesity is a risk factor for higher mortality occurrence.Thus, we wanted to assess the nutritional status of patients admitted to our COVID-19 Unit. We aimed also to verify the possible correlation between nutritional status, inflammatory status and mortality. Method(s): we prospectively studied patients admitted to the COVID-19 Unit of San Benedetto General hospital. All the patients had biochemical, antropometric, HRCT chest scan and nutritional assessments at the time of admission and, at 15 days interval follow-up. Result(s): we studied 65 consecutive patients (mean age 65.8+/-2.5 years, BMI 23.2 Kg/m2). Main comorbidities were: diabetes (type 1 6%, type 2 35%), hypertension (45%), chronic ischemic heart disease (22 %), COPD (22%), anxiety (30%) and depression (20%). Moderate to severe overweight was present in 13% of patients;Onodera index (23.000+/-0.976), suggestive of malnutrition, was present in 20% of patients. Both PCR (C-reactive protein) and IL-6 values significantly correlated with worse radiologic pneumonitis progression (r=0.79 and r=0-72, respectively). After 15 days upon admission, we recorded 6 deaths (mean age 75.5+/-3.1 years, BMI 26.0 Kg/m2). Increased PCR and IL-6 values significantly correlated with exitus occurrence (r=0.78 and 0.75, respectively). Moreover, both overweight and malnutrition significantly correlated with exitus occurrence (r= 0.67 and r=0.70, respectively). Conclusion(s): we confirmed that higher inflammatory indexes significantly correlate with both worse radiological findings and fatal COVID-19 evolution. Interestingly, overweight and malnutrition, but not diabetes, significantly correlated with mortality. These results, if confirmed by larger perspective studies, can suggest a role for systemic micro-inflammation, related to both obesity and malnutrition, in worse disease evolution.

"Applying Evidence-Based Interventions for Cognitive and Psychiatric Sequelae in a Population with Novel Neurological Needs (SARS-CoV-2)","Research Objectives: 1) Identify cognitive, psychological and behavioral sequelae in COVID-19 survivors. 2) Describe evidence-based interventions from cognitive rehabilitation and psychiatric literature that have been efficaciously utilized in individuals with comorbid neurologic and psychiatric conditions, and therefore have potential to address cognitive and emotional sequelae in COVID-19 survivors. Design(s): Literature review. Setting(s): Multidisciplinary medical institution Participants: None. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): None. Result(s): The long-term sequelae in COVID-19 survivors is largely unknown and emerging studies have begun to identify cognitive and psychiatric symptoms as consequences in some individuals. Cognitive abilities most adversely impacted include attention, memory and executive functioning. Survivors of life-threatening illnesses, especially individuals with a history of lengthy ICU stays, are known to exhibit significant psychiatric sequelae, including elevated anxiety, depression, and symptoms of PTSD;all of which are known to exacerbate existing cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions have been utilized in a variety of neurological populations with similar concomitant cognitive and psychiatric symptoms noted in the limited extant literature describing survivors of COVID-19. Integrated use of these evidenced-based CR and CBT interventions is necessary to address the interplay of cognitive and emotional symptomatology that can impede functional recovery in these patients. Conclusion(s): An integrated treatment approach that incorporates both CR and CBT interventions can be used to address the cognitive, behavioral, and psychological manifestations observed in patients with COVID-19 in order to maximize a survivor's level of daily functioning and facilitate re-integration into daily activities. Until further research assessing treatment efficacy in this population can be conducted, rehabilitation specialists should adapt known CR/CBT protocols that are used in disorders that present with similar pathology, as well as neurocognitive and emotional challenges as those in this novel disease.

"Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Emergency Department Presentations in an Integrated Health System","Objective: To quantify the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic on emergency department volumes and patient presentations and evaluate changes in community mortality for the purpose of characterizing new patterns of emergency care use. &lt;br/&gt;Patients and Methods: This is an observational cross-sectional study using electronic health records for emergency department visits in an integrated multihospital system with academic and community practices across 4 states for visits between March 17 and April 21, 2019, and February 9 and April 21, 2020. We compared numbers and proportions of common and critical chief symptoms and diagnoses, triage assessments, throughput, disposition, and selected hospital lengths of stay and out-of-hospital deaths. &lt;br/&gt;Result(s): In the period of interest, emergency department visits decreased by nearly 50% (35037 to 18646). Total numbers of patients with myocardial infarctions, stroke, appendicitis, and cholecystitis diagnosed decreased. The percentage of visits for mental health symptoms increased. There was an increase in deaths, driven by out-of-hospital mortality. &lt;br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Fewer patients presenting with acute and time-sensitive diagnoses suggests that patients are deferring care. This may be further supported by an increase in out-of-hospital mortality. Understanding which patients are deferring care and why will allow us to develop outreach strategies and ensure that those in need of rapid assessment and treatment will do so, preventing downstream morbidity and mortality.&lt;br/&gt;Copyright &#xa9;2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research","Walker, L.

"Incidence of postpartum depression (PPD) in SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers who underwent maternal-neonatal separation","Objective: To evaluate the incidence of postpartum depression in mothers who endured maternal-neonatal separation at delivery and in the postpartum period due to their SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR status. Study Design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women who delivered during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic from March 18th to May 12th 2020, when maternal-neonatal separation was recommended for SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers by the American Academy of Pediatrics. We excluded women who were less than 18 years of age at the time of delivery and those who experienced an IUFD or neonatal death. We investigated the difference in postpartum depression rates between SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers. SARS-CoV-2 status was determined using a nasopharyngeal PCR swab upon admission to labor and delivery. We conducted analyses using Fischer Exact Tests, where a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): The incidence of postpartum depression was 2.4% in SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers versus 10.3% in SARS-COV-2 positive mothers with a p-value of 0.02. The relative risk of developing PPD in SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers was 3.73 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.03-13.4 with a p-value of 0.04. Conclusion(s): There was increased incidence and relative risk of postpartum depression in patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients and providers should be made aware of this possible association. One possible contributing factor to the increased incidence of postpartum depression may have been maternal-neonatal separation. Current CDC evidence demonstrates low risk of neonatal acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic positive mothers. The results of this study suggest another reason to follow the updated American Academy of Pediatrics SARS-CoV-2 recommendation, that asymptomatic mothers positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be allowed to room in with their neonate and not endure maternal-neonatal separation.

"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security among East and West African pastoralists<U+2606>","The focus of attention regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has been on direct health outcomes and the macroeconomic impacts of control measures. Here we review the available evidence about the food security impacts of the pandemic on pastoralists in Eastern and Western Africa. While pastoralism occurs on more than 50% of the world's land area, the landscapes that pastoralists exploit tend to be remote and highly variable arid and semi-arid lands with low population densities. Over time pastoralists have developed sophisticated mechanisms to enhance their self-sufficiency. At the same time, remoteness and sociopolitical marginalization have resulted in higher rates of food insecurity and underdevelopment among pastoralists relative to more sedentary populations. These dynamics tend to be intractable to standardized food security, malnutrition, and economic development interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic is contributing to a worsening of food security trends in pastoralist areas of East and West Africa due to a multiplicity of factors, including the closure of livestock markets, movement restrictions, disruptions of supply chains and livestock production inputs, reduced frequency and quality of human and animal healthcare delivery, and lost income from complementary livelihoods. It opens, however, space for innovations that may contribute to the food-secure future of pastoralism, including adapting a One Health approach that addresses the social, economic, and environmental health determinants of food security among African pastoralists.","Griffith, Evan F.; Craige, Shaina, Manzano, Pablo, Pius, Loupa, Jost, Christine C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.af2s.2021.07.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Advances in Food Security and Sustainability;2021.; Publication details: Advances in Food Security and Sustainability;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21059,""

The pandemic exposed the complexity of social inequality and the urgency of a society engaged in repairing existing weaknesses.","Silva, Simone Santana da; Skalinski, Lacita Menezes; Calmon, Tricia Viviane Lima; AraÃºjo, Gleide Santos de; Nery, Joilda Silva","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1414-32832021000200501","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: LILACS; Publication details: Interface (Botucatu, Online);25(supl.1): e200690, 2021.; Publication details: Interface (Botucatu, Online);25(supl.1): e200690, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21065,""

"N-Terminomics for the Identification of In Vitro Substrates and Cleavage Site Specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease","The genome of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encodes for two proteases, a papain like (PLpro ) protease and the so-called main protease (Mpro ), a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, also named 3CLpro or non-structural protein 5 (nsp5). Mpro is activated by autoproteolysis and is the main protease responsible for cutting the viral polyprotein into functional units. Aside from this, it is described that Mpro proteases are also capable of processing host proteins, including those involved in the host innate immune response. To identify substrates of the three main proteases from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-NL63 coronviruses, an LC-MS based N-terminomics in vitro analysis is performed using recombinantly expressed proteases and lung epithelial and endothelial cell lysates as substrate pools. For SARS-CoV-2 Mpro , 445 cleavage events from more than 300 proteins are identified, while 151 and 331 Mpro derived cleavage events are identified for SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63, respectively. These data enable to better understand the cleavage site specificity of the viral proteases and will help to identify novel substrates in vivo. All data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021406.","Koudelka, Tomas; Boger, Juliane; Henkel, Alessandra; SchÃ¶nherr, Robert; Krantz, Stefanie; Fuchs, Sabine; RodrÃ­guez, EstefanÃ­a; Redecke, Lars; Tholey, Andreas","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmic.202000246","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Proteomics;21(2): e2000246, 2021 01.; Publication details: Proteomics;21(2): e2000246, 2021 01.; COVID-19/virology; Coronavirus 3C Proteases/metabolism; Coronavirus NL63, Human/enzymology; Peptide Fragments/analysis; SARS Virus/enzymology; SARS-CoV-2/enzymology; Viral Proteins/metabolism; COVID-19/metabolism; Cells, Cultured; Endothelial Cells/metabolism; Endothelial Cells/virology; Epithelial Cells/metabolism; Epithelial Cells/virology; Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/metabolism; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Lung/metabolism; Lung/virology; Substrate Specificity; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21069,""

Stress levels and quality of life in selected population groups in the early phase of the lockdown of the corona pandemic were examined. Associations of coping strategies with perceived stress levels and associations of activities to increase well-being with health-related quality of life as an aspect of well-being are presented. METHODS: Data from the first survey wave of the CoPa study were evaluated, which were collected via online survey. Group differences regarding stress and quality of life were explorative tested by means of Chi-square tests and T-tests. Associations of coping strategies with stress and of activities to increase well-being with health-related quality of life were calculated using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 5315 participants, persons at risk of mental health and those who did not go out in public showed signs of depression, anxiety disorders and stress significantly more often than other participants. Persons with children under 12 years of age showed significantly higher stress levels than others and their health-related quality of life was comparable. Perceived social support and self-efficacy proved to be resources for stress. Humor, physical activity, healthy eating, maintaining daily routines and pursuing specific goals were positively associated with health-related quality of life. DISCUSSION: Persons with mental health risks need therapeutic services in times of reduced contact. Selected measures to increase well-being appear to be effective and should be recommended.","Peters, Elke; HÃ¼bner, Joachim; Katalinic, Alexander","https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1275-3792","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Dtsch Med Wochenschr;146(2): e11-e20, 2021 01.; Publication details: Dtsch Med Wochenschr;146(2): e11-e20, 2021 01.; Adaptation, Psychological; COVID-19; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Stress, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19/prevention & control; COVID-19/psychology; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Physical Distancing; Quarantine/psychology; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21070,""

"Cyberbullying Among Traditional and Complementary Medicine Practitioners in the Workplace: Protocol for a Cross-sectional Descriptive Study","BACKGROUND: Cyberbullying is becoming prevalent among health care professionals and may cause a variety of mental health issues. Traditional and complementary medicine practitioners remain an important pillar of the health care system in Malaysia. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a study protocol for an online survey (Cyberbullying Among Traditional and Complementary Medicine Practitioner [TCMPs]) that will collect the first nationwide representative data on cyberbullying behavior among traditional and complementary medicine practitioners in Malaysia. The objectives of the survey are to (1) evaluate the cyberbullying behavior among traditional and complementary medicine practitioners in Malaysia, (2) identify sociodemographic and social factors related to cyberbullying, and (3) evaluate the association between cyberbullying behavior, sociodemographic, and social factors. METHODS: A snowball sampling strategy will be applied. Traditional and complementary medicine practitioners who are permanent Malaysian residents will be randomly selected and invited to participate in the survey (N=1023). Cyberbullying behavior will be measured using the Cyberbullying Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ). Data on the following items will be collected: work-related bullying, person-related bullying, aggressively worded messages, distortion of messages, sending offensive photos/videos, hacking computers or sending a virus or rude message, and threatening messages about personal life or family members. We will also collect data on participants' sociodemographic characteristics, social factors, and substance abuse behavior. RESULTS: This cross-sectional descriptive study was registered with Research Registry (Unique Identifying Number 6216; November 05, 2020). This research work (substudy) is planned under a phase 1 study approved by the Research Management Centre, Xiamen University Malaysia. This substudy has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Xiamen University Malaysia (REC-2011.01). The cross-sectional survey will be conducted from July 01, 2021, to June 30, 2022. Data preparation and statistical analyses are planned from January 2022 onward. CONCLUSIONS: The current research can contribute to identify the prevalence of workplace cyberbullying among Malaysian traditional and complementary medicine practitioners. The results will help government stakeholders, health professionals, and education professionals to understand the psychological well-being of Malaysian traditional and complementary medicine practitioners.

"Implementing Home Office Work at a Large Psychiatric University Hospital in Switzerland During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Field Report","BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, psychiatric hospitals all over the world had to adapt their services to the prevailing governmental regulations. As a consequence, home office use and telepsychiatry boomed. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of home office use, its adoption, and the association of home office use with employees' mental health in a large psychiatric university hospital in Switzerland. METHODS: We obtained and analyzed home office implementation and use data from the psychiatric university hospital's information technology services. We also conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey to assess the employees' attitudes toward the clinic's crisis management during the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. Part of this web-based survey consisted of questions about home office use between March and June 2020, attitudes toward home office implementation, and mental health. Three mental health measures assessed depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-2), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder [GAD]-2), and stress factors (stress module of the PHQ-D); a cut-off score &#8805;3 was used for the PHQ-2 and GAD-2. RESULTS: Of the 200 participating employees, 69 reported that they had worked from home at least partially (34.5%). Home office use differed significantly across professional groups (&#967;162=72.72, P&#8804;.001, n=200). Employees experienced neither depressive symptoms (mean 0.76, SD 1.14) nor anxiety (mean 0.70, SD 1.03). The employees reported minor psychosocial stressors (mean 2.83, SD 2.92). The number of reported stress factors varied significantly across groups with different levels of home office use (&#967;42=9.72, P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: In general, home office implementation appears to be feasible for large psychiatric hospitals, however, it is not equally feasible for all professional groups. Professional groups that require personal contact with patients and technical or manual tasks must work onsite. Further evaluation of home office use in psychiatric hospitals up to the development of clinics that function merely online will follow in future research. The situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic served as a stepping stone to promote home office use and should be used to improve employees' work-life balance, to save employers costs and foster other benefits.","KrÃ¼ckl, Jana Sophia; Moeller, Julian; Gaupp, Rainer; Meier, Christoph E; Roth, Carl BÃ©nÃ©dict; Lang, Undine Emmi; Huber, Christian G","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/28849","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(9): e28849, 2021 Sep 01.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(9): e28849, 2021 Sep 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21073,""
"Emotional Analysis of Twitter Posts During the First Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Greece: Infoveillance Study","BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of public health measures depends upon a community's compliance as well as on its positive or negative emotions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to perform an analysis of the expressed emotions in English tweets by Greek Twitter users during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece. METHODS: The period of this study was from January 25, 2020 to June 30, 2020. Data collection was performed by using appropriate search words with the filter-streaming application programming interface of Twitter. The emotional analysis of the tweets that satisfied the inclusion criteria was achieved using a deep learning approach that performs better by utilizing recurrent neural networks on sequences of characters. Emotional epidemiology tools such as the 6 basic emotions, that is, joy, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger based on the Paul Ekman classification were adopted. RESULTS: The most frequent emotion that was detected in the tweets was ""surprise"" at the emerging contagion, while the imposed isolation resulted mostly in ""anger"" (odds ratio 2.108, 95% CI 0.986-4.506). Although the Greeks felt rather safe during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, their positive and negative emotions reflected a masked ""flight or fight"" or ""fear versus anger"" response to the contagion. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study show that emotional analysis emerges as a valid tool for epidemiology evaluations, design, and public health strategy and surveillance.","Geronikolou, Styliani; Drosatos, George; Chrousos, George","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/27741","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e27741, 2021 Sep 29.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(9): e27741, 2021 Sep 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21074,""
"Emergency Department Encounters Among Youth With Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: Population-level reports of suicide-related emergency department (ED) encounters among youth during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking, along with youth characteristics and preexisting psychiatric service use. Objective: To characterize population-level and relative change in suicide-related ED encounters among youth during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 2019. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study evaluated ED encounters in 2019 and 2020 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California-a large, integrated, community-based health system. Youth aged 5 to 17 years who presented to the ED with suicidal thoughts or behaviors were included. Exposure: The COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Population-level incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and percent relative effects for suicide-related ED encounters as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes in 4 periods in 2020 compared with the same periods in 2019. Results: There were 2123 youth with suicide-related ED encounters in 2020 compared with 2339 in 2019. In the 2020 group, 1483 individuals (69.9%) were female and 1798 (84.7%) were aged 13 to 17 years. In the 2019 group, 1542 (65.9%) were female, and 1998 (85.4%) were aged 13 to 17 years. Suicide-related ED encounter incidence rates were significantly lower in March through May 2020 compared with this period in 2019 (IRR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.51-0.63; P < .001), then returned to prepandemic levels. However, suicide-related ED visits among female youth from June 1 to August 31, 2020, and September 1 through December 15, 2020, were significantly higher than in the corresponding months in 2019 (IRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.04-1.35; P = .04 and IRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.35; P < .001, respectively), while suicide-related ED visits for male youth decreased from September 1 through December 15, 2020 (IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.94). Youth with no history of outpatient mental health or suicide encounters (129.4%; 95% CI, 41.0-217.8) and those with comorbid psychiatric conditions documented at the ED encounter (6.7%; 95% CI, 1.0-12.3) had a higher risk of presenting with suicide-related problems from September to December 2020 vs the same period in 2019. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of youth experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviors, suicide-related presentations to the ED initially decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely owing to shelter-in-place orders, then were similar to 2019 levels.

"Parents under Lockdown: the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Families","This paper explores aspects of parenting during COVID-19 lockdown, analyzing the international literature and presenting a study conducted in Italy during the initial period of social isolation (March-May 2020). The pandemic has made childcare challenging for parents globally, compromising the well-being and mental health of caregivers themselves (Brooks et al., 2020), and creating a potentially highly vulnerable situation for children (Gromada, Richardson, Rees, 2020). The COVID-19 emergency and the restrictions it has entailed bear short- and long-term implications for families, including the potential impact of delaying implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2015) and increased risk of children witnessing or experiencing violence and abuse (End Violence Against Children, 2020). Given this background, we investigated the family ecosystem, exploring both individual and parental factors in parentsâ€™ relationships with their children, during lockdown.","Biffi, Elisabetta, Gambacorti-Passerini, Maria Benedetta, Bianchi, Daniela","https://doi.org/10.36253/rief-10332","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Rivista Italiana di Educazione Familiare; 18(1):97-111, 2021.; Publication details: Rivista Italiana di Educazione Familiare; 18(1):97-111, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21076,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Human Resource Operation: Empirical Evidence from the Perspective of Malaysian Retail Employees in Klang Valley","The aim of this research is to examine the Coivd-19 impacts on the Human Resource (HR) operation in the Malaysian retail sector, especially in the Klang Valley area. A self administered online survey was conducted with 330 participants answering. The partial least square approach to structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to investigate the direct effects of the proposed variables. Besides, the mediation test was used to examine the indirect effects. The outcomes of the study showed that the current pandemic has an essential influence on job depression and anxiety at the retail level. Furthermore, the direct relationship between Covid-19, salary, and layoff is significant, suggesting that COVID-19 is a severe problem for employees' salaries and layoffs. In contrast, the indirect effect of Covid19, job depression, job anxiety, salary, and layoff confirm a significant relationship with partial mediation. Job depression, however, does not mediate the relationship between COVID-19 and layoff. This research only considered Klang Valley area in addition to the data collected through the convenient sampling method by using an online survey form. The findings of the study offer an insight into the factors influencing human capital management and how the retail decision-makers, retailers, retail consultants, and staff should devise a new approach to adjust HR policies in a â€˜new normalâ€™ situation. The study adds to the existing knowledge about the effect of Covid-19 on job depression, job anxiety, salaries, and layoffs among retail employees.

"Peopleâ€™s understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic: social representations of SARS-CoV-2 virus in Italy","This study examined the social representations of SARS-CoV-2 virus in Italy. We used the technique of free word association involving 1572 adults living in Italy. An open coding procedure and content analysis lead to the identification of 13 key topics representing the categorisation of concepts that emerged from the elicited words. The most common categories were spread of the virus, negative feelings, life during quarantine, and health consequences of the virus. Multidimensional scaling of co-occurrences of categories revealed these categories were grouped into four thematic areas. In addition, we found that the frequency of the categories of words was associated with gender, age, well-being, and mental health symptoms. By revealing complex and differentiated social representations, results from the present study provide a comprehensive insight on Italian peopleâ€™s perception of COVID-19 outbreak in the Spring of 2020. This early study of social representations forms a useful basis for later studies, in order to understand how collective understandings and framings of risk have evolved across the duration of the pandemic.

"PERCEPTION AND THE ASSOCIATED APPREHENSION STEMMING FROM NOVEL COVID-19 AMONG PAKISTANI STUDENTS","ABSTRACT Objective: To highlight Pakistani Students anxieties and their attitude towards the circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic and to bring forth this data for better policy revisions in the country. Study Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study conducted using snowball sampling technique. Place and Duration of Study: Armed Forces Institute of Dentistry, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from 14th May to 16th May 2020. Methodology: A structured self-administered questionnaire was prepared, based on other surveys conducted in the past. Questionnaire was made available online and shared across social media sites with students. Results: We found that around 44% of students felt anxious daily due to COVID-19 while 60% of them were not content with the current measures to stop the spread of the virus. 87% of the students feared for the health of thei r family members while 80% felt anxious for their academic future due to the unprecedent circumstances created by the disease. 53% had decided not to go to hospitals in case of any illness other than covid-19. Approximately 55% believed that the situation was worse than actually being portrayed. Females generally were found to be more anxious than males regarding their health and health of their family members. Conclusion: There is a dire need of establishing mental health services in educational institutions. Despite the students' generally correct approach towards curbing the spread of COVID-19, they are still much apprehensive regarding the situation surrounding the pandemic due to the disturbance of their academic and everyday life.","Kaleem, Muhammad, Talha, Muhammad, Nazir, Rozina, Hafeez, Resham","https://www.google.com/search?q=PERCEPTION+AND+THE+ASSOCIATED+APPREHENSION+STEMMING+FROM+NOVEL+COVID-19+AMONG+PAKISTANI+STUDENTS","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Pakistan Armed Forces Medical Journal; _(COVID-19 (1)), 2020.; Publication details: Pakistan Armed Forces Medical Journal; _(COVID-19 (1)), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21081,""

"Haptoglobin as a Biomarker","Haptoglobin (Hp) is a glycoprotein that binds free hemoglobin (Hb) in plasma and plays a critical role in tissue protection and prevention of oxidative damage. Besides, it has some regulatory functions. Haptoglobin is an acute-phase protein, its concentration in plasma changes in pathology, and the test for its concentration is part of normal clinical practice. Haptoglobin is a conservative protein synthesized mainly in the liver and lungs and is the subject of research as a potential biomarker of many diseases, including various forms of malignant neoplasms. Haptoglobin has several unique biophysical characteristics. The human ÃÂÃ‘<U+0080> gene is polymorphic, has three structural alleles that control the synthesis of three major phenotypes of haptoglobin: homozygous ÃÂÃ‘<U+0080>1-1 and ÃÂÃ‘<U+0080>2-2, and heterozygous ÃÂÃ‘<U+0080>2-1, determined by a combination of allelic variants that are inherited. Numerous studies indicate that the phenotype of haptoglobin can be used to judge the individual predisposition of a person to various diseases. In addition, Hp undergoes various post-translational modifications (PTMs). These are structural transformations (removal of the signal peptide, cutting off the Pre-Hp precursor molecule into two subunits, &#945; and ÃŸ, limited proteolysis of &#945;-chains, formation of disulfide bonds, multimerization), as well as chemical modifications of &#945;-chains and glycosylation of the ÃŸ-chain. Glycosylation of the ÃŸ-chain of haptoglobin at four Asn sites is the most important variable PTM that regulates the structure and function of the glycoprotein. The study of modified oligosaccharides of the ÃŸ-chain of Hp has become the main direction in the study of pathological processes, including malignant neoplasms. These characteristics indicate the possibility of the existence of Hp in the form of a multitude of proteoforms, probably performing different functions. This review is devoted to the description of the structural and functional diversity and the potential use of Hp as a biomarker of various pathologies.","Naryzny, S N; Legina, O K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1990750821030069","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Biochem Mosc Suppl B Biomed Chem;15(3): 184-198, 2021.; Publication details: Biochem Mosc Suppl B Biomed Chem;15(3): 184-198, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21083,""

"Priming COVID-19 salience increases prejudice and discriminatory intent against Asians and Hispanics","Mounting reports in the media suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified prejudice and discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, especially Asians. Existing research has focused on discrimination against Asians and is primarily based on self-reported incidents or nonrepresentative samples. We investigate the extent to which COVID-19 has fueled prejudice and discrimination against multiple racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States by examining nationally representative survey data with an embedded vignette experiment about roommate selection (collected in August 2020; n = 5,000). We find that priming COVID-19 salience has an immediate, statistically significant impact: compared to the control group, respondents in the treatment group exhibited increased prejudice and discriminatory intent against East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic hypothetical room-seekers. The treatment effect is more pronounced in increasing extreme negative attitudes toward the three minority groups than decreasing extreme positive attitudes toward them. This is partly due to the treatment increasing the proportion of respondents who perceive these minority groups as extremely culturally incompatible (Asians and Hispanics) and extremely irresponsible (Asians). Sociopolitical factors did not moderate the treatment effects on attitudes toward Asians, but prior social contact with Hispanics mitigated prejudices against them. These findings suggest that COVID-19-fueled prejudice and discrimination have not been limited to East Asians but are part of a broader phenomenon that has affected Asians generally and Hispanics as well.","Lu, Yao; Kaushal, Neeraj; Huang, Xiaoning; Gaddis, S Michael","https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2105125118","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A;118(36)2021 09 07.; Publication details: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A;118(36)2021 09 07.; Asian Americans/psychology; COVID-19/psychology; Hispanic Americans/psychology; Prejudice; Attitude; COVID-19/ethnology; Humans; Intention; Minority Groups/psychology; Pandemics; Prejudice/ethnology; Racism/ethnology; Racism/psychology; United States; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21085,""
"Factors Associated With Suicide Ideation in Lithuania and Poland Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on many risk and protective factors associated with suicide. Aims: The aim of this study was to identify pandemic-related factors associated with suicidal ideation in the two European countries, Lithuania and Poland, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: The sample comprised 2,459 participants in both countries; 57.2% of the respondents were female. The Mage of the participants was 43.45 years (SD = 15.91). Pandemic-related stressors and adjustment problems were measured to assess associations with suicidal ideation. Results: High levels of adjustment problems, loneliness, and burden due to staying at home more during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly associated with suicide ideation in both Lithuania and Poland. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional online study with different recruitment approaches in the two countries. Conclusion: Adjustment problems, loneliness, and stressors related to staying at home more could be important targets for suicide prevention amid the pandemic.","Gelezelyte, Odeta; Dragan, Malgorzata; Grajewski, Piotr; Kvedaraite, Monika; Lotzin, Annett; Skrodzka, Magdalena; Nomeikaite, Auguste; Kazlauskas, Evaldas","https://dx.doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000814","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Crisis;2021 Aug 31.; Publication details: Crisis;2021 Aug 31.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21086,""
"Depression in the Pediatric Otolaryngology Clinic Setting","OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: For most pediatric specialty clinics, mental health is not the primary presenting complaint, yet can portend unrecognized morbidity. We describe rates and risk factors of depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents seen at a pediatric specialty clinic and examine changes during COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database review. METHODS: Outpatient pediatric otolaryngology clinic encounters of patients aged 12-19 years at a tertiary academic medical center were identified from October 2018 to July 2020. Demographic characteristics, ICD-10 primary diagnosis, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 score, and PHQ-9 score (if administered) were obtained. Multivariable regression examined risk factors for PHQ-9 administration, PHQ-9 scores &#8805;10, and suicidal ideation. Patient characteristics and PHQ scores were compared before and after March 23, 2020 (California COVID-19 Stay-at-Home order). RESULTS: Three thousand six hundred nine encounters with PHQ-2 data were identified. Of these, 223 (6.2%) scored &#8805;3 and underwent PHQ-9 assessment, of which 121 (3.4% of 3,609) scored &#8805;10 on the PHQ-9 and 53 (1.5%) endorsed suicidal ideation. Factors associated with PHQ-9 administration were female gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.58, PÂ =Â .001), obesity (OR 1.48, PÂ =Â .043), and neck mass/neoplasm/cancer diagnosis (OR 1.99, PÂ =Â .013). Female gender was also associated with suicidality (OR 2.47, PÂ =Â .008). Comparison of pre-COVID-19 versus during COVID-19 showed no differences in depression or suicidality. However, subgroup analysis revealed some significant findings. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate substantial prevalence of positive depression screening and suicidal ideation among adolescent pediatric otolaryngology clinic encounters. Depression rates were similar to pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19, yet barriers to screening during this time were substantial. Pediatric specialty providers must remain vigilant for mental health issues in their patients.

"Coronavirus is like: Sense relations from metaphors by simile","In this paper, we analyze metaphors by simile in the context of the covid-19 pandemic, taking into account sense relations that encompass conceptual domains, socio-cultural aspects, as well as pragmatic and discourse functions raised in the circumstances examined. For this purpose, we assume a theoretical framework that conceives metaphor as a multi-faceted phenomenon that permeates distinct linguistic levels. In addition, we adopt a method that resorts to the web as a corpus to identify the metaphors, by applying triggers such as coronavÃ­rus Ã© como, covid-19 Ã© como, coronavÃ­rus Ã© que nem e covid-19 Ã© que nem. In the light of our findings, in general, we can assert that, although speakers use similar metaphorical domains, they do so based on different discourse-argumentative positions and intentions, which can result, for instance, in positive or negative attitudes towards the effects of the pandemic.

"Fake news in pandemic times: The urgency of new multiliteracies in the digital culture","In the era of digital culture (Santaella, 2003), the new multiliteracies necessary to produce meanings have become more demanding, because they change the relationship of consumption, reception, and production of languages and discourses. This article aims to analyze the fake news (Bucci, 2019;Frias Filho, 2018;Santaella, 2018) produced during the pandemic period caused by COVID-19 in Brazil. For that, the linguistic and imagery strategies of appeal and persuasion are evaluated, as well as the digital treatment of fakes that reflect a transmedia narrative (Jenkins, 2009), which presupposes the need for critical literacies capable of interconnecting people, media objects and meaning-building strategies (Lemke, 2010). Thus, it was carried out the selection of five (5) fake news that circulated on different social networks with different configurations and promoted the misinformation related to the number of deaths by COVID-19. After that, it was made a cutting from them for analysis, the fake news based on the theme of ""empty coffins"" that used static images (Rojo and Moura, 2019;Santaella and NÃ¶th, 1998) accompanied or not by verbal text and verified in checking agencies. At the end of this research, we learn that if there is freedom to access a lot of information and to interact through the networks with several people, the reading practices need to understand the multisemiosis present in the texts that circulate on the networks. Also, we could comprehend the relationships established in the means of transmission and production of texts in digital contexts. Â© 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

"The impact of COVID-19-delayed elective sports surgery on young patients","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed the US healthcare system in unprecedented ways. As a response to the spread of the virus, elective surgeries throughout the country have been canceled, in an effort to minimize further transmission. To our knowledge, the effects of delayed surgeries on patients have not been investigated. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the physical and psychological consequences of elective surgery delays on young sports medicine patients. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study of patients, ages 10-25 years old, who had sports medicine surgery delayed between March and May 2020 due to the COVID crisis. All patients were still awaiting surgery at the time of the initial survey. Electronic surveys were sent to patients and included the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), which yields a physical component score (SF12-PCS) as well as a mental component score (SF12-MCS), the PROMIS Psychological Stress Experience survey (PROMIS-PSE), and self-designed questions about patient concerns regarding the COVID crisis and delayed surgery. A higher score on SF-12 subscales signifies better health, whereas a higher score on the PSE indicates more psychological stress. Scores that deviate significantly from a mean of 50 indicate a difference from the general population norm. Results: Of the 146 eligible patients with delayed elective sports surgeries, 89 patients (61%) elected to participate (mean age 17.7Â±2.9 years, 30% male). The median length of surgical delay was 36 days (range 9-54), and 79% of patients were awaiting surgery on the lower extremity. Delayed surgery patients scored significantly lower than population norms on the SF12-PCS (mean 39.4, CI 36.8-42.1, p&lt;0.001). Males scored significantly higher than females on the SF12-MCS (53 vs 45.1, p=0.003), but the overall mean was not significantly different from the general population (47.2, p=0.08). The mean PSE score was significantly higher than population norms (57.9, CI 56.3-59.6, p&lt;0.001), but did not differ by age or sex. Those with a history of mental health conditions reported higher PROMIS-PSE scores compared to those without (61.2 vs 56.9 p=0.02). Patients who reported being extremely concerned about their surgical delay had lower scores on the SF-PCS and SF-MCS, and higher scores on the PROMIS-PSE (p=0.03, p=0.01, and p&lt;0.001 respectively), suggesting more significant physical and emotional symptoms. The majority of patients indicated that their physical and emotional symptoms were attributed mostly to their injury awaiting surgery, with patients reporting a median 50% attribution (IQR, 32-75%), compared to attributions for COVID or other concerns. The biggest concern with COVID-related surgical delays was a concern about not being back in time for a sports season. Conclusions: Young sports medicine patients reported significant physical and emotional symptoms associated with COVIDrelated surgical delays. Patients were most concerned about delays resulting in missed sport seasons. Those who reported greater levels of concern with surgical delays demonstrated lower physical and mental health scores and higher levels of psychological stress. The physical and psychological impact of surgical delays should be considered when caring for young athletes.","Sanborn, R.; Miller, P.; Milewski, M.; Heyworth, B.; Kramer, D.; Yen, Y.

"Taking real issues to virtual conferences: The training of YKP to discuss social vulnerability measures in the COVID-19 context","Background The COVID-19 pandemic persisted for most of 2020 and, although the government initially canceled thousands of events, the need for adaptation forced many of them to go online. Through various digital platforms, people found new ways to deal with social distance and, at the same time, to promote events. Methods A two-step approach was used for this analysis: 1) creation of a data collection form using Google Forms, and 2) transfer of data from the form to a spreadsheet using Google Spreadsheets. Results The Ministry of Health of Brazil (MoH Brazil) started hosting webinars and virtual meetings. Between July and December 2020, MoH Brazil held four thematic webinars focusing on the Young Key Populations (YKP). As a result, more than 600 YKP were trained to deal with social vulnerabilities, especially with mental health and behavioral issues. Conclusion The use of this post-event databank will help governments to identify ways to move forward with the presentation of information and to organize trainings based on YKP interests. These webinars also represent a virtual safe space that engage the youth in a healthy discussion regarding social protection measures that are adapted to the covid-19 context..","Agostinho Calixto, D.; Fagundes Correia, N.; Moreira AlÃ³, C.; Bernardes Sousa, C.","https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.445","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sexually Transmitted Infections; 97(SUPPL 1):A169-A170, 2021.; Publication details: Sexually Transmitted Infections; 97(SUPPL 1):A169-A170, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21093,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on the sexual health of youth in The Netherlands","Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) changed people's life drastically, due to restrictions to reduce transmission such as social distancing and the limited number of social contacts. The objective is to gain insight in the impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on the sexual health of youth in the Netherlands. Methods We conducted two cross sectional surveys targeting Dutch youth aged 16-20 year old during the pandemic. Recruitment occurred via social media and a youth sexual health website (sense.info). Both studies included a questionnaire about dating, relationships, sexual- and help seeking behavior and mental health. We identified 4 different time periods: (i) 6 months before the pandemic (pre pandemic), (ii) first lockdown, (iii) between lockdowns, and (iv) second lockdown. Results The samples consisted of 5218 and 4091 participants. The study showed that less singles had sex during the first (40%) and second (52%) lockdown period compared to pre lockdown (67%). Singles who continued to have sex more often reported casual regular partner during the first (58%) and second lockdown (60%), than pre lockdown (28%) and between lockdowns (33%). STI testing uptake decreased from 9% pre-lockdown to 1% during the first and 3% during the second lockdown. Self-tests were used almost twice as often during the pandemic (13%) as before (7%). Among the reasons for not testing, corona-related reasons (e.g., STI clinics are closed, or health care providers are too busy) decreased between the first (47%) and second lockdown (27%). Furthermore, youths mental health has weakened since the first lockdown up until the end of 2020. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacts the sexual health of Dutch youth, especially during lockdown periods, but also in periods of relaxation of pandemic control measures. Therefore, it is extremely important for healthcare providers to make their facilities accessible and find for alternatives for face-to-face testing..","De Graaf, H.; Joemmanbaks, F.; Heijne, J.; Meijer, S.; Polet, J.","https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.392","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sexually Transmitted Infections; 97(SUPPL 1):A149-A150, 2021.; Publication details: Sexually Transmitted Infections; 97(SUPPL 1):A149-A150, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21094,""
"Loneliness among older black and white people living with HIV","Background Loneliness is a concern among older people living with HIV (PLWH), especially given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there is little research characterizing loneliness and race. To investigate how HIV impacts older (age 50+) PLWH in the US, a study called Aging with Dignity, Health, Optimism and Community (ADHOC) was launched at ten sites to collect self-reported data. This study uses ADHOC data to compare loneliness between older Black and White PLWH. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was performed to compare loneliness between older Black and White PLWH. Loneliness was assessed using the Three-item Loneliness Scale, a validated patient-reported outcome measure (range 3-9), with higher scores indicating greater loneliness. Student's t-test was used to compare loneliness between White and Black people. Control variables for loneliness were identified a priori and included in a multivariable linear regression model. Results Of 868 participants, the average age was 60 (SD 6.2) years, 77% (N=671) were White and 23% (N=197) were Black, 85% were male, and 82% were gay or lesbian. In bivariate analyses, Black participants were less lonely than White participants (5.2 vs 5.6, P=.02). In the multivariable linear regression analysis, Black participants were again less lonely than Whites (coef. -0.45, P=0.01) while controlling for age, education, depression, anxiety, number of co-morbid conditions, being single, income, gender, sexual orientation, and spirituality (Adjusted R2=0.38;P&lt;.01). Conclusion Among PLWH over age 50 in ADHOC, Black participants experienced less loneliness than White participants, even after controlling for a variety of factors. Additional research is needed to better understand the causes of these racial differences, so that programs designed to decrease loneliness among PLWH can consider the unique characteristics of each group.","Berko, J.; Berko, J.; Loo, T.; MacLaren, L.; Huhn, G.; Nwafor, T.; Spinelli, F.; Zolopa, A.","https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.310","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Sexually Transmitted Infections; 97(SUPPL 1):A118, 2021.; Publication details: Sexually Transmitted Infections; 97(SUPPL 1):A118, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21095,""
"""I got into a very dark place"": addressing the needs of young people leaving care during the Covid-19 pandemic","Purpose This paper aims to report on the findings of a qualitative study that explored the views and experiences of young people leaving care during the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach was adopted involving semi-structured interviews with 24 care leavers 18-25 years old from across the region. Interviews were conducted remotely online or by telephone and explored young people's lived experiences during the pandemic including their views on the formal support services and how best to provide ongoing for support care leavers during the pandemic. Findings Study findings highlight how known adversities for care leavers are exacerbated during the pandemic, having a detrimental impact, particularly on their emotional well-being. The response of the state as a corporate parent in mitigating the impact of the pandemic was found to be inadequate;with a need for much clearer communication, transparent and prompt decision-making and targeted specialist mental health services. The account given by the young people also highlighted the importance of participation and relationship-based practice to build on the young people's resilience in the context of high levels of social isolation and limited access to informal support systems. Originality/value This research, based on the views of care experienced young people themselves, is the first study in Northern Ireland to report on the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on care leaving. As such it makes a contribution to this emerging international field of study and, given the persistence of the pandemic, provides empirical findings and a social justice perspective of ongoing relevance to policy and practice with young people leaving care.","Kelly, B.; Walsh, C.; Pinkerton, J.; Toal, A.","https://doi.org/10.1108/jcs-05-2021-0022","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal of Childrens Services; ahead-of-print(ahead-of-print):14, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Childrens Services; ahead-of-print(ahead-of-print):14, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21096,""
"Pacific peoples and the pandemic: exploring multiple well-beings of people in tourism-dependent communities","This article aims to examine how the border closures due to Covid-19 have impacted the well-being of Pacific peoples. Many women, men and children living on islands around the South Pacific live in households that depend on tourism income to provide for the majority of their cash needs, thus the pandemic has delivered a devastating financial blow to them. Nevertheless, an online survey combined with interviews in five Pacific countries shows that many people have drawn on their traditional skills combined with cultural systems, social capital and access to customary land to ensure that their well-being is maintained despite major decreases in household income. Others, however, have been more vulnerable, struggling with reductions in their mental health and increases in household conflict, for example. As well as this, the research data reveals that there needs to be a consideration of the spiritual aspect of well-being as something that is of deep importance for Pacific peoples and can provide them with great comfort and support during times of shocks. We will elucidate what can be learned from this in terms of planning for more just, sustainable tourism.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social isolation in older adults with sensory loss","Purpose : Past studies have shown that social isolation and loneliness are risk factors for increasing mortality among older adults. Adults with vision loss and hearing loss are likely to experience greater social isolation and loneliness compared to healthy controls. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person interactions were discouraged due to the risk of infection, public-health messaging and governmental stay-at-home orders. This study was designed to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social interactions and emotional wellbeing in adults with sensory loss. Methods : Three groups of older adults - vision loss (N = 13, legally blind), hearing loss (N = 24, hearing-aid or cochlear-implant users), and controls (N = 18) - were recruited from the Twin Cities Minnesota community (mean age = 68.18, range = 57 to 80). Participants were interviewed every 4 to 6 weeks from the end of April to the end of October using the same set of questions. The initial interview at the end of April included retrospective responses to the questions regarding participants' status at the beginning of March, prior to pandemic restrictions, and the beginning of April, after the onset of pandemic restrictions. The survey questions addressed (1) demographic and health information, (2) average number of in-person and electronic social interactions per week, (3) sense of loneliness, (4) accessibility of daily services such as grocery shopping, (5) mental health, (6) worry levels about COVID infection, and (7) impact on daily activities. Results : There was a significant decline of in-person social interactions in all three groups after the pandemic started, accompanied by a significant increase of electronic social interaction. From late April to October, the number of in-person interactions increased in the control and hearing-loss groups but remained depressed in the vision-loss group. The number of electronic social interactions did not change significantly during this time period. All three groups had worse scores on the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) after the start of the pandemic. Participants with vision loss demonstrated higher worry levels about touching things. Participants with hearing loss worried more about understanding speech from people wearing masks. Conclusions : Our results have shown the widespread impact of the pandemic on social interactions and emotional wellbeing of older adults with sensory loss.","Wu, Y.

"Barriers to health information and health services in COVID-19 for older adults with combined vision and hearing loss","Purpose : Older adults with combined vision and hearing loss (dual sensory loss/DSL) are often sidelined in vision and hearing research, and evidence suggests that they are at a high risk of cognitive impairment, functional decline, social isolation, falls, depression, and mortality. These consequences get exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic due to physical distancing restrictions on mobility and social interactions. Around one million older adults in Canada experience DSL;yet, there is very limited evidence in the Canadian context that could inform pandemic preparedness for this population. Hence, the present study identifies and describes the barriers to health information and health services access for older adults with DSL during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods : We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 11 communitydwelling older adults with DSL (age 62-85 years;7 female) in Montreal between September and December 2020. Diverse remote communication modes and accessible formats were used to obtain consent and interview participants. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were managed using NVivo software and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results : Findings indicate that the central barriers to healthcare information and access are linked to communication breakdown between older adults with DSL and healthcare providers, in addition to the presentation of information through inaccessible formats. Furthermore, healthcare staff rarely have the additional time available that is necessary to interact with the DSL clientele or have the necessary training to accommodate their communication needs. In terms of barriers to accessibility, participants reported that they have difficulty following the 2-meter distance requirements and coloured lines painted on the floor to ensure physical distancing in the healthcare setting. Conclusions : Our results highlight that the pandemic heightened the risk for older adults with DSL because of the systemic and physical barriers to healthcare access for this population. There is a dire need for training of healthcare professionals to accommodate the communication and accessibility needs of older adults living with DSL. Healthcare administrators and policymakers should consider the distinct accessibility and communication needs of this vulnerable population in order to help them age well.","Jaiswal, A.; Boie, N.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults with visual impairments in canada","Purpose : The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on society but has disproportionately affected the disability population. The CNIB COVID-19 Impact Survey was distributed throughout Canada in May 2020 to gather information on the experiences of adults with visual impairments during the pandemic. This cross-sectional study identified key aspects in which those with vision loss have been impacted by the pandemic and associated policies and procedures. Methods : Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS version 22 statistical software. Conventional descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample. Data were crosstabulated by age, age of sight loss onset, severity of sight loss, other disability or health condition, employment status, and education. Results : Approximately half (51%) of the sample had concerns about their healthcare, and just over half (58%) said they did not know where to get tested for SARS-CoV2. Key concerns reported by respondents included: 1. Touching things in public such as elevator panels, self-serve kiosks, or restroom doors to check signage (68% agreed). 2. Due to social distancing, they feel more depressed, sad, and lonely (64% agreed). 3. Because the individual does not drive, they will not be able to get themselves or a family member to a COVID-19 test centre or to a hospital or healthcare facility if they present with severe COVID-19 symptoms (61% agreed). 4. Getting access to accurate and current information about those who may be infected in their area (59% agreed). 5. Concern about accessing emergency medical services (50% agreed). 6. Unsure how to maintain appropriate social distance in public (48% agreed). Conclusions : The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted those with sight loss in many ways and in many different aspects of their lives. This study gave key insights into barriers affecting the societal participation of those with sight loss. While the findings of this study may have evolved over the course of the pandemic, these concerns are important for all levels of policy and advocacy leads to take into account while developing and revising existing policies. This study has provided evidence for the development of new policies and procedures, and the evaluation of existing policies and public health procedures to ensure those with sight loss are not put at an even greater disadvantage during these times and are able to receive the necessary supports.","Gatzios, E.; Sukhai, M.; Forestell, K.; Robbins, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+adults+with+visual+impairments+in+canada","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science; 62(8), 2021.; Publication details: Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science; 62(8), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21104,""
"[Dynamics of psychopathological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia]; Dinamika psikhopatologicheskoi simptomatiki vo vremya pandemii COVID-19 v Rossii","OBJECTIVE: The results of the analysis of psychopathological symptom dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia are presented. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study uses the data of the Internet survey, which included a block of sociodemographic questions and the SCL-90-R symptomatic questionnaire. Nine hundred and eight responses received from 22.03.20 to 22.06.20 were analysed. The change in the responses over time was assessed: 3 periods of time were allocated, associated with the change in countermeasures to the pandemic in Russia. In addition, the change in the values of the SCL-90 parameters was assessed depending on the existence of respondent's acquaintances infected with the coronavirus. RESULTS: It was shown that SCL-90 symptoms (Somatization, Depression, Obsession, all integral parameters, including the Global Severity Index) increased from 22.03.20 to 22.06.20. With infected people appearing in the respondent's environment psychopathological symptoms increase. The growth of hostility, sensitivity and anxiety is associated with a personal experience of a danger of the pandemic, which intensifies when infected persons appear in the immediate environment. CONCLUSION: The increase in psychopathological symptoms after the mitigation or cancellation of the quarantine restrictions suggests the persistence of long-term consequences.","Medvedeva, T I; Enikolopov, S N; Boyko, O M; Vorontsova, O Yu; Kazmina, O Yu","https://dx.doi.org/10.17116/jnevro202112107190","","Country: RU; FEDERAÃ‡ÃƒO RUSSA; RUSSIA; RUSIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova;121(7): 90-95, 2021.; Publication details: Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova;121(7): 90-95, 2021.; COVID-19; Mental Disorders; Anxiety/epidemiology; Depression/epidemiology; Humans; Mental Disorders/epidemiology; Pandemics; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21105,""
"Carer Empowerment Is Key to Reduce Dementia Care Inequalities in the Middle East","Dementia represents a significant problem in the Middle East. Sociocultural and political factors that shape conceptions of health and care tend to stifle research and the dissemination of knowledge throughout the Middle East. These socio-political challenges concerning engagement with individuals living with dementia and their carers include language barriers, stigmatization, logistical constraints, lack of informal support outside of hospitals, and over-dependence on clinicians for dementia information. There is an urgent need in the Middle East to increase care and support for adults with dementia and their carers, enhance research efforts and improve the dissemination of information related to dementia in the region. One possible way to do so is to begin to promote a knowledge-based culture throughout the Middle East. This can be achieved by aligning traditional deterministic and spiritual perspectives of mental health with more Western, scientific, and evidence-based models. We suggest employing practical, multidimensional approaches to deal with the stated challenges, both at individual and societal levels. Doing so will improve knowledge of dementia and allow health and social care systems in the Middle East to begin to address a growing problem.","Javaid, Syed Fahad; Al-Zahmi, Aishah; Abbas, Munir","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084378","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(8)2021 04 20.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(8)2021 04 20.; Caregivers; Dementia; Adult; Dementia/therapy; Humans; Mental Health; Middle East; Social Support; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21106,""
"A Qualitative Study of the Health Perceptions in the Venezuelan Immigrant Population in MedellÃ­n (Colombia) and Its Conditioning Factors","This study explored the general and oral health perceptions in the Venezuelan immigrant population in MedellÃ­n (Colombia) and its conditioning factors. A qualitative study involving Venezuelan immigrants &#8805;18 years with a minimum stay of six months in Colombia was conducted. Dentists, dental students, and other health professionals also participated. Semi-structured interviews (n = 17), focus groups (n = 2), and key informants' interviews (n = 4) were utilized. The interviews and focus groups were recorded and transcribed for later narrative content analysis. A high degree of vulnerability of participants was found due to the precarious living conditions from the premigratory moment and the lack of job placement possibilities at the time of settling in Colombia, where the migratory status played a fundamental role. Among the perceived needs, the mitigation of noncommunicable diseases stood out. Poor mental health symptoms (depression and anxiety) were perceived, and oral health was not a priority. Barriers to accessing health and dental care were found. The migrant condition was found to be a determinant that affected physical, mental, and oral health and the provision of health care. This situation is of interest to the construction of public health policies that guarantee access to fundamental rights.","Murillo-Pedrozo, AndrÃ©s M; MartÃ­nez-Herrera, Eliana; Ronda-PÃ©rez, Elena; Agudelo-SuÃ¡rez, AndrÃ©s A","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18083897","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(8)2021 04 08.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(8)2021 04 08.; Emigrants and Immigrants; Colombia; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Perception; Qualitative Research; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21107,""
"Exploration of Factors Affecting Post-Secondary Students' Stress and Academic Success: Application of the Socio-Ecological Model for Health Promotion","OVERVIEW: There has been an increase in the frequency and severity of stress experienced by Canadian post-secondary students, which has adverse implications on their academic success. This work applied the socio-ecological model for health promotion to explore the contextual factors that influence this relationship at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and public policy levels. METHODS: Using a qualitative, phenomenological approach, we conducted 38 semi-structured interviews with undergraduate students and on-campus staff who provide services to this population at a post-secondary institution in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Thematic analysis inductively identified overarching themes among participants' perspectives. RESULTS: Several positive and negative factors were identified at each socio-ecological model level, demonstrating the complex interplay of demographic, psychological, emotional, social, physical, and academic factors impacting students' academic stress. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of communication and knowledge seems to underlie many factors, highlighting the need to strengthen communication strategies to promote awareness, accessibility, and availability of services and programs on campus. Results also pointed to focusing on proactive, resilience-focused, upstream mental health promotion efforts at post-secondary institutions to reduce stress and improve academic success. This knowledge can help Canadian campuses better address students' needs.","Lisnyj, Konrad T; Pearl, David L; McWhirter, Jennifer E; Papadopoulos, Andrew","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073779","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(7)2021 04 05.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(7)2021 04 05.; Academic Success; Health Promotion; Humans; Knowledge; Ontario; Students; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21108,""
"Examination of Symptoms of Depression among Cooperative Dairy Farmers","Farmers experience a high risk of stress, depression, and suicide. Risk factors are well documented but protective factors are seldom examined. Social support has been reported to reduce psychological distress among the general population but its effect on farmers is inconclusive. Agricultural cooperatives are typically created and owned by farmers to secure markets, access supplies and services, and participate in decision-making. It is unknown whether having cooperative resources impacts symptoms of depression. A survey was used to examine whether having access to cooperative programs and social support impacted symptoms of depression among dairy farmers. Farm bankruptcies, stress, depression, and suicide were identified as ongoing concerns. Having social support and cooperative educational opportunities and mentorship programs were associated with decreased symptoms of depression. Conversely, having cooperative policy discussions was associated with increased symptoms of depression. Results suggest that social support can potentially reduce symptoms of depression among farmers and having access to cooperative resources can reduce or increase it, depending on the type of program. Our findings identified an opportunity to further examine how programs provided by farmer-led organizations such as cooperatives can impact stress, depression, and suicide among farmers.","Liang, Yanni; Wang, Kai; Janssen, Brandi; Casteel, Carri; Nonnenmann, Matthew; Rohlman, Diane S","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073657","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(7)2021 04 01.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(7)2021 04 01.; Farmers; Suicide; Agriculture; Depression/epidemiology; Farms; Humans; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21109,""
"The Role of Occupational Health Services in Psychosocial Risk Management and the Promotion of Mental Health and Well-Being at Work","The development and enhancement of occupational health services (OHS) at the national level is central to ensuring the sustainable health, well-being and work engagement of the working population. However, due to differences in national health, social security and occupational safety and health systems, the content, capacity, coverage and provisions of OHS vary considerably across national contexts. Obtaining a better understanding in terms of such similarities and variations internationally is essential as such comparative information can help inform evidenced-based decision-making on OHS at both policy and practice levels. This paper therefore reviews and analyses the key policies, standards and approaches in OH systems and services, using both academic and grey literature, across 12 industrialised countries (Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Poland, United Kingdom and the United States of America). It provides a detailed overview and categorization of OHS in these selected countries in terms of the legal and policy context, organisation and financing and coverage and staffing while specifically discussing variations aimed at psychosocial risk management and the promotion of mental health and well-being at work. It draws conclusions on key development needs of OHS internationally to ensure psychosocial risk management and mental health promotion are prioritised effectively in a preventive manner.","Jain, Aditya; Hassard, Juliet; Leka, Stavroula; Di Tecco, Cristina; Iavicoli, Sergio","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073632","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(7)2021 03 31.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(7)2021 03 31.; Occupational Health Services; Occupational Health; Australia; Canada; Finland; France; Germany; Humans; Ireland; Italy; Japan; Mental Health; Netherlands; Poland; Risk Management; United Kingdom; United States; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21110,""

"Potential of amentoflavone with antiviral properties in COVID-19 treatment","Amentoflavone is one of the flavonoids that are known for their antiviral effects and many of them are predicted to have inhibitory effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) enzymes 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). Amentoflavone is a biflavonoid found in the herbal extracts of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), Gingko biloba, Selaginella tamariscina, Torreya nucifera, and many other plants. Its pharmacological actions have been listed as antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antidepressant, and neuroprotective. Molecular docking studies have found that amentoflavone binds strongly to the active site of the main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As conventional antiviral medications are met with limited success against coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and vaccines are one of the only weapons against COVID-19 in the pharmaceutical armamentarium, traditional medicines are being considered for the forefront battle against COVID-19. Clinical studies with Hypericum and Gingko extract as additional or alternative drugs/supplements are registered. Here we review the potential of amentoflavone, an active agent in both Hypericum and Gingko extract as an adjunct therapy for COVID-19. Its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and sepsis preventive actions could provide protection against the ""cytokine storm."" Compared with the herbal extracts, which induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) and uridine 5'-diphospho (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) activity producing a negative herb-drug interaction, amentoflavone is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and UGT. Further studies into the therapeutic potential of amentoflavone against the coronavirus infection are warranted.","Singh, A.

"Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Patients: A Feasibility Study","Context Patient-reported outcome tools have historically been limited to fixed questionnaires that are not tailored to an individualâ€™s subjective experience of disease or treatment. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) employs item response theory (IRT) with computer adaptive testing (CAT), which offers the patient an electronic survey with customized questions targeting their primary symptoms or concerns. Objective To assess the efficacy and feasibility of the PROMIS-CAT in patients actively undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to identify common symptoms surrounding transplant with the goal of earlier intervention and improved outcomes. Design Single-arm prospective design. Setting Single academic center in the HSCT inpatient and outpatient setting. Patients Patients consented for HSCT were eligible;13/15 patients enrolled between June 2020 and May 2021;age range 24â€“74 years. Interventions Surveys were prospectively collected on an iPad, which administered and scored the PROMIS-CAT. Survey timepoints were pre-transplant, and 30, 30â€“60, 60â€“90, 180, and 365 days post-transplant. Surveys conducted in person were preferred;however, phone surveys also occurred due to COVID-19 restrictions. Main Outcomes Measured After patients complete the survey, a numeric score is calculated that indicates â€œmild, moderate, or severeâ€ symptoms in the domains of physical function, pain interference, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Upon completion of each survey, patients are asked to rate how easy/difficult their experience was taking the survey, on a scale of 1 (not at all easy) to 5 (very easy). Results Thirteen patients ranging in age from 24â€“74 years completed at least one survey. At interim analysis, 31 surveys were complete. The majority of surveys (29/31) were rated as very easy to complete, taking approximately 7â€“8 minutes. Moderate to severe symptom scores were identified in approximately half of the total surveys (15/31), as follows: physical function (1), depression (5), pain interference (6), fatigue (7), and anxiety (9). Conclusions Electronic data collection via the PROMIS-CAT in HSCT is feasible and can identify important thresholds to signal needed attention to physical function, pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Future use of the PROMIS-CAT could lead to appropriate activation of pathways to provide care to patients surrounding their transplant.","Blackmon, Amanda, Risco, Miguel, Coluzzi, Paul, Nelson, Edward, McKinney, Chelsea, Ciurea, Stefan, Wenzel, Lari","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2152-2650(21)01996-0","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Clinical Lymphoma Myeloma and Leukemia; 21:S448-S449, 2021.; Publication details: Clinical Lymphoma Myeloma and Leukemia; 21:S448-S449, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21115,""
"Robotic Process Automation in purchasing and supply management: A multiple case study on potentials, barriers, and implementation","Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has received growing attention within the digital transformation as this cutting-edge technology automates human behavior and promises high potentials. However, the adoption in purchasing and supply management (PSM) is still in its infancy and has hardly been explored, particularly in the public sector. Based on a multiple case study including 19 organizations of the public and private sector, this paper narrows that gap and presents comprehensive insights into potentials, barriers, suitable processes, and best practices and components for RPA implementation. The findings indicate that adoption depends on the organizationsâ€™ digital procurement readiness and maturity. Application areas of RPA enlarge with increasing experience and range from transactional and operative tasks within the procure-to-pay process to more strategic use cases in sourcing and supply relationship management. Potentials mainly comprise employee reliefs, cost savings, and increased operational efficiency and quality. We uncover multiple technical, organizational, and environmental barriers related to IT infrastructure and human resources, internal communication, financial resources, top management support, organizational structures, supplier-related issues, and government regulations. Furthermore, our study indicates several differences between the private and public sectors for RPA implementation.

"The Relationship between Source and Level of Psychological Distress among Healthcare Workers of Sepang District Health Office during COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic that hit the whole world has had a considerable impact, not only in terms of economic and lifestyle, but mental well-being as well. Being frontliners, healthcare workers are one of the society group that was affected the most, especially in terms of their mental health. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the relationship between stress factors and the level of stress experienced by health workers in the Sepang District Health Office during the outbreak of COVID-19. A total of 94 respondents were involved in this study through non-probability sampling method. The stress factor is evaluated by two components, namely the workload factor and the time management factor. Data analysis found that mean of stress factors due to workload (mean = 3.6902) were higher than time management factors (mean = 3.5436). The stress level of healthcare workers was at a moderate level (mean = 3.1489). The results of correlation analysis found that there is no significant relationship between workload factor with stress level (p = 0.769) and time management factor with stress level (p = 0.530). These insignificant findings can be contributed by several factors, for example the lack number of respondents involved and the sampling method used. Future studies are recommended to be conducted with a larger sampling scale, as well as the assistance and treatment that can be provided to the healthcare frontliners.

"Psychological Well-Being among Singles and Married: A Comparison Study","Studies on psychological well-being are gradually catching attention especially since the outbreak of pandemic Covid-19. Conversely, studies on psychological well-being comparing with single and marries are still scarce. Thus, this study aims to investigate psychological well-being comparing single and married individuals in Lembah Klang. This study specifically took place from December 2019 until February 2020 before Covid 19 pandemic outbreak in Malaysia. This study is apart from a larger study that explores death anxiety. A number of 295 respondents who are single and married with age ranging from 20 years old until 67 years old agreed to take part in this study. The study applies the survey research design using questionnaires. Questionnaires consisted of questions relating to personal background, stressor and psychological well-being (meaning of life, depression, anxiety and stress). In sum, there is a significant difference of psychological well-being (meaning of life, depression, anxiety and stress) between the single and married individuals. On the other hand, findings show that health problems was reported as the highest stressor and followed by work load and financial problems. Findings indicated the importance of considering marital status when understanding issue relating to psychological well-being in future. Hence, future studies should focus on the psychological process that takes place within a close relationship such as marital relationships that brings to psychological well-being of individuals. Besides psychological aspects, health and financial are two personal background aspects that was should also be considered in helping individuals achieve optimum psychological well-being.

"Bavarian outpatient Covid-19 monitor","<h2>Condition:</h2>COVID-19<br><br><h2>Intervention:</h2>Intervention 1: Study participants:<br>Approx. 1,500 people in need of long-term care (care level I-V + positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test) Intervention 2: Control group:<br>Approx. 500 persons in need of care (care grades I-V; negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result, respiratory infection)<br><br>In the control group, too, all surveys and measurement time points are basically carried out in the same way as for the study participants. The stratification criteria of the control group correspond to those of the remaining study participants.<br><br><h2>PrimaryÂ outcome:</h2>The aim of this study is to establish an interdisciplinary outpatient Covid-19 monitor to improve the understanding of the physiological, clinical, psychological and social effects of Covid-19 on people in need of care in Bavaria. These persons in need of care can be understood as ""index participants"" of the monitor, since starting from these persons, the needs and resources of GPs, caring relatives and nursing staff in outpatient and inpatient care are also to be recorded. The monitor thus ultimately also serves the sustainable optimisation of care for those in need of care, the support of GPs, nursing staff and caring relatives during the current pandemic in Bavaria.<br>The Bavarian outpatient Covid-19 monitor is intended to identify physical, psychological and social long-term consequences, as well as care-related supply needs and needs of service providers. This should create a basis for optimising current care for all those affected and contribute to the development and implementation of long-term prevention and aftercare strategies. The monitoring should serve as an empirical data basis for a practicable, efficient and patient-oriented pandemic management for a particularly vulnerable population group. It should enable the derivation of evidence-based recommendations for action.<br><br>Study objectives: <br>a) Recording of clinical factors in patients in need of care during the Covid-19 pandemic<br>Clinical factors such as serostatus, medication, comorbidities, BMI and vaccination status will be examined in the monitor. A brief physical examination with measurement of vital signs is performed by the family doctor or study nurse. In addition, the use of health care, symptoms, complications and diagnoses are used to characterise the course of the disease and stratify the included patients. <br><br>b) Assessment of psychosocial stress and resources among care recipients during the Covid-19 pandemic<br>Due to various factors (isolation, concerns about severe disease progression/about economic situation, general health policy measures to contain the pandemic), the Covid 19 pandemic can cause severe physical and psychosocial stress in people in need of long-term care in different age groups and life situations. In order to recognise these burdens and identify possible protective factors or risk factors, participant questionnaires with validated measurement instruments will be used. Interviews will be conducted to expand and deepen the findings. <br>The psychosocial health status of those in need of care will be assessed with regard to various aspects. These include the generic, health-related quality of life, the degree of frailty, depressiveness, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders. The aim is to identify possible resources and strategies that can contribute to convalescence on the one hand and address the specific care needs of people in need of long-term care for sustainable prevention on the other. <br><br>c) Assessment of the needs of people in need of long-term care during the Covid-19 pandemic<br>As most of the ongoing studies focus on severe disease courses with necessary hospital treatment, little is known about the situation and needs of long-term care patients in outpatient/home and inpatient long-term care. Although people in need of long-term care have a particularly high risk of a severe course of disease, the special medical and nursing needs of this group of people in the different care settings are largely unknown so far. In addition to the mobility and social participation of people in need of care, such an assessment should also include care services already used, health literacy, individual coping strategies, physical function and frailty, medical diagnoses according to ICD-10, care diagnoses and a life course-specific (including geriatric) assessment. Relatives and their perspectives are also included here, depending on the care setting and if further findings are expected. From these findings, it is to be derived which offers are necessary for sustainable prevention in long-term care in order to be able to contribute to an improvement of resilience and resilience so that, in view of the pandemic, an individual, self-determined life and living oriented towards the principle of normality is still possible. <br>Sociodemographic differentiations also play a role in all these dimensions. It is known from medical sociology that coping with illness, dealing with the consequences, and the cognitive and social resources of active shaping of one's own life are all important.<br><br>d) Assessment of the needs of medical and nursing staff and family carers during the Covid-19 pandemic<br>Furthermore, the needs of medical and nursing staff and family carers from the outpatient/home and inpatient care sectors must be characterised. <br>The needs of staff and family carers must be defined in order to be able to cope with the stresses and strains in a situation-appropriate manner and in the long term, and to be able to adequately address possible deficits in good time. This also includes the interfaces between the different groups of actors. Experience shows that in organised settings, the interfaces, the form of division of labour, the flow of information and the question of decision-making authority and routines are the decisive parameters for conflicts or for a smooth process. At the same time, occupational stress situations often have to do not only with the quantity and temporal dimension of tasks, but also with the question of clear distribution of tasks and clear assignment of roles of acting persons.<br><br>Qualitative accompanying study:<br>Actor constellations and monitoring of the Monitor - a qualitative reconstruction:<br><br>The field of long-term care in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic is characterised by a multitude of actors. The constellation of actors is complex, generates interactions and must be managed accordingly. An investigation of this constellation of actors is indispensable for the assessment of the infection process and its control and management. This must be done using qualitative methods. Key actors and players are: <br>- People with long-term care needs <br>- Employees of care institutions<br>- Relatives/friends/caregivers<br>- External medical/therapeutic/pastoral care staff <br>- Managers within the homes and the providers<br>- Persons in public administration/health authorities/ministries<br>- The public<br>A total of up to 60 expert interviews are to be conducted in the form of semi-standardised, guideline-supported interviews, which are primarily aimed at the perspective view of the interfaces of the different actors.

"Prevalence and determinants of tobacco use amongst South African adults with mental illness in the Eastern Cape","Background: Given the physical and mental health consequences of tobacco use amongst individuals with mental illness, it was imperative to assess the burden of tobacco use in this population. Aim: This study examined the patterns and factors associated with tobacco use in individuals attending the outpatient unit. Setting: Cecilia Makiwane Hospital Mental Health Department in Eastern Cape province, South Africa. Methods: Lifetime (ever use) use and current use of any tobacco products were examined in a cross-sectional study of 390 individuals between March and June 2020. A logistic regression was fitted to determine the correlates of lifetime and current use of any tobacco products. Results: The rates of ever use and current use of tobacco products were 59.4% and 44.6%, respectively. Of the participants interviewed, lifetime tobacco use was more prevalent amongst individuals with schizophrenia (67.9%) and cannabis-induced disorders (97.3%) and lower in those with major depressive disorders (36.1%) and bipolar and related disorders (43.5%). Men were six times more likely to have ever used or currently use tobacco products in comparison to women. Also, those who had a salaried job or owned a business were over three times more likely to have ever used or currently use tobacco products compared with those receiving government social grants. Conclusions: The prevalence of tobacco use in this study was significantly higher than the general population in the Eastern Cape. Therefore, smoking prevention and cessation interventions targeted at the general population should target this often neglected sub-population in the region.","Tindimwebwa, Linda K; Ajayi, Anthony I; Adeniyi, Oladele V","https://dx.doi.org/10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v27i0.1637","","Country: ZA; ÃFRICA DO SUL; SOUTH AFRICA; SUDAFRICA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: S Afr J Psychiatr;27: 1637, 2021.; Publication details: S Afr J Psychiatr;27: 1637, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21123,""
"When Cyclodextrins Met Data Science: Unveiling Their Pharmaceutical Applications through Network Science and Text-Mining","We present a data-driven approach to unveil the pharmaceutical technologies of cyclodextrins (CDs) by analyzing a dataset of CD pharmaceutical patents. First, we implemented network science techniques to represent CD patents as a single structure and provide a framework for unsupervised detection of keywords in the patent dataset. Guided by those keywords, we further mined the dataset to examine the patenting trends according to CD-based dosage forms. CD patents formed complex networks, evidencing the supremacy of CDs for solubility enhancement and how this has triggered cutting-edge applications based on or beyond the solubility improvement. The networks exposed the significance of CDs to formulate aqueous solutions, tablets, and powders. Additionally, they highlighted the role of CDs in formulations of anti-inflammatory drugs, cancer therapies, and antiviral strategies. Text-mining showed that the trends in CDs for aqueous solutions, tablets, and powders are going upward. Gels seem to be promising, while patches and fibers are emerging. Cyclodextrins' potential in suspensions and emulsions is yet to be recognized and can become an opportunity area. This is the first unsupervised/supervised data-mining approach aimed at depicting a landscape of CDs to identify trending and emerging technologies and uncover opportunity areas in CD pharmaceutical research.","RincÃ³n-LÃ³pez, Juliana; Almanza-Arjona, Yara C; Riascos, Alejandro P; Rojas-Aguirre, Yareli","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13081297","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pharmaceutics;13(8)2021 Aug 19.; Publication details: Pharmaceutics;13(8)2021 Aug 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21124,""
"Synthesis and Evaluation of the Antidepressant-like Properties of HBK-10, a Novel 2-Methoxyphenylpiperazine Derivative Targeting the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> Receptors","The increasing number of patients reporting depressive symptoms requires the design of new antidepressants with higher efficacy and limited side effects. As our previous research showed, 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine derivatives are promising candidates to fulfill these criteria. In this study, we aimed to synthesize a novel 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine derivative, HBK-10, and investigate its in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile. After assessing the affinity for serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors, and serotonin transporter, we determined intrinsic activity of the compound at the 5-HT1A and D2 receptors. Next, we performed behavioral experiments (forced swim test, tail suspension test) to evaluate the antidepressant-like activity of HBK-10 in naÃ¯ve and corticosterone-treated mice. We also assessed the safety profile of the compound. We showed that HBK-10 bound strongly to 5-HT1A and D2 receptors and presented antagonistic properties at these receptors in the functional assays. HBK-10 displayed the antidepressant-like effect not only in naÃ¯ve animals, but also in the corticosterone-induced mouse depression model, i.e., chronic administration of HBK-10 reversed corticosterone-induced changes in behavior. Moreover, the compound's sedative effect was observed at around 26-fold higher doses than the antidepressant-like ones. Our study showed that HBK-10 displayed a favorable pharmacological profile and may represent an attractive putative treatment candidate for depression.","Salaciak, Kinga; Malikowska-Racia, Natalia; Lustyk, Klaudia; Siwek, Agata; Gluch-Lutwin, Monika; Kazek, Grzegorz; PopiÃ³l, Justyna; Sapa, Jacek; Marona, Henryk; Zelaszczyk, Dorota; Pytka, Karolina","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ph14080744","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pharmaceuticals (Basel);14(8)2021 Jul 29.; Publication details: Pharmaceuticals (Basel);14(8)2021 Jul 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21125,""
"A Systematic Review on TeleMental Health in Youth Mental Health: Focus on Anxiety, Depression and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder","Background and Objectives: The Internet is widely used and disseminated amongst youngsters and many web-based applications may serve to improve mental health care access, particularly in remote and distant sites or in settings where there is a shortage of mental health practitioners. However, in recent years, specific digital psychiatry interventions have been developed and implemented for special populations such as children and adolescents. Materials and Methods: Hereby, we describe the current state-of-the-art in the field of TMH application for young mental health, focusing on recent studies concerning anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and affective disorders. Results: After screening and selection process, a total of 56 studies focusing on TMH applied to youth depression (n = 29), to only youth anxiety (n = 12) or mixed youth anxiety/depression (n = 7) and youth OCD (n = 8) were selected and retrieved.

"Sextech Use as a Potential Mental Health Reprieve: The Role of Anxiety, Depression, and Loneliness in Seeking Sex Online","Depression, anxiety, and loneliness have long been recognized as global mental health concerns. To temporarily relieve psychological distress, self-soothing behavior is common, including engagement in sexual behaviors that are linked to positive mental well-being. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated many mental health ailments alongside physical distancing regulations, we specifically examined online sexual behavior via the use of emergent digital sexual technologies, or sextech. In a 2019 study of 8004 American adults, we assessed whether people experiencing higher anxiety, depression, and/or loneliness were more likely to engage in sextech use. Furthermore, we examined whether anxiety or depression mediated the association between loneliness and sextech use, as loneliness is one contributor to anxiety and depression. People with higher anxiety and depression were more likely to engage in sextech. However, those who were more lonely were less likely to engage with sextech, suggesting the aforementioned patterns were not due to lack of social connection. Our findings suggest people with mental health struggles may be drawn to interactive, digital forms of sexual behavior as a means of alleviating symptoms through distraction or self-soothing. This insight offers an important pathway for expanding the scope of mental health interventions, particularly as technology becomes increasingly prevalent and accessible in everyday life.","Marcotte, Alexandra S; Kaufman, Ellen M; Campbell, Jessica T; Reynolds, Tania A; Garcia, Justin R; Gesselman, Amanda N","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178924","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 08 25.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 08 25.; COVID-19; Loneliness; Adult; Anxiety/epidemiology; Depression/epidemiology; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Sexual Behavior; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21127,""
"The Effectiveness and Safety of Mind-Body Modalities for Mental Health of Nurses in Hospital Setting: A Systematic Review","The mental health of nurses including burnout is an important issue. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate whether mind-body modalities improve burnout and other mental health aspects of nurses. A comprehensive search was conducted using six electronic databases. Randomized controlled trials using mind-body modalities on the mental health of nurses, up to January 2021, were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Seventeen studies were included in the review. Data on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and yoga were available for burnout, and there was no evidence that multimodal resilience programs including MBIs statistically significantly improved burnout levels compared to no intervention or active control groups. However, one study reported that yoga could significantly improve emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, which are subscales of burnout, compared to usual care. In addition, the effects of MBIs, relaxation, yoga, and music on various mental health outcomes and stress-related symptoms have been reported.

"The Development of a Health Promotion Program for Unmarried Mothers Living in Residential Facilities Using Urban Forests: An Intervention Mapping Approach Based on the Transtheoretical Model","Unmarried mothers living in residential facilities (UMLFs) in Korea face complex and challenging physical, psychological, and socioeconomic issues. This study developed a physical and mental health promotion program using urban forests for UMLFs based on the transtheoretical model and evidence. We utilized an intervention mapping approach (IMA) and assessed the needs of UMLFs by analyzing previous quantitative studies. Moreover, we conducted a qualitative hermeneutic phenomenological study involving nine participants. Based on the needs assessment, important and changeable determinants were identified; further, the program performance and change objectives were classified to achieve the program goals and establish the intervention strategy. We found that physical activity using forests, self-reflection using metaphors, five-sense activities, achievement activities using natural objects, building interpersonal relationships in the forest, and designing future plans, are desirable methods for improving the health of UMLFs. The IMA was deemed appropriate for the systematic development of health promotion programs for UMLFs through clear links among change objectives, theoretical methods, and practice strategies. These results should be applied to future intervention studies.","Bang, Kyung-Sook; Kim, Sungjae; Lee, Gumhee; Choi, Sinyoung; Shin, Da-Ae; Kim, Misook","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168684","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(16)2021 08 17.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(16)2021 08 17.; Illegitimacy; Transtheoretical Model; Forests; Health Promotion; Humans; Residential Facilities; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21129,""
"Effects of Financial Expenditure of Prefectures/Municipalities on Regional Suicide Mortality in Japan","In Japan, suicide mortality has been improving from 2009; however, suicide remains one of the leading causes of death. Although previous studies identified solid relationships between governmental financial support for social welfare systems and suicide mortality, little attention is paid to how specific regional policies, designed according to regional cultural, economic, and social welfare situations, affect suicide mortality. Therefore, the present study analyses the relationships between the regional governmental expenditure of six major divisions and suicide mortality across the 47 prefectures in Japan from 2009 to 2018 using fixed-effect analysis of hierarchal linear regression with robust standard error. The expenditure in ""public health"", ""police"", ""ambulance/fire services"", ""welfare"" and ""education"" is associated with reduction in suicide mortality, at least in some statistical indicators, whereas expenditure of ""public works"" indicated the influence of increasing suicide mortality or had no effect. Welfare expenditure was the most predominantly effective among the six major divisions of regional governmental expenditure. In the welfare subdivisions, expenditure of ""child welfare"" and ""social welfare"" was effective in a reduction in suicide mortality, but expenditure of ""elderly welfare"" surprisingly contributed to increasing suicide mortality. Child welfare expenditure negatively impacted suicide mortality in wide-ranging generations of both males and females; the positive effects of elderly welfare expenditure reached were limited as working-age populations increased, but unexpectedly did not affect the suicide mortality of elderly populations. The relatively increasing expenditure of elderly welfare with the relatively decreasing child welfare are unavoidable due to the Japanese social issues associated with a declining birth rate and ageing population. Furthermore, the budget of that regional government that can modify its expenditure structure by making its own policies is limited since most regional governmental expenditure is composed of essential expenditure for maintaining and operating regional social welfare systems. Although severe social situations in Japan are still unoptimised, the present results suggest that scientific-evidence-based redistributions of welfare expenditure in regional governments can at least partially improve Japanese society and welfare systems.","Shiroyama, Takashi; Fukuyama, Kouji; Okada, Motohiro","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168639","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(16)2021 08 16.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(16)2021 08 16.; Health Expenditures; Suicide; Aged; Aging; Cities; Female; Humans; Japan/epidemiology; Male; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21130,""
"Development Work in Healthcare: What Supportive and Deterrent Factors Do Employees Working in a Hospital Department Experience in an Improved Work Environment?","Work-related mental health issues, accounting for high worker absenteeism in the world's developed economies, are increasing, with the main cause being workplace conditions. The health services sector is especially experiencing great problems with this, because of challenging psychosocial working conditions. The aim of this study was to explore employees' experiences of development work with a focus on the work environment within a hospital department with an outspoken special development assignment. The special assignment was decided by the highest management at the hospital and concerned work environment, caring processes, and ways of organizing the work. Eleven employees completed two individually semi-structured interviews, approximately 7 and 13 months after the start of the special assignment at the department. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The results reveal that both internal and external aspects influence the development work and highlight the importance of viewing the local development work in relation to how the rest of the organization functions. Important factors and conditions for a supportive and change-friendly work culture are discussed, as well as the need to plan for integration and change to create conditions for successful implementation of the results from organizational development and change initiatives.","PerÃ¤, Susanna; Hellman, Therese; Molin, Fredrik; Svartengren, Magnus","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168394","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(16)2021 08 08.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(16)2021 08 08.; Absenteeism; Workplace; Delivery of Health Care; Hospital Departments; Organizations; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21131,""
"Emotional states and coping methods in nursing and non-nursing students responding to COVID-19: a cross-sectional study in China","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the emotion, coping strategy, dealing methods and their correlation in the COVID-19 outbreak among nursing and non-nursing students. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional online survey. PARTICIPANTS: Full-time nursing and non-nursing undergraduate students. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to determine the emotional status in the COVID-19 pandemic among nursing and non-nursing students. Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) was used to measure the emotion regulation strategies and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) was used to evaluate the coping methods among nursing and non-nursing students. RESULTS: In total, 746 students including 366 nursing students and 380 non-nursing students participated in the survey. Compared with the non-nursing students, a significant decrease was noticed in GAD-7 score (p<0.01) and PHQ-9 (p<0.01) in the nursing students. The cognition re-evaluation score in the nursing students was significantly lower than that of the non-nursing students (p<0.05). In the nursing students, the score of anxiety was positively correlated with ERQ expression inhibition (p<0.01) and SCSQ negative coping (p<0.01), while the score of depression was also positively correlated with ERQ expression inhibition (p<0.01) and SCSQ negative coping (p<0.01). There was a negative correlation between SCSQ and the scores of anxiety (p<0.05) and depression (p<0.05). In the non-nursing students, the anxiety score was positively correlated with the SCSQ negative coping (p<0.01), while the depression score was positively correlated with the ERQ expression inhibition (p<0.01) and SCSQ negative coping (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affected the emotional status of nursing and non-nursing students. The emotional status was correlated with the emotional regulation and coping methods. Staff involved in the nursing professionals should pay attention to the psychological status of the nursing and non-nursing students, and give moderate psychological interference in the presence of COVID-19.","Miao, Qunfang; Xie, Lin; Xing, Bingyu; Wang, Xiaolei; Tang, Shiming; Luo, Hong","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054007","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(8): e054007, 2021 08 26.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(8): e054007, 2021 08 26.; COVID-19; Students, Nursing; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emotions; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21132,""

Healthcare professionals that are involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients diagnosed with coronavirus have been under a heavy burden both physically and psychologically during the fight against this disease. Articles published on protecting the mental health of healthcare professionals during the epidemic have stated that healthcare professionals should be supported to prevent the negative effects of the epidemic on them. This new situation requires developing appropriate strategies for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the given heavy burden by healthcare professionals. Therefore, the determination of effective approaches for the protection of mental health of healthcare professionals and increasing their protective factors, such as psychological resilience, has got great importance. Positive religious coping contents can be seen among the protective factors that affect the psychological resilience of healthcare professionals. Positive religious coping behaviors, such as refuge in Allah, praying, and reading Qur'an, not only provides a spiritual strength against the troubles of life but also provides a sense of control, peace, and security. This research aims to examine the relationship between religious coping and psychological resilience in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ethical approval for this research was obtained from AtatÃ¼rk University Social and Human Science Ethics Committee (12.04.2021 dated and 88656144000.E.2100103436 numbered). Descriptive research and correlational methods were used in the study. The population of the research consists of personnel working in health facilities operating throughout the country. The sample consists of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, midwives, and other health workers working in these health institutions. The Snowball sampling method was used in this study. For this aim, a Google Forms was established and 293 health workers in more than 40 provinces have filled this form. Personal Information Form, Religious Coping Scale, and Brief Psychological Resilience Scale were used as data collection tools. These data collection tools were used to determine whether positive and negative religious coping and psychological resilience differs according to gender and age. In addition to the above-mentioned aim, the relationship between positive and negative religious coping and resilience was examined in this study. T-test and ANOVA were applied in the analysis of demographic variables. Correlation and regression analysis were used to test the relationship between the variables. Findings obtained from this study have revealed that the levels of religious coping and psychological resilience of healthcare professionals differ according to their demographic characteristics. Results have shown that while there is no significant difference between women and men in terms of using positive religious coping methods, men use negative religious coping methods more frequently than women. Results have also revealed that positive coping methods are used more frequently as age increases and psychological resilience increased with age. Correlation analysis has shown that there is a significant relationship between positive religious coping and psychological resilience. Results of regression analysis have shown that positive religious coping is a significant redictor of psychological resilience. This result shows that positive religious coping is an important variable that affects psychological resilience. Results have suggested that there is a need to develop a program with religious/spiritual content that can help healthcare professionals to overcome this difficult process more easily by increasing their psychological resilience. Results obtained from this study may not only contribute to other rehabilitative studies that can be carried out for healthcare professionals during and after the pandemic but also provide scientific data for possible academic studies on this subject.","Angin, Yasemin","https://www.google.com/search?q=Covid-19+Pandemi+SÃ¼recinden+GeÃ§erken+Saglik+Ã‡alisanlarinda+Dini+Basa+Ã‡ikma+ve+Psikolojik+Saglamlik+Iliskisi+&Uuml;zerine+Bir+Arastirma","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Cumhuriyet Ilahiyat Dergisi; 25(1):331-345, 2021.; Publication details: Cumhuriyet Ilahiyat Dergisi; 25(1):331-345, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21136,""
"When High-Realism and Cost-Effectiveness Meet: Simulating Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation","Simulators for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are generally haunted by bulky devices and low-fidelity methodologies. Ongoing efforts optimizing modern solutions for such issues, focusing on minimizing expenses and blending training with the intensive care unit. This is particularly evident, following the Coronavirus pandemic, where economical resources are extensively cut. Upon reviewing the state-ofthe- A rt and developing a strong collaboration with Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Qatar's leading provider of healthcare, requirements have been established for the development upon the cutting-edge. This work introduces a high-realism, cost-effective simulator for ECMO for adult patients. Specifically, the system's core relies on a thermochromic module that simulates blood color changes through an innovative reversible technology. On top, multiple simulation modules are developed, including bleeding, line chattering, air bubbles noise, and more. Furthermore, wireless technology enables teachers to orchestrate the teaching process via a custom developed tablet application. It also enables both creative and standardized simulation scenario modeling via an intuitive interface. Currently, a high-fidelity, product-level prototype is in the final stages of development (Figure 1). In a questionnaire-based study conducted in 2017 at HMC, nineteen specialists classified the efficiency of the simulator as highly realistic during an interactive demonstration. A second study is planned to be performed to assess the educational effectiveness of the simulator as a complete ECMO simulation toolbox that meets strict budget constraints and yet satisfies high pedagogical standards.

"Assessment of psychological distress among the general public in saudi arabia during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its preventative measures have disrupted peopleâ€™s day-to-day lives and jobs and consequently had an impact on their health and well-being. Studies have revealed high levels of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. AIM: The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of psychological distress among the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, it aimed to determine the characteristics of highly susceptible population. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study using an online self-administered questionnaire gathering sociodemographic information and using the Kessler scale, which measures psychological distress. A total of 1058 people agreed to participate in the study and completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: The study findings showed that 48.6% (n = 514) of the studyâ€™s respondents were psychologically distressed, that is, either in the high or very high distress category. Significantly higher ratings of psychological distress were observed among female participants, younger adults, those who self-reported poor health status, single persons, students, and individuals with caring responsibilities, and those who have no access to a private outdoor space. This distress was also found among those who have been in close or indirect contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection, p &lt; 0.05. CONCLUSION: Psychological distress has been widely prevalent among the general public in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Egyptian and Roma Adolescents' Perspectives on Their Developmental Assets in Albania During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This mixed-method study explores the accessibility of developmental assets among Egyptian and Roma minority youth in Albania during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six focus groups were conducted in August 2020 with Egyptian (nÂ =Â 16) and Roma (nÂ =Â 15) adolescents (14-20Â years, Mage Â =Â 16.71; SDage Â =Â 2.00; 14 girls and 17 boys). In addition, adolescents rated how much they experienced each developmental asset. Descriptive and thematic analyses highlighted: (1) low developmental assets and barriers to accessing resources, (2) mental health concerns and coping strategies, (3) the role of proximal contexts of life, and (4) experiences within the society in terms of discrimination, integration, and contribution to society.

"Triple Therapy for Cystic Fibrosis <i>Phe508del</i>-Gating and -Residual Function Genotypes","BACKGROUND: Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor is a small-molecule cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator regimen shown to be efficacious in patients with at least one Phe508del allele, which indicates that this combination can modulate a single Phe508del allele. In patients whose other CFTR allele contains a gating or residual function mutation that is already effectively treated with previous CFTR modulators (ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor), the potential for additional benefit from restoring Phe508del CFTR protein function is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial involving patients 12 years of age or older with cystic fibrosis and Phe508del-gating or Phe508del-residual function genotypes. After a 4-week run-in period with ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor, patients were randomly assigned to receive elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor or active control for 8 weeks. The primary end point was the absolute change in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline through week 8 in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group. RESULTS: After the run-in period, 132 patients received elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor and 126 received active control. Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor resulted in a percentage of predicted FEV1 that was higher by 3.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8 to 4.6) relative to baseline and higher by 3.5 percentage points (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.7) relative to active control and a sweat chloride concentration that was lower by 22.3 mmol per liter (95% CI, 20.2 to 24.5) relative to baseline and lower by 23.1 mmol per liter (95% CI, 20.1 to 26.1) relative to active control (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The change from baseline in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain score (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life) with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was 10.3 points (95% CI, 8.0 to 12.7) and with active control was 1.6 points (95% CI, -0.8 to 4.1). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups; adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in one patient (elevated aminotransferase level) in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group and in two patients (anxiety or depression and pulmonary exacerbation) in the active control group. CONCLUSIONS: Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was efficacious and safe in patients with Phe508del-gating or Phe508del-residual function genotypes and conferred additional benefit relative to previous CFTR modulators.

"Six-Month Quality of Life in COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit Survivors","OBJECTIVES: Because there is increasing evidence of serious deterioration in long-term quality of life (QoL) in coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) intensive care unit (ICU) survivors, the authors identified predictors of poor quality of life in these patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Research hospital repurposed into a COVID-19 center. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients admitted in COVID-19 ICUs between March and June 2020. INTERVENTIONS: An SF-36 questionnaire, which included physical and mental items, was used six months after patient's discharge. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 403 patients were managed in the ICU, with a hospital mortality of 181 of 403 (44.9%), and 16 (4.0%) patients died within six months. Among the 125 questionnaire responders, only 32.0% and 52% had a normal quality of life in terms of the physical and mental component of health. Multivariate analysis identified low-molecular-weight heparin treatment in the ICU as the only modifiable factor associated with an increase in physical component of QoL odds ratio (OR) 3.341 (95% confidence interval 1.298-8.599), pÂ =Â 0.012, and age &#8805;52 years OR 0.223 and female sex OR 0.321 were significantly associated with a decrease in the physical component. Medical history of cerebrovascular insufficiency was significantly associated with a decrease in mental component of QoL OR 0.125, and the only factor associated with an increase in the mental health component was body mass index &#8805;27.6 kg/m2 OR 7.466. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 ICU survivors the authors identified treatment with low- molecular-weight heparin as a predictor of improved physical component of QoL at 6 months.","Likhvantsev, Valery; Landoni, Giovanni; Perekhodov, Sergey; Chaus, Nikolay; Kadantseva, Kristina; Ermokhina, Lyubov; Baeva, Anastasia; Yadgarov, Mikhail; Berikashvili, Levan; Kuzovlev, Artem; Grechko, Andrey","https://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2021.08.036","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth;2021 Aug 28.; Publication details: J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth;2021 Aug 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21145,""
"From Florence to fossil fuels: Nursing has always been about environmental health","BACKGROUND: Since its founding, professional nursing has applied an environmental lens to healing. METHODS: This CANS 2020 Keynote article describes the history of nursing environmental science and nurses important contributions to the US Environmental Justice Movement. Starting with Florence Nightingale's Notes on Nursing, which established Environmental Theory, the paper introduces key figures throughout nursing history who have studied and advocated for environmental health and justice. FINDINGS: The paper emphasizes that nursing has always been about environmental health and that, regardless of specialty or practice setting, all nurses are called to incorporate environmental science and translation into their research and practice.

"Continued influence of misinformation in times of COVID-19","Health-related misinformation, especially in times of a global health crisis, can have severe negative consequences on public health. In the current studies, we investigated the persuasive impact of COVID-19-related misinformation, and whether the valence of the misinformation and recipients' degree of overconfidence affect this impact. In two pre-registered experimental studies, participants (NÂ =Â 403; NÂ =Â 437) were exposed to either a positive or a negative news article describing a fictional hospital's high COVID-19 recovery/mortality rates. Half of the participants subsequently received a correction. Attitudes towards the hospital were measured before and after exposure. Results of both studies showed that, as expected, corrections reduced the persuasive impact of misinformation. But whereas some persuasive impact remained for corrected negative misinformation (a continued influence effect), it reversed for corrected positive information, causing people to have more negative attitudes towards the hospital than before exposure to any information (a backfire effect). These results corroborate prior suggestions that continued influence effects are asymmetric: negative misinformation is harder to neutralise than positive misinformation. Participants' overconfidence degrees did not have a moderating role in misinformation effects. Even though corrections decrease the persuasive impact of health-related misinformation, continued influence remains for negative misinformation.","van Huijstee, Dian; Vermeulen, Ivar; Kerkhof, Peter; Droog, Ellen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12805","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Psychol;2021 Aug 26.; Publication details: Int J Psychol;2021 Aug 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21147,""
"Quality of life among undergraduate university students during COVID-19 movement control order in Sarawak","Background and Aims: This study aimed to examine the quality of life (QoL) and health satisfaction of undergraduate university students in Sarawak during MCO and its association with socio-demographic profiles. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, QoL and satisfaction of health of 503 undergraduate university students (63.4% females) from a public university was assessed online using the World Health Organization QoL (WHOQOL)-BREF instrument. Results: The overall QoL and satisfaction with health were 3.7Â Â± 0.87 and 3.9Â Â± 0.82, respectively. Male students showed significantly lower mean scores for the environmental domains than female students (63.37 Â± 16.21 vs 68.10Â Â± 14.00, PÂ < .01). Students who lived inside the campus (vs outside campus) showed significantly lower mean score for the physical health (61.49 Â± 13.94 vs 67.23 Â± 13.93, PÂ < .01), environmental health (58.35 Â± 15.07 vs 70.49 Â± 13.21, PÂ < .01), overall QoL (3.39 Â± 0.90 vs 3.84 Â± 0.83, PÂ < .01), and satisfaction with health (3.71 Â± 0.90 vs 3.97 Â± 0.77, PÂ < .01). Students with parent's income below RM5000 (vs parent's income more than RM5000) had significantly lower mean score for the environmental domain (65.06 Â± 14.35 vs 68.20 Â± 15.74, PÂ < .05). Others ethnicity scored significantly lower than Bumiputera Sarawak and Malay while Bumiputera Sarawak scored significantly lower than Chinese in physical health domain (MalayÂ =Â 65.73 Â± 13.40, ChineseÂ =Â 63.24 Â± 15.35, Bumiputra SarawakÂ =Â 67.35 Â± 13.30, OthersÂ =Â 60.84 Â± 15.88, PÂ < .05). Malay (69.99 Â± 15.20) scored significantly higher than other ethnicities (ChineseÂ =Â 63.58 Â± 15.80; Bumiputera MalaysiaÂ =Â 65.23 Â± 13.66; othersÂ =Â 63.98 Â± 15.59) in environmental domain (PÂ < .01).

"Mental Health of Apprentices during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Austria and the Effect of Gender, Migration Background, and Work Situation","This study assessed the mental health of apprentices during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria and the effect of gender, migration background, work situation, and work sector. An online survey via REDCap was performed with a sample of 1442 apprentices (female: 53.5%, male: 45.4%, diverse: 1.1%, migration background: 28.4%) from 29 March to 18 May 2021. Indicators of mental health were depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), well-being (WHO-5), disordered eating (EAT-8), and insomnia (ISI-7). There was a high prevalence of clinically relevant depression (cut-offs &#8805;11 for adolescents, &#8805;10 for adults: 48.3%), anxiety (cut-offs &#8805;11 for adolescents, &#8805;10 for adults: 35.4%), insomnia (cut-off &#8805;15: 27%), and disordered eating (cut-offs &#8805;2 for men, &#8805;3 for women: 50.6%). Linear models revealed that apprentices with female and diverse gender, migration background, and unemployed status showed the poorest scores on all mental health measures (all p-values < 0.05) except disordered eating. These findings emphasize the need for intersectional strategies to reduce and prevent adverse mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for apprentices.","Dale, Rachel; O'Rourke, Teresa; Humer, Elke; Jesser, Andrea; Plener, Paul L; Pieh, Christoph","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178933","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 08 25.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(17)2021 08 25.; COVID-19; Pandemics; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety/epidemiology; Austria/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21149,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic: Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Levels Highest amongst Indigenous Peoples in Alberta","This study explores differences in stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by different ethnic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a cross-sectional online survey of subscribers of the COVID-19 Text4Hope text messaging program in Alberta. Stress, anxiety, and depression were measured among Caucasian, Indigenous, Asian, and other ethnic groups using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)-10, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 scales, respectively. The burden of depression and stress were significantly higher in Indigenous populations than in both Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups. The mean difference between Indigenous and Caucasian for PHQ-9 scores was 1.79, 95% CI of 0.74 to 2.84, p < 0.01 and for PSS-10 it was 1.92, 95% CI of 0.86 to 2.98, p < 0.01). The mean difference between Indigenous and Asian for PHQ-9 scores was 1.76, 95% CI of 0.34 to 3.19, p = 0.01 and for PSS-10 it was 2.02, 95% CI of 0.63 to 3.41, p < 0.01. However, Indigenous participant burden of anxiety was only significantly higher than Asian participants' (mean difference for GAD-7 was 1.91, 95% CI of 0.65 to 3.18, p < 0.01). Indigenous people in Alberta have higher burden of mental illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Specifically, individuals with a pre-existing mental health disorder seem more impaired by lockdown measures posing as major stress factors. Medical rehabilitation treatment can help people cope with these stressors. The internet and digital apps provide a platform to contribute to regular treatment and to conduct research on this topic. OBJECTIVE: Making use of internet-based assessments, this study investigated individuals from the general population and patients from medical, psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics. Levels of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, common COVID-19-related worries, and the intention to use digital apps were compared. Furthermore, we investigated whether participating in internet-delivered digital trainings prior to and during patients' rehabilitation stay, as well as the perceived usefulness of digital trainings, were associated with improved mental health after rehabilitation. METHODS: A large-scale, online, cross-sectional study was conducted among a study sample taken from the general population (N=1812) in Germany from May 2020 to April 2021. Further, a longitudinal study was conducted making use of the internet among a second study sample of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients at two measurement time points-before (N=1719) and after (n=738) rehabilitation-between July 2020 and April 2021. Validated questionnaires and adapted items were used to assess mental health and COVID-19-related worries. Digital trainings were evaluated. Propensity score matching, multivariate analyses of covariance, an exploratory factor analysis, and hierarchical regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Patients from the psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics reported increased symptoms with regard to depression, anxiety, loneliness, and stress (F4,2028=183.74, P<.001, ÃŽÂ·2p=0.27) compared to the general population. Patients perceived greater satisfaction in communication with health care professionals (F1,837=31.67, P<.001, ÃŽÂ·2p=0.04), had lower financial worries (F1,837=38.96, P<.001, ÃŽÂ·2p=0.04), but had higher household-related worries (F1,837=5.34, P=.02, ÃŽÂ·2p=0.01) compared to the general population. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived stress were lower postrehabilitation (F1,712=23.21, P<.001, ÃŽÂ·2p=0.04) than prior to rehabilitation. Psychosomatic patients reported a higher intention to use common apps and digital trainings (F3,2021=51.41, P<.001, ÃŽÂ·2p=0.07) than the general population. With regard to digital trainings offered prior to and during the rehabilitation stay, the perceived usefulness of digital trainings on rehabilitation goals was associated with decreased symptoms of depression (ÃŸ=-.14, P<.001), anxiety (ÃŸ=-.12, P<.001), loneliness (ÃŸ=-.18, P<.001), and stress postrehabilitation (ÃŸ=-.19, P<.001). Participation in digital group therapy for depression was associated with an overall change in depression (F1,725=4.82, P=.03, ÃŽÂ·2p=0.01) and anxiety (F1,725=6.22, P=.01, ÃŽÂ·2p=0.01) from pre- to postrehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: This study validated the increased mental health constraints of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients in comparison to the general population and the effects of rehabilitation treatment. Digital rehabilitation components are promising tools that could prepare patients for their rehabilitation stay, could integrate well with face-to-face therapy during rehabilitation treatment, and could support aftercare.

"Emotional fatigue in anesthesiologists, as a factor associated with Burnout syndrome due to Covid-19","Work demands often generate symptoms ranging from irritability to depression, accompanied by physical and mental exhaustion, representing these the first symptoms of Burnout syndrome (BS) or chronic work stress. Among the circumstances that anesthesiologists must face during their performance, their long and delicate working hours stand out, to which today is added the demand for extreme biosafety measures that they must have as a result of Covid-19 and the fear of contagion during their operations, which increase their levels of stress and job helplessness. In this article, under a descriptive, documentary methodology, emotional fatigue in anesthesiologists will be described as a factor associated with chronic work stress or Burnout syndrome due to Covid-19, based on the foundations of the origin of the term Burnout introduced by Freudenberger in 1974 and Maslach and Jackson's research from 1982 to the results of current research published in high-impact peer-reviewed journals on the subject studied, such as those of Arayago Iriarte, et al., (2016), Rodriguez Paipilla, et al., (2011), Tobie-Gutierrez and Nava-Lopez (2012), among others. Concluding that emotional exhaustion (CE) constitutes a key factor for the prevalence of Burnout syndrome (SB), manifested through the progressive loss of energy, physical and mental wear and tear;caused by the continuous presence of these signs, without being diagnosed or treated efficiently.","Padron, N.

"Trends of emergency calls during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic in nur-sultan","BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus infection (coronavirus disease [COVID]-19) has become a serious obstacle on the health-care systems in Kazakhstan, as well as throughout the world. Certainly, the extent of emergency medical services (EMSs) use at some stage within the COVID-19 pandemic has been increased. However, the impact on the use of EMS in Kazakhstan during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been studied. AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze the dynamics of changes in the number of emergency medical calls during the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on the time of year, day of the week, and the causes for the calls. METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated the Nur-Sultan (capital of Kazakhstan) EMS data for the period after the pandemic was first seen in Kazakhstan. The necessary permissions for the study were obtained from the Nur-Sultan City Public Health Department. EMS data for the same time interval (February 1â€“May 1) in the past 3 years (2018, 2019, and 2020) were compared. The data were taken from the database of the automated control system â€œKomek 103,â€ which is used in the ambulance station since the end of 2019, and the automated dispatch information systems â€œADISâ€ used by the ambulance station in Nur-Sultan. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, EMS call rates had been maximum common on Mondays and Thursdays by 13, 75%. The evaluation suggests that the quantity of male sufferers extended by 14, 05% in the course of the pandemic length, as compared to the pre-pandemic length. The quantity of patients with inside the 65+ age group in the course of the pandemic length has extended by 31.5%. During the pandemic, the signs and symptoms of fever enlarged significantly by 83%. Moreover, suicides elevated by 61% during the pandemic period. During the COVID<U+2610>19 pandemic, using EMS particularly for time touchy illnesses, which include hypertension (-31%), surgical emergencies (acute abdomen) (-40%), cerebrovascular illnesses (-11%), and other heart illnesses (-29%) decreased. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic period, there was an increase in the calls from male patients, compared to the pre-pandemic period. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, EMS call rates had been increased on Mondays and Thursdays. We found an alteration with inside the sample of obtained calls. Furthermore, the quantity of patients with inside the 65+ age group in the course of the pandemic length has extended.

"Meeting the Mental Health Needs of College Student-Mothers during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is the deadliest public health emergency in the twenty-first century. To mitigate the rapid spread of the virus, institutions around the globe, including higher education, instituted infection control measures such as social distancing and restricted movements with virtual/remote work and learning environments. These changes, including the pandemic-related stressors, are associated with poor mental health among college students. However, student-mothers may encounter an aggravated psychological impact of the pandemic because of their competing and challenging intersecting roles. Multipronged strategies and targeted-mental health services that consider the needs of student-mothers, their children, and families are encouraged to mitigate the pandemicâ€™s impact. Doing so has important implications for public health, policy, and research.","Ajayi, Kobi V.","https://doi.org/10.3390/women1030013","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Women; 1(3):137-142, 2021.; Publication details: Women; 1(3):137-142, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21155,""
"Exploring Returnee Migrant Women, COVID-19 and Sustainability in Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has signified an historical change in human mobility. By transforming the patterns of people on the move, it has highlighted gender-based inequalities and womenâ€™s vulnerabilities. The link between COVID-19 and return migration shapes returneesâ€™ readaptation process in their home countries, as returnees are embedded in a limbo between the pandemicâ€™s pressure on the policy and socio-economic setting, on one hand, and their efforts for reintegration, on the other. Due to the pandemic, the gender-based imbalance has increased existing gender gaps both in migration and return, exacerbating womenâ€™s vulnerability. Thus, personal aspirations and professional expectations of highly educated women are caught in a system of socio-economic and geographical (im)mobility, which represents the principal outcome in their relocation and readaptation process. Based on a qualitative methodology through the analysis of ten life histories of highly educated returnee migrant women, this paper sheds light on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their migratory trajectories, providing a typology of them. Findings stress the necessity for more sustainable measures and resources for lifeâ€“work balance and gender-sensitive policies, to promote a better integration process into the local labour market;to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on returnee women, and to prevent the proliferation of mental health problems among returnee women.","Di Martino, Maria Luisa","https://doi.org/10.3390/su13179653","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(17):9653, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(17):9653, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21156,""
"Self-Compassion and Social Connectedness as Predictors of â€œPeace and Meaningâ€ during Spainâ€™s Initial COVID-19 Lockdown","The COVID-19 lockdown has had a massive psychological impact on mental health in the general population, with increases in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Spiritual well-being, specifically peace and meaning, has already been identified as one of the main protective factors for these disorders in the COVID-19 context. The aim of the present study is to identify facilitating elements for peace and meaning during the COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. Online surveys were used to obtain data from a sample of 3480 Spanish people. Self-compassion and social support were positively related with peace and meaning, while loneliness and perceived discrimination were negatively related. The model for peace and meaning was statistically significant, explaining 47% of the variance. The significant variables were self-kindness, family support, mindfulness, and sense of belonging having a positive association and loneliness a negative one.","Saiz, JesÃºs, AusÃ­n, Berta, GonzÃ¡lez-Sanguino, Clara, Castellanos, Miguel Ãngel, Salazar, MarÃ­a, Marin, Carolina, LÃ³pez-GÃ³mez, AÃ­da, Ugidos, Carolina, MuÃ±oz, Manuel","https://doi.org/10.3390/rel12090683","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Religions; 12(9):683, 2021.; Publication details: Religions; 12(9):683, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21157,""
"The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Remote Learning in Higher Education","Stressful events can cause a significant impact on education;however, it is not yet clear how the interplay between anxiety, work, and social dysfunction relates to learning impairments. In this study, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on studentsâ€™ learning and mental health. This study was conducted during four modules of a remote Psychopharmacology course between 5 October and 20 December 2020. We collected data from 28 Psychology undergraduate students at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. We used pre- and post-test multiple-choice questions to obtain a quantitative measure of learning. Students completed an online survey to report demographic information, functional impairment (Work and Social Adjustment scale;WSAS), generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale;GAD-7), coronavirus anxiety (Brazilian adapted version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale;CAS-BR), and self-perception with the remote lecturesâ€™ methodology. In our sample, 42.9% of respondents experienced symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders (GAD-7 = 15), and 53.6% had moderate to severe functional impairment (WSAS &gt;20). We also observed an overlapping profile of highly anxious and dysfunctional students. A chi-square test of independence revealed a relation between pairs of multiple-choice questions answers and GAD-7 scores, indicating that less anxious students were more likely to perform better in pairs of pre- and post-tests. Intriguingly, the correlational analysis suggested that students with moderate to severe functional impairment (WSAS scores &gt;20) were less likely to change from an incorrect to a correct answer to pairs of pre- and post-tests. This data suggests that psychological distress and anxiety states might influence studentsâ€™ ability to coordinate social and work activities and performance during remote learning. Although this study evaluated a small sample of students, our data highlights the importance of investigating anxiety and functional impairment measures as part of the remote-learning curriculum.","Godoy, LÃ­vea Dornela, Falcoski, Raquel, Incrocci, Roberta Monteiro, Versuti, Fabiana Maris, Padovan-Neto, Fernando E.","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11090473","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(9):473, 2021.; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(9):473, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21158,""

We collected the basic demographic, sleep generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), perceived stress scale (PSS) and sleep quality data from 676 participants using a web-based cross-sectional survey. Among the participants, the overall prevalence of GAD and PSS were 22.9%, 15.7% (low), 79.4% (medium), 4.7 (high), respectively. Younger participants reported higher GAD and PSS symptoms. Lockdown stressors have a significant correlation with GAD and PSS. In addition, the increased mobile phone usage significantly affects sleep latency, and sleep quality (p &lt; 0.001) is a subject of concern. As part of global preparedness measures, continuous monitoring of sleep and the psychological impacts of outbreaks should become standard practice.","Radhakrishnan, B. L.; Kirubakaran, E.; Belfin, R.

"Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty for Online Food Services Provider in India: An Empirical Study","In the food sector, customers have been voting by their feet since ages. However, due to the technological changes clubbed with present COVID-19 pandemic, the trend has changed rapidly. Customers are confined to their home and technology has emerged as the only saviour. The number of increased downloads of food ordering app is an indication of both popularity of these apps and helplessness of the present age customer. With restricted movement, they have these apps to either get the food delivered at their doorstep or take away with pre-orders. Hence, it becomes imperative for the app designer and food service provider to brainstorm and develop an app which can focus on the customer ease rather than forcing their design and interface to customer. In this backdrop, this study is a novel attempt which primarily focuses on relationship amid customer satisfaction and app quality. The inter-related relationship among service quality, satisfaction of customer and their loyalty using the app has been explored. Collection of the data used stratified random sampling.

"Brexit, COVID-19, and attitudes toward immigration in Britain","Abstract Objective A key issue in Britain's referendum on European Union membership was the free movement of labor into Britain, with Brexit ?Leavers? having more negative attitudes toward immigrants than ?Remainers.? Such anti-immigrant attitudes are driven by feelings of threat. The coronavirus pandemic presented a new threat in the context of ongoing Brexit negotiations. This paper examines how the COVID-19 pandemic affected anti-immigrant attitudes and how these effects differ between Leavers and Remainers. Methods Using an online survey in Spring 2020 of 3,708 individuals residing in the UK, we experimentally test the effect of priming COVID-19 thoughts on anti-immigrant attitudes, and examine whether this effect varies by Brexit identity. Results We show that COVID-19 may exacerbate anti-immigrant attitudes among Leavers while having little effect on Remainers. Conclusion These findings support the idea that the coronavirus pandemic might have presented a new, viral, threat that heightened anti-immigrant attitudes among certain political identities.","Pickup, Mark, de Rooij, Eline A.; van der Linden, Clifton, Goodwin, Matthew J.","https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.13010","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Social Science Quarterly; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Social Science Quarterly; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21162,""
"Preferred policy options to assist post-COVID-19 mental health recovery: A population study","The aim of this study was to gauge the opinions of people in Australia about policies to help them recover from the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions. An anonymous online survey of people aged 18 years and older in Australia was available from 1 July to 31 August 2020. It included 16 proposed policies which respondents rated as 'Not at all helpful', 'Somewhat helpful', or 'Very helpful' in assisting them recover from the COVID-19 restrictions. In all, 9220 people completed the survey. The most endorsed policy was 'To have a publicly available plan about management of future pandemics' which was rated as 'very helpful' by 46.1% of respondents. Four other policies were rated as 'very helpful' by more than 30% of respondents: two related to mental health support, one to individual financial support for living expenses, and one to support for community organisations. Government preparedness for future pandemics and support for mental health, individual finance, and community organisations should be policy priorities in the post-COVID-19 recovery phase. The findings can guide policy development to support people in Australia as they recover from COVID-19 and the restrictions that have been imposed to control its spread.","Hammarberg, K.; Tran, T.; Kirkman, M.; Rowe, H.; Fisher, J.","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8500.12507","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Australian Journal of Public Administration;: 11, 2021.; Publication details: Australian Journal of Public Administration;: 11, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21163,""
"The influence of illness perception, anxiety and depression disorders on students mental health during COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan: a Web-based cross-sectional survey","Purpose Since the emergence of a coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV) in December 2019, the whole world is in a state of chaos. Isolation strategy with quarantine is a useful model in controlling transmission and rapid spread. As a result, people remained at home and disrupted their outside daily activities. It led to the closure of educational institutes, which is a source of many students to cope with numerous personal and familial issues. This study aims to focus on exploring the relationships and potential mediational pathways between mental health problems, illness perception, anxiety and depression disorders. Design/methodology/approach The study incorporated snowball sampling techniques through a cross-sectional, Web-based survey and recruited 500 students from different universities of twin cities, Rawalpindi and Islamabad from March 23 to April 15, 2020, during the coronavirus outbreak lockdown. The study used four instruments, Beck Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire and The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale for assessing depression, anxiety, illness perception and mental health disorders. Findings The findings indicated normal (43.2%), mild (20.5%), moderate (13.6%) and severe (22.7%) levels of anxiety prevalence in students. Results specified a normal (65.9%), mild (9.10%), moderate (9.12%) and severe (15.90%) depression prevalence and findings stipulated that anxiety disorder prevalence was higher than depression disorder. The correlational results specified a negative and significant relationship between mental health, illness perception, anxiety and depression symptoms. The multiple regression analysis stated that anxiety and depression disorders mediated the relationship between mental health and present illness perception. The perception of illness exhibited a relation to depression and anxiety disorders. Originality/value The study proposed a model to address mental health problems during the lockdown. The (2019-nCoV) illness perception developed mental disorders, including anxiety and depression, which has declined individuals' mental health. There is an urgent need for ongoing clinical examination and management to address psychological disorders and findings suggest assessing mental health to combatting the pandemic worldwide.

"Efficacy of Remote as Compared to In-Person School Psychological Services: A Rapid Systematic Evidence Review","As a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, remote school psychological services have increased notably in many countries. With the aim of supporting evidence-based practices, we conducted a rapid systematic evidence review on the efficacy of remote as compared to in-person school psychological services. From a total of 3,873 references identified through our search, only three (&lt; 1%) met eligibility criteria for this review. One of these studies showed serious risk of bias according to the ROBINS-I rating scale and was therefore excluded. Overall, the limited evidence that we identified indicates that the impact of remote school psychological services on consumer satisfaction and evaluated mental health outcomes of service users is equivalent or slightly higher to in-person school psychological services. However, this information needs to be interpreted with caution due to the scarcity of available data, as well as methodological limitations.

"Sexting during confinement in Spain: prevalence, motivations and predictor variables (Sexting durante el confinamiento en Espana: prevalencia, motivaciones y variables predictoras)","SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the mandatory isolation of the entire population, reducing the opportunities for casual sexual encounters or between partners who do not live together. However, it is plausible to assume that other forms of sexual contact like sexting are occurring. This research aimed to analyse the behaviours and motivations to engage in sexting and to examine some predictors of mental health and loneliness that could be associated with sexting during confinement. The sample consisted of 510 participants: 280 emerging adults and 230 adults. The results showed higher prevalence of sexting behaviours among emerging adults (vs. adults) and among males (vs. females). Moreover, emerging adults reported more motivations to engage in sexting. Finally, the analysis revealed that loneliness would predict engagement in sexting by emerging adults. These findings could have implications for the implementation of sexual education programmes aimed at achieving adequate social interactions associated with sexting.","Garrido-Macias, M.; Villanueva-Moya, L.; Alonso-Ferres, M.; Sanchez-Hernandez, M.

"Organizational Workplace Mental Health: An Emerging Role for Occupational Therapy","The purpose of this paper is threefold: firstly, to provide a brief overview of current practice in workplace mental health and introduce an emerging role for occupational therapy in this field (i.e., practicing at the organizational level where â€œclientsâ€ are workplaces or organizations, and not individual workers);secondly, to present the findings from a small qualitative study which describes this emerging role from the perspectives of occupational therapists who have worked in this area;and thirdly, to provide suggestions for future work which could advance this emerging role for occupational therapy world-wide.KEY MESSAGESPrevious research suggests that there is an increasing interest among employers to address workplace mental health through organizational initiatives and that occupational therapists are beginning to consult on the topic.Occupational therapists in our small qualitative study described their role in organizational workplace mental health as one which involves adopting a business lens, practicing in an organization-centred manner, and focusing on population health promotion.Suggestions for future work to advance this emerging role include identifying the fundamental elements of the business lens, investigating models and frameworks to guide organization-centred practice, evaluating the short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes of interventions, exploring the fit between an occupational perspective and workplace mental health, and examining the impact of COVID-19 on current practice.","Thompson, Alexandra N.; Fugard, Madison I.; Kirsh, Bonnie","https://doi.org/10.1080/0164212X.2021.1908925","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Occupational Therapy In Mental Health; 37(3):240-263, 2021.; Publication details: Occupational Therapy In Mental Health; 37(3):240-263, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21167,""
"Uncovering the personal and environmental factors associated with youth mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: The pursuit of sports and physical activity as a protective factor","With recent research underscoring the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' well-being, greater insight into the protective factors that buffer against the negative consequences of the pandemic on youth mental health merits greater attention. The goal of this quantitative study was to examine associations between adolescents' attachment to parents and peers, their participation in sports before and during the confinement, and the severity of their psychological distress. A total of 133 adolescents between the ages of 11 and 17 took part in an online survey including the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, the Psychological Distress Index, and questions regarding their involvement in physical activity before and during confinement. Overall, findings highlight participants' high levels of total psychological distress, with girls reporting more severe symptoms. However, results of correlational analyses showed that adolescents reporting greater attachment security to parents and peers showed fewer symptoms of total distress as well as fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, and irritability. Participation in organized sports prior to confinement and time devoted to physical or sports activities in the last week were not significantly correlated with the Psychological Distress Index subscales. However, results of hierarchical regression analyses revealed that youth participation in sports prior to confinement moderated the association between time devoted by adolescents to physical or sports activities in the last week and symptoms of depression, above and beyond the influence of attachment security to parents and peers. The importance of quality relationships and physical activity for youth adaptation during confinement is discussed.

"Parenting amidst COVID-19: Pandemic-related stressors, inequities, and treatment utilization and perceptions","Many parents of children under age 18 are faced with additional COVID-19 parenting-related stressors and may be experiencing increases in psychological difficulties;however, we have yet to investigate parent's levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and adjustment disorder. Further, COVID-19 has served as a sobering reminder of the significant public health disparities in our society and it is critical to identify risk factors for poorer clinical outcomes. The primary objectives of the present study were to: (a) determine whether parents are reporting higher levels of pandemic-related stress, PTSS, and adjustment disorder than controls, (b) identify specific individual-level factors (e.g., age, gender, race, number of children, age of children) that may be related to higher levels of stress and symptoms among parents, and (c) report parents' utilization of, and perceived efficacy of, psychological interventions during COVID-19. A U.S. nationally representative sample (N = 2,019) from Qualtrics Data panels was recruited in July-August 2020. Parents endorsed higher levels of stress, PTSS, and adjustment disorder, particularly younger parents. Further, 38.3% of parents reported PTSS above clinical cutoff. Younger participants and persons of color reported higher levels of pandemic-related stress. One-third of parents (33.1%) reported using online mental health services. Taken together, parents may be at greater risk for pandemic stress, PTSS, and adjustment disorder symptoms. Individual-level risk factors, such as age and minority status, are important to consider when understanding COVID-19 stress. Clinical intervention efforts should prioritize trauma-focused treatments for parents, especially those who are younger and identify as a person of color.

"Summary of nitrogen soil test for rice (N-STaR) nitrogen recommendations in Arkansas during 2020","Seeking to fine-tune nitrogen (N) application, increase economic returns, and decrease environmental N loss, some Arkansas rice (Oryza sativa L.) producers are turning away from blanket N recommendations based on soil texture and cultivar and using N-STaR (Nitrogen Soil Test for Rice) to determine their field-specific N rates. In 2010, Roberts et al. correlated several years of direct steam distillation (DSD) results obtained from 0 to 18-in. soil samples to plot-scale N response trials across the state to develop a field-specific, soil-based N test for Arkansas rice. After extensive small-plot and field-scale validation, N-STaR is available to Arkansas farmers for both silt loam and clay soils (using 0 to 12-in. soil samples). To summarize the samples submitted to the N-STaR Soil Testing Lab in 2020, samples were categorized by county and soil texture. Samples were received from 24 fields across 11 Arkansas counties. Total samples received were from 9 clay and 15 silt loam fields. Sample submission was depressed this season due to COVID-19, but expectations are that sample numbers will increase for the 2021 growing season. The N-STaR N-rate recommendations for these samples were compared to the producer's estimated N rate, the 2020 Recommended Nitrogen Rates and Distribution for Rice Cultivars in Arkansas, and the standard Arkansas N-rate recommendation of 150 lb N/ac for silt loam soils and 180 lb N/ac for clay soils. Each comparison was divided into 3 categories based on a decrease in the recommendation, no change in recommended N rate, or an increase in the N rate recommendation. Neither county nor soil texture was found to be significant factors in any of the comparisons made in this year's data, yet the same general trends seen in previous years were observed.","Williamson, S.

"Evaluation of Health-Related Quality of Life in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Patients with rheumatic diseases have been affected by the isolation measures taken by the authorities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of them becoming physically inactive. Purpose This study was designed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the health-related quality of life in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Methods A total of 14 RA patients of both sexes (mostly female - 92.86%, from urban areas - 78.57%, with an average age of 56.42 +/- 15.97 years) were recruited for this study. An online-based questionnaire was developed and participants were invited to complete it via social media. The questionnaire included demographic and socioeconomic data, health status, the condition epidemic situation and EQ-5D scale. Patients were advised to perform blood samples in order to assess serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) was recorded in all subjects. Results In the EQ-5D questionnaire, most patients did not report any problems related to self-care (71.42%), routine activities (50%) and anxiety or depression (64.29%), only in the case of mobility (42.86%) and pain or discomfort (57.14%) did the majority report the existence of mild problems. Most patients did not have problems, except for social activities, where most (35.71%) had mild problems. Also, a number of patients presented mild problems in terms of sleep quality (35.71%) and relationship with friends (21.43%). About performing daily exercises during quarantine, most reported no problems (57.15%), but 28.57% of them reported inability to perform them. Conclusion The epidemic condition, generally, did not affect the patient's quality of life, probably due to its short application period. However, quite a few patients had impaired social activities, sleep quality, and relationships with friends.","Sirbu, E.; Gligor, S.; Gligor, R.; Ianc, D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Evaluation+of+Health-Related+Quality+of+Life+in+Rheumatoid+Arthritis+Patients+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Proceedings of the 6th International Conference of Universitaria Consortium Fefstim: Physical Education, Sports and Kinesiotherapy - Implications in Quality of Life;: 336-342, 2020.; Publication details: Proceedings of the 6th International Conference of Universitaria Consortium Fefstim: Physical Education, Sports and Kinesiotherapy - Implications in Quality of Life;: 336-342, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21173,""
"Exploring associations between pregnancy context, trauma, self-compassion, and treatment readiness in opioid-dependent pregnant women","In 2019, 10.1 million Americans reported using opioids in the past year (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2020). It is estimated that 128 Americans die each day due to opioid use (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2020). In the midst of an opioid epidemic, opioid dependent pregnant women (ODPW) are a population that needs further attention and understanding, as the number of ODPW continues to rise (Preis et al., 2020). The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of treatment readiness among ODPW, particularly as it relates to self-compassion, pregnancy context, and trauma. The sample size was smaller than intended (n=39) for a myriad of reasons, including the onset of COVID-19, which limited analyses to non-parametric bivariate techniques. While no correlations were statistically significant, there were many important findings that warrant further exploration. The high rate of ambivalent pregnancies, trauma (childhood and adult), parenting trauma, and pregnancy trauma all show the need not only for further research but for trauma-responsive substance use treatment and prenatal care. Opioid-dependent pregnant women are a diverse population with many complex experiences and characteristics that come into play when exploring their treatment readiness.

"Critical evaluation and recommendations for psycho-social support needs in cancer patients during the Covid-19 pandemic","Psycho-social oncology is a cancer specialty that addresses the variety of psychological, behavioral, emotional, and social issues that arise for cancer patients and their loved ones. This study assessed the disruptions, barriers, and gaps associated with the psycho-social oncology treatment continuum during the pandemic in order to develop recommendations for patients within an NCI-designated cancer center. A survey of 954 cancer patients, and 10 stakeholder interviews with healthcare providers, cancer patients and caregivers, along with a comprehensive literature review were conducted and analyzed. The results uncovered the need for enhancement of psycho-social support services, from both a mental health and socio-economic point of view. Key issues uncovered from the study included disruptions in cancer care, increased concern for socio-economic insecurities, decreased social interaction creating mental-health complications, and deficient communication strategies. Recommendations for the cancer center include addressing clinical trial strategies and operations, completing an in-depth psycho-social oncology needs assessment, and developing centralized digital platforms that will connect the oncology care team to patients experiencing psycho-social distresses.

"Possible effects of flashers on victims: A case study on the impacts of exhibitionism on a female victim's romantic and sexual experiences","This qualitative study sought to expand upon and add to the existing research literature in understanding how exposure to multiple unsolicited acts of exhibitionism affected a female victim's affective, cognitive, and behavioral functioning and how her romantic and sexual interactions were changed as a result of these acts. The primary participant was an African American female who lived in the New York City metropolitan area and was between 18 and 55 years old. She responded to a web-based survey and was then selected for a follow-up phone interview due to ongoing COVID-19 concerns. Through thematic analysis, various themes emerged that represented the participant's aggregate experiences in the aftermath of experiencing multiple exposures. These themes include: 1) negative perceptions of men;2) changes in mental health functioning;3) changes in social behaviors;4) changes in sexual and romantic functioning;5) learned helplessness;and 6) shame/guilt. Overall findings revealed that exposures to multiple acts of flashings had a long-term negative impact on the victim's personal and social life functioning as described within the themes. Public, clinical, and advocacy implications, as well as limitations and future directions, are discussed.

"Disordered eating attitudes and behaviors in individuals with celiac disease and the association with quality of life","The only treatment for celiac disease (CeD), an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten, is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). CeD and the GFD have been shown to be associated with low quality of life (QoL). In some individuals, such a strict diet can lead to disordered eating attitudes and behaviors. The purpose of this study was to better understand the extent to which disordered eating attitudes and behaviors may be common in a sample of adults diagnosed with CeD, as well as the relationship with various factors and QoL measures, including anxiety and depression. The study is a cross sectional pilot study of 50 individuals with CeD. Patients between the ages of 18 to 45 years old (mean=29.56, SD=7.40) with a biopsy-proven CeD diagnosis, following a GFD for at least a year (mean=7.20, SD=5.31) with no previous or current eating disorder diagnosis were recruited.In this study, suggestive ED (based on EDDS) and DE (based on EPSI) were present, but low (2% suggestive diagnosis of BED, 12% suggestive diagnosis of OSFED as per DSM-V). The distribution of the self-reported food attitudes and behaviors measures (CD-FAB scores) were spread out around the mean 36.96 (15.30) with a maximum score of 66 out of a possible 77. The CD-FAB may have utility in identifying adults with CeD that may be at risk for disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, particularly those in the first few years after diagnosis. It likely has limited utility in identifying suggestive EDs (as per EDDS) and DE (as per EPSI). The main factors that were associated with higher CD-FAB scores were BMI, number of symptoms, years since diagnosis, diet adherence and personality characteristics. Seven years after diagnosis seems to be an important cut-point in how participants rated food attitudes, fear responses and adaptive responses on the CDFAB scales. Higher CD-FAB scores had a significant and meaningful association with QoL scores. Participants recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic had significantly lower CD-FAB scores and higher QoL scores compared to those recruited pre-pandemic;despite not having significant differences in any other demographic characteristics.

"Effects of biopsychosocial factors on the association between loneliness and mental health risks during the COVID-19 lockdown","Previous data suggest that loneliness is a hallmark of the mental health issues triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health and behavioural outcomes, as well as the moderating and mediating effects of biopsychosocial variables on these relationships. The data were collected during France's first national COVID-19 lockdown and included 556 participants (M age = 30.06Â years, range = 18-87) who completed well-known validated measures assessing symptom-levels of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. They also indicated their level of worry about the COVID-19 crisis, and provided sociodemographic and health status data. Responses were submitted to hierarchical linear regression and mediation analyses. In terms of prevalence of loneliness, 18.9% of participants reported severe loneliness. High levels of loneliness were significantly associated with the three mental health and behavioural outcomes. The loneliness - anxiety relationship was moderated by employment and working arrangements. The loneliness - insomnia relationship was moderated by living conditions, history of medical or psychological problems, and COVID-19-related worry. Further findings supported the indirect effects of COVID-related worry on pathways from loneliness to the three mental health and behavioural health outcomes. The mediation models accounted for 28.9%, 33.7%, and 15.0% of the variance in anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The present evidence-based findings revealed that loneliness and worry were major contributing factors of mental health and behavioural concerns during the COVID-19 lockdown. They could inform treatment recommendations for tackling prolonged-self isolation and loneliness in specific vulnerable groups.

"Prevalence and Trends in Suicidal Behavior Among US Military Veterans During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised considerable concerns about increased risk for suicidal behavior among US military veterans, who already had elevated rates of suicide before the pandemic. Objective: To examine longitudinal changes in suicidal behavior from before the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly 10 months into the pandemic and identify risk factors and COVID-related variables associated with new-onset suicide ideation (SI). Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based prospective cohort study used data from the first and second wave of the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, conducted from November 18, 2019, to December 19, 2020. Median dates of data collection for the prepandemic and peripandemic assessments were November 21, 2019, and November 14, 2020, nearly 10 months after the start of the COVID-19 public health emergency in the US. A total of 3078 US military veterans aged 22 to 99 years were included in the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Past-year SI and suicide attempts. Results: In this cohort study of 3078 US veterans (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [14.7] years; 91.6% men; 79.3% non-Hispanic White veterans, 10.3% non-Hispanic Black veterans, and 6.0% Hispanic veterans), 233 (7.8%) reported past-year SI, and 8 (0.3%) reported suicide attempts at the peripandemic assessment. Past-year SI decreased from 10.6% prepandemic (95% CI, 9.6%-11.8%) to 7.8% peripandemic (95% CI, 6.9%-8.8%). A total of 82 veterans (2.6%) developed new-onset SI over the follow-up period. After adjusting for sociodemographic and military characteristics, the strongest risk factors and COVID-19-related variables for new-onset SI were low social support (odds ratio [OR], 2.77; 95% CI, 1.46-5.28), suicide attempt history (OR, 6.31; 95% CI, 2.71-14.67), lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder and/or depression (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.16-4.35), past-year alcohol use disorder severity (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12), COVID-19 infection (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.41-5.01), and worsening of social relationships during the pandemic (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.16-1.88). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this cohort study suggest that despite grim forecasts that the COVID-19 pandemic would exacerbate suicidality among US military veterans, the rate of SI decreased at the population level nearly 10 months into the pandemic. Veterans who were infected with COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to report SI, which suggests the need for future research to examine the potential link between COVID-19 infection and suicidal behavior.","Nichter, Brandon; Hill, Melanie L; Na, Peter J; Kline, Alexander C; Norman, Sonya B; Krystal, John H; Southwick, Steven M; Pietrzak, Robert H","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.2332","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Psychiatry;2021 Aug 25.; Publication details: JAMA Psychiatry;2021 Aug 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21181,""
"The COVID-19 babies are even more blue and lethal","This is a century of corona virus. The world is still coping up with the third wave of COVID-19, while the scientists have already warned that a fourth wave is imminent. This wave is expected to be more lethal due to multiple mutated variety of the corona virus, including one of the most lethal one known as Indian variant or delta variant. Meanwhile, the health staff has to deal with those patients who survived COVID-19, but continued to have a variety of new complaints, including respiratory distress, dysautonomia, intravascular thrombosis and endocardial myocarditis etc. Anti-corona therapy, in itself lead to multiple syndromes including acute kidney injury, bone marrow depression and deranged blood sugar levels. One of the more lethal complication is mucormycosis-a fungal disease. It has effected thousands of recovering or recovered corona patients in India.

"Treatment options for localized and widespread post-covid pain","Data on the new coronavirus caused disease and its treatment have been accumulating for more than a year. There are four main disease courses: no or mild symptoms, unavoidable hospitalisation, severe or lethal outcome, and permanent or posthoc manifestations. The last course is usually referred to as post-COVID syndrome. As a part of the acute and post-COVID symptomatology there were published pain perceptions with frequent but heterogeneous localisation. It is practical to classify them by the origin of pain: nociceptive/inflammatory, peripheral neuropathic or central. Additionally, we have to clear which phase is the post-COVID patient in i.e. the patient has the prolonged COVID- or persistent post-COVID syndrome. However, in addition to an acute general inflammatory reaction, a true inflammation of joints and muscles is very rare in the musculoskeletal system. The diffuse musculoskeletal pain, chronic fatigue, generalised anxiety and depressive disposition manifest themselves in both acute and persistent forms. Their explanation is essentially of neurological nature: there are para-infectious â€œneuro-inflammationâ€, i.e. neuropathic and central mechanisms in the background. Accordingly, therapeutic options must be chosen while concerning the neuropharmacological action mechanisms of analgesics. Elderly patients at high iatrogenic risk and with multiple co-morbidities may be treated transdermal instead of oral drug administration. Â© 2021 Literatura Medica Publishing House.

"Practical guidelines for the treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain and comorbid chronic insomnia: Clinical observation","A clinical case of a patient with chronic nonspecific low back pain and comorbid chronic insomnia is described, and a modern approach to the management of this patient category is shown. So-called yellow flags â€“ factors that contribute to the central sensitization of pain â€“ lead to chronicity of LBP. In the presented clinical case we identified the most common ""yellow flags"": insomnia, pain catastrophizing, restrictive ""pain"" behavior, anxiety. In practice, they often ignore the afore-mentioned factors, determine only the presence of back pain and prescribe analgesic therapy, which does not allow for an effective result. Insomnia is prevalent among patients with LBP, occurring in 47-64% of cases. With the COVID-19 pandemic among the population, the incidence of insomnia, anxiety and depression has increased. To date, the identification and treatment of these disorders is particularly relevant in the management of patients with chronic nonspecific LBP. The patient was treated, which included non-drug and drug methods and complied with Russian and foreign clinical guidelines on the therapy of chronic nonspecific LBP and on the therapy of chronic insomnia. Non-drug treatment consisted of educa-tional talks, recommendations on daily activity and sleep hygiene, cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, relaxation, and therapeutic gymnastics. The listed methods were aimed at reducing pain catastrophizing, physical and social activation of the patient. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug dexketoprofen was used as pharmacotherapy according to a step-by-step regimen. After 5 days of therapy pain relief was observed, after 3 months of therapy back pain regressed, sleep normalized, mood improved. This therapeutic approach showed its effectiveness and safety in the treatment of chronic nonspecific LBP and comor-bid chronic insomnia. Â© 2021.","Golovacheva, V. A.; Golovacheva, A.

"Modern approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders associated with a new coronavirus infection","The article systematizes information on the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders, the frequency of which has increased significantly at the present time, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. The characteristic of stressful factors affecting the human psyche in the conditions of forced self-isolation and after it is given. Many people experience anxiety due to lockdown, social isolation, unemployment, and a high probability of illness and death. Uncertainty in the future, anxiety during the period of uncertainty caused by the spread of the â€œnew coronavirusâ€, are a trigger for emotional exhaustion, suppress the immune system, which negatively affects the human nervous system and provokes an exacerbation of chronic ailments. The psychological conse-quences of a personâ€™s stay in quarantine are considered. In the structure of mental health disorders associated with the COVID-19 epidemic, there is a large range of adaptation disorders: fear, frustration, a sense of hopelessness, expectation of threat, loneliness, social isolation and alienation. In the situation of COVID-19, there is often a depletion of mental resources and maladaptation, a disorder of adaptive reactions. Anxiety disorders occur in the form of adaptation disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, somato-form disorders, including panic attacks. Timely diagnosis of these disorders is possible not only by the psychiatric service, but also with the involvement of internists who possess screening diagnostic tools with automated conclusions (scales, mobile applications to smartphones, etc.). A brief review of domestic and foreign studies on the assessment of methods for the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders is presented. Diagnostic methods and therapeutic tactics, the use of various traditional drugs in psychosomatic pathology are discussed. To correct the identified disorders, there is a choice of anti-anxiety drugs, including antidepressants (primarily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), tranquilizers, among which tofizopam occupies a worthy place.

"Socioacademic Insecurities and Task Performance of Researchers in Training: Evidence from the First Weeks of the COVID-19 Pandemic","This research illustrates that socio-academic insecurities directly impacted the performance of the task of Brazilian researchers in training during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This conclusion is based on data obtained through the application of a survey of 1.459 stricto sensu graduate students enrolled in all areas of knowledge classified by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES). For the construction of empirical evidence, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used, calculated from the partial least squares. The results indicate that the insecurities in the development of academic activities, financial maintenance, interpersonal and psychological academic relationships configure the concerns of the participants and affect the performance of the task in terms of scientific writing, research activities, self-assessment and scientific reading and discussion. These results can be used as drivers of possible interference from educational institutions regarding social support for students during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, as the mental health and performance of these individuals are related to their insecurities. In addition, it can be configured as an advisory material that contributes to the structuring of socio-academic spaces in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Meurer, A. M.; Lopes, I.

"The functioning of adolescents during quarantine - the role of non-professional and professional support in overcoming the problem of social isolation","Purpose: The main aim of the article is to discuss common concepts about the role of non-professional and professional support offered to teenagers during social isolation due to COVID-19 pandemic. A short description of various activities that could be offered by parents, teachers, resilient peers and psychologists are given. Some information on teenage resilience is presented. The information is discussed in the developmental context, including the main biological, environmental, and social problems revealed in teenage functioning during the pandemic. Views: The COVID-19 pandemic heavily modified the social life of teenagers, and changed their daily lives. Young people were abruptly withdrawn from schools and outdoor activities. In effect, they were faced with uncertainty and alienation, which led to decreased levels of well-being and an increase in psychological problems. Some teenagers report feeling as well as they felt before the pandemic, or report a higher level of well-being than they experienced prior to period of social isolation. Discussion on the topic of resilience is therefore needed. Adolescents, more than any other age group, need social interactions with peers, time spent outdoors, and face-to-face communication with others. The lack of these thing, accompanied by stress, leads to many mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and changes in daily activity. Teenagers put a lot of effort to resisting these, but since the tentative social conditions continue, the damage to their mental functioning increases. Conclusions: Raising awareness and discussing these issues is crucial, in order to alert the public health system about the mental health needs of adolescents during the pandemic.","Kleszczewska-Albinska, A.","https://doi.org/10.5114/ppn.2021.108476","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii; 30(2):122-129, 2020.; Publication details: Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii; 30(2):122-129, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21187,""
"Psychiatry in the time of the pandemic Is COVID-19 changing the discipline?","Purpose: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The research conducted to date has focused mainly on the somatic complications of the disease, while only a few studies look at the potential direct mental health effects of the virus and its neurotropic potential. Views: The COVID-19 pandemic is also a psychologically significant stressor, affecting not only every aspect of an individual's life, but also economic and social sectors around the world. The deterioration of mental health can be caused not only by the fear of illness, death, or job loss, and uncertainty about the future, but also social isolation resulting from the loss of structured educational activities, professional activities and sanitary regime. We are slowly beginning to see the progressing effect of the current pandemic - not only the increasing symptoms of panic, anxiety and depression, but also somatization disorders, disadaptive syndromes, chronic fatigue syndrome, psychoactive substance abuse, and possibly also fixed post-pandemic personality disorders. Nosophobia, when it comes to the pandemic, takes the form of ""coronaphobia'. Conclusions: The protracted duration of the pandemic poses a threat to mental health. It causes a growing failure of psychological mechanisms for coping with the current situation. The study attempts to identify especially mentally vulnerable social groups, including the impact on health protection professionals from the perspective of a physician specializing in psychiatry. Disturbing social phenomena, highlighted by the pandemic, were identified, and practical aspects of the pandemic discussed - the new tasks that psychiatrists and psychologists face.","Pajor, P.","https://doi.org/10.5114/ppn.2021.108475","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii; 30(2):113-121, 2021.; Publication details: Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii; 30(2):113-121, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21188,""
"Fear of COVID-19 and death anxiety: Polish adaptations of scales","Purpose: We aimed to adapt for the Polish language two scales for studies on the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic - The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) by Ahorsu et al. and the Scale of Death Anxiety (SDA) by Cai et al. Methods: Besides the FCV-19S and SDA, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS (Zigmond and Snaith), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) (Cohen et al.), the General Health Questionnaire GHQ-28 (Goldberg), and the Positive Orientation Scale P (Caprara et al.) were used in the study on 756 people aged 18-68 (M = 31.91, SD = 11.30) - 158 men and 598 women. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensional structure of the Polish adaptation of FCV-19S, with satisfactory internal consistency and Cronbach's alpha equal to 0.84. With regard to the Polish adaptation of the SDA, instead of the 4-factorial structure (as in the original tool), the analysis uncovered a three-factor structure: intrusions/thoughts, anxiety/emotions, and avoidance. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the entire scale was 0.92. Both tools were significantly, positively correlated with anxiety, depression, and stress levels. Conclusions: Polish adaptations of both tools are characterized by satisfactory psychometric properties, which enable their use in research and clinical practice.","Chodkiewicz, J.; Gola, M.","https://doi.org/10.5114/ppn.2021.108471","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii; 30(2):61-72, 2021.; Publication details: Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii; 30(2):61-72, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21189,""
"Characteristics of psychiatric manifestations among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and their correlation with disease severity-a cross sectional study","Purpose: COVID-19 severity, characteristics of psychiatric symptoms using a brief psychiatric rating scale, and sociodemographic variables were explored and evaluated. Methods: An exploratory study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, from July 13th to July 26th 2020, in an isolation facility at the COVID-designated Sola hospital in Ahmedabad, India. A total of 201 inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included in this study. We assessed the presence and severity of psychiatric symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: Of the 201 COVID-19 patients, 63 (31.3%), 36 (18%), 16 (8%) and 14 (7%) experienced anxiety, tension, somatic concern and depressed mood respectively. The effect of the severity of COVID-19 on the mean of the total BPRS score was statistically significant (F = 17.2, p = 0.000). In the severe COVID-19 group, the mean of the total BPRS score (22.6 +/- 4.8) was significantly higher than in the moderate (20.3 +/- 4.0) and mild (19.1 +/- 2.2) COVID-19 groups. High levels of serum ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer were associated with the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms like hallucinatory behavior and disorientation. Conclusions: The majority of COVID-19 patients experienced anxiety, tension and somatic concern. The presence of serious psychiatric symptoms like hallucinatory behavior and disorientation were predominantly seen in severe COVID-19 patients with significantly high serum inflammation and coagulation markers.","Khanpara, B.

"A Brief Research Report on the Perception and Satisfaction of Italian University Students With Disabilities and Specific Learning Disabilities at the Emergency Remote Teaching During the COVID-19 Lockdown","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably transformed face-to-face teaching to remote teaching (e-learning or blended) which has had psychological and social impacts on the mental health of university students. Object: In this study, we surveyed university students with disabilities and specific learning disabilities (SLDs) on their perceptions of and satisfaction with emergency remote teaching (ERT) during the lockdown phase (Marchâ€“April 2020) and following restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the responses of students with disabilities and SLDs with those of normotypical students. Methodology: A questionnaire was completed remotely: five items on the ERT were designed as ad hoc questions and five items were taken from the Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12) to evaluate physical and mental self-perceived health. There was a total of 163 students surveyed, 67 students with disabilities and/or SLDs and 96 normotypical students. Results and Conclusion: Students with disabilities and SLDs were more satisfied with remote teaching than the normotypical students. In fact, only 22% of the students with disabilities or SLDs indicated that they were dissatisfied with the teaching method used due to difficulties encountered, including those related to a weak technological infrastructure. We found that among all the students, important social and emotional aspects emerged as a consequence of the absence of interactions and relationships with both faculty and peer groups.

"Articulating key obligations of states to persons deprived of liberty under a right to health framework: the Philippine case study","Purpose This paper aims to examine key obligations of states to persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) under the right to health framework in the context of COVID-19. As a case study, it also describes the state of health in places of detention in the Philippines during the pandemic, with an end view of providing granular recommendations for prison policy reforms. Design/methodology/approach Relevant rules under international human rights law related to places of detention were thematically analyzed to articulate the scope of the right to health of PDLs. To describe the state of places of detention in the Philippines, this paper relied on archival research of news from selected local mainstream and specialized media. Findings The right to health framework provides a foundation for the response to COVID-19 in places of detention. Key concerns include increase in the number of infections, vulnerabilities in physical and mental health, and the spread of infection among correctional staff. Long-standing structural constraints and limited health information compound the threat of COVID-19. The Philippines must comply with its human rights obligations to PDLs to effectively address COVID-19-related concerns. Practical implications Policy reforms in Philippine places of detention must include application of community standards on physical and mental health, implementation of emergency release and application of non-custodial measures for long-term prison decongestion. Originality/value This is one of the few papers to analyze human rights in health care in places of detention during a pandemic, as nuanced in the context of the Philippines.","Yarcia, L. E.

"The COVID-19 pandemic and corporate dividend policy","This paper shows for major equity markets that the proportion of index values attributable to the first five years of dividends dropped substantially in the first quarter of 2020 and that this drop has not been reversed by the end of the year. In the cross-section, this breakdown of dividend smoothing due to COVID-19 was less severe for firms with higher operating cash flows and more positively co-skewed stock returns and more pronounced for those with higher leverage and in the financial sector. Heavy dividend cutters also experienced a substantial increase in exposure to systematic risk. Â© 2021 Cambridge University Press.

"Depression, Anxiety And Stress Level Among Low-Income Family During Covid-19 Pandemic In Malaysia","In January 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading globally as a pandemic in March 2020. To date, about 123,498 million cases have been reported worldwide and about 2.71 million deaths were reported. This newly discovered pandemic has majorly impacted many things such as tourism, the economy, and others. Because of this, low-income households (also known as B40) seem to be affected. Through a survey conducted online in the state of Pahang, Malaysia, this study aims to examine the level of depression, anxiety, and stress faced by B40 households. The study extracted data from 128 respondents (N=128) from B40 households around the state by using the DASS-21 online form. The result of the study showed that 31% respondents had moderate depression, 40% had severe depression, and 22% had extremely severe depression. Moreover, 15% respondents had moderate anxiety, 16% had severe anxiety, and 68% had extremely severe anxiety. The result also showed that 31% respondents had moderate stress, 36% had severe stress, and 18% had extremely severe stress. All scores were tabulated from the administration of the Depression, Stress, and Anxiety Scale (DASS-21) inventory. The result showed that the government sector and self-employed groups differed slightly at p&lt;0.051. Regardless of the employment sector within B40 respondents, this study showed that they are prone to have mental health issues especially depression, anxiety, and stress. The limitation of this study is the sample size. So, it is advisable for future studies to increase the sample size so that the data will have a significant value Â© 2021, Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues.

"Self-reported Mental and Physical Health Among Norwegian Adolescents Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting conditions may negatively affect adolescents. Objective: To examine aspects of self-reported mental and physical health among adolescents in Norway before and during the pandemic, including the role of pandemic-associated anxiety. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study examined a diverse nationwide sample of grade 11 students from the longitudinal MyLife study in Norway. The original study recruitment of all 8th, 9th, and 10th graders from the same middle schools facilitated identification of 2 sociodemographically comparable cohorts assessed in October to December 2018 and 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, and October to December 2020, during the pandemic. School entry and enrollment in Norway is determined by the birth year, and students usually start high school (11th grade) during the fall of the year of their 16th birthday. Data were analyzed from March to June 2021. Exposures: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated conditions in Norway. Main Outcomes and Measures: In grades 10 and 11, adolescents reported their depression symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (cutoff scores for moderate/severe depression, &#8805;15), number of close friends, physical health, and organized sports participation. Cohort differences were examined with a set of nested regression models, incrementally controlling for sociodemographic covariates and grade 10 outcomes. Results: A sample of 2536 adolescents (1505 [59.4%] girls) was analyzed, including 1621 adolescents before the pandemic and 915 adolescents during the pandemic, of whom 158 adolescents (17.3%) reported high pandemic anxiety. The only significant difference in outcomes between the COVID-19 cohort and the pre-COVID-19 cohort were lower odds of organized sports participation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87). However, in subanalyses comparing adolescents with high anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic with adolescents in the pre-COVID-19 cohort, adolescents with high pandemic anxiety were more likely to experience clinical-level depression symptoms (aOR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.39-3.37) and poor physical health (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01-2.31). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of Norwegian adolescents, adolescents who started high school during the pandemic year had lower odds of organized sports participation in late 2020, but were otherwise comparable in terms of self-reported mental and physical health with their pre-COVID-19 counterparts. However, adolescents in the COVID-19 cohort experiencing high pandemic-related anxiety had significantly greater odds of poorer mental and physical health than adolescents in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Strategies aiming to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 may benefit from identifying youth disproportionally affected by the pandemic conditions.","Burdzovic Andreas, Jasmina; Brunborg, Geir Scott","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.21934","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(8): e2121934, 2021 08 02.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(8): e2121934, 2021 08 02.; Adolescent Health; Anxiety/epidemiology; COVID-19; Depression/epidemiology; Health Status; Mental Health; Pandemics; Adolescent; Anxiety/etiology; COVID-19/psychology; Depression/etiology; Depressive Disorder/epidemiology; Depressive Disorder/etiology; Female; Humans; Male; Norway/epidemiology; Odds Ratio; SARS-CoV-2; Self Report; Sports; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21199,""
"Time to be counted: COVID-19 and intellectual and developmental disabilities-an RSC Policy Briefing","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives and well-being of all people globally, with consequences being observed across all domains from physical and mental health, to education and employment outcomes, to access to community supports and services. However, the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated public health restrictions on individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) has largely been overlooked. Not only do people with IDD have a greater risk of severe complications and death from the virus as shown in large-scale studies, but they also face significant short- and long-term consequences of COVID-related public health measures on their mental health and well-being. At a time when this vulnerable population is already feeling undervalued, ignored, and forgotten, it is imperative that the risks facing adults and children with IDD-as well as their families and caregivers-are recognized, valued, and addressed through a disability-inclusive approach to Canada's pandemic policy response planning. This requires both a mainstreaming of disability inclusion into all COVID-19 response and recovery policies as well as disability-specific policies to address the unique barriers and challenges encountered by people with IDD during the pandemic. The recommendations in this policy briefing aim to achieve a more inclusive, accessible, and sustainable Canada for people with IDD both during and after the pandemic-an approach that will result in benefits for all of society.","Majnemer, A.; McGrath, P.

"Challenges and Gratitude: A Diary Study of Software Engineers Working From Home During Covid-19 Pandemic","Covid-19 dramatically changed how organizations worked. Microsoft was one of the first to ask employees to work from home (WFH). We des eloped an anonymous nightly diary study with 335 participants anti learned about their experiences user the first 10 weeks of the WFH directive. We found the largest challenges were basing too many meetings, feeling overworked, and physical and mental health. However, engineers reported gratitude for family, increased flexibility, being employed, and team support. People who reported no gratitude were 22% (p-value=.000007) less likely to report being satisfied that day. Many people also reported that the simple act of reflecting nightly during the studs was helpful to them.

"Religion amid the pandemic: A buddhist case study","This chapter highlights the strategies that religious groups are using to cope with a crisis that has simultaneously damaged the financial, spiritual, and organizational capacities of religion while also making those capacities more important than ever. Following a regional overview, it considers Covid-19â€˜s effects on religion in one relatively small case study: Buddhist communities in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan Buddhist communities face a variety of challenges which are also faced by other religious groups in Asia. These include avoiding close contact with co-worshippers, addressing economic depression among devotees and institutions, and managing the new legal and administrative restrictions proposed by government. Also, like other religious groups, Sri Lankan Buddhists have proposed their own range of religious solutions to the unfolding crisis. These include special forms of public blessing, social service activities, and alterations to public ceremonies and rituals. Looking at Buddhistsâ€™ responses to the Covid-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka illuminates not only the depth and extent of the diseaseâ€™s impact on societies in Asia, but it also highlights the creative and unprecedented changes to religion that have come from the pandemic.

"Covid-19 in Asia: Law and policy contexts","Covid-19 in Asia: Law and Policy Contexts is an edited collection of original essays on Asiaâ€™s legal and policy responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, which, in a matter of months, swept around the globe, infecting millions. In a matter of weeks, the unimaginable became ordinary: lockdowns of cities and entire countries, physical distancing and quarantines, travel restrictions and border controls, movement-tracking technology, mandatory closures of all but essential services, economic devastation and mass unemployment, and government assistance programs on record-breaking scales. Yet a pandemic on this scale, under contemporary conditions of globalization, has left governments and their advisors scrambling to improvise solutions, often themselves unprecedented in modern times, such as the initial lockdown of Wuhan. Identifying cross-cutting themes and challenges, this collection of essays taps the collective knowledge of an interdisciplinary team of sixty-one researchers. Beginning with an epidemiological overview and survey of the law and policy themes, it covers five topics: first wave containment measures;emergency powers;technology, science, and expertise;politics, religion, and governance;and economy, climate, and sustainability.

"CDCâ€™s Interim Guidance for General Population Disaster Shelters During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Access to safe shelter from disasters is critical even during community spread of COVID-19;therefore, shelters should accept all people seeking safety regardless of vaccination status. People housed in general population disaster shelters may be exposed to crowded conditions that can make it easier to spread COVID-19. Although the risk of getting sick with COVID-19 is lower for people who are fully vaccinated, everyone staying at a disaster shelter should still take precautions regardless of vaccination status, including wearing masks correctly and maintaining physical distance (at least 6 feet). This interim guidance is based on current information about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the CDC COVID-19 website periodically for updated guidance. Because conditions vary from community to community, disaster shelter managers should look to their state and local health officials for information specific to their location. Key Points Alternatives to opening disaster shelters, such as sheltering in place, should be considered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hotels/dormitories and small shelters (fewer than 50 residents) should be prioritized over larger shelters. Large congregate shelters should be a last resort. Officials should demobilize large congregate shelters as soon as possible after the emergency phase and relocate residents to hotels/dormitories or small shelters for better social distancing. Shelter managers should maintain contact with state and local public health agencies and emergency management for updates on local COVID-19 information. Shelter health staff should monitor residents daily for symptoms of COVID-19 and other illness, including mental health concerns, and provide a daily status update to the local health department and other relevant agencies. View resources on daily life and coping . Body temperature monitoring should be conducted for all persons entering the shelter and in food distribution areas. Shelters should provide separate areas, including restrooms, to isolate residents with symptoms of COVID-19. Shelter staff and residents should wear a mask at all times except when not practical, such as when eating or showering. NOTE: Masks should not be placed on babies or children younger than 2 years of age or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance. All shelter residents, even those without symptoms, may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should self- quarantine after leaving the shelter in accordance with state and local recommendations. If testing for COVID-19 is available, shelter staff, volunteers, and residents should be tested in accordance with state and local health department guidelines. During disasters, resource availability may limit the ability to apply this guidance. Best efforts should be made to implement this guidance to the extent possible.

"Reviewing the physiology, pharmacology and therapeutic uses of ketamine","Ketamine is a synthetic drug with unique properties which started to be used therapeutically in humans in the 1970s and is now widely used in all fields of nursing. Ketamine acts on the central nervous system, primarily through inhibiting N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. However, the precise understanding of its mechanisms of action remains elusive in many respects. Ketamine is frequently used as an anaesthetic in medical and surgical procedures and as an analgesic in children and adults. It is increasingly used in mental health settings to treat depression. It has potential to be used more often in areas such as palliative care and mental health care. This article reviews the physiological and pharmacological properties of ketamine, explores its main therapeutic uses, and considers the associated implications for nursing practice.","Hunt, Jane Alison; Lake, Maisie Alice","https://dx.doi.org/10.7748/ns.2021.e11737","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Nurs Stand;36(9): 77-81, 2021 09 01.; Publication details: Nurs Stand;36(9): 77-81, 2021 09 01.; Analgesics; Anesthetics; Ketamine; Analgesics/pharmacology; Analgesics/therapeutic use; Anesthetics/pharmacology; Anesthetics/therapeutic use; Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology; Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use; Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology; Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use; Humans; Ketamine/pharmacology; Ketamine/therapeutic use; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21206,""
"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Safety Practices About COVID-19 Among High School Students in Iran During the First Wave of the Pandemic","Background: School closures have inevitably deprived students of their traditional source of information. The objective of this study was to determine knowledge, attitudes, and safety practices about COVID-19 among high school students in Iran. Methods: This study was conducted from March 24th-April 3rd, 2020. Data were collected via an online-parent-administrative questionnaire. Results: Responses of 704 students were analyzed. Students' mean (SD) knowledge score was 21.5 (4.6) of 30. More than 90% of students knew about the cause of the disease, the routes of transmission, and the most renowned symptoms: dyspnea and cough. Social-and- audiovisual-media were the leading information source. Most students believed that people need to keep safe physical distancing, everyone should isolate themselves upon symptoms onset, people should avoid unnecessary in-person contact with family and friends, and that cities need to go under lockdowns if needed. Students' mean (SD) practice score was 20.2 (2.5) of 24. Most students did not go on a trip, and more than 80% said they would wear facemasks when going outside. Conclusions: High school students' knowledge and safety practices about COVID-19 were somewhat satisfactory, and their attitudes toward the disease were mainly positive. Nevertheless, some witnessed knowledge gaps, negative attitudes, and unsafe practices in the study highlighted the need for targeted education on the pandemic. Social and mass media's significant role and potential could be utilized to battle misinformation and deliver proper knowledge to young adolescents.","Hatami, Hossein; Abbasi-Kangevari, Mohsen; Malekpour, Mohammad-Reza; Kolahi, Ali-Asghar","https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.680514","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Front Public Health;9: 680514, 2021.; Publication details: Front Public Health;9: 680514, 2021.; COVID-19; Adolescent; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Iran/epidemiology; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Schools; Students; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21207,""
"Violence, Place, and Strengthened Space: A Review of Immigration Stress, Violence Exposure, and Intervention for Immigrant Latinx Youth and Families","Latinx immigrant families are greatly impacted by US policies and practices that limit immigrant families' and children's rights. This article reviews the effects of such policies and the growing literature examining migration experiences. Latinx immigrant youth and parents may encounter multiple stressors across the stages of migration, including physical and structural violence, fear, poverty, and discrimination, which contribute to higher rates of mental health problems in this population. Despite significant trauma exposure, immigrants demonstrate incredible resilience within themselves, their families, and their communities and through movements and policies aimed at protecting their rights. Numerous culturally relevant universal, targeted, and intensive interventions were developed to magnify these protective factors to promote healing, advance immigration reform, and provide trauma-informed training and psychoeducation.

"The Use of Electroconvulsive Therapy in Neuropsychiatric Complications of Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Systematic Literature Review and Case Report","BACKGROUND: There is a significant prevalence of new onset neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), some severe and persistent, in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: This study reports on the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to treat NPS associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A review of the literature pertaining to the use of ECT in patients with COVID-19 and NPS was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE. Search terms included ""Electroconvulsive Therapy"" and ""ECT,"" combined with ""COVID-19"" and ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2)."" In addition, we present a case in which ECT was used to achieve complete remission in a patient who developed new onset, treatment-resistant depression, psychosis, and catatonia, associated with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 67 articles were reviewed with 3 selected for inclusion. These articles detailed 3 case reports of patients with new onset NPS (mania, psychosis and suicidality, and catatonia) that developed in the context of active COVID-19 and were treated successfully with ECT. CONCLUSIONS: ECT, a broad-spectrum treatment that has been found to be effective in various NPS (independent of etiology), is shown in our case report and others, to be safe and effective for NPS associated with COVID-19. Although we identified only 3 other cases in the literature, we believe that the probable antiinflammatory mechanism of ECT, its safety and tolerability, and the faster time to symptom remission support the need for more research and increased clinician awareness about this life-saving procedure.","Austgen, Gabriela; Meyers, Matthew S; Gordon, Mollie; Livingston, Robin","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2021.07.010","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Acad Consult Liaison Psychiatry;2021 Aug 04.; Publication details: J Acad Consult Liaison Psychiatry;2021 Aug 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21209,""

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to differentiate the opinions related to coronavirus vaccination (acceptance, refusal, ignorance, hesitation). We analyzed advantages and disadvantages of vaccination, and the different channels in getting information about the vaccine. METHOD: Our study is part of the ""Longitudinal examination of mental factors caused by the coronavirus epidemic"" research project, wave of December 2020. We analyzed the responses of 1009 people by one-way analysis of variance tests. RESULTS: Our results show that elder people, males, and those who have higher education are more likely to accept the vaccine. In addition, those who live in Budapest and Cental Hungary are more likely to choose vaccination against the coronavirus than those living in other areas. The groups with different opinions on vaccination are better discriminated by benefit-related than risk-related opinions. Those benefit-related items showed the largest variance between groups, which focused on social usefulness on curbing the epidemics, preventing the spread of the infection. Analyzing the sources of information, we found that all groups rely more on personal (family, friends) and medical health information than on news from the media. CONCLUSION: The opinions of the vaccination groups differ mostly regarding the positive benefits of vaccination, especially the social usefulness. Opinions are mostly formed through personal relationships including relations with healthcare workers. Healthcare professionals therefore have a key role in providing a differentiated understanding of those seeking advice, providing expert information and appropriate advice.

"The effect of stress and depression on quality of life of pharmacy students in Malaysia","Objective: This study aims to determine the prevalence of stress and depression among pharmacy students, evaluate their health related quality of life (HRQoL) in Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted among pharmacy students at eight universities from March to May 2020 across Malaysia. Instruments adopted in the survey included perceived stress scale 4 (PSS-4) for stress, patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression and WHOQOL-BREF for health related quality of life. Results: A total of 441 students participated in the study. The overall PSS-4 score mean was 7.30 and the differences in PHQ-9 scores mean between public and private universities were not significant. A positive correlation was observed between total PSS-4 scores and PHQ-9 scores. Only 24.5% of pharmacy students reported a good quality of life, with a median score of 96.00. A Significant negative correlation was found between stress and depression against the quality of life. Conclusions: Stress and depression play a significant role in deteriorating the quality of life of pharmacy students. This highlighted the importance of future research in developing useful interventions to improve the quality of life of university students, especially students from the medical and health science fields.","Blebil, A.; Dujaili, J.; Mohammed, A.

"COVID-19 pandemic mitigation for the high-risk patients served by the community mental health system","Multiple chronic medical conditions are common to patients served by the community mental health (CMH) system. Medical diseases are present in at least 50% of all patients with psychiatric conditions, and severe mental disorders are associated with significant physical comorbidity and mortality. Early data show that individuals with preexisting multiple chronic conditions have a higher mortality risk when they are symptomatic with COVID-19. Although mitigation guidelines and recommendations are constantly being reviewed and updated, we found no specific recommendations targeting the vulnerable population who use CMH systems or the publicly funded and managed behavioral health entities which serve them. We reviewed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines regarding infection control in health care facilities that provide ambulatory care, including behavioral health clinics, as well as reviewed recent population outcomes data. We posit that the population served by the CMH systems is a higher-risk cohort than the general population and offer recommendations for effective infection prevention strategies specific to this population.","Alavi, Z.; Haque, R.; Haque, A.; Meier, D.","https://doi.org/10.25270/con.2020.05.00020","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Consultant; 60(11):3-13, 2020.; Publication details: Consultant; 60(11):3-13, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21212,""
"Strategy Resilience: Getting Wise About Philanthropic Strategy in a Post-Pandemic World","Public and private systems worldwide have been disrupted by COVID-19, cutting across all types of philanthropic priorities. Amid this uncertainty, some philanthropic strategies have struggled to find their footing while others have adapted easily, harnessing previously unanticipated opportunities to achieve change. Why have some philanthropic strategies been more successful than others? What wisdom can we draw from this moment that can help us prepare for the future? â€¢ During times of crisis, the concept of resilience is frequently applied to nonprofit organizations and their leaders. This article flips the vantage point toward funders, proposing a theory to explain what makes some philanthropic strategies more durable than others in the face of disruptions. Drawing on case examples across diverse settings, literature on resilience, and the authors' own observations, it proposes five elements of resilient philanthropic strategies: They release control over pathways and outcomes;support networks rather than solutions;address systems, not symptoms;focus on transformative over transactional capacity;and align philanthropic power to supplement, not supplant. â€¢ Recognizing that COVID-19 is only one of many disruptions our world is likely to face, this article seeks to offer a new way of thinking about strategy resilience that centers people and organizations instead of the power of financial resources. At the core of this theory is the assumption that given today's complexities, philanthropy must use its power differently â€” releasing control over organizations and their change strategies while using its unique position, reach, and voice to work in solidarity with community leaders.

"Disease and disaster: Navigating food insecurity in a community affected by crises during COVID-19","This exploratory study examines how a community experiencing food insecurity while navigating multiple crises can be a model to inform resources, processes, and systems supporting communities facing similar circumstances. Data for this study were collected from residents of a community in Oconee County, a rural county in the northwest corner of South Carolina experiencing pervasive food insecurity. The community was severely impacted by the onset of COVID-19 and further devastated by a tornado in mid-April. The area of the county that sustained the greatest damage from the tornado was the Utica Mill Hill community, home to the county's most vulnerable population. This cascading series of events constituted a crisis-within-a-crisis for the community. In this study, we sought to learn more about community members' experiences and the effects of the crises on community members' access to food. We conducted in-depth interviews with 14 residents living in the Utica Mill Hill community. The results provided insight into community members' experiences of the crises and the nature of community-level response and recovery efforts. We learned about participants' experiences with food insecurity, new food policy developments, and gained unexpected insight into community members' experiences with mental health challenges related to the crises.","Pyle, Andrew S.; Eichinger, Michelle, Garst, Barry A.; Mobley, Catherine, Griffin, Sarah F.; Hossfeld, Leslie H.; McGirr, Mike, Saunders, Helen R.","https://doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2021.103.005","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development; 10(3):37, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development; 10(3):37, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21214,""
"Impact of videoconferencing applications on mental health","Under the circumstances of the current COVID-19 pandemic, videoconferencing applications (apps) have come into the mainstream across the world. Owing to their easy availability and cost-effectiveness, they are used in personal as well as professional lives to communicate. They have been very helpful for students and professionals to ensure that their routine work did not halt when various countries imposed lockdown rules restricting travel, social gatherings and other measures that resulted in reduced in-person meetings. However, they have their own set of disadvantages, aptly called 'Zoom gloom/fatigue', named after a popular videoconferencing platform. Users are also noted to have anxiety while using these apps. Therefore, immediate attention is warranted to ensure cautious usage and to reduce the distress associated with videoconferencing apps while maintaining the obvious advantages that these methods have rapidly spread all over the world.

"Effect of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health and wellbeing during pregnancy","The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to cause debilitating long-term consequences regarding mental health. This was evident during previous pandemics and mental health crises. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently highlighted the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the psychological status of pregnant females and their newborns. The goal of this study is to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health among pregnant women specifically anxiety and depression. Data were extracted from electronic databases such as PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) without any custom range of time, language, or keywords. Studies that reported anxiety, depression, or both were included in the study. Data from twenty-five studies with a total of 18,088 pregnant females were recorded and transferred to MedCalc software for statistical analysis. Forest plot was completed and publication bias was evaluated by Egger's test for both anxiety and depression parameters, which resulted in a 95% confidence interval. The risk of bias was evaluated by the Youden plot as well. A comparison of analysis between anxiety and depression was done. All studies reported that there has been a high prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is thus, imperative for healthcare organizations to optimize their perinatal care systems in an effort to minimize the rates of anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Maani, A.; Oli, B.; Masiak, J.","https://doi.org/10.1177/23982128211035062","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Brain and Neuroscience Advances; 5:161, 2021.; Publication details: Brain and Neuroscience Advances; 5:161, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21216,""
"Analysis of College Students' Home Exercise and Mental State during the Novel Corona Pneumonia Epidemic","In this study, 2568 college students who participated in online physical education were investigated for their exercise status and mood during the new coronary pneumonia epidemic. The results showed that the proportion of male and female college students in physical exercise was roughly balanced, but there were differences in the number of students in physical exercise between different regions. In terms of mood state, male and female students have significant differences in tension, depression, anger and panic, and there are also significant differences in the number of people with bad mood in different regions. Overall, there is an inverse correlation between College Students' home physical exercise and TMD score, that is, a certain amount of physical exercise has a positive effect on improving the mood of College students.

"A Review of Microsystem Factors Related to Stress in Undergraduate Students Studying Communication Sciences and Disorders","Purpose: The purpose of this review article is to review the existing literature about the factors that impact stress in undergraduate students studying communication sciences and disorders (CSD). Current undergraduate students are more stressed than their predecessors and the body of literature about stressed students is growing. However, CSD students' experience may differ from their non-CSD peers and there is a dearth of literature about stressed CSD students, in particular. Method: This is a narrative review of the literature about the factors that impact stress in undergraduate students studying CSD. The review is structured using the ecological systems theoretical framework with an emphasis on the microsystems that encompass the most salient factors related to undergraduate students' stress. Factors such as family influence (e.g., parenting style, parent education), peer support, faculty relationships, minority status, technology, and individual health behaviors were explored in the literature using electronic databases. Conclusions: This review of the literature suggests that a myriad of microsystem factors contribute to the stress of undergraduate CSD students. Although the review focuses on microsystem factors that are closest to students, it is important to situate the results in context. The mental health of college students was on the decline before COVID-19, and as the economic and public health of the nation and world shift, the urgency to attend to our students increases. This review contributes to the greater understanding of CSD students' experiences that will inform programmatic and individual support.","Roos, Brianne H.; Schreck, Janet S.","https://doi.org/10.1044/2021_PERSP-21-00008","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups; 6(4):806-817, 2021.; Publication details: Perspectives of the ASHA Special Interest Groups; 6(4):806-817, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21218,""
"Detection of anxiety and depression through mental health screening questionnaires in cystic fibrosis patients and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic","Justification: CF patients and their caregivers have a high prevalence of depression (D) and anxiety (A) compared to the general population. Due to the strict confinement during the months of March to May, we evaluated the mental health (MH) of our patients and their caregivers. Also, we evaluated clinical and demographic variables to determine their influence (age, sex, screening diagnosis, F508del homozygous, FEV1, asthma, P. aeruginosa infection, pancreatic insufficiency, BMI, CFRD, modulator treatment, number of consultations, SARS-Cov-2 PCR number, psychiatric background, marital status, educational level and occupation). Methodology: Patients with CF over 12 years-old and caregivers of children with CF from 0 to 18 years-old performed an online MH screening using two validated questionnaires: PHQ9 and GAD7. Results: 96 people participated in the study: 7.3% (n7) adolescents, 19.8% (n19) adult patients, 43.7% (n42) mothers and 29.2% (n28) fathers of CF patients. Of them, 57.3% (n55) had pathological results in the D surveys and 50% (n48) in the A surveys. Women, among patients and caregivers, had higher scores than men (D: p 0.013;A: p 0.042). Furthermore, 44.8% (n43) had both disorders. The 76% (n33) of the children and adolescents had at least one parent with symptoms of D or A. There was no correlation between the score of the adolescents and their parents (D: p 0.66;A: p 1.00). Only asthma had a negative influence on MH in adult patients (D: p 0.016;A: p 0.018). No statistically significant differences were observed in other variables. [Table presented] Conclusions: During confinement, we found elevated D and A values in CF patients and their caregivers. The group with the highest prevalence was adult patients, followed by mothers of children with CF. The scores for A and D were higher in women, and adult CF patients with asthma. Adolescents did not have relevant alterations, regardless of their parentsâ€™ outcomes.","Morales Tirado, A.; Blitz Castro, E.; Vicente Santamaria, S.; Lamas Ferreiro, A.; Pando, M.

"Use of telemedicine for mental health screening during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives: Persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) have higher rates of depression and anxiety compared to the general population. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the International Committee on Mental Health in Cystic Fibrosis (ICMH) recommend annual screening for depression and anxiety for people with CF. The COVID-19 pandemic and related social distancing has created challenges for administration of mental health screening by CF centres. The aim of this quality improvement project was to implement mental health screening during multidisciplinary telemedicine appointments for adult patients with CF during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Patients were screened via telemedicine using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening instruments between April and October 2020. Results: Use of telemedicine to conduct screening allowed for a majority of the clinic population (n = 93) to receive mental health screening during a time that health system operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Screening did not increase clinic visit length and rates of depression and anxiety were found to be similar to 2019 clinic rates. [Table Presented] Conclusion: Mental health screening during a multidisciplinary telemedicine clinic is feasible and allows CF centres to maintain adherence to mental health screening and treatment guidelines.","Bruschwein, H.; Soper, M.; Jennings, D.; Somerville, L.; List, R.; Compton, M.; Gettle, L.; Murray, R.; Starheim, E.; Albon, D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S1569-1993(21)01236-4","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis; 20:S103, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis; 20:S103, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21220,""
"COACH project - screening for psychological comorbidity in adolescents with cystic fibrosis","Objectives: Depression and anxiety in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have a negative impact on physical health, therapy adherence, and the quality of life of those affected. At the moment there is hardly any research on the optimal and early treatment of these comorbidities. The COACH project (Chronic Conditions in Adolescents: Implementation and Evaluation of Patient-centered Collaborative Healthcare), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, aims to identify psychological stress in chronically ill adolescents at an early stage, to gain a better understanding and optimise treatment. Methods: As part of the COACH project, an anxiety and depression screening tool was implemented in the German CF register Mukoweb. Based on the current international guidelines, the evaluated questionnaires PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are completed once a year in participating German clinics by adolescents with CF aged 12 to 21 years and transferred directly to Mukoweb. Patients are then offered the opportunity to participate in further sub-projects, which are intended to improve depressive and anxiety distress by supporting strengths and strategies in coping with their illness. Results: So far, 7 CF centres are participating in the COACH project. Screening was performed in 96 patients with a median age of 16.6 years, 56.3% of which were female. In 19.8% of the patients screened, the result was in the abnormal range with a screening result of PHQ-9 =7 or GAD-7 =7 (as of Dec 31, 2020). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, recruitment has been very delayed in 2020. Conclusion: The first interim results show that one in five of the adolescents with CF examined suffers from anxiety or depression and the care for these comorbidities is of high relevance. Based on the study results of the COACH project, the aim is to raise awareness of Mental Health Screening and to provide evidence-based recommendations for collaborative care of those affected.","Temming, S.; Thalemann, R.; Andert, M.; NÃ¤hrlich, L.; Baumeister, H.; Mall, M.; Staab, D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S1569-1993(21)01235-2","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis; 20:S103, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis; 20:S103, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21221,""
"Anxiety, depression and resilience during COVID-19 in Dutch patients with cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia and their caregivers","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the world, leading to government measures such as national lockdowns and social distancing, which are associated with a negative impact on mental health. This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on anxiety, depression and resilience in Dutch children and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) or primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and their caregivers during the second wave of the pandemic. Methods: Adolescents (12â€“18 years), adults and caregivers of children (0â€“18 years) with CF or PCD completed screening questionnaires from Sept-Dec 2020 on anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and resilience (BRS). The psychosocial impact of COVID-19 was measured by the Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS) part 2, which was translated into Dutch using EMA guidelines. Results from the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were compared to participantsâ€™ pre-pandemic scores. Results: 65 individuals participated (CF: 6 adolescents, 32 caregivers. PCD: 17 patients, 10 caregivers). Prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression (score of =5 on the GAD-7 and/or PHQ-9) during the pandemic was high (34% and 37% respectively for CF, 48% and 37% PCD), but median GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores during the pandemic (CF: GAD-7 = 3.0 and PHQ-9 = 2.5;PCD: GAD-7 = 3.0 and PHQ-9 = 4.0) did not differ from the pre-pandemic outcomes for both groups (CF: GAD-7 = 2.0 and PHQ-9 = 2.0;PCD: GAD-7 = 5.0, PHQ-9 = 5.0). Resilience was within the normal range (mean for CF: 3.33;PCD: 3.29). The mean CEFIS scores for both CF and PCD corresponded to a low (PCD: 11.3) to normal (CF: 21.7) impact. Conclusion: Despite the high prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in this selected population, there was no detected change in these symptoms during the pandemic. Therefore, the current study could not demonstrate a significant impact of COVID-19 on mental health, but does still emphasise the need for psychological care in individuals with CF or PCD and their caregivers.","Verkleij, M.; Noij, L.; Hashimoto, S.; Terheggen-Lagro, S.; Altenburg, J.; Haarman, E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S1569-1993(21)01233-9","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis; 20:S102, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis; 20:S102, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21222,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health of children with cystic fibrosis and their parents","Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on 1) the psychological health of children with cystic fibrosis (CWCF) and their parents and 2) education of CWCF. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted via SmartSurvey UK for a period of six-to-eight weeks in September/October 2020. The survey was hosted and advertised by CF Ireland via social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp). Results: 123 parents of CWCF responded. Increasing prevalence of issues related to mental health of CWCF was noted with increasing age. The psychological issues in children during the pandemic were mainly stress (33.3%) and anxiety (25.6%). Communicating with loved ones (18.8%) followed by gardening (11.5%) and watching TV (10.4%) were preferred by most parents and children to manage stress. Parents of children &gt;5 years were 2.7 times more willing to send their children to creche/playgroup/school as compared to those with children aged &lt;5 years (Odds Ratio: 2.663;p value = 0.030). One in ten (11%) parents of CWCF aged &lt;5 years showed signs of depression or distress. Many parents of CWCF?&gt;5 years did not feel peaceful (31.8%) and felt tired (52.4%). Overall, more fathers felt happy (52.6%), peaceful (47.4%) and energetic (57.9, p value = 0.023), and more mothers felt tired (57%). Looking at comparisons by parental age, parents &lt;45 years were more nervous (45.7% vs 20.5%;p value = 0.008) and tired compared to older parents (63.7% vs 41.0%;p value = 0.019). Overall, working parents were relatively happier (53.4% vs 47.4% p value = 0.514), and more energetic (41.4% vs 29.8%;p value = 0.196) compared to parents who were not working. Conclusion: The pandemic has an important effect on mental health through fear and isolation. Increased anxiety and levels of stress were the key mental issues faced by CWCF. Parents of children aged over 5 years were more willing to send their children to school. Younger parents were more likely to feel nervous and tired.","Bhatnagar, R.; Tecklenburg, S.; Segurado, R.; Fitzpatrick, P.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S1569-1993(21)01114-0","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis; 20:S66, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis; 20:S66, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21223,""
"The anxiety levels of children with cystic fibrosis and healthy children during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives: The first case of COVID-19 infection was confirmed in Turkey on March 11, 2020 and the Turkish government ordered a nation-wide school closure and lockdown for people younger than 20 years old by 1st of April. School closure and home confinement might have adverse effects on children's physical and mental health. In this study, we aimed to compare the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological reactions and coping of CF patients and healthy controls. Methods: 132 CF patients and 135 volunteers, ages 7 years and older, were included in the study. The survey included questions regarding family environment and peer relations, self care during lockdown and psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Compared to the patient group, the control group showed more anxiety symptoms, tried to have new hobbies during lockdown and needed more psychological help (Table 1). [Table presented] Conclusion: Surprisingly, symptoms of anxiety were higher in the control group compared to the CF group. CF patients seem to show more resiliance in coping with the outbreak and with school closure than their peers. Also, they reported needing less psychological help (not statistically significant). Since CF patients are already used to wearing face masks and follow infection control measures in their daily lives, these measures may not cause extra anxiety as in their healthy peers. Screening for psychological symptoms should be recommended both for CF patients and healthy children. Children with CF and also healthy children should be screened for anxiety symptoms and appropriate psychological support should be provided to them, if needed.","Ergenekon, A.

"Surveying providers to identify gaps in perinatal mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives: In Canada, an estimated 20% of women experience perinatal mental illness. Rates are elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poor mental health affects expectant and new parentsâ€™ overall emotional and physical well-being, and has consequences for children, families, and society. Services currently available to those experiencing perinatal mental illness in Canada are largely inadequate and issues are magnified during COVID-19. This presentation offers findings from the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative survey, which examines gaps in perinatal mental health service delivery. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of Canadian perinatal health care providers. Providers (N=405) were recruited via social media. Results: The majority of providers (87%) do not have mandated screening for perinatal mental illness at their workplace. When women are screened and have symptoms indicative of needing intervention, 61% of providers reported wait times of 1-12 months for services. Mental health services provided are disparate across health regions. Half (50%) reported that they have not received specialized training in perinatal mental illness. Providers identified significant barriers in service provision, with language and/or lack of culturally-appropriate counselling services being cited by 87%. Providers reported that COVID-19 has complicated access to care, including reduced in-person visits and overall services. Conclusions: The survey findings underscore a critical need for anational perinatal mental health strategy to address gaps in screening and treatment. Obstetricians and other perinatal care providers should integrate screening for mood disorders into routine practice while systemic changes are required to ensure accessible and culturally safe treatment of perinatal mental illness across Canada.","Tarasoff, L.; Ou, C.; Hooykaas, A.; Charlebois, J.; Tomfohr-Madsen, L.; Tomasi, P.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2021.02.044","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada; 43(5):661-662, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada; 43(5):661-662, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21225,""
"The psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on pregnant and postpartum individuals: a mixed methods exploration","Objectives: To explore the psychosocial and behavioural responses of pregnant and postpartum individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to develop strategies for healthcare providers to support patients through a pandemic. Methods: Mixed-methods study of patients in an urban Toronto multidisciplinary Family Health Team who were between 20 weeks pregnant and 5 months postpartum from June to August 2020. Using a questionnaire and qualitative interviews, we explored psychosocial and behavioral impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including access to prenatal care, lifestyle changes, and strategies for mitigating distress. Results: Forty-seven pregnant (and 62 postpartum individuals responded (response rate 52%));12 semi structured interviews were completed. Respondents indicated a loss of freedom (93%), lonely/lack of support (66%), and nearly/totally housebound (63%). About half (46-54%) were worried/very worried for themselves ortheir baby contracting COVID-19 and 13% scored &gt; 13 on EPDS indicating depression. Helpful strategies included keeping busy (86%), exercise (84%), and talking to their healthcare provider (79%). Qualitatively, participants expressed profound feelings of loss and persistent fear, anxiety, loneliness/isolation, and uncertainty. Adaptive behaviours included seeking mental health services, participating in online support groups, connecting with family/friends, avoiding information fatigue, and exercising. Maladaptive behaviours included overeating, becoming sedentary, and social isolation. Conclusions: Notwithstanding the â€œnormalâ€ stresses of pregnancy andparenthood, the added burden of pandemic-related stressors may impact parental mental health and relationships, parent-infant bonding, and infant development. Understanding psychosocial and behavioural responses to pregnancy during COVID-19 will enable healthcare providers to mitigate these impacts by providing appropriate supports.","Kolker, S.; Biringer, A.; Carroll, J.; Bytautas, J.; Blumenfeld, H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2021.02.037","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada; 43(5):659-660, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada; 43(5):659-660, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21226,""
"Women's health inequities during covid-19: a rapid scoping review","Objectives: The unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted women disproportionately in all biopsychosocial domains. We undertook a rapid scoping review to determine the extent of impacts to women's health during the pandemic. Methods: Electronic bibliographic databases (EMBASE, CINAHL, Epistemonikos), pre-prints servers (MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and PsyArXiv), and the grey literature (websites for WHO, UN, CDC, NICE, SIGN, SOGC, ACOG, RCOG, RANZCOG) were searched for articles reporting COVID-19's impact on women's health. Findings were organized thematically with narrative synthesis. Results: Of 1,490 abstracts identified using electronic databases, 87 studies were included, along with 88 from grey literature search for final analysis. Most studies were based on a single country (n=82), while others were international from Asia, Europe, North America, and South America (n=5). The majority were original studies in scientific journals (n=83), and others were policy papers (n=4). Six major themes were identified to include the reported health impacts on women: [1] increased proportion of COVID-19 infections, frequency of symptoms, and hospitalization duration (n=8);[2] worsening mental health and substance misuse (n=37);[3] restricted women's health services (family planning, breast/gynecologic cancer, sexual health, and transgender health) (n=7);[4] increased healthcare worker harassment, stigmatization, and burnout among women (n=21);[5] pregnancy specific vulnerabilities (n=10);and [6] increased gender-based violence (n=2). Conclusions: Our review provides a global overview of COVID-19's impact on women's physical and mental health, and access issues to health services. Our results will inform future quantitative and qualitative research, as well as health system policies and decision-making for women's health during the pandemic.","Le, A.

"Impact of the covid-19 pandemic on mental health from patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases","Objectives: Evidence suggests an association between rheumatic diseases (RD) and the development of anxiety and depression [1]. The COVID-19 pandemic is considered a traumatic event as it may cause physical, emotional, and psychological damage. Social and economic problems, and the exposure to stressors could favor the appearance of anxiety and depression symptoms [2]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported elevated levels of adverse mental health conditions, substance use, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of patients with RD at risk of developing mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study. We selected patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) from our medical records. Our population was classified according to the time they were evaluated into two groups: before COVID-19 pandemic and during COVID-19 pandemic. Categorical variables were assessed using <U+03C7>2 test and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Student's t-test was used to assess continuous variables. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered significative. Results: We collected data from151 patients, 117 (77.48%) were evaluated before the COVID-19 pandemic, 140 (92.71%) were female. The main diagnosis was RA in 114 (75.49%) patients. Other characteristics in Table 1.We found no difference in HADS score between both groups, but patients evaluated during the pandemic were younger (49.2 vs 37.0 years old, p = 0.23), and had higher education levels, less comorbidities (20.5% vs 68.3%, p &lt; 0.0001), and less duration of the disease (61.7 vs 103.0 months, p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: We found no difference in the prevalence of mental health disorders in our population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the patients studied before the pandemic are older, this may suggest that they could be avoiding hospital contact. It is necessary to improve data collection methods to obtain representative samples and better outcomes.","Villegas, J. E. C.; De La Garza, D. E. G.; Villarreal-AlarcÃ³n, M.

"Risk perception and the impact of the sars-cov-2 (Corona virus) pandemic on rheumatic diseases in Mexico","Objectives: To describe risk perception and its relationship with sources of information consulted, actions, and the impact of the pandemic on the physical and mental health as well as social aspects of a group of patients from the rheumatology consultation. Methods: A survey was conducted from August 10 to November 29, 2020 in rheumatic diseases (RD) patients who returned to an outpatient clinic in Mexico following the Stay at home program implemented from March 23 to July 31. An online questionnaire was administered on mobile devices. Measurements: Assessment of the patient's health status by rheumatologist (visual analog scale ranging 0-10) and some sections of the UNIV-COVID-19 questionnaire. A descriptive analysis was performed. Measures of central tendency and dispersion for continuous variables and frequency measures for categorical variables. Normality was checked with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Inferential statistical tests were performed to determine differences between the COVID-19 + vs -groups with Chi-square and Student's t test for nominal and continuous sociodemographic variables, respectively. Logistic regressions were performed. Results: A total of 471 patients with RD were included, 84.5% women, aged 46.9 (SD 14.5) years old;rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was the most prevalent diagnosis 42.4%. 4.8%had SARS-CoV-2 infection, 21.74% required hospitalization. Treatment modification was reported in 36.1% (66.6% discontinued);health condition worsened in 39.1% of the patients. 52.1% of the patients who made modifications in their treatment had COVID-19 and 39.1% of those who had COVID-19 reported that their health condition worsened. The perception of risk was 85.9% (very serious/serious). The preventive action carried out was home isolation 44.3%. Television was consulted 88.7%and alert 74.5%the most prevalent feeling, while 7% said they felt discriminated. The logistic regression analysis revealed that having SpA, taking leflunomide, feeling discriminated, and greater perception of risk were associated with having COVID-19. The bimodal results for each variable are presented to indicate the change on action taken per group. Conclusion: The risk perception in RD patients was very high. 5% had COVID-19. The impact on disease activity, physical/mental health was greater in patients with COVID-19.

"PERSPECTIVES of YOGA and NATUROPATHY INTERVENTIONS in PSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION of SPORTSPERSON during COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The devastating effects of the rapid progression of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic across the globe have created unprecedented challenges concerning the health, wellness, and survival of the human populations. The impact of the pandemic situation on the global sports scenarios continues to trouble the health, wellness, quality of life, and professional development of elite athletes. The high incidence of depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, and other mental health complications among sportspersons impacts their physical fitness and adds to their disability-adjusted life years. The cognitive decline and loss of interest in future sporting events adversely impact the current performance of sportspersons and also increase their post-sport unemployment issues. The lack of self-control, coping skills, and self-management of sportspersons triggers the need for psychological interventions to enhance their mental health outcomes. Yoga and Naturopathy are robust techniques with the potential to minimize the overall stress of athletes and reduce their risk of psychosocial complications. The Yoga practices like Asanas, Sun salutations, Pranayama, Mantra, Sudarshan Kriya, and Kriyas like Kapalabhati potentially boost the immune system, respiratory health, physiology, and psychological processes of the sportspersons. The strengthening of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system functions via Yoga and Naturopathy improve the concentration, attention span, focus, coping skills of the sportspersons and impact performances. Yogic practices also enhance their self-control and minimize their predisposition to chronic disease conditions. The Yogic techniques also prove cost-effective for the sportspersons and help them fight the stress and adversities of the COVID-19 pandemic. The health care sector duly acknowledges the power of Yoga and Naturopathy to improve the health-appropriate behaviours of sportspersons irrespective of the adversities they face due to the pandemic situation.","Somanadhapai, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=PERSPECTIVES+of+YOGA+and+NATUROPATHY+INTERVENTIONS+in+PSYCHOLOGICAL+REHABILITATION+of+SPORTSPERSON+during+COVID-19+PANDEMIC","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Turkish Journal of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation; 32(3):12798-12806, 2021.; Publication details: Turkish Journal of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation; 32(3):12798-12806, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21230,""
"A survey regarding awareness, fear & psychosis among dentists after pandemic COVID-19","Background: Dentists are at a greater risk for infection and transmission of COVID -19 with increased psychological stress in comparison to general population. Aim: To investigate the awareness, psychological aspects as well as financial burden on dental professionals during the rapid rise in COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: A total of 3248 participants from different cities, towns across India enrolled and submitted the online 30-item questionnaire divided into different sections. Only 188 forms were unfilled or partially filled which were excluded and final analysis was comprised of responses from 3060 participants. Questionnaire was comprised of closed ended - dichotomous questions and likert scale statements. Results: 1948 (64%) males and 1112 (36%) females participated in study. Out of these 1443(47.2%) were Private Practitioners, 564 (18.4%) were Academicians and 822(26.8%) were indulged both in private practice and academics. Significant proportions of participants expressed a fear of practicing dentistry after the outbreak of COVID 19 infection. Private practitioners and academicians have good knowledge and awareness for pandemic (COVID 19) and its infection control measures to ensure safe dental practice. Conclusion: Psychological and economic impact of COVID-19 on the dental professionals is more problematic so, psychological interventions must be designed in order to improve mental health among dentists. This survey indicates that there is a sturdy need to implement periodic educational interventions and training programs on infection control practices for COVID-19 across all healthcare professions.","Sodhi, S.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic effect on disease activity, depressive symptoms, and functionality in an ambulatory clinic-based cohort of RA patients in BogotÃ¡, Colombia","Objectives: To evaluate changes in terms of disease activity, functionality and depressive symptoms in an ambulatory clinic-based cohort of Colombian Rheumatoid arthritis patients after the COVID-19 pandemic onset. Methods: We conducted a medical records review cohort study. Mean disease activity (DA) was calculated for a before pandemic period (Mar. 2019 -Mar. 2020) using the DAS28-ESR and up to 12 months after the pandemic onset (Sep. 2020 -Mar. 2021) through the RAPID-3 [1]. Both average scores were used to categorize our patients as having high-, moderate-, low-DA, or remission. Alongside, functionality and depressive symptoms were assessed through the HAQ and the PHQ9 which after the onset of the pandemic, were self-administered through a web-based tool. Differences on proportions (2 sample X2 test) were calculated and tested for statistical significance. Results: Our population was constituted by 584 patients of whom 78,6% were women and 58,4% presented with low DA or remission at baseline;mean age was 53,2 years (SD 13,12) and preserved functionality (HAQ score = 0.375) was seen on 39,9% of cases. After the onset of the pandemic, over half of our patients were categorized as having moderate and high DA (Fig. 1) and when comparing before and after the pandemic onset, differences of proportions were statistically significant for patients reaching therapeutic goals (58,4% vs 34,2%: dif. of 24,1%;95%CI 18,4%-29,8%;p &lt; 0,0001) and for patients with preserved functionality (39,9% vs 32,7%: dif. of 7,2%;95% CI 1,5% -12,9%;p 0,013). When focusing on the patients who presented at remission before the pandemic, 46,8% showed worsening, being categorized after the pandemic onset with high or moderate DA (Table 1). Interestingly, even when DA was worse, functionality was preserved for 50,2% (n = 119) of them;furthermore, according to the PHQ-9 score [2], results are somewhat counterintuitive showing what seems to be an improvement in depressive symptoms after the pandemic onset. Conclusions: This study contributes to our perception of the COVID-19 pandemic as an urgent challenge not only for RA patients but also for rheumatologists, when acknowledging the unmistakable worsening in terms of higher disease activity and a relatively decrease in functionality. Further research with a longer follow-up should be undertaken to investigate the role of distinct risk or protective variables, the potential explanations on adaptative coping mechanisms and mental health well-being.","Maldonado-CaÃ±Ã³n, K.; Coral-Alvarado, P.; MÃ©ndez-Patarroyo, P.; Bautista-Molano, W.; BermÃºdez, E.; Quintana-LÃ³pez, G.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Coronavirus+disease+2019+(COVID-19)+pandemic+effect+on+disease+activity,+depressive+symptoms,+and+functionality+in+an+ambulatory+clinic-based+cohort+of+RA+patients+in+BogotÃ¡,+Colombia","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Rheumatology; 27(SUPPL 1):S92-S93, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Rheumatology; 27(SUPPL 1):S92-S93, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21235,""
"Experience of tele consulting care for health care professionals and patients with rheumatoid arthritis, in the health emergency due to covid-19","Objectives: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease highly vulnerable to COVID-19, a factor that caused an impact on everyday practice and the implementation of tele care assistance. Our goal was to understand the experiences of RA patients and health care professionals (HCP) in the implementation of a non-face-to-face multidisciplinary consultation model in the health emergency caused by COVID-19. Methods: Qualitative descriptive exploratory study. Semi-structured interviews (telephone or video-based depending on the participant preferences) were carried out that analyzed the experiences of RA patients and HCP who cared for them in a specialized center in BogotÃ¡ (Colombia). All interviews were audio-recorded, with prior informed consent of the participants, and were conducted by researchers trained in qualitative designs. Inclusion criteria: Adult RA patients evaluated in the tele consultation modality on at least two occasions, patients treated in the face-to-face consultation modality on at least two occasions and health professionals who have carried out at least 25 tele consultations, in the context of the health emergency due to COVID-19. It was analyzed following the Taylor-Bogdan proposal. Results: 36 interviews were conducted, 29 (80.5%) corresponded to RA patients (69% were attended by tele consultation and 31%, through face-toface consultation);and 7 (19.4%) corresponded to HCP. Characteristics of participants are shown in table 1 and 2. Four categories emerged configuring the experience of the subjects (patients and professionals) in a scenario of high vulnerability and uncertainty derived from the COVID-19 pandemic: Factors present in communication, information and communications technology (ICT) management, family support and interaction, and adherence to treatment. In patients, mental health, pain, functional dependence, and quality of life, were the most affected dimensions. Resilience mechanisms such as adaptation and self-care measures emerged to minimize risks from pandemic. Conclusion: Clinical and social conditioning factors were identified, which may determine the relevance of tele consultation. The implementation of tele consultation should be accompanied by the training of HCP, digital literacy and investment in technological infrastructure to overcome barrier access. It is important to promote assertive communication processes in the professional-patient relationship mediated by ICT.","HernÃ¡ndez-Zambrano, S. M.; Castiblanco-MontaÃ±ez, R. A.; Guerrero, P. M.

The majority of the population knew the necessary measures of prevention. 83% were able to connect with their doctor during this period, the most common way was in person and via Whats App, only 18% had access through tele consultation. 79.2% continued with the treatment for their disease, 14.2% had difficulties and 6.4% did not succeed. Of these two groups, lack of access to medication and lack of communication with their doctor was the cause. During this period, 50% were able to do physical activity at home. Of the surveyed population, 35 people (6.4%) had a diagnosis of COVID-19;of these only 6 (15%) required hospitalization, the rest only isolation at home. Anxiety 63% anguish 48% and sadness 42.6%were the emotions that predominated in the vast majority of people with rheumatic diseases. Regarding vaccines, 51% thought that they would be vaccinated if recommended by their rheumatologist and 28 .6% had doubts. Only 9% would not be vaccinated. These data are depincted in Figures 1 and 2. Conclusion: From this survey, we obtained information on how the pandemic impacted people's daily lives during the restriction. Although the vast majority were able to comply with their treatment and indications, a percentage could not comply with their treatment and did not have access to their rheumatologist. There is a great emotional impact from the restrictions on this group of people. Additionally, patients expressed trust in their rheumatologist, and the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination.","Garrott, L. F.; Petkovic, I.; Lazaro, M.

"Fear of covid-19 in Mexican women with autoimmune rheumatic diseases","Objectives: We aimed to describe the fear of COVID-19 scale in women with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) from Mexico. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September to November 2020 at the Pregnancy and Rheumatic Diseases Clinic from the University Hospital Dr. JoseE. Gonzalez in Monterrey, Mexico. Women with ARDs were invited to participate. The Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) was applied. The instrument consists of seven items, each with a five-point Likert scale of options. The maximum possible total is 35 points, with cutoff point score of 16.5. The validated Spanish FCV-19S version was used. Also, sociodemographic data were collected from the medical charts. Results: A total of 83 women were included: 46 were in childbearing age, 32 were postpartum women, 4 were pregnant and 1 was going through menopause. The most frequent diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis in 41 (49.4%), followed by systemic lupus erythematosus 31 (37.3%), 8 (9.6%) with other diagnosis (Sjogren's syndrome 2, antiphospholipid syndrome 3, and dermatomyositis 2 and psoriatic arthritis 1 patient). The demographic variables are shown in Table 1. The mean level of fear was 18.09 points, which means the fear of COVID-19 screening was highly positive. Regarding the rheumatic diseases group, women in the category of Other diagnoses had a greater mean FCV-19S score (19.0), than patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (17.45) and rheumatoid arthritis (18.8). Also, in the reproductive status classification the postpartum women had the highest mean score (19.68). Only the group of Non diagnostic yet, had a score below the cutoff point. Conclusion: Postpartum women with ARDs had a higher FCV-19S score than women with a different reproductive status. Women with ARDs and especially postpartum women should receive psychological support and be screened for symptoms of depression and anxiety.","Espinosa-BaÃ±uelos, L.

"Modifications in self-care, quality of life and therapeutic adherence in patients with rheumatoid arthritis during sars-cov-2 pandemic treated by tele consultation","Objectives: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic joint inflammation, causing intense pain and stiffness. SARS-CoV-2, as the main pathogen of the current pandemic emergency, increases the clinical vulnerability of the population with RA and led to the implementation of tele consultation. Our objective was to analyze the changes in the level of therapeutic adherence, quality of life and the capacity for self-care agency during the follow-up period of the group of patients linked to the non-face-to-face multidisciplinary consultation model during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: A longitudinal analytical cohort observational study in adult RA patients evaluated in a specialized center under a tele care model in BogotÃ¡, Colombia was carried out. Three instruments: EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ 5-D-3 L), Morisky Green Test and The Appraisal of Self-care Agency Scale (ASA-R), to measure quality of life, adherence to treatment and self-care agency respectively, were administered. Data was collected by telephone interview between a three-month period (baseline and third month measurement). Ethical approval was granted. A quantitative comparison between follow up and baselines measurements was done (p-value&lt;0.05 was considered significant) Results: Of 71 patients included and evaluated in tele consultation modality, 85.9% were women, with an age range of 90 years (Table). The most prevalent comorbidities were musculoskeletal (14.1%). Regarding the variables analyzed, the quality of life, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and mobility were the variables most affected. In the 3-month follow-up period, no differences in EQ 5-D-3 L score and dimensions were found (p = 0.659). During follow-up, in adherence to treatment, patients did not stop taking medication when they were well (p = 0.029);As well, in the self-care agency, they took measures to guarantee their safety and that of their family (p = 0.000), they changed life habits to improve their health (p = 0.004) and they looked for betterways to take care of themselves (p = 0.026). Conclusion: The teleconsultation implemented in patients with RA during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had a high degree of acceptability, found significant changes in the variables of adherence to treatment and self-care agency and without significant changes in quality of life. This study provides new findings in the evaluation of the tele-assisted monitoring model in the context of a health emergency due to COVID-19 in Latin-American RA patients.","Castiblanco-MontaÃ±ez, R.

"Factors influencing disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients monitoring on a virtual setting during the COVID pandemic: A cohort study inan outpatient center","Objectives: The aim of this study is twofold: 1) to describe the clinical, functional and depressive symptoms of RA patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) to determine the factors associated with achieving remission or low disease activity in RA patients based on RAPID-3 score assessed on a virtual setting. Methods: A medical records review cohort study was conducted. Patients were assessed remotely from September-2020 to March 2021. Self-administered questionnaires were completed by patients using an online platform evaluating disease activity, functionality and depressive symptoms in an outpatient clinic-based cohort. Disease activity was assessed using the RAPID-3 score. Functional status and depressive symptoms were assessed through the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which were self-administered by each patient through a web-based tool. A logistic regression analyses was done to identify determinants related to reaching remission or low disease activity in these RA patients. Results: In total 607 patients were included, 78%women (n = 474) with amean age of 51.8 (SD 13.4) years. Of them, 42.7% (n = 259) of all patients had completed the survey online, 33.4% had 2 registries, and 23.9% had more than 3 registries.Additionally, 54%(n = 327) of all patients assessed remotely were still working (employed). With regards to disease activity, the mean RAPID-3 score was 10.5 (SD 7.3), categorized in remission =3 (19.9%), low=6 (13.7%), moderate 6-12 (26.2%) and high disease activity =12 (40.0%). Considering functional status, the mean HAQ score was 0.92 (0.7) and functionality (defined as HAQ score = 0.375 and HAQ score = 1.5) was observed in on 28.8% (n = 174) and 78.3% (n = 475), respectively. Finally, the mean PHQ-9 was 5.4 (SD 5.5), categorized as minimum =4 (54.7%), mild 5-9 (24.9%), moderate 10-14 (11.2%) and severe =15 (9.2). Predictive factor for achieving remission or low disease activity based on RAPID-3, were the functional status assessed by HAQ (p = =0.001) and depressive symptoms assessed by the PHQ-9 (p = =0.001). Conclusion: During the current pandemic there is a considerable frequency of disease activity and depressive symptoms in RA patients. Functional status (HAQ) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were identified as determinants of achieving remission or low disease activity based on RAPID-3 score during this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a critical challenge not only for RA patients but also for rheumatologists in terms of monitoring this condition.","Bautista-Molano, W.; Maldonado-CaÃ±Ã³n, K.; Coral-Alvarado, P.; MÃ©ndez-Patarroyo, P.; BermÃºdez, E.; Quintana-LÃ³pez, G.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Factors+influencing+disease+activity+in+rheumatoid+arthritis+patients+monitoring+on+a+virtual+setting+during+the+COVID+pandemic:+A+cohort+study+inan+outpatient+center","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Rheumatology; 27(SUPPL 1):S82, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Rheumatology; 27(SUPPL 1):S82, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21241,""
"Impact of COVID-19 virus on the obesity and depression on population at Saudi Arabia in Makkah Al-Mukarramah","Background The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world, particularly in developed countries where obesity and depression is also widespread. There is a high frequency of increased BMI in patients admitted to intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a major severity in patients with an excess of visceral adiposity. Patients at risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory syndrome are characterised by the high prevalence of preexisting diseases (high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer), most of them typically present in severely obese patients. Indeed, the biological role of adipose tissue in sustaining SARS-CoV-2 infection is not completely elucidated. During pandemics, including the most recent COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health of population healthcare is expected to be affected negatively, impacting the lifestyle of population. The pandemic of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has caused significant disruption in everyday lifestyle. Aim of the study: to assess the Impact of COVID-19 virus on the obesity and depression on Population at Saudi Arabia in Makkah Al-Mukarramah. Method: Across-sectional study among Population residents in primary health care center in Makkah Al-Mukarramah was conducted using an online questionnaire designed during April 2021. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, depression Symptoms in participants before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic (via the PHQ-9 patient depression questionnaire) and the BMI category changes and weight changes during and before the COVID-19, our total participants were (150). Results: the BMI category during and before the pandemic, the total (during COVID-19 and before COVID-19) a significant positive increase of Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test Were P-value=0.001and Z (10.629) and while changed in before COVID-19 the Range (23.3-32.7) While (Mean Â±SD) were (28.625Â±2.061) to become during COVID-19 the range (17.7-31.7).

"Factors Affecting Hesitancy to mRNA and Viral Vector COVID-19 Vaccines among College Students in Italy","Vaccine hesitancy (VH) may be significant in jeopardizing efforts to mass containment of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was carried out on a sample of 2667 Italian college students, before the COVID-19 vaccines became available for this age group (from 7 May to 31 May 2021). An online survey was created to obtain information about socio-demographic, health-related, and psychological factors linked to mRNA and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines. Statistically significant higher VH (30.4%) and vaccine resistance (12.2%) rates were found for viral vector than mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (7.2% and 1.0%, respectively; p < 0.001). Factors related to viral vector VH were partially different from those related to mRNA VH. Students with greater endorsement on conspiracy statements and negative attitudes toward the vaccine had higher odds of being vaccine-hesitant or -resistant. Students who had received a previous COVID-19 test and who scored higher on the agreeableness personality dimension had lower odds to be vaccine-hesitant or -resistant. The willingness to choose the vaccine was related to the viral vector but not to the mRNA VH. Taking into consideration the factors involved in vaccine hesitancy/resistance in college students could represent a key public health strategy to increase vaccine coverage and reduce viral spreading.","Salerno, Laura; CraxÃ¬, Lucia; Amodio, Emanuele; Lo Coco, Gianluca","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080927","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Vaccines (Basel);9(8)2021 Aug 19.; Publication details: Vaccines (Basel);9(8)2021 Aug 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21245,""

Additionally, a current situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant deterioration of mental health in people around the world. So far, rodents have been treated as basic animal models used in studies on this disease, but in recent years, Danio rerio has emerged as a new organism that might serve well in preclinical experiments. Zebrafish have a lot of advantages, such as a quick reproductive cycle, transparent body during the early developmental stages, high genetic and physiological homology to humans, and low costs of maintenance.

"Examining the relationship between food insecurity and causes of injury in Canadian adults and adolescents","BACKGROUND: Food insecurity, as an indicator of socioeconomic disadvantages and a determinant of health, may be associated with injury by increasing risk exposure and hampering risk mitigation. We examined the association between food insecurity and common causes of injury in the general population. METHODS: Linking the Canadian Community Health Survey 2005-2017 to National Ambulatory Care Reporting System 2003-2017, this retrospective cohort study estimated incidence of injury-related emergency department (ED) visits by food insecurity status among 212,300 individuals 12 years and above in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Alberta, adjusting for prior ED visits, lifestyle, and sociodemographic characteristics including income. RESULTS: Compared to those in food-secure households, individuals from moderately and severely food-insecure households had 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.25) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.24-1.48) times higher incidence rate of ED visits due to injury, respectively, after confounders adjustment. The association was observed across sex and age groups. Severe food insecurity was associated with intentional injuries (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 1.81; 95% CI 1.29-2.53) including self-harm (aRR 1.87; 95% CI 1.03-3.40) and violence (aRR 1.79; 95% CI 1.19-2.67) as well as non-intentional injuries (aRR 1.34; 95% CI 1.22-1.46) including fall (aRR 1.43; 95% CI 1.24-1.65), medical complication (aRR 1.39; 95% CI 1.06-1.82), being struck by objects (aRR 1.43; 95% CI 1.07-1.91), overexertion (aRR 1.31; 95% CI 1.04-1.66), animal bite or sting (aRR 1.60; 95% CI 1.08-2.36), skin piercing (aRR 1.80; 95% CI 1.21-2.66), and poisoning (aRR 1.65; 95% CI 1.05-2.59). Moderate food insecurity was associated with more injuries from violence (aRR 1.56; 95% CI 1.09-2.21), falls (aRR 1.22; 95% CI 1.08-1.37), being struck (aRR 1.20; 95% CI 1.01-1.43), and overexertion (aRR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04-1.50). Moderate and severe food insecurity were associated with falls on stairs and being struck in non-sports settings but not with falls on same level or being struck during sports. Food insecurity was not related to transport injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Health inequity by food insecurity status extends beyond diseases into differential risk of injury, warranting policy intervention. Researchers and policymakers need to address food insecurity as a social determinant of injury to improve health equity.","Men, Fei; Urquia, Marcelo L; Tarasuk, Valerie","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11610-1","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 1557, 2021 08 17.; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 1557, 2021 08 17.; Emergency Service, Hospital; Food Insecurity; Adolescent; Adult; Family Characteristics; Food Supply; Humans; Ontario; Retrospective Studies; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21247,""
"Mental health condition of college students compared to non-students during COVID-19 lockdown: the CONFINS study","OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effect of student status on mental health condition during COVID-19 general lockdown in France. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis comparing students and non-students recruited in the same study. SETTING: Participants of the web-based CONFINS study implemented during the general lockdown in France in spring 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 2260 participants (78% women) including 1335 students (59%). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Through an online questionnaire, participants declared if they have experienced suicidal thoughts, coded their perceived stress on a 10-points scale and completed validated mental health scales (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depressive symptoms, Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety symptoms) during the last 7 days. The effect of college student status on each mental health condition was estimated using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Stratified models for students and non-students were performed to identify population-specific factors. RESULTS: Student status was associated with a higher frequency of depressive symptoms (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.58; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.14), anxiety symptoms (aOR=1.51; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.07), perceived stress (n=1919, aOR=1.70, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.29) and suicidal thoughts (n=1919, aOR=1.57, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.53). Lockdown conditions that could be potentially aggravating on mental health like isolation had a higher impact on students than on non-students. CONCLUSIONS: College students were at higher risk of mental health disturbances during lockdown than non-students, even after taking into account several potential confounding factors. A close follow-up and monitoring of students' mental health status is warranted during lockdown periods in this vulnerable population.","Arsandaux, Julie; Montagni, Ilaria; Macalli, MÃ©lissa; Texier, Nathalie; Pouriel, Mathilde; Germain, RaphaÃ«l; Mebarki, Adel; Kinouani, ShÃ©razade; Tournier, Marie; Schuck, StÃ©phane; Tzourio, Christophe","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053231","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(8): e053231, 2021 08 19.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(8): e053231, 2021 08 19.; COVID-19; Mental Health; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21248,""
"Father-child bonding and mental health in gay fathers using cross-border surrogacy during the COVID-19 pandemic","RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the psychological implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for father-child bonding and mental health among Italian gay fathers pursuing surrogacy in the USA or Canada? DESIGN: Between 20 March and 29 July 2020, this cross-sectional case-control study collected data on father-child bonding quality, depression, anxiety and somatization in 30 Italian gay fathers (n=15 families) who were having or successfully had a child through cross-border surrogacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. These fathers were compared with a sociodemographically similar group of 50 Italian gay fathers (n=25 families) who had children through cross-border surrogacy prior to the pandemic. RESULTS: Although father-child bonding quality and the mental health symptoms of fathers scored below the clinical cut-off points in both groups, fathers who had or were having a child during the COVID-19 pandemic reported poorer father-child bonding (estimate 3.04, SE 1.47, P=0.044) and more depressive (estimate -1.47, SE 0.49, P=0.005), anxious (estimate -1.96, SE 0.55, P<0.001) and somatic symptoms (estimate -2.48, SE 0.52, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings call for the development of international guidelines for cross-border surrogacy and underline the need for tailored and ongoing psychological and legal support for intended gay fathers to ease their strain and anxiety related to having a child through cross-border surrogacy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Carone, Nicola; Manzi, Demetria; Barone, Lavinia; Lingiardi, Vittorio; Baiocco, Roberto; Bos, Henny M W","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2021.05.023","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Reprod Biomed Online;43(4): 756-764, 2021 10.; Publication details: Reprod Biomed Online;43(4): 756-764, 2021 10.; COVID-19/epidemiology; Fathers/psychology; Homosexuality, Male/psychology; Object Attachment; Parenting/psychology; Adult; Anxiety/complications; Canada; Case-Control Studies; Depression/complications; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Medically Unexplained Symptoms; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Surrogate Mothers; United States; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21249,""
"Impact of prolonged isolation from the campus on the mental health of the students during Covid-19 pandemic","There is a strong etiological connection between human psychology with the surroundings. A pandemic can create a huge negative impact on humans. This impact can be both physical and mental. With the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic all the stimulus in life has been stopped. It left an adverse impact on the students, too. All kinds of educational institutions are closed, and classes are going online. This paper focuses on the psychological impact on the students as a result of being detached from campus oriented educational and other activities. A survey has been conducted on the students to find out their psychological impact during this situation where many students participated. It is revealed that prolonged isolation and segregation from normal campus activities has created mental trauma in the young minds of the students. Â© 2021 AIUB Office of Research and Publication.

"Support vector machine based stress detection system to manage COVID-19 pandemic related stress from ECG signal","This study represents a detailed investigation of induced stress detection in humans using Support Vector Machine algorithms. Proper detection of stress can prevent many psychological and physiological problems like the occurrence of major depression disorder (MDD), stress-induced cardiac rhythm abnormalities, or arrhythmia. Stress induced due to COVID -19 pandemic can make the situation worse for the cardiac patients and cause different abnormalities in the normal people due to lockdown condition. Therefore, an ECG based technique is proposed in this paper where the ECG can be recorded for the available handheld/portable devices which are now common to many countries where people can take ECG by their own in their houses and get preliminary information about their cardiac health. From ECG, we can derive RR interval, QT interval, and EDR (ECG derived Respiration) for developing the model for stress detection also. To validate the proposed model, an open-access database named ""drivedbâ€ available at Physionet (physionet.org) was used as the training dataset. After verifying several SVM models by changing the ECG length, features, and SVM Kernel type, the results showed an acceptable level of accuracy for Fine Gaussian SVM (i.e. 98.3% for 1 min ECG and 93.6 % for 5 min long ECG) with Gaussian Kernel while using all available features (RR, QT, and EDR). This finding emphasizes the importance of including ventricular polarization and respiratory information in stress detection and the possibility of stress detection from short length data (i.e. from 1 min ECG data), which will be very useful to detect stress through portable ECG devices in locked down condition to analyze mental health condition without visiting the specialist doctor at hospital. This technique also alarms the cardiac patients from being stressed too much which might cause severe arrhythmogenesis. Â© 2021 AIUB Office of Research and Publication.

"Voices of street connected children in Delhi during COVID-19","The study conducted by a non-governmental organisation â€˜Butterfliesâ€™ describes the lived experiences of street children during COVID-19 in Delhi. It documents the effects of COVID-19 on their household food security, mental health, and schooling. Data was collected over 11 months through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 56 children. The data revealed that children were affected on a large scale, as families took loans from relatives and friends to buy food. Closure of schools resulted in the interruption of supportive services like mid-day meals, school health care and scholarships for children belonging to the below poverty line category. This pushed large numbers of families into extreme poverty, physical and mental health trauma and a corresponding increase in child labour. Â© 2021 Tata Institute of Social Sciences.

"Medical studentsâ€™ reactive anxiety as a quality criterion for distance learning during the sars-cov-2 pandemic","Background: Numerous studies have shown an effect of rapidly spreading SARS-COV-2 on combined anxiety-depressive disorders and maladjustment syndrome occurrences. Objective: To determine the primary medical studentsâ€™ reactive anxiety level and the final scores of their educational progress in distance learning during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Materials and Methods: The study involved 824 students at medical universities in Saratov and Moscow. The assessment of the reactive anxiety level was carried out according to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI;the average score of students' academic performance was calculated according to the data of the technological platform ""1C: Enterprise"" version 8.4.1. The survey was completed during distance learning in May 2020. The quality of distance learning was compared to a similar score for 2019, when students were trained in a traditional way. Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistica 6.0. Results: It was shown the presence of moderately severe disorders among the primary medical students according to the average score of reactive anxiety (43.28 Â± 12.85), that expressed more in females s (p&lt;0.05), After distance learning, lasting 25% of the whole course, the overall performance score in theoretical knowledge did not change significantly (p&gt;0.05) but the practical skills suffered much especially in time trend (p&lt;0.05). Novelty: It was found that a high level of the reactive anxiety negatively affects the students' adaptive capabilities and the education quality. The specificity of programs at different faculties can determine the state of the students' psychological status. Findings: Timely transition to online classes during pandemics helps to preserve the students' mental well-being and the quality of the educational process. The duration of distance learning for a practical course should not exceed 25% of the whole course. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.

"Investigating and designing an online psychosocial support platform for caregivers","Background: Healthcare professionals are prone to many psychosocial issues including job burnout, depression, and anxiety, which can affect the healthcare systems and societies. This has been intensified by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of the caregivers' problems are due to insufficient psychosocial competence and lack of suitable training for basic skills such as self-awareness, rapport, empathy, compassion, reasoning, decision-making, etc. The main purpose of this study was to design a psychosocial service package for caregivers to help them throughout their lives. Methods: Data gathering was performed by conducting 2 focus groups, searching for studies to identify urgent and important healthcare needs, and finding the best way to address their necessities through a proactive and sustainable method. Results: The online ""healers' healing"" platform is designed with 3 general objectives. The first objective was to present practical and effective materials to support caregivers in order to improve their psychosocial competence. The second objective was to monitor the member's progress and measure the effectiveness of the program. Moreover, to make the members more active in training and their own health promotion, this platform leads and supports self-help groups for caregivers as the third purpose of this project. Furthermore, healers can be active in content development and community education in order to experience a more productive interaction within the communities of caregivers.

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 on health-care workers in African Countries: A systematic review","In Africa, a systematic appraisal of the associated pattern of psychiatric disorders (PDs) among health-care workers (HCWs) is lacking. We, therefore, aimed to ascertain the pattern of PDs and their associated risk factors among HCWs in Africa during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. We identified 12 studies for inclusion after searching four databases: Web of Science, PubMed, AJOL, and EBSCOhost for articles written in English from January 2020 to April 2021. Anxiety disorder with rates from 9.5% to 73.3% and depression, 12.5% to 71.9%, were the most reported PDs. Availability of protective gear and information regarding preventive measures reduced the risk of developing any PDs, while psychoactive substance use, history of chronic medical illness, low level of resilience, and low social support increased these risks. A considerable proportion of HCWs manifest various psychological problems such as their counterparts in other parts of the world. Multiple factors were also implicated as risk, albeit associations were not consistently established across the studies. There is a need to increase research capacity tailored to the HCW population's needs in the continent. Â© 2021 Medknow.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-associated perceived stress and anxiety among indian medical students: A cross-sectional study","Introduction: The spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new public health concern that has shaken the whole world and possesses a challenge to the mental health of the public. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the perceived stress, anxiety level, and mental health of medical students as well as to explore the knowledge of COVID-19 among Indian medical students. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among the undergraduate medical interns and postgraduate medical residents using the online data collection form. The form consisted of five domains (sociodemographic details, knowledge assessment, perceived stress assessment, generalized anxiety disorder-7 assessment, and assessment of the perceived level of change in social habits and personal hygiene related to COVID-19 outbreak). The statistical analysis of the responses was carried out by the Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Two hundred participants filled the distributed survey, 61% (n = 122) were males. The mean knowledge score of 200 participants was 4.27 Â± 1.45. The participant had a mean perceived stress score of 18.35 Â± 6.28, and the females had a significantly higher perceived stress level than the male (P = 0.037). About 10% (n = 20) of the participants reported high perceived stress level (27-40), and moderate stress (score 14-26) was reported in 69% (n = 138) of the participants. However, only 21% (n = 42) of the participants reported low stress (0-13). While only moderate anxiety (score 10-14) was reported in 16% (n = 32) of the participant and 4% (n = 8) of the participants reported severe anxiety (score &gt;14). Conclusion: There is an increased stress and anxiety in Indian medical students due to overburdened responsibilities and lack of adequate resources. Â© 2021 Medknow.

"'Psychological consequences and coping strategies of patients undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at a tertiary care hospital': A qualitative study","Introduction: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global threat and has affected physical as well as mental health adversely. There had been an exponential rise in COVID-19 cases in India from May to October 2020. Isolation, hospitalization, and stigmatization were significant issues in COVID-19 crisis. The literature is sparse on the mental health effects on hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to describe the psychological consequences and coping strategies of COVID-19 patients admitted to tertiary health-care hospital. The objectives were (1) to assess the psychological consequences in COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital, (2) to assess the coping strategies in these COVID-19 patients, and (3) to find correlations of sociodemographic characteristics, psychological consequences, and coping strategies of these COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional qualitative study, 100 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection participated. In-depth interviews were conducted using semi-structured questionnaire. The narratives were coded into themes and correlations of variables generated were done using Chi-square test. Results: The most common themes about the psychological state of patients were loneliness and isolation (56%), adjustment issues in the hospital (54%), and concerns about family members (32%). Patients who had family members also suffering from COVID-19 illness (24%) had more concerns about their health (Chi-square 25.209, P = 0.00) and had worries of their future (Chi-square 7.023, P = 0.008). Females had more worries about family members (Chi-square 16.295, P = 0.00) and had more concerns about their own health (Chi-square 5.71, P = 0.01). The most common coping strategies used by patients were digital communication with family members (82%), distraction (58%), and communicating with other co-patients (30%) to deal with their psychological distress. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection leads to psychological distress due to multiple factors. Timely interventions with support for effective coping mechanisms can help in alleviating the distress.

"Persistent lymphopenia after diagnosis of COVID-19 predicts acute respiratory distress syndrome: A retrospective cohort study","Background: Lymphopenia is a marker of immunosuppression after severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) which is characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between persistent lymphopenia and ARDS. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 125 patients with COVID-19 admitted to government-designated treatment center between 14 January 2020, and 20 March 2020 was conducted. We recorded all complete blood cell counts during the day 0th, 3rd, and 7th following the diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients were grouped based on the depression of the lymphocyte cell count, their return, or their failure to normal. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ARDS, and secondary outcomes included developing vital organ dysfunction and hospital lengths of stay. Results: 17.6% (22/125) patients developed ARDS. The lymphocyte counts with ARDS and non-ARDS were 0.94 Ã— 109/L, 1.20 Ã— 109/L at admission, respectively (p = 0.02). On the 3rd and 7th day, the median of lymphocyte count in ARDS was significantly lower than that of non-ARDS. Multivariable logistic regression, which was adjusting for potentially confounding factors (including age, comorbidities, and APACHE II score), showed that persistent lymphopenia within the 7th day was independently associated with ARDS (OR, 3.94 [95% CI, 1.26â€“12.33, p = 0.018). Further, patients with persistent lymphopenia had longer hospital lengths of stay (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The results showed persistent lymphopenia predicted ARDS after COVID-19. Further studies are needed to investigate whether immunostimulation of lymphocytes within 1 week can reduce ARDS occurrence in patients with COVID-19.

"Impact of COVID-19 on School Psychology Practices in Canada","In March of 2020, COVID-19 forced schools to close across Canada. While school psychologists typically work directly with students, teachers, and families, nearly all services had to be modified to accommodate the new circumstances. The following brief report presents a summary of the survey responses of 214 Canadian school psychology practitioners on their experience of the COVID-19 shutdown. Nearly all respondents indicated their work experiences had significantly changed since the start of the pandemic, notably through decreases in assessments and mental health interventions. Importantly, respondents also indicated significant decreases in their own mental health/well-being as compared to before the pandemic. Implications for professional practice are discussed.","Ritchie, Tessa, Rogers, Maria, Ford, Laurie","https://doi.org/10.1177/08295735211039738","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Canadian Journal of School Psychology;: 08295735211039738, 2021.; Publication details: Canadian Journal of School Psychology;: 08295735211039738, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21262,""
"Uses of digital technologies in the time of Covid-19: opportunities and challenges for professionals in psychiatry and mental health care","The Covid-19 pandemic has required psychiatric and mental health professionals to change their practices to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in particular by favoring remote monitoring and assessment via digital technologies. As part of a research project that was co-funded by the French National Research Agency (ARN) and the Centre-Val de Loire Region, we carried out a systematic literature review to investigate how such uses of digital technologies have been developing. The present systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. The search was carried out in MEDLINE (PubMed) and Cairn databases, as well as in a platform specializing in mental health, Ascodocpsy. The search yielded 558 results for the year 2020. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, first on titles and abstracts, and then on full texts, 61 articles were included. The analysis of the literature revealed a heterogeneous integration of digital technologies, not only depending on countries, contexts, and local regulations, but also depending on the modalities of care. Notwithstanding these variations, the use of videoconferencing has developed significantly, affecting working conditions and therapeutic relationships. For many psychiatric and mental health professionals, the pandemic has been an opportunity to build up an experience of remote care, and thus better identify the possibilities and limits of these digital technologies. The new uses of such technologies essentially consist in a transition from the classic consultation model towards teleconsultation and makes less use of the specific potential of artificial intelligence. As professionals were not prepared for these uses, they were confronted with practical difficulties and ethical questions, such as the place of digital technology in care, confidentiality and protection of personal data, and equity in access to care. The health crisis questions how the organization of health care integrates the possibilities offered by digital technology, in particular so as to promote the autonomy and empowerment of mental health service users.","HÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ne, Gourret Baumgart, El Hage, Deloyer, Maes, Lebas, Marazziti, Thome, Fond-Harmant, Denis","https://doi.org/10.2196/30359","20211104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21263,""
"Introduction to Core Competencies for Digital Peer Support: Efforts to Promote Consistency and Standardization of Best Practices","As digital peer support is quickly expanding across the globe in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, standardization in the training and delivery of digital peer support can advance the professionalism of this field. While telehealth competencies exist for other fields of mental health practice such as social work, psychiatry, and psychology, limited research has been done to develop and promote digital peer support competencies. The goal of this manuscript is to introduce the co-production of core-competencies which can guide digital peer-support. Peer support specialists were recruited through an international listserv and participated in a 1-hour virtual focus group. A total of four focus groups were conducted with 59 peer support specialists from 11 states and 3 countries. Analysis was conducted using RADar, and ten themes were identified: (1) protecting the rights of service users; (2) technical knowledge and skill in the practice of digital peer support; (3) available technologies; (4) equity of access; (5) digital communication skills; (6) performance-based training; (7) self-care; (8) monitoring digital peer support and addressing digital crisis; (9) peer support competencies; and (10) health literacy (emerging). The authors present recommendations based on these themes. The introduction of digital peer support core competencies is an initial first step to promote the standardization of best practices in digital peer support. The established competencies can potentially act as a guide for training and skill development to be integrated into state peer support specialist competencies and enhance competencies endorsed by the Substance Abuse for Mental Health Services Administration.","Collins-Pisano, Velez Court, Johnson, Mois, Brooks, Myers, Muralidharan, Storm, Wright, Berger, Kasper, Fox, MacDonald, Schultze, Fortuna","https://doi.org/10.2196/30221","20211104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21264,""
"Trajectories of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 associations with religion, income, and economic difficulties","The current study examined trajectories of anxiety and depression symptoms at three-time points during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined correlates of those trajectories. Data were collected at three time points during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample in the current study consisted of 804 respondents who had completed the online questionnaire at all three time points designed for the study. Using Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) we identified four trajectories: (a) A resilient group reported consistently low levels of symptoms (62% anxiety and 72% depression), (b) a chronic group reported consistently high levels of symptoms (12% anxiety and 14% depression), (c) an emerging group reported low initial symptoms that increased steadily across time (20% anxiety and 13% depression), and (d) an improving group reported high initial symptoms that decreased across time (6% anxiety and 3% depression). The salient conclusion that emerged from these results is that even in a severe and prolonged crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the most common outcome in the population is that of resilience. Moreover, examining predictors of these trajectories, we found that the resilience trajectory was associated with fewer economic difficulties due to the COVID-19, greater income, and self-identification as religious.","Kimhi, Eshel, Marciano, Adini, Bonanno","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.10.043","20211104","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Longitudinal study; Trajectories","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21265,""
"The effect of social support on work stress in health workers during the pandemic: The mediation role of resilience","Stressful experiences commonly increase among health workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. From this perspective, this study primarily aimed to examine the mediating role of resilience in the effect of perceived social support on work stress among health workers. The sample of the study consisted of 402 health workers. In the research, the ""General Work Stress Scale,"" ""Brief Resiliency Scale,"" and ""Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support"" were used. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between work stress and social support (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.223, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00) and resilience (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.432, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00), and a statistically significant positive correlation between social support and resilience (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.226, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00). Resilience mediates the relationship between perception of social support and work stress. When planning effective intervention strategies, it will be critical to reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes in health workers, who are fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, by increasing social support and resilience and reducing work stress.","KaradaÃ…Å¸, Duran","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22742","20211104","health worker; resilience; social support; work stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21266,""
"Investigating differential effects of socio-emotional and mindfulness-based online interventions on mental health, resilience and social capacities during the COVID-19 pandemic: The study protocol","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a mental health crisis on a global scale. Epidemiological studies have reported a drastic increase in mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, increased loneliness and feelings of disconnectedness from others, while resilience levels have been negatively affected, indicating an urgent need for intervention. The current study is embedded within the larger CovSocial project which sought to evaluate longitudinal changes in vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion during the pandemic. The current second phase will investigate the efficacy of brief online mental training interventions in reducing mental health problems, and enhancing psychological resilience and social capacities. It further provides a unique opportunity for the prediction of intervention effects by individual biopsychosocial characteristics and preceding longitudinal change patterns during the pandemic in 2020/21. We will examine the differential effects of a socio-emotional (including 'Affect Dyad') and a mindfulness-based (including 'Breathing Meditation') intervention, delivered through a web- and cellphone application. Participants will undergo 10 weeks of intervention, and will be compared to a retest control group. The effectiveness of the interventions will be evaluated in a community sample (N = 300), which is recruited from the original longitudinal CovSocial sample. The pre- to post-intervention changes, potential underlying mechanisms, and prediction thereof, will be assessed on a wide range of outcomes: levels of stress, loneliness, depression and anxiety, resilience, prosocial behavior, empathy, compassion, and the impact on neuroendocrine, immunological and epigenetic markers. The multi-method nature of the study will incorporate self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approaches, and biological, hormonal and epigenetic markers assessed in saliva. Results will reveal the differential effectiveness of two brief online interventions in improving mental health outcomes, as well as enhancing social capacities and resilience. The present study will serve as a first step for future application of scalable, low-cost interventions at a broader level to reduce stress and loneliness, improve mental health and build resilience and social capacities in the face of global stressors. This trial has been registered on May 17, 2020 with the ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04889508 registration number (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04889508).","Godara, Silveira, MatthÃƒÂ¤us, Heim, Voelkle, Hecht, Binder, Singer","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256323","20211104","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21267,""
"Strengths of the heart: Stressors, gratitude, and mental health in single mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant economic, social, and mental health challenges for many parents. However, single mothers (who are typically both primary caregivers and wage earners for their families) may be especially vulnerable to stress and mental health problems during this crisis. Gratitude is strongly linked to positive emotions as well as mental health and has been shown to be amendable in interventions but has rarely been assessed in regard to parent well-being. In the present study, we assessed the longitudinal relations between life stressors and gratitude on single mothers' mental health (<i>N</i> = 200) prior to, and during, the pandemic using quantitative and qualitative data. We found that stressors contributed to poor mental health both concurrently and across time. However, T1 gratitude was associated with lower internalizing problems at T2 (controlling for prior internalizing problems). Qualitative interviews revealed both challenges and strengths of single mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that fostering gratitude in single mothers could have benefits for their mental health and well-being. Future research should test this in an intervention and further elucidate strength-based resources that single mothers utilize to assist them during challenging times, reduce stressors, and improve their mental health.

"Web-Based Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing for Adults With Suicidal Ideation: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Adversity and traumatic experiences increase the likelihood of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence-based, trauma-focused psychotherapy that desensitizes painful memories, so that reminders in the present no longer provoke overwhelming emotional responses. Preliminary evidence suggests that EMDR can be used as an acute intervention in suicidal patients, including those with major depressive disorder. In addition, because of social distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have been using EMDR on the web and, in the absence of formal evaluations of web-based EMDR, informal reports indicate good results. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate whether remotely delivered EMDR (targeting experiences associated with suicidal thinking) reduces suicidal thoughts. Secondary aims include examining the impact of remotely delivered EMDR on symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, emotional dysregulation, and dissociation. We will also report on adverse events in the EMDR group to explore whether targeting suicidal ideation with EMDR is safe. Finally, we will compare dropout rates between the treatment groups. In this randomized controlled trial, 80 adults who express suicidal ideation and meet the study criteria will receive either 12 sessions of twice weekly EMDR plus treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. EMDR sessions will focus on the most distressing and intrusive memories associated with suicidal ideation. Data for primary and secondary objectives will be collected at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months after enrollment. A subsequent longer-term analysis, beyond the scope of this protocol, will examine differences between the groups with respect to the number of posttreatment emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and overall health care use in the year before and after therapy. The protocol was approved by the University of Alberta Research Health Ethics Board (protocol ID Pro00090989). Funding for this study was provided by the Mental Health Foundation (grant RES0048906). Recruitment started in May 2021, with a projected completion date of March 2023. The results of this trial will contribute to knowledge on whether web-based delivery of EMDR is a safe and effective treatment for reducing suicidal ideation and potentially reducing the incidence of suicide attempts in this patient population.

"University students' adherence and vaccination attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic: Focusing on costs and benefits","Numerous measures were implemented to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Adhering to these measures as well as getting vaccinated is associated with subjective costs and benefits. Since young people like university students largely feel less vulnerable to the virus, other costs and benefits than health might be more decisive for them. This article combines the results of a qualitative and a quantitative longitudinal study conducted with university students mainly living in Tyrol, Austria. The studies focused on the second wave of infections of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health concerns, altruistic concerns, worrying about the economic consequences of the measures and reactance played an important role for students in deciding what measures to follow and their vaccination attitudes. The effects were partially mediated by understanding the measures' necessity. Qualitative results enabled further insights into thought processes during these decisions and revealed additional aspects, such as concerns about mental health consequences. This research suggests that students make their decisions about adherence and vaccinations based on a variety of aspects that they weigh against each other. Understanding the individual assessments of costs and benefits is crucial to promote both adherence to the measures against the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination readiness.","Kulcar, Straganz, Kreh, Siller, File, Canazei, Bork-HÃƒÂ¼ffer, Juen","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12320","20211104","COVID-19; adherence; compliance; university students; vaccination attitudes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21271,""
"Korean University Students' Problematic Alcohol use, Depression, and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury During COVID-19 Lockdown","This study investigated depression, problematic alcohol use, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) of university students in Korea during COVID-19 lockdown and evaluated the moderating effect of problematic alcohol use in the relationship between depression and NSSI. In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 234 Korean university students' data were used to analyze the relationship between depression and NSSI and the moderating effect of problematic alcohol use. To analyze the moderating effect, Hayes PROCESS macro (model 1) was used. Of the participants, 69.7% were problematic alcohol drinkers and 58.1% were binge drinkers. Depression and NSSI scores were 13.948 and 0.901, respectively. Of the participants, 33.3% had experienced NSSI for 6 months. Depression was positively associated with NSSI among university students. Furthermore, problematic alcohol use had a conditional moderating effect on the relationship between depression and NSSI. Problematic alcohol use had conditional moderating effects on the relationship between depression and NSSI. Additionally, since the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, to prevent NSSI, health care professionals in the university should screen students with problematic alcohol use and depressive symptoms.","Kim, Jeong, Park","https://doi.org/10.1177/24705470211053042","20211104","alcohol drinking; depression; mental health; self-injurious behavior; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21272,""
"High Psychosocial Work Demands, Decreased Well-Being, and Perceived Well-Being Needs Within Veterinary Academia During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Higher psychosocial work demands in veterinary and academic professions are associated with decreased occupational, physical, and mental well-being. COVID-19 introduced far-reaching challenges that may have increased the psychosocial work demands for these populations, thereby impacting individual- and institutional-level well-being. Our objective was to investigate the psychosocial work demands, health and well-being, and perceived needs of faculty, staff, residents and interns at the Ontario Veterinary College, in Ontario, Canada, during COVID-19. A total of 157 respondents completed a questionnaire between November 2020 and January 2021, that included the Third Version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ-III) and open-text questions on perceived needs for well-being. Results showed that COPSOQ-III dimensions of quantitative demands, recognition, sense of community, burnout, stress, and depressive symptoms, were significantly worse in our study population than the Canadian norm. Quantitative and emotional demands, health and well-being (including depressive symptoms, stress, cognitive stress, somatic stress, and burnout), and work-life conflict were also reported to have worsened since the COVID-19 restrictions for most respondents. Females and caregivers had higher odds of experiencing increased work demands, and decreased health and well-being, compared to males and non-caregivers. However, male caregivers experienced worsened supervisor relations, compared to female caregivers. Social capital also worsened for clinical and part-time employees, compared to full-time and non-clinical employees. Respondents identified increased workload support, community-building, recognition of employees' capacities and personal needs, flexible work schedules, and consistent communication, as strategies to increase well-being during COVID-19 and generally. Overall, our findings suggest that COVID-19 has increased occupational demands, work-life conflicts, and decreased well-being in veterinary academia. Institutional-level interventions are discussed and recommended to aid individual and institutional well-being.","McKee, Gohar, Appleby, Nowrouzi-Kia, Hagen, Jones-Bitton","https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.746716","20211104","COVID-19; academia well-being; mental health; psychosocial work demands; stress; veterinary well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21273,""
"Supporting Health-Care Workers and Patients in Quarantine Wards: Evidence From a Survey of Frontline Health-Care Workers and Inpatients With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","<b>Objective:</b> Frontline health-care workers and patients with COVID-19 have been identified as high-risk groups for psychological problems. Experience of working or staying in quarantine wards generated psychological stressors for health-care workers and patients with COVID-19. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological symptoms of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and the health-care workers treating them during the outbreak period, examine the effects of psychological stressors on mental health in both populations and perceived coping resources for both sides. <b>Methods:</b> Three hundred and eleven health-care workers working in a COVID-19 designated hospital in Wuhan, China, and 148 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the same hospital participated in this cross-sectional survey conducted in February 2020. Psychological symptoms, psychological stressors, and perceived coping resources were reported by both groups. <b>Results:</b> Thirty-three percent of health-care workers and 35.2% of patients with COVID-19 had significant psychological symptoms that were indicative of a high risk for psychological disorders. Pandemic-related psychological stressors contributed to psychological symptoms for both populations. Concern about patients was one aspect of psychological stressors of frontline health-care workers and both groups perceived support from the opposite side as an important external coping resource. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results shed light on the need to provide psychological support to both frontline health-care workers and patients with COVID-19 and suggest enhancing the treatment alliance might be effective to improve mental health for both populations during the crisis.","Zhou, Guan, Rosenthal, Moerdler, Guan, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.705354","20211104","coping resource; frontline health-care workers; hospitalized patients with COVID-19; psychological stressors; psychological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21274,""
"What factors explain anger and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic? The case of Israeli society","What factors affected the levels of anger and emotional distress experienced during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic? We hypothesized that (1) sociodemographic factors and resiliency factors would partially explain psychological distress and anger, with stronger resiliency associated with lower levels of distress and anger; (2) women would report more trust in national leadership, as well as more psychological problems; (3) individuals of low socioeconomic status would report less resiliency, less trust in national leadership, and greater distress than individuals of higher socioeconomic status; and (4) hope would mediate the relationships between the other resiliency factors and both anger and distress. To explore whether community resilience, hope, and trust in leaders were associated with lower levels of anger and emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this observational study, data were gathered in Israel during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, just before the Jewish New Year (mid-September 2020), as a second lockdown was announced. Data were gathered from 636 Israeli adults, who were recruited by the Midgam research panel. The participants filled out self-reported questionnaires including one on state anger, the Brief Symptom Inventory as a measure of mental-health problems (<i>i.e.</i>, somatization, depression, and anxiety), and questionnaires about trust in the state's leaders, community resilience (CCRAM), and hope as measures of coping resources and resiliency. <i>t</i>-tests were used to explore differences between men and women and between those of lower and higher socioeconomic status. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was then used to examine whether and how the sociodemographic and resiliency variables explained state anger and psychological distress. A Sobel test was used to evaluate the possible effects of hope on community resilience and trust in leadership in the context of both distress and anger. Our results revealed differences between women and men in terms of anger and mental-health problems, but not in terms of coping resources. Women reported higher levels of both anger and mental-health problems. Participants of lower socioeconomic status reported more mental-health problems, more anger, and greater trust in the state's leaders; whereas those of higher socioeconomic status reported greater hope. Furthermore, hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that the sociodemographic factors of gender, age, and socioeconomic status, as well as community resilience, trust in the state's leaders, and hope explained mental health with a total of 19% of the variance and anger with a total of 33% of the variance. The Sobel tests showed that hope mediated the relationships between community resilience and mental health (<i>z</i> = 3.46, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), community resilience and anger (<i>z</i> = 2.90, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), and trust in leaders and anger (<i>z</i> = 3.26, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), but did not affect the relationship between trust in leaders and mental health (<i>z</i> = 1.53, <i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). Personal and communal factors affect psychological distress. Personal resilience is an important factor that should be strengthened throughout life. Trust in leadership is important for citizens' mental health.","Braun-Lewensohn, Abu-Kaf, Kalagy","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i10.864","20211104","Anger; Community resilience; Hope; Mental health; Pandemic; Trust in government","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21275,""
"Psychiatric sequelae in COVID-19 survivors: A narrative review","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was initially reported in Wuhan, China. Previous epidemics including SARS and middle east respiratory syndrome raises concern that COVID-19 infection may pose a significant threat to the mental health of affected individuals. Studies and reviews have shown the acute psychiatric manifestations in COVID-19 patients, although long term psychiatric sequelae are predicted, there are only few review studies about the long term psychiatry outcome in COVID-19 survivors. Clinically significant post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and/or depression among COVID-19 survivors during 14-90 d were observed following the diagnosis. Risk of anxiety or depression were higher in patients with more severe illness at 6 mo follow-up, early convalescence, and at 1 mo follow-up. Diagnosis of COVID-19 Led to more first diagnoses and relapses of psychiatric illness during the first 14-90 d after COVID-19 diagnosis. The possible underlying mechanisms of psychiatric sequelae in COVID-19 infection are neurotropism, immune response to SARS-CoV-2, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity, disrupted neuronal circuits in several brain regions, increased stress levels, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. This study will review the psychiatric sequelae in previous coronavirus pandemics, current studies, risk factors, and thorough explanation on pathophysiology of the psychiatric sequalae in COVID-19 survivors.","Putri, Arisa, Hananto, Hariyanto, Kurniawan","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i10.821","20211104","COVID-19; Mental disorders; Psychiatrics sequelae; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21276,""
"A Questionnaire-based Survey on Depression and Anxiety among Rheumatology Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Patient's Perspective","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a global pandemic and has caught the attention of the rheumatology fraternity, where patients are thought to be at higher risk of infection. We aimed to study the incidence of COVID-19 infection and depression and anxiety symptoms among patients with rheumatic disease (RD) in Hospital Selayang, Malaysia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted via phone interview using a structured questionnaire in patients with RD aged &gt; 18 years old scheduled for clinic appointments from 4 to 28 May 2020, which coincided with the second wave of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. The questionnaire included demographics, COVID-19 screening questions, depression and anxiety symptoms screening using questions derived from the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2). Among the 361 patients enrolled, the majority were females (83.1%), and over half (54.3%) were ethnic Malays, 41.6% had rheumatoid arthritis, 34.6% had systemic lupus erythematosus, 12.2% had spondyloarthropathy, and only one (0.3%) patient had COVID-19 infection. The mean age of patients was 48.2 years (range: 16-80 years). The frequency of patients with depression and anxiety symptoms was 8.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Married patients reported feeling more anxious (<i>p =</i>0.013), while patients with tertiary education levels reported feeling more depressed (<i>p =</i>0.012). The incidence of COVID-19 infection is low, probably due to the low rate of testing. Depression and anxiety symptoms reported by patients in our cohort were modest. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has a greater impact on married patients with RD and those with a higher education level.","Lim, Tay, Bhullar, Baharuddin, Ch'ng, Yusoof, Zain, Rosman","https://doi.org/10.5001/omj.2022.34","20211104","Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Malaysia; Patient Health Questionnaire; Rheumatic Diseases; Rheumatology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21277,""
"Psychotherapy as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Coping Strategies and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the development of several risk factors for mental health, not only for people directly infected but also for those experiencing social isolation, loneliness, and concern for their health. The impact of these factors on individuals' health and well-being also depends on the type of coping strategies adopted. Moreover, one of the main effects of COVID-19 is the increase in the prevalence of people who manifest anxious or depressive syndromes. This study investigates the relationship between coping strategies and a multidimensional assessment of anxiety symptoms measured during the COVID-19 pandemic in people who were having psychotherapy sessions, while participating in the study had psychotherapy sessions (clinical group) and those who have never done them (non-clinical group). The results of a questionnaire administered online to Italian subjects from June to July, 2020 were analyzed through multiple linear regressions methods to evaluate the role of psychotherapy as moderator between anxiety symptoms and coping strategies. The results of this study highlight that there are substantial differences in functioning between the clinical and non-clinical groups, underlying the key role of psychotherapy as a moderator between anxiety and the coping strategies of avoidance, social support, and positive attitude.","Merlo, Nicastro, Taibi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.764347","20211104","COVID-19; anxiety; coping strategies; mental health; psychotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21278,""
"Comorbid Anxiety and Depression and Related Factors Among Pregnant and Postpartum Chinese Women During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","<b>Objective:</b> To identify the prevalence of comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) and analyze the relationship between CAD and sociodemographic and obstetric-related variables in pregnant and postpartum Chinese women during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Participants were 2,237 pregnant and postpartum women (aged 19-47 years) who visited various medical institutions in China between February 28, 2020, and April 26, 2020. They were asked to complete an online survey assessing the anxiety and depression, obstetric characteristics, and sociodemographic variables. The women were grouped into the following categories in accordance with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9): (a) CAD, (b) ""anxiety only,"" (c) ""depression only,"" and (d) ""no depression or anxiety."" After estimating the prevalence of CAD, ""anxiety only,"" and ""depression only,"" we carried out chi-squared tests and multiple logistic regression analysis to examine the related factors between these groups of pregnant and postpartum Chinese women. <b>Results:</b> Comorbid anxiety and depression, ""anxiety only,"" and ""depression only,"" occurred in 6.3, 5.8, and 3.9% of participants, respectively. The prevalence rates of CAD during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and the postpartum period were found to be 7.4, 6.5, 5.7, and 8.2%, respectively. The factors that differed among the groups were age (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), marital status (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), level of education (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), family support (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and total live births (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

"Intervention Effect of Long-Term Aerobic Training on Anxiety, Depression, and Sleep Quality of Middle School Students With Depression After COVID-19","<b>Objective:</b> To explore the effects of using RPE exercise intensity monitoring methods and 12-week mid- and low-intensity team aerobic training on anxiety, depression and sleep quality of depressed middle school students after the COVID-19 epidemic. <b>Methods:</b> All study participants were all from a boarding middle school in Chongqing, China. All study participants were screened by the self-rating depression scale and reached the diagnostic criteria for depression. The study subjects were divided into a control group (<i>N</i> = 35) and an exercise group (<i>N</i> = 34). The exercise group performed 30-min night aerobic running four times a week. Use the Borg 6-20 rating of perceived exertion scale (RPE) as a monitoring tool for exercise intensity, and control the exercise intensity at RPE = 11-14. And the control group studied and lived normally. The experiment lasted 12 weeks in total. After the experiment, there were 34 people in the control group and 23 people in the exercise group. The subjects' anxiety, depression and Pittsburgh sleep quality were scored before and after the experiment. <b>Results:</b> After intervention, the depression index (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) of the exercise group was significantly lower than that of the control group. <b>Conclusion:</b> Using the RPE exercise intensity monitoring method for 12 weeks of mid- and low-intensity team aerobic training can improve the depressive symptoms of depressed middle school students, and it is beneficial to improve the students' mental health.","Luo, Song, Yang, Huang, Zhou, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.720833","20211104","aerobic exercise; anxiety; depression; middle school students; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21280,""
"Psychological Status Associated With Low Quality of Life in School-Age Children With Neurodevelopmental Disorders During COVID-19 Stay-At-Home Period","<b>Background:</b> This study seeks to ascertain how the COVID-19 stay-at-home period has affected the quality of life (QOL) of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) who had experienced sleep schedules alteration and clarify what psychological status predicted low QOL in children with and without altered sleep patterns. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Study participants were 86 children between 8 and 17 years of age (mean age, 11.7 years; 70 boys, 16 girls; mean intellectual quotient, 83.6). QOL was evaluated using the self-assessment KINDL<sup>R</sup>. Participants answered questions regarding depression and anxiety on a visual analog scale (VAS) for temporary mood. Their parents answered questionnaires regarding their maladaptive behaviors and differences in sleep patterns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The student's <i>t</i>-test was performed to examine the presence or absence of sleep changes in the children, which affected QOL, temporary mood, and maladaptive behaviors. Multiple or simple linear regression analyses were also performed to identify the psychogenic factors that significantly affected decreased QOL for each group with and without changes in sleep schedule. <b>Results:</b> During the COVID-19 stay-at-home period, 46.5% of participants experienced changes in sleep patterns. These changes were associated with decreased QOL as well as internalized symptoms. The decreased QOL of children with sleep patterns changed was predicted by a high level of depression. In addition, low QOL in children with unchanged sleep patterns was predicted by a high level of depression and low current mood status. <b>Conclusions:</b> Almost half of the participants experienced a poor sleep schedule during the stay-at-home period. These alterations in sleep patterns were associated with a low QOL. The QOL of children with a stable life schedule was affected not only by depressive tendencies but also temporary moods. Therefore, they need to live a fulfilling life to maintain their QOL. However, the QOL of children with poor sleep patterns was affected only by depressive tendencies. Hence, clinicians need to ensure that children with NDDs are well-diagnosed with depression and treated for sleep problems.","Ueda, Okada, Kita, Ozawa, Inoue, Shioda, Kono, Kono, Nakamura, Amemiya, Ito, Sugiura, Matsuoka, Kaiga, Kubota, Ozawa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.676493","20211104","COVID-19; children; depression; neurodevelopmental disorders; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21281,""
"Neurological Manifestations in COVID-19 Population: A Short Review","Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a neuroinvasive potential, which has been discussed in various research papers. During the current pandemic, the novel CoV, i.e., SARS-CoV-2, is causing a considerable number of fatalities and posing a great danger of a recurrent epidemic. COVID-19 has been labeled as a public health emergency of international concern, and the epidemic curves are on the rise. Some studies discuss the neurological implications of SARS-CoV-2 but in light of growing number of evidences we cannot ignore the planning of mental health care settings in COVID-19. We are discussing how this novel CoV can affect the human brain directly and indirectly, including psychiatric problems, and how neurological conditions can be explored as a diagnostic tool in COVID-19 by analyzing cohort studies and review papers that discuss the recent neurological findings in COVID-19. Current research and review papers were searched to find out any relation between the COVID-19 disease and the altered mental health. This study attempts to find out neurological symptoms in a large population affected by COVID-19 and thus filtering out individual case reports and cohort studies which have a patient pool of less than 50. This unique observation revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has direct neurological manifestations such as anosmia and gustatory impairment, encephalopathy, and seizures as well as an indirect effect on the psychiatric health such as anxiety, amnesia, etc. because of psychosocial stress. The most commonly reported neurological symptoms should not be ignored and must be tested for COVID-19. More neurological studies like medical imaging and neuropathology should be performed on these COVID-19 patients.","Singh, Agarwal","https://doi.org/10.1177/0972753121990247","20211104","COVID-19; Coronavirus; neuroimaging; neuroinvasion; neurology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21282,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on sickness absence for mental ill health in National Health Service staff","To explore the patterns of sickness absence in National Health Service (NHS) staff attributable to mental ill health during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in March-July 2020. Case-referent analysis of a secondary dataset. NHS Trusts in England. Pseudonymised data on 959Ã¢â‚¬â€°356 employees who were continuously employed by NHS trusts during 1 January 2019 to 31 July 2020. Trends in the burden of sickness absence due to mental ill health from 2019 to 2020 according to demographic, regional and occupational characteristics. Over the study period, 164Ã¢â‚¬â€°202 new sickness absence episodes for mental ill health were recorded in 12.5% (119Ã¢â‚¬â€°525) of the study sample. There was a spike of sickness absence for mental ill health in March-April 2020 (899Ã¢â‚¬â€°730Ã¢â‚¬â€°days lost) compared with 519Ã¢â‚¬â€°807Ã¢â‚¬â€°days in March-April 2019; the surge was driven by an increase in new episodes of long-term absence and had diminished by May/June 2020. The increase was greatest in those aged &gt;60 years (227%) and among employees of Asian and Black ethnic origin (109%-136%). Among doctors and dentists, the number of days absent declined by 12.7%. The biggest increase was in London (122%) and the smallest in the East Midlands (43.7%); the variation between regions reflected the rates of COVID-19 sickness absence during the same period. Although the COVID-19 epidemic led to an increase in sickness absence attributed to mental ill health in NHS staff, this had substantially declined by May/June 2020, corresponding with the decrease in pressures at work as the first wave of the epidemic subsided.","van der Plaat, Edge, Coggon, van Tongeren, Muiry, Parsons, Cullinan, Madan","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054533","20211104","COVID-19; epidemiology; infectious diseases; mental health; occupational &amp; industrial medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21283,""
"Acute psychosis and serotonin syndrome in the setting of ""Triple-C"" overdose: a case report","Over-the-counter medication overdose is a difficult diagnostic challenge for many physicians as common drug screening assays cannot detect these substances. We present a case of acute psychosis, serotonin syndrome, and anticholinergic overdose-like properties in the setting of Coricidin HBP Cough &amp; Cold tablets, known by their street name Triple-C. This is the first case report we are aware of involving a patient presenting with these symptoms and requiring critical-care-level support. A 31-year-old African American female with a past medical history of anxiety, childhood asthma, previous methamphetamine abuse, and coronavirus disease 2019 infection in August 2020 was brought to the emergency department by the local police department with altered mental status. Initial blood work, including extended drug screens, were unremarkable for a definitive diagnosis. This patient required critical-care-level support and high sedation because of her symptoms. Collateral history revealed the patient regularly consumed Triple-C daily for the 6Ã‚Â weeks prior to admission. A trial off sedation was attempted after 24Ã‚Â hours with no complications. The patient admitted to regular Triple-C consumption and auditory hallucinations since adolescence. She was discharged safely after 48Ã‚Â hours back into the community. She was lost to follow-up with psychiatry and internal medicine; however, she was evaluated in the emergency room 1Ã‚Â month later with a similar psychiatric presentation.

"Influence of a Stay-At-Home Order on Trauma Volume and Injury Patterns at a Level I Trauma Center in Ohio","Changes in injury patterns during the COVID pandemic have been reported in other states. The objective was to explore changes to trauma service volume and admission characteristics at a trauma center in northeast Ohio during a stay-at-home order (SAHO) and compare the 2020 data to historic trauma census data. Retrospective chart review of adult trauma patients admitted to a level I trauma center in northeast Ohio. Trauma admissions from January 21 to July 21, 2020 (COVID period) were compared to date-matched cohorts of trauma admissions from 2018 to 2019 (historic period). The COVID period was further categorized as pre-SAHO, active-SAHO, and post-SAHO. The SAHO was associated with a reduction in trauma center admissions that increased after the SAHO (<i>P</i> = .0033). Only outdoor recreational vehicle (ORV) injuries (<i>P</i> = .0221) and self-inflicted hanging (<i>P</i> = .0028) mechanisms were increased during the COVID period and had substantial effect sizes. Glasgow Coma Scores were lower during the COVID period (<i>P</i> = .0286) with a negligible effect size. Violence-related injuries, injury severity, mortality, and admission characteristics including alcohol and drug testing and positivity were similar in the COVID and historic periods. The SAHO resulted in a temporary decrease in trauma center admissions. Although ORV and hanging mechanisms were increased, other mechanisms such as alcohol and toxicology proportions, injury severity, length of stay, and mortality were unchanged.","Huang, Chance, Dunham","https://doi.org/10.1177/00031348211047488","20211104","COVID-19; stay-at-home order; substance abuse; trauma; traumatic injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-05","",21286,""
