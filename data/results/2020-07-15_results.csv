In this article, we relate our experiences since the Covid-19 crisis to the lessons we have learned over time as mental health professionals working with families in no-cost, student-managed community comprehensive health clinics in academic-community partnerships. We compare and contrast the learnings of flexibility of time, space, procedures or attendance we acquired in this clinical community setting during regular times, with the new challenges families and therapists face, and the adaptations needed to continue to work with our clients in culturally responsive and empowering ways during the Covid-19 pandemic. We describe families, students, professionals, promotoras (community links) and IT support staff joining together in solidarity as the creative problem solvers of new possibilities when families do not have access to Wifi, smart phones or computers, or suffer overcrowding and lack of privacy. We describe many anxieties related to economic insecurity or fear of facing death alone, but also how to visualize expanding possibilities in styles of parenting or types of emotional support among family members as elements of hope that may endure beyond these unprecedented tragic times of loss and uncertainty.","Falicov, NiÃƒÂ±o, D'Urso","https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12578","20200714","Community Clinic; Covid-19 Impact; Health Disparities; Immigrants; Latinx; Telehealth; Under Resourced","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-15","",2734,""
"Anxiety and depression and its correlates in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke-out in Wuhan China in December 2019, and spread throughout the entire country within a short time. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated risk factors were analysed in patients with COVID-19. This single-center cross-sectional study focussed on measuring depression and anxiety using self-report scales. Linear regression was used to determine independent predictors for depression and anxiety. A total of 78 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were diagnosed in 35.9% and 38.5% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis found female gender was an independent predictor for higher depression severity index. Having family members who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and family members who died from COVID-19 were independently associated with higher depression severity index and anxiety score. Patients with COVID-19 especially those who had family members diagnosed with COVID-19 or died from COVID-19 were more susceptible to depression and anxiety than were other patients. Effective strategies should be pursued to improve the mental health of this patient population. Key points Patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Female patients were associated with higher risk of depression. Patients with family members diagnosed as COVID-19 or died from this disease were associated with higher risk of depression and anxiety.","Nie, Wang, Wang, Zhao, Liu, Zhu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2020.1791345","20200714","COVID-19; Depression; anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-15","",2735,""

"Development of the Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS)","Abstract Parenting is critical to creating and maintaining healthy child development. Importantly, there are multiple determinants of effective parenting, including the psychological resources of the parent, contextual sources of stress and support, and characteristics of the child. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in colossal disruptions to family life, and has fundamentally altered the landscape of parenting. In the face of escalating infection and mortality rates, rising unemployment, financial insecurity, school closures, and shelter-in-place orders, parents have had to create new environments in which their children can flourish while, in many cases, continuing to juggle ongoing work, health, and emotional stressors of their own. Several recent reviews have offered a variety of recommendations for parents to promote child well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, no measures have been developed to assess how parents have adapted their parenting behaviors in response to the pandemic. To better understand the lasting impact of the pandemic on childrenâ€™s socioemotional health and well-being, we urgently need to characterize the impact of the pandemic on parenting practices. Accordingly, the current study developed the 24-item Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS) to assess behaviors enacted by parents to mitigate infection risk, manage childrenâ€™s social and emotional needs, structure childrenâ€™s activities, help with schoolwork or education, and promote physical activity. The scale is available in English and Spanish and is freely accessible for research, educational, or scientific purposes. We anticipate the PIPS being employed in studies alongside other, validated measures of parenting practices, parenting stress, or parental burnout, as well as in relation to measures of child mental health and resilience in the face of the pandemic.","Rebecca Waller et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-521-BA3","20200714","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; family; dads; childhood; parents; moms; home environment; children; covid-19; adolescence; parenting practices; parent-child relationships; parenting","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-15","",2742,""

Exclusion criteria included clinical pharmacological trials, and studies using psychophysiological or biological recordings. The study protocol was previously pre-registered in https://osf.io/bk3gw/. Findings: Twenty-eight studies were identified. More than 75% met the requirements related to reporting key methodological and statistical information. However, 89.3% used convenience samples and 92.86% lacked of a priori power analysis. There was low compliance with open science recommendations, such as pre-registration of studies (0%) and availability of databases (3.57%), which raise concerns about the validity, generalisability, and reproducibility of the findings. Interpretation: While the importance of offering rapid evidence-based responses to mitigate mental health problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic is undeniable, it should not be done at the expense of sacrificing scientific rigor. The results of this study may stimulate researchers and funding agencies to try to orchestrate efforts and resources and follow standard codes of good science.","Ines Nieto et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-73A-AF7","20200714","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; mental health; systematic review; covid-19; research quality","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-15","",2743,""
