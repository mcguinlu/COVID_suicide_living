"Associations between moral injury and ICD-11 post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD among help-seeking nurses: a cross-sectional study","This study aimed to evaluate how moral injury (MI), traumatic experiences and daily stressors were related to the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and International Classification of Diseases 11th revision specific complex PTSD (CPTSD) symptoms of disturbances in self-organisation (DSO) in a treatment-seeking sample of nurses. A cross-sectional study. Nurses from all regions of Lithuania participated in the study. The data were collected between April and May 2021. A total of 206 nurses, mean age 42.34 years (SD=11.68), 97.1% women and with 65% &gt;10 years of work experience. The prevalence of PTSD and CPTSD in the treatment-seeking sample of nurses was 9.2% and 10.2%, respectively. The results of structural equation modelling indicated an acceptable model fit for the model regarding the links between trauma exposure, daily stressors, MI, PTSD and DSO symptoms, (Ãâ€¡2 (df)=219.718 (123), p&lt;0.001, Comparative Fit Index/Tucker-Lewis Index=0.937/0.922, root mean square error of approximation (90%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=0.062 (0.048 to 0.075), standardised root mean square residual=0.049). MI had a large effect on DSO symptoms, ÃŽÂ²=0.667, p&lt;0.001, and a medium effect on PTSD symptoms, ÃŽÂ²=0.394, p&lt;0.001. Daily stress but not trauma exposure was significantly related to MI, ÃŽÂ²=0.618, p&lt;0.001. The prevalence of PTSD and CPTSD in a treatment-seeking sample of nurses inform healthcare administrators, policymakers and medical staff about the demand for psychosocial interventions for healthcare workers focused on stress management to address their daily stressors and mitigate effects on MI or trauma-focused treatments for PTSD/CPTSD.

"How has physical distancing impacted on health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic? A Scottish longitudinal qualitative study","This study provides an in-depth understanding of the impact of physical distancing restrictions and other quarantining measures during the first 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health and well-being. Longitudinal qualitative research using semistructured interviews at two time points (21 May to 10 June 2020 when the first restrictions were eased, and 2 to 26 August 2020 when many restrictions had been eased, but physical distancing measures remained) and framework analysis. Interviews by telephone or video call in Scotland. Thirty participants: 16 women, 93% reporting white ethnicity, 18+ years, 47% from deprived areas, 47% reported mental and/or physical health conditions. Four main themes described the impact of physical distancing restrictions on (1) health behaviours; (2) healthcare access; (3) physical health; and (4) mental health. Changes in impact over the two time points were compared. For example, health behaviours in May/June, such as reduced physical activity and increased calorie intake, appeared to improve by August. From May/June to August, an increasing number of participants expressed dissatisfaction with healthcare they received. Participants with existing physical health conditions reported continued negative impact of restrictions on their physical health. All participants reported some negative mental health impact, mostly anxiety. An increasing number reported mental health improvements in August, with those with mental health conditions or under 30 years reporting improvement most frequently. In line with previous research, our participants felt able to return to prepandemic health habits. Our findings corroborate evidence of reduced preventive healthcare use and help-seeking behaviours. People with existing health conditions appear to be most vulnerable to negative mental and physical health impacts of physical distancing. These negative impacts and periods of unhealthy behaviours have potential long-term consequences, especially among already underserved groups. We recommend public health and policy strategies to mitigate long-term impacts of physical distancing.","Kotzur, O'Connor, Robb","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054506","20220509","COVID-19; mental health; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31097,""
"Negotiating agency and belonging during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic: an interview study among older adults in England, UK","The aim of this study was to explore the agency of older adults and their strategies to restructure ways of being and belonging in a rapidly and radically changed social environment during the UK's first COVID-19 lockdown in Spring 2020. Qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews. Findings were derived from a thematic analysis of interview transcripts. We also established a patient and public involvement and engagement group who advised on study design, interview topic guide and interpretation of findings. Interviews were conducted online with older adults in the UK through their platform of choice in Spring 2020 in England, UK. We conducted 28 interviews (16 women, 12 men) with older adults over the age of 70 years. Our participants were mostly white, middle class adults. From the data, we constructed three strategies that older adults used to employ agency and create spaces of belonging in their social networks despite lockdown restrictions. First, participants created a sense of belonging by being 'good' members of society who were knowledgeable about COVID-19. Second, older adults created new ways to socially engage with the wider community. Finally, older adults actively restructured social networks to preserve a sense of belonging. Older adults are actively and creatively carving a space of belonging during the societal upheaval in response to the COVID-19 lockdown and public health restrictions. Rather than internalising potential exclusionary messages based on their age, older adults instead used their agency to reimagine and transform spheres of belonging.","Wenning, Polidano, Mallen, Dikomitis","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-060405","20220509","mental health; public health; qualitative research; social medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31098,""
"Cohort profile: intimate partner violence and mental health among women from refugee background and a comparison group of Australian-born - the WATCH cohort study","The Women Aware with Their Children study was created because prospective data are required to accurately guide prevention programmes for intimate partner violence (IPV) and to improve the mental health and resettlement trajectories of women from refugee backgrounds in Australia. 1335Ã¢â‚¬â€°women (685 consecutively enrolled from refugee backgrounds and 650 randomly selected Australian-born) recruited during pregnancy from three public antenatal clinics in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. The mean age was 29.7 years among women from refugee backgrounds and 29.0 years among women born in the host nation. Main measures include IPV, mood, panic, post-traumatic stress disorder, disability and living difficulties. Prevalence of IPV at all three time points is significantly higher for refugee-background women. The trend data showed that reported IPV rates among Australian-born women increased from 25.8% at time 1 to 30.1% at time 3, while for refugee-background women this rate declined from 44.4% at time 1 to 42.6% at time 3. Prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) at all three time points is higher for refugee-background women. MDD among Australian-born women significantly declined from 14.5% at time 1 to 9.9% at time 3, while for refugee-background women it fluctuated from 25.1% at time 1 to 17.3% at time 2 and to 19.1% at time 3. We are currently examining trajectories of IPV and mental disorder across four time points. Time 4 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling a unique opportunity to examine the impacts of the pandemic over time. Time 5 started in August 2021 and time 6 will begin approximately 12 months later.

"Recording and evaluating affect and coping during COVID-19 in healthcare workers and outcomes (REACCH-Out): mental health implications for our junior doctor cohort","The announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 had a huge impact on surgical practice in the UK. Many surgical trainees were redeployed to areas within the hospital to provide additional cover during this time. Providing adequate well-being and support to trainees is imperative during such times of hardship.18 plastic surgery junior doctors were redeployed to either intensive care units, emergency departments or medical wards during the period of intervention. A 2-3 weekly quantitative survey was completed by trainees which aimed to explore rates of anxiety, depression and coping during the first peak of the pandemic. A 'COVID-19 Care Package' was provided and regular interactions with the parent team was encouraged via the online platform of Zoom to support surgical junior doctors.The average anxiety score for trainees exceeded that regarded as 'normal' as predicted by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Core surgical-level trainees were found to show higher scores of anxiety and depression throughout the course of project as compared with their senior specialty registrar counterparts. 43.8% of junior doctors reported greater levels of stress since the announcement of the pandemic. 81% of junior doctors stated they would value regular check-ins with work colleagues during difficult times.Providing a strong support system for trainees is vital to ensure doctors are not overwhelmed during potentially volatile times in their careers. The use of psychological monitoring tools to guide the implementation of appropriate levels of support for individuals could aid in enhanced junior doctor well-being and support. Feedback from surveys during this time of study suggests that surgical trainees agree that contact with their parent team and colleagues has a positive impact on their well-being and trainees value regular 'check-ins' with their colleagues on a monthly basis.","Akbar, McNally","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001643","20220509","COVID-19; Medical education; Mental health; Surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31100,""
"Psychopathological burden and coping strategies among frontline and second-line Italian healthcare workers facing the COVID-19 emergency: Findings from the COMET collaborative network","The aim of this study was to explore the psychopathological burden related to COVID-19 together with coping strategies in healthcare workers, focusing on differences between frontline and second-line workers. This is a cross-sectional study part of the COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET). Participants' socio-demographic and COVID-19-related information was collected through an online survey. Psychiatric symptoms and coping strategies were also investigated. Multivariate analyses, corrected for demographic characteristics, were adopted to assess differences between frontline and second-line workers. The sample consisted of 20,720 individuals. Healthcare workers (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2907) presented with significantly higher risk for mental health disturbances as compared to the rest of the sample (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Healthcare professionals working versus not working on the front line differed in living in severely impacted areas (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), precautionary isolation by COVID-19 (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), infection by COVID-19 (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Frontline workers also reported significantly increased insomnia (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), depression (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.007), anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), non-specific chronic and acute traumatic stress (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), as well as more adaptive coping strategies (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). The survey was conducted between March and June 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Accordingly, the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic might have changed over time. The survey design involved online invitation and it was not possible to assess the participation rate. To our knowledge, this is the largest study addressing the psychopathological burden of Italian healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak and associated coping strategies.

"Prospectively Assessed Long-Term Outcomes of Patients with E-cigarette or Vaping-associated Lung Injury (EVALI)","E-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) was first identified in 2019. The long-term respiratory, cognitive, mood disorder, and vaping behavior outcomes of patients with EVALI remain unknown. To determine the long-term respiratory, cognitive, mood disorder, and vaping behavior outcomes of patients with EVALI. We prospectively enrolled patients with EVALI from two health systems. We assessed outcomes at one-year after onset of EVALI using validated instruments measuring: cognitive function, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, respiratory disability, Covid-19 infection, pulmonary function, and vaping behaviors. We used multivariable regression to identify risk factors of post-EVALI vaping behaviors and to identify whether admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was associated with cognitive, respiratory, or mood symptoms. Seventy-three patients completed 12-month follow-up. Most patients were male (66.7%), young (mean age 31 Ã‚Â± 11 years), White (85%), and did not need admission to the ICU (59%). At 12-months, 39% (25 of 64) had cognitive impairment, while 48% (30 of 62) reported respiratory limitations. Mood disorders were common with 59% (38 of 64) reporting anxiety and/or depression and 62% (39 of 63) had post-traumatic stress. 6.4% (4 of 64) reported a history of Covid-19 infection. Despite the history of EVALI, many people continued to vape. Only 38% (24 of 64) reported quitting all vaping and smoking behaviors. Younger age was associated with reduced vaping behavior post-EVALI (OR=0.93, p=0.02). ICU admission was not associated with cognitive impairment, dyspnea, or mood symptoms. Patients with EVALI, despite their youth, commonly have significant long-term respiratory disability, cognitive impairment, symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and persistent vaping.","Blagev, Callahan, Harris, Collingridge, Hopkins, Eve, Waddoups, Aston, Brown, Lanspa","https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202201-049OC","20220509","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31102,""
"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and the Risk of Suicidal and Self-Harm Thoughts and Behaviour: A Systematic Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a complex impact on risks of suicide and non-fatal self-harm worldwide with some evidence of increased risk in specific populations including women, young people, and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. This review aims to systematically address whether SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 disease confer elevated risk directly. As part of a larger Living Systematic Review examining self-harm and suicide during the pandemic, automated daily searches using a broad list of keywords were performed on a comprehensive set of databases with data from relevant articles published between January 1, 2020 and July 18, 2021. Eligibility criteria for our present review included studies investigating suicide and/or self-harm in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 with or without manifestations of COVID-19 disease with a comparator group who did not have infection or disease. Suicidal and self-harm thoughts and behaviour (STBs) were outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if they reported data for people who only had potential infection/disease without a confirmed exposure, clinical/molecular diagnosis or self-report of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Studies of news reports, treatment studies, and ecological studies examining rates of both SARS-CoV-2 infections and suicide/self-harm rates across a region were also excluded. We identified 12 studies examining STBs in nine distinct samples of people with SARS-CoV-2. These studies, which investigated STBs in the general population and in subpopulations, including healthcare workers, generally found positive associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 disease and subsequent suicidal/self-harm thoughts and suicidal/self-harm behaviour. This review identified some evidence that infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or COVID-19 disease may be associated with increased risks for suicidal and self-harm thoughts and behaviours but a causal link cannot be inferred. Further research with longer follow-up periods is required to confirm these findings and to establish whether these associations are causal.","Sinyor, Zaheer, Webb, Knipe, Eyles, Higgins, McGuinness, Schmidt, Macleod-Hall, Dekel, Gunnell, John","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437221094552","20220509","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; self-harm; suicide; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31103,""
"Mental Health Gap Action Programme training in Nigeria: reflections for progressive learning among primary care workers","In the majority of low- and middle-income countries, mental healthcare is delivered by primary care workers. Often, they are the only contact for patients and their families. Although their knowledge base can be limited, they are expected to manage complex cases with few resources. The authors describe their experience of partnership with mental health centres set up by the Nigeria Health Care Project, and training their primary care workers based on the World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Programme. Although the programme was very effective in helping to upskill their knowledge and experience, a need for continued professional development was highlighted. Based on their feedback, multiple evidence-based options are explored, including the use of remote learning and social media (increased significantly around the world because of the COVID-19 pandemic), to help primary care workers improve their knowledge base and maintain their competencies with the limited resources available.","Ali, Chakraborty","https://doi.org/10.1192/bji.2021.32","20220509","Mental health; primary care; training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31104,""

"Protective Behaviors for COVID-19 Were Associated With Fewer Psychological Impacts on Nurses: A Cross-Sectional Study in Taiwan","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased psychological distress among common people and has caused health care providers, such as nurses, to experience tremendous stress. This prospective cross-sectional study assessed the psychological impacts on nurses in a community hospital in Taiwan, including major depressive disorder (MDD), posttraumatic stress (PTS), and pessimism. According to transactional theory, coping strategies and personal factors have psychological impacts. We hypothesized that behavioral responses to COVID-19 (problem-focused coping) are more effective in reducing psychological impacts than emotional responses to COVID-19 (emotion-focused coping). Independent variables were the use of behavioral and emotional coping strategies for COVID-19 and 3 personal factors, namely sleep disturbance, physical component summary (PCS-12), and mental component summary (MCS-12) of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) obtained from the Medical Outcomes Study. Dependent variables comprised 3 psychological impacts, namely MDD, PTS, and pessimism. We determined that behavioral coping strategies had significant negative effects on PTS and pessimism; however, emotional coping strategies had significantly positive effects on PTS and pessimism. Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with increased MDD and pessimism. PCS-12 had a significant negative effect on PTS, whereas MCS-12 was not significantly associated with any of the 3 psychological impacts. Nurses who adopted protective behavior against COVID-19, such as washing hands, wearing masks, avoiding touching eyes, and mouth, and avoiding personal contact, were associated with less posttraumatic stress and pessimism. Healthcare providers should consider strategies for improving preventive behaviors to help ease their worries and fears concerning COVID-19.","Yen, Chan, Lin, Yeh","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580221096278","20220509","COVID-19; coping strategies; cross-sectional study; depression; posttraumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31106,""
"Mental health and protective strategies among community-based health workers in region 3, Philippines during COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 crisis in the Philippines posed both physical and psychological threats to health workers.

This study determined the prevalence of mental health outcomes among community-based health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined the association of protective strategies with symptoms of mental health outcomes. A cross-sectional study design was applied to the records of community-based health workers conducted through online psychological assessment by Department of Health - Central Luzon between September 1-30, 2020. Respondents' age, sex, mental health status, and protective strategies were extracted using Abstraction Form, and analyses were done using OpenEpi. A total of 324 records of community-based health workers were included in the analysis. Ten percent of the respondents present symptoms of stress, 26% anxiety symptoms, and 18% depressive symptoms. The majority of the respondents were using deep breathing techniques, having a constant social connection with family and friends, and engaging in their regular spiritual/religious activities as protective strategies during the pandemic. Engagement in regular spiritual/religious practices was found associated with symptoms of stress through Fisher's exact test. Participants who engaged in religious/spiritual practices were less likely to report symptoms of stress. Community-based health workers showed evident rates of symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. The majority of the participants engaged in various protective strategies but only engagement in regular religious/spiritual practices was found associated with symptoms of stress.","Bangalan","https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2022.2069666","20220509","COVID-19; Mental health; health workers; pandemic; protective strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31107,""

"Mental health in COVID-19 Delta variant survivors and healthcare workers during 2021 outbreak in Nanjing, China: a cross-sectional study","Since COVID-19 Delta variant was discovered in India in October 2020, it has rapidly triggered a second outbreak globally. However, the effects of COVID-19 Delta variant on mental health in survivors and healthcare workers is unclear. To assess the mental health among COVID-19 Delta variant survivors and healthcare workers, and analyze the possible impact factors. This survey-based, cross-sectional study used the Symptom Check List 90 - Revised (SCL90-R) questionnaire to evaluate psychological status among 60 COVID-19 Delta variant survivors, 162 nurses, and 72 hygienists in Nanjing, China. 3 indices and 9 dimensions were compared among job, education level, gender, age, marriage classification. Data was analyzed using SPSS 25.0. Mental distress among participants was not very serious in general. The survivors presented the highest score, then the hygienists, and the lowest in nurses. Low-educated and women showed significant increase. No significant difference was noted in age and marriage classification.

"A comparison of telehealth versus in-person group therapy: Results from a DBT-based dual diagnosis IOP","The effectiveness of remotely delivered group interventions and treatments for individuals with more complex psychiatric presentations is understudied. Nevertheless, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic shifted such treatments from in-person to remote service delivery without the establishment of comparable effectiveness between in-person and remote delivery. The current study presents the results of a private practice's transition from in-person treatment delivery to a videoconference-delivered Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)-based intensive outpatient program (IOP) for individuals with comorbid mental health and substance use disorder diagnoses in response to the pandemic. Change in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress following completion of the IOP was compared between the in-person and videoconference groups. Large reductions in symptoms were found following completion of the IOP for both the in-person and videoconference groups. Furthermore, no significant differences in symptom reduction were found between the groups. Although large-scale replication is needed, these results suggest that IOPs and other intensive group therapies delivered via videoconference may be as effective as in-person therapies, even among individuals with more complex psychiatric presentations. Providers who have transitioned group therapies to videoconference formats or are considering creating remote groups can be more confident that they are not sacrificing treatment efficacy.","Bean, Aurora, Maddox, Mekota, Updegraff","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23374","20220509","Dialectical Behavior Therapy; Telehealth; anxiety; depression; intensive outpatient program; videoconference","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31110,""
"Social and Psychological Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Adolescents' and Young Adults' Mental Health: A Cross-Cultural Mediation Study","The ongoing pandemic has dramatically disrupted daily life, increasing the risk of developing psychiatric disorders and poor mental wellbeing. The compound effects of social, political and psychological stressors have increased psychological symptoms among adolescents and young people, with worries about COVID-19 playing a central role in the clinical course of their mental health problems caused by the pandemic. The aim of this cross-cultural study was to examine the social psychological effects of COVID-19 on adolescents' and young people's mental health and wellbeing in Ibero-American population. Participants involved 6,283 adolescents and young adults from five different Spanish-Speaking countries (83.7% female) aged between 12 and 30Ã‚Â years (<i>M</i> = 18.79; <i>SD</i> = 3.48). Participants completed the Worries about COVID-19 and its Consequences Scale (W-COV), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Descriptive analyses, multivariate ANOVAs and Pearson correlations were performed, as well as Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) testing a mediational model. The results indicate cross-cultural difference in COVID-19 related worries, emotional symptoms and life satisfaction. Results from SEM confirmed the overall indirect effects of COVID-19 cases, political response and participants' conditions during lockdown on depression, anxiety, stress and life satisfaction mediated by COVID-19 related worries. These findings suggest that the social psychological factors underlying psychological symptoms could be partly explained by increased worries about COVID-19 and its personal, social, economic and political consequences, which may offer guidance to policy makers and health services for safeguarding youth mental well-being.","Schoeps, Tamarit, De la Barrera, Lacomba-Trejo, Montoya-Castilla, Del Rosario, Coello, Herrera, Trujillo, Riveros Munevar, Amador Esparza","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221100451","20220509","Ibero-American population; Trans-cultural; emotional symptoms; life satisfaction; structural equation modelling; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31111,""
"The perceived work environment and well-being-a survey of emergency healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care provider well-being has been affected by various challenges in the work environment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the perceived work environment and mental well-being of a sample of emergency medicine (EM) physicians, EM nurses and emergency medical services (EMS) providers during the pandemic. We surveyed EM attending physicians, EM resident physicians, EM nurses and emergency medical service providers from 10 academic sites across the United States. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to estimate the effect of the perceived work environment on screening positive for depression/anxiety and burnout controlling for respondent characteristics. We tested possible predictors in the multivariate regression models and included the predictors that were significant in the final model. Our final sample included 701 emergency health care workers. Almost 23% of respondents screened positive for depression/anxiety and 39.7% for burnout. Nurses were significantly more likely to screen positive for depression/anxiety (aOR=2.04: 95% CI 1.11, 3.86) and burnout (aOR=2.05: 95% CI 1.22, 3.49) compared to attendings. The LCA analysis identified 4 subgroups of our respondents that differed in their responses to the work environment questions. These groups were identified as: Work environment risk group 1, an overall good work environment; risk group 2, inadequate resources; risk group 3, lack of perceived organizational support and risk group 4, an overall poor work environment. Participants in the 2 groups who perceived their work conditions as most adverse were significantly more likely to screen positive for depression/anxiety (aOR=1.89: 95% CI 1.05, 3.42 and aOR=2.04: 95% CI 1.14, 3.66) compared to participants working in environments perceived as less adverse. We found a strong association between a perceived adverse working environment and poor mental health, particularly when organizational support was deemed inadequate.

"Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on refugee communities in San Diego, California: A participatory action research cross-sectional study","While the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people worldwide, refugee communities are particularly vulnerable to the pandemic's social, economic and health impacts. This study assessed factors associated with increases in adverse community effects of COVID-19 in a refugee community in California. This study uses data from a cross-sectional survey developed and administered as part of a participatory action research project by a refugee community organization in San Diego, California. Data was collected between September and November 2020 in a sample of refugee community members (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 517). Multivariable Poisson regression models measured associations between sociodemographic and acculturation measures with seven adverse community effects overall and stratified by duration of residence in the United States. Adverse community effects included job/wage loss, bank/cash access barriers, food insecurity, school interruptions, household violence, substance misuse and poor mental health. Refugee community members reported an average of 2.1 adverse community effects that worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with job/wage loss and poor mental health the most prevalent (84% and 49%). Characteristics associated with reporting increased numbers of adverse community effects included being younger, female, childless, not actively seeking employment, living in the US for six or more years and speaking English at home. Stratified analyses show that these associations were concentrated in refugees who had lived in the US for at least six years. Refugee communities have experienced pervasive job losses and worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and these effects are concentrated in respondents who have lived in the US for six or more years. Additional targeted support is needed to ensure that refugees who have lived in the US for longer durations have the financial and social support needed to cope with the unprecedented challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.","McDougal, Erikat, Yusufi, Sahid, Streuli, Fielding-Miller","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2022.101110","20220509","COVID-19; California; Job loss; Mental health; Refugees; San Diego","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31113,""
"The Feasibility of Providing Remote Functional Family Therapy with Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Method Study","Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, mental health care has largely transferred its services to online platforms, using videoconferencing (VC) or teletherapy. Within the field of family therapy, however, there is little evidence on the feasibility of using VC, especially when working with whole families at the edge of care. This study investigated the feasibility of remote Functional Family Therapy (FFT), using a mixed-method approach. Study 1 consisted of semi-structured interviews with 23 FFT professionals (18 female) about their experience of providing remote FFT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study 2 included monitoring data of 209 FFT clients (46% female, <i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.00) who participated in FFT during the pandemic. We compared families who received mainly in-person, mainly remote or a mix of remote and in-person on client-reported alliance, drop-out, therapist-rated outcomes, and treatment intensity using MANCOVA's and chi-square tests. In Study 1 two themes emerged around experienced challenges, namely 'Feeling in control' and 'Engagement and alliance'. Two other themes emerged around adaptations, namely 'Being more on top' and 'Connecting in different ways'. In Study 2, we found that the therapeutic alliance was not related to using VC. Also, families had less between-session contact during the Engagement and Motivation Phase when receiving mainly VC, but had more sessions and longer therapy when receiving a mix of in-person and remote therapy. The current study suggests that providing systemic family teletherapy to families on the edge of care is feasible. Further development of systemic family teletherapy is warranted.

"Urban parks as a potential mitigator of suicide rates resulting from global pandemics: Empirical evidence from past experiences in Seoul, Korea","Globally, the increased suicide rate of the general population has become a concern not only because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also because of its associated socioeconomic insecurity, loss of jobs, and economic shocks. This study employed robust fixed-effects panel models to empirically identify the mitigating effects of infectious diseases, via urban parks, on the suicide rate, and to examine gender differences in this regard, based on previous experiences in Seoul, Korea. We found that the differentiating mitigating effect did not significantly affect suicide rates during the 2015 MERS epidemic. However, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, wherein the number of confirmed cases was very high and diffused nationwide, urban parks significantly reduced the suicide rates for both men and women. The role of parks as a mitigator was more enhanced in cities with a high number of confirmed cases if it was associated with economic shocks. However, this effect was significant only in the suicide rates of men, not women. During a pandemic, urban parks can help maintain social interaction and sustain physical activities (i.e., walking and exercise) while maintaining physical distance. National and local governments should develop urban parks to actively control the suicide rate influenced by movement restriction measures inevitably occurring during the spread of infectious diseases.","Kim, Sung","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.103725","20220509","COVID-19; Global pandemic; Mitigating effect; Suicide rate; Urban Park","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31116,""
"The cognitive basis of psychosocial impact in COVID-19 pandemic Does it encircle the default mode network of the brain? A pragmatic proposal","Epigenetics, hypothalamic-pituitary axes, environmental and metabolic influences, and transgenerational plasticity govern social behavior. Cognitive research considers the brain's default mode network (DMN) as a central hub that integrates various cognitive and social processing domains responsible for emotion perception, empathy, theory of mind, and morality. Hence, DMN is regarded as the ""social brain."" Upsurge in social turmoil, social anxiety, panic, depression, post-traumatic stress, hoarding, herd behavior, substance and behavioral addictions, sexual abuse, and violence in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic are intricately related to personality traits resulting in disruptive social cognition and social behavior, conceptualized as the result of unsettling and disruption of the functional nexus of the DMN. Considering overt and conspicuous display of neuroticism during the current pandemic, its impact upon modulation of the DMN functional nexus and the DMN itself, and the potential to presage cognitive impairment in the future, the authors caution that an increase in the global burden of dementia may be one of the long-term ramifications of COVID-19. Social behavior, a functional derivative of the DMN, can strikingly affect the functional nexus of DMN and the DMN itself, in a centripetal way via the phenomenon called ""Experience-Dependent Plasticity,"" with long-term consequences. In this review, we intend to 1) decipher the association between social cognition and social behavior with the DMN, in time of COVID-19; and to 2) discuss the prospective aftermath of disrupted social behavior during the pandemic on modulation/alteration of functional connectomes of DMN or the DMN itself in the time ahead.","Dubey, Dubey, Ghosh, Mitchell, Chatterjee, Das, Pandit, Ray, Das, Benito-LeÃƒÂ³n","https://doi.org/10.18103/mra.v10i3.2707","20220509","COVID-19; Cognition; Default mode network; Social Behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31117,""
"Resource utilization of medical waste under COVID-19: Waste mask used as crude oil fluidity improver","The disposal of medical waste has become an increasing environmental issue since the COVID-19 epidemic outbreaks. Conventional disposal methods have produced waste of fossil resources and environmental problems. In this study, the waste medical mask-derived materials were tested as viscosity reducer and pour point depressant to evaluate the possibility of being used as crude oil fluidity improver. The results show that the materials derived from the three parts of the waste medical mask can reduce the viscosity and pour point of each crude oil samples from different oilfields in China. The middle layer of the medical mask (PP-2) displays the highest efficiency, and the viscosity reduction rate and maximum pour point reduction reaches 81% and 8.3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C at 500Ã‚Â ppm, respectively.

"Comparison of Students' Mental Wellbeing, Anxiety, Depression, and Quality of Life During COVID-19's Full and Partial (Smart) Lockdowns: A Follow-Up Study at a 5-Month Interval","Scholars have debated the COVID-19's full and partial lockdowns' effectivity to control the transmission of the new case. They emphasized the provision of required economic and social resources worldwide. Past literature related to COVID-19 has contributed little evidence to examine the efficacy of full and partial lockdown measures with experimental perspectives at different intervals. This study bridges this literature gap and explores the full and smart lockdowns' impacts on Pakistani students' mental health, depression, quality of life, and anxiety symptoms, during the various waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pretest and posttest experimental designed web-based survey recruited 40 students from March 23 to August 23, 2020, and recorded their responses. The study incorporated four standardized psychological instruments to receive the desired datasets related to students' mental health, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Researchers shared data links with the participants via social media, WhatsApp. The study applied one-way and multivariate ANOVA tests (analysis of variance) to draw the desired results. This study's findings suggest that both full and partial COVID-19 lockdowns effectively improve students' mental health and quality of life. These measures help reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms among university students. The study results exhibit that partial lockdown (PL) is more effective in improving quality of life. Besides, PL helps reduce anxiety symptoms than complete lockdown among Pakistani students. The present study's findings suggest that students are vulnerable. They need particular interventions and preventive measures to protect and improve their mental health and quality of life during a global pandemic. As the stressful experience of the epidemic persists in Pakistan. It will also be interesting to examine the psychological impact of the successive waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Aqeel, Rehna, Shuja, Abbas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.835585","20220509","COVID-19 full lockdown; COVID-19 preventive health behavior; anxiety; depression; mental health; quality of life; smart lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31119,""
"Mental Health Problems, Burnout and Resilience in Community Pharmacists during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Cross-Sectional Study","The study aimed to assess burnout, resilience, and levels of depression, anxiety, stress and fear among community pharmacists during the pandemic, and examine if fear of COVID-19 is associated with these outcomes of interest. A cross-sectional survey of community pharmacists in Qatar was conducted. Pharmacists' burnout was measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory: Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel (MBI-HSSÃ¢â€žÂ¢ for MP-Mindgarden). Resilience was assessed using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10). Depression, anxiety, and stress were measured by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Fear of COVID-19 was assessed by the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). 256 respondents completed the survey and were included in the final study analysis (response rate: 42.7%). Overall, participants reported a moderate level of burnout as illustrated in the mean scores of the three burnout dimensions; 20.54 (SD=12.37) for emotional exhaustion, 6.76 (SD=6.22) for depersonalization, and 36.57 (SD=9.95) for personal accomplishment. Moreover, depression, anxiety and stress were reported by 44.8%, 53.2% and 25.4% of particiants respectively. Participants had shown moderate resilience (mean score: 27.64 (SD=8.31)) and their mean score fear of COVID19 was 15.67 (SD=6.54). Fear of COVID-19 was a statistically significant and an independent predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress levels. The pharmacists experienced moderate burnout but moderate resilience, which indicates their potential to overcome difficulties. Future interventions at the personal, national and organizational levels are required to enhance the pharmacists' wellbeing by decreasing stress, improving self-efficacy and resilience, and preventing burnout.","Samir Al Kudsi, Hany Mohamed Mostafa Kamel, El-Awaisi, Shraim, Saffouh El Hajj","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2022.04.015","20220509","Anxiety; Burnout; COVID-19; Community pharmacist; Depression; Mental Health; Qatar, Middle East; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31120,""
"COVID-19 and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in a large multi-site college sample","The COVID-19 pandemic poses unique risks to college students' mental health, and specifically to symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To better understand the relationship between COVID-19 impact and OC symptoms in this population, six colleges from across the US administered a battery of questionnaires and an emotion differentiation paradigm to eligible students (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯841). We examined whether degree of pandemic-related disruption was associated with OC severity, and if so, whether this relationship was explained by trait (poor emotion regulation and differentiation) and state risk factors (poor sleep quality, less exercise frequency, less social support, thwarted sense of belongingness, and greater loneliness). Results indicated that the positive relationship between COVID-19 impact and OC severity was mediated by trait emotion-related processes (e.g., emotion regulation and differentiation), but no state risk factors emerged as significant mediators. Our findings contribute to the literature demonstrating a significant relationship between COVID-19 impact and OC severity, and highlight that emotion regulation difficulties may help explain this association. Our findings can inform evidence-based interventions on college campuses; however, the cross-sectional design precludes causal inferences. Future research should evaluate these relationships longitudinally and incorporate other psychosocial factors that may operate as mechanisms.","Berman, Fang, Hoeppner, Reese, Siev, Timpano, Wheaton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocrd.2022.100727","20220509","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31121,""
"Women mental health status and behaviour change during the COVID-19 in Sudan","During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sudan, women took the heaviest burden in taking care of family health needs. Potential health risks and its ensuing readiness to adopt and comply with public health measures may be especially distressing on women. Mental health challenges involved with modifying health behaviours that adhere to pandemic guidelines are considered following the Stages of Change Model. A total of 498 Sudanese women completed a cross-sectional online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic in Khartoum State. A questionnaire was designed to assess the transition within the stages of change towards maintenance to protective behaviours. Mental health status was assessed using an Arabic validated version of the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist for depression and anxiety. Most of the respondents were 40-year university graduate women. Depression and anxiety were low among 75% of respondents. The stages of change indicated that 22% of the women are in the maintenance stage compared to 1% in precontemplation. Anxiety increased significantly with the progression in the stages. The multiple regression equation <i>R</i>2 = .42, <i>F</i>(1, 416) = 6.71, <i>p</i> = .005 indicated that the preparation stage and action stage has a significant effect on the maintenance of protective behaviours. The most likely factors to motivate Sudanese women to comply with COVID-19 protective behaviours are the perception of self-efficacy coupled with access to information. The implications may be central to empirically stage-match transition points in the change process as they relate to mental health status.","Eltayeb, Badri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09358","20220509","Anxiety; Behavior change; COVID-19; Depression; Sudan; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31122,""

"Transition Needs Compassion: a Thematic Analysis of an Online Compassion-Focused Therapy Group in a Gender Service","Transgender and gender non-conforming people may face elevated rates of shame and self-criticism in light of minority stress. Compassion-focused therapy has a growing evidence base in addressing trans-diagnostic processes in mental health difficulties, including shame and self-criticism. The objective of the present study was to explore the experience of an initial pilot compassion-focused therapy group delivered online in a Gender Service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six transgender people completed a semi-structured interview after attending an 8-week compassion-focused therapy group in a national Gender Service. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify themes in the data. Four themes were identified from the data: <i>Transition Needs Compassion; Acceptability of the Compassion-Focused Approach; Being in a group with other transgender people; and Online delivery works despite its challenges.</i> Participants reported that the compassion-focused framework was an appropriate and helpful way of understanding their experiences of stigma and that both the content and process of the group had benefitted them. Being with other transgender people raised some anxieties, such as comparisons or fear of offending, but also enabled seeing the self in more positive and accepting ways. While online delivery had some challenges, participants largely felt it was an effective mode of delivery, aided by the experiential nature of the group. Compassion-focused therapy seems to be a feasible and acceptable approach for transgender and gender non-conforming people. Group processes may be helpful in increasing self-acceptance.

"Stress coping strategies used by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic","The risk of getting SARS-CoV-2 infection, worries about exposing loved ones, anxiety and frustration, emotional and physical exhaustion, burn out, a feeling of being overwhelmed, and struggles and challenges with parenting are a few among many factors that affect nurses' personal lives and professional functioning. The aim of the research is to assess nurses' level of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and their sense of self-efficacy, and to learn what coping strategies they use. The study was carried out online and based on the diagnostic poll method, using an original survey questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES 10-40), the Mini-COPE questionnaire (0-3), and the Perceived Stress Scale PSS-10 (0-40). The respondent group was made up of nurses (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 220) who provide health services in inpatient and outpatient health care institutions in the northeastern region of Poland. The statistical analysis was performed using the STATISTICA 13.0 package (StatSoft). The distribution of variables was checked with Shapiro-Wilk tests. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare two independent samples, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare more samples. The adopted statistical significance level was <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05. Multivariate regression analysis was applied to determine which factors were related to the level of stress. The mean age of the participants was 43.3 years. The vast majority were women (96.4). The mean work experience of the nurses was over 20 years (58.2%). A total of 62.3% worked directly with patients in hospitals, including 11.8% respondents working at COVID-19 units and 37.7% working at primary care institutions. The analyses show that the respondents represented a high level of stress (PSS-10 - 20.9), related to their work experience as a nurse (ÃŽÂ² -0.250, <i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.014), the number of hours worked a month (ÃŽÂ² 0.156, <i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.015), and self-assessed health status (ÃŽÂ² -0.145, <i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.037). They declared an average sense of self-efficacy (GSES - 29.1), which significantly depended on the nurses' places of employment (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.044). Out of stress coping strategies (Mini-COPE), the younger nurses mentioned venting (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.010), instrumental support (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.011), sense of humour (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.013) and self-blame (0.031). Practice nurses also chose the strategy of behavioral disengagement (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.032), and nurse managers chose the strategy of planning (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.018). The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to implement some strategies to protect nurses' mental health and to take extensive prevention measures in critical situations. Special attention should be given to nurses who are younger and have shorter work experience. It is also important to monitor nurses' working time and health status, and those who work at outpatient health care institutions should be given more support and information.","Sierakowska, Doroszkiewicz","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13288","20220509","Coping strategies; Pandemic COVID-19; Self-efficacy; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31125,""
"The influence of race, sexual orientation and gender identity on mental health, substance use, and academic persistence during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study from a national sample of college students in the Healthy Minds Study","This study seeks to characterize substance use, mental health, and academic persistence in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing variations by race, sexual orientation, and gender identity. National samples (n=146,810) of undergraduate students from the Healthy Minds Study were compared in two time periods: Fall 2017-Winter 2020 (pre-COVID) and March-December 2020. Descriptive statistics were conducted including t-tests/chi square tests comparing differences between time periods. Logistic regressions were estimated for main outcomes: substance use (licit, illicit, none), anxiety and/or depression symptoms, and academic persistence (student confidence that they will finish their degree). Marginal effects of race, sexual orientation, and gender identity were reported for all logistic regressions. In March-December 2020, students had 1.70 higher odds of screening positive for anxiety and/or depression compared to pre-COVID semesters. Latinx, Black, and ""other"" race/ethnicity had significantly higher probabilities of screening positive, as did transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) students.;Students had 0.43 times lower odds of reporting substance use in March-December 2020. Asian, Black, and Latinx students had significantly lower probabilities of reporting substance use, as did TGNC and LGBQ students.; During the pandemic, most students (86.7%) report at least 1 day of academic impairment (emotional/mental difficulties that hurt academic performance) in the last month due to mental health (up from 79.9% pre-pandemic).

"Assessment of fear, anxiety, obsession and functional impairment of COVID-19 amongst health-care workers and trainees: A cross-sectional study in Nepal","The emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic threw the world into turmoil. The medical community bore the brunt of the pandemic's toll. Long work hours, and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and social support all had an influence on mental health. This cross-sectional study was conducted among Lumbini Medical College Teaching Hospital students and employees in Palpa, Nepal. Data entailing their demographic details, pre-existing comorbidities, or death in the family due to COVID-19 was collected using a self-administered survey.Ã‚Â In addition, the level of fear, anxiety, obsession, and functional impairment due to COVID-19 was recorded using previously validated respective scales. In total, 403 health-care workers and trainees participated in our study. The average age of the study participants was 23Ã‚Â±4 years, and more than half of them (n=262, 65%) were females. A significant association was found between fear score with age (p-value=0.04), gender (p-value &lt;0.01) and occupation (p-value&lt;0.001). The participants suffering from chronic diseases (p-value=0.36), and those who had experienced a COVID-19 death in the family (p-value=0.18), were not found to be significantly obsessed with COVID-19. However, for those who had experienced a COVID-19 death in the family (p-value=0.51) and age (p-value=0.34), these factors were not found to be significantly associated with higher anxiety levels. Nursing students suffered from a significantly greater functional impairment than other medical professionals (mean score=269.15, p-value &lt; 0.001). A moderately positive correlation was observed between fear, anxiety, obsession, and functional impairment scales. This study revealed various socio-demographic characteristics as risk factors for psychological stress in the people related to the health-care profession of Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic. A viable answer to this quandary might be adequate psychosocial intervention by health-care authorities, increased social support, and the introduction of better mental health management measures for the front-line medical workers.","Atreya, Nepal, Menezes, Shurjeel, Qazi, Ram, Usman, Ghimire, Marhatta, Islam, Sapkota, Garbuja","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.76032.1","20220509","COVID-19; Nepal; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; health care workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31127,""
"Application of animal models to compare and contrast the virulence of current and future potential SARS-CoV-2 variants","Since Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified during late 2019, the sustained spread of this pathogen within the human population has caused worldwide disruption with staggering infection rates and death tolls. Due to the accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2, the virus has evolved into many variants, five of which have been listed as variants of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Multiple animal models of SARS-CoV-2 have been developed to evaluate vaccines and drugs and to assess the pathogenicity, transmissibility and antiviral measures of these VOCs. Here, we review the cutting-edge research based on mouse, hamster, ferret and non-human primate models for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on the Omicron variant, and highlight the importance of updating vaccines in a timely manner in order to mitigate the negative effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the human population.","Ding, Chen, Lan, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2022.05.001","20220509","Animal models; Omicron; SARS-CoV-2; Variants of concern","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31128,""

A total of 4000 patients (1900 men and 2100 women) with mild, moderate, or chronic disease, appealing to our Second Opinion Medical Consultation Network, signed an informed consent form and were injected subcutaneously with <i>C. parvum</i>. The treatment was followed up to 6 months, completing the short form of the medical outcome health survey questionnaire (SF-36) directly by the patients or their parents and monitoring their health status regularly via telemedicine (Skype, WhatsApp, mail, etc.) or outpatients visits. The main efficacy endpoints, as assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire are: significant improvements in the mental and physical role functioning score (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.02), better general health; social role performance (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.02), vitality (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.03), and a significant pain reduction (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.03). A quick (48-72 hours) symptoms improvement and/or complete regression of the herpetic eruptions was observed in 1000 affected patients with disappearance or relieve of herpetic neuralgia (reduced in 80% of cases); also full recovery or frequency reduction (30%) of recurrent cystitis and prostatitis in 120 affected patients. Last but not least, a life quality improvement in 100 oncologic patients of overall 200 cases. A significant increase in the lymphocyte count (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), mainly helper and killer lymphocytes, was noted 6 months after Parvulan injection vs. the baseline. The asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients who were incidentally enrolled in our survey were tested at the sixth month for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and 14 patients had high levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The incubating COVID infections of the Parvulan-injected patients even if frail and multimorbid recovered in short term (48-96 hours) with a benign clinical course, without need of drugs administration except for the variants, such as Delta and Omicron, whose infections lasted on average one week and required some antipyretics and low-dose steroids for a few days. Our results confirm that <i>C. parvum</i> is quite safe and effective in supporting immune-compromised patients when epidemic or pandemic events increase the life risk and any kind of infection and complication rate.

"Developing mental health competency in undergraduate nursing students amid pandemic: A hybrid model approach","COVID-19 has raised a concern about the quality and continuity of education. The uncertain situation has required universities to undertake several innovative measures to continue their educational programs without compromising the quality of education. The aim of this paper is to introduce the hybrid approach for undergraduate nursing students for teaching mental health nursing course, utilizing Gagne's instructional design theory, in a private nursing institution in Pakistan. The nine steps of instructions in Gagne's theoretical framework were utilized for teaching the mental health nursing course. The approach enhanced students' therapeutic communication skills, boosted their confidence level, and assisted them in overcoming their fears in caring patients with psychiatric illnesses. Students appreciated the innovative strategies, such as problem-based learning, case studies, interactions with standardized patients, and learning through movies. The innovative and creative clinical teaching approaches can be used to develop nursing students' competencies, core clinical skills, and to bridge the theory-practice gap.","Tharani, Lalani, Mughal, Momin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.teln.2022.03.007","20220509","Gagne theory; hybrid model; mental health nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31130,""
"Dreams and nightmares during the pandemic","The pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had aÃ‚Â huge impact on public mental health. This was also reflected in dreams. Not only did people start to remember more dreams, but dream content changed as themes like sickness, confinement, and-in the English-speaking world-even bugs began to dominate. This also led to an increase in nightmare frequency. There are various factors that contributed to this change in the dream landscape. Some people have started to sleep more and hereby spend more time in REM sleep, which is known to increase dream recall and further lead to bizarre and vivid dreams. On the other hand, stress and poor mental health had an impact on sleep, and sleep quality thus dropped in many individuals. Poor sleep quality can also lead to an increase in dream recall. Dreams are known to regulate mood, so the rise in dreams and the change in dream content could also reflect aÃ‚Â reaction to the overall rise in stress and decline in mental health. Recent studies have shown that as the pandemic progresses, further changes in mental health, dream recall, and dream content arise, but data are still scarce. Further research could help understand the impact the pandemic still has on mental health and dreams, and how this impact is changing over the course of the pandemic. Die Pandemie rund um die Coronavirus-Krankheit-2019 (COVID-19) zeigte starke Auswirkungen auf die psychische Gesundheit. Dies wurde auch in den TrÃƒÂ¤umen reflektiert. Nicht nur konnten sich Personen an mehr TrÃƒÂ¤ume erinnern, auch deren Inhalte ÃƒÂ¤nderten sich. Krankheiten und EinschlieÃƒÅ¸ungen kamen vermehrt in TrÃƒÂ¤umen vor und im englischsprachigen Raum wurde sogar von KÃƒÂ¤fern getrÃƒÂ¤umt. Ebenso kam es zu einem Anstieg von AlbtrÃƒÂ¤umen. Dabei gibt es viele verschiedene Faktoren, ÃƒÂ¼ber die die Pandemie TrÃƒÂ¤ume beeinflusst. Manche Personen konnten mehr schlafen und hatten dadurch mehr REM-Schlaf. Dieser kÃƒÂ¶nnte nicht nur fÃƒÂ¼r die erhÃƒÂ¶hte Traumerinnerung verantwortlich sein, sondern auch fÃƒÂ¼r das Auftreten von bizarren und lebhaften TrÃƒÂ¤umen. Andererseits verursachten der durch die Pandemie ausgelÃƒÂ¶ste Stress und die damit einhergehende verringerte psychische Gesundheit auch Schlafprobleme, und die SchlafqualitÃƒÂ¤t sank bei vielen. Dies kann wiederum auch einen Anstieg der Traumerinnerung verursachen. Da TrÃƒÂ¤ume einen Mechanismus zur Emotionsregulation darstellen, kÃƒÂ¶nnten aber auch der Stress und die psychische Gesundheit selbst die AuslÃƒÂ¶ser fÃƒÂ¼r ein vermehrtes Vorkommen von TrÃƒÂ¤umen sowie deren VerÃƒÂ¤nderung sein. Mit dem Fortschreiten der Pandemie verÃƒÂ¤ndern sich auch weiterhin die psychische Gesundheit, die Traumerinnerung und Trauminhalte, allerdings gibt es dazu bisher nur wenig Datenmaterial. Um die noch bestehenden Auswirkungen der Pandemie auf die psychische Gesundheit und auf TrÃƒÂ¤ume sowie deren weiteren Verlauf zu verstehen, sind weiterfÃƒÂ¼hrende Erhebungen notwendig.","Ableidinger, Nierwetberg, Holzinger","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11818-022-00351-x","20220509","COVID-19; Dreaming and dream recall; Mental health; Nightmare frequency; PTSD; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31131,""
"Knowledge and Attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccination and Associated Factors among College Students in Northwest Ethiopia,2021","It is imperative to ensure optimal vaccine uptake at the population level to combat the deadly COVID-19 pandemic disease. However, refusal of the COVID-19 vaccine, poor knowledge, and a negative attitude towards vaccination are the challenges of the world. College students are among the high-risk subgroups of the population to COVID-19 infection and the main source of information and trust in vaccines to the society. Also, their judgement on vaccine affect the public attitude towards vaccination. Therefore, this study aimed to assess knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination and associated factors among college students in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 626 study participants in Gondar city. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit the study participants. A pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. The level of significance was claimed based on a p-value &lt; 0.05. In this study, 46.8% (95% CI: 43.3, 50.6) of study participants had good knowledge and 50% (95% CI: 45.9, 53.7) had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. Having comorbidity disease and being male were significantly associated with good knowledge. In addition, being married, being a health science student, being exposed to mass media, having a good knowledge of COVID-19 vaccination, and having paternal primary education were significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. In general<b>,</b> knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination among college students are low. Comorbidity disease and sex were predictors of COVID-19 vaccination knowledge, whereas, marital status, category of college students, mass media, paternal education and knowledge about COVID-19 vaccination were predictors of COVID-19 vaccination attitude.

"Correlation between stress and lifestyle in teachers at some schools in lima, Peru, during telework in 2020","Stress and unhealthy lifestyle are serious problems in public health and education, particularly due to their significant relevance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To determine the correlation between stress and lifestyle in teachers at some schools in Lima, Peru, during telework in 2020. This observational, quantitative, analytical, cross-sectional study was conducted in 217 school teachers from Lima. Lifestyle was measured using the FANTASTIC questionnaire; stress was measured using the Teaching Stress Scale (ED-6), comprised of the anxiety, depression, maladaptive beliefs, work pressure and poor coping dimensions. The Spearman correlation between numerical variables, and the difference of the FANTASTIC score according to the categorical variables, were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test, as necessary. Multivariable analysis was done with a multiple linear regression model to find raw and adjusted ÃŽÂ² (ÃŽÂ²a). The median of the ED-6 scale was 81 (RI: 64-105).

Using a database on behaviour and feelings of non-academic staff from a Brazilian university working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, a binary logistic regression model was structured. In an exploratory manner, six independent variables (presented in the previous item) were analysed in terms of their ability to predict the dependent variable (feelings of sadness and depression). The results presented the prediction power of the independent variables for the dependent variable. The variables regarding concern with their health, increased anxiety and concern about their career presented Odds Ratios of 3.6 (1.4-8.5 -95% C.I.) and 3.3 (2.2-5.0 -95% C.I.), respectively, standing out from the other variables.

"Fatigue due to smartphone use? Investigating research trends and methods for analysing fatigue caused by extensive smartphone usage: A review","The easy accessibility of smartphones has led to a fivefold increase in their use. People use smartphones almost anywhere, including during travelling and studying. During the global COVID-19 pandemic, the average smartphone screen time has increased from 2.25 to 4.8 hours per day. In India, smartphone usage increased by 68% , and the average screen time increased from 2.42 to 6.9 hours. This dependency on smartphones has led to smartphone addiction. Inappropriate postures during the prolonged use of smartphones can exert adverse effects such as musculoskeletal disorders, digital eye strain, loss of focus and attention. This study was undertaken to understand the effects of prolonged smartphone utilisation and explored fatigue measurement techniques.

Participants included adult patients (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°18 yo) who were quarantining as part of Victoria's COVID-19 quarantine program. The primary outcome was discharge destination from the emergency department (admission to hospital vs discharge from ED). 164 patients presented to the Alfred E&amp;TC during the study period. The mean (SD) age was 50.9, with most patients being male (n=96 (58.5%)). Most patients were referred from a Quarantine Hotel (n=83 (50%)). 34% (n=56) of ED presentations were admitted to hospital (31.5% to a ward, 2.5% to ICU). 46% (n=75) were discharged to the Complex Care (CC) Hotel to be looked after by Alfred Health, with only 16% (n=26) being discharged to a standard Quarantine Hotel (QH). The most common presenting complaint categories were: CVS (n=33 (20%)), miscellaneous (n=25 (25%)), GI (n=19 (11.5%)), and mental health (n=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18 (11%)). The study demonstrates that the number of ED presentations from quarantine was low (&lt;1 presentation/day). COVID Quarantine Victoria (CQV), along with Alfred Health, put significant resources into the program to allow most returned international travellers to be safely cared for within a hotel and thus reduce the burden on the public hospital system.","Melvin, O'Reilly, Underhill, Stokes, Tant, Look","https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.14014","20220509","COVID-19; Emergency medicine; Emergency medicine, Transportation of patients; Infectious diseases, Emergency medicine, Emergency treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31138,""
"Oral high-dose acetylcysteine: Effective against the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)?","The Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a high rate of transmission and it exhibits immune escape characteristics. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a precursor of reduced glutathione (GSH), which can enter cells to play an antioxidant role, so it is better than glutathione. Patients tolerate NAC well, and adverse reactions are rare and mild, so this type of drug with multiple actions is considered to be a mucolytic agent as well as a drug for the prevention/treatment of various diseases, including COVID-19. Previous studies indicated that the clinical effectiveness of NAC is dose-dependent. Low-dose NAC (0.2 g tid for adults) is a mucolytic expectorant, high-dose NAC (0.6 g bid or tid) has expectorant action as well as antioxidant action, and extreme-dose NAC (300 mg/kg.d) is used for detoxification in cases of an acetaminophen overdose. Presumably, orally administered high-dose NAC (0.6 g tid for adults and 10 mg/kg tid for children) could be used as an adjuvant to treat an Omicron infection. It should reduce the time to negative conversion and prevent severe COVID-19, reducing the duration of hospitalization and increasing the bed turnover rate.","Chen, Lu","https://doi.org/10.5582/ddt.2022.01032","20220508","N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC); Omicron; effectiveness; high-dose, oral","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31139,""
"Unmasking the Truth of Health Care Workers' Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Burnout is a well-documented multifactorial phenomenon that affects up to 47% of intensive care unit staff at some point in their career. The literature highlights increased rates of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder among staff as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the second and, at the time of writing, largest surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, concern for staff 's mental health prompted a hospital-wide study to assess depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and alcohol misuse and to determine the use and effectiveness of employee resources. Through REDCap, 212 intensive care unit employees were surveyed with validated screening tools for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and alcohol misuse. The use and perceived effectiveness of hospital initiatives were assessed. A total of 212 surveys were evaluated. Among respondents, 54% experienced mild anxiety, more than 50% screened positive for mild depression, and 37% screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder. Most employees (74.5%) were aware of at least 1 resource; 37% knew of the COVID-19 newsletter, one of the top resources highlighted in the survey. Perceived effectiveness of resources ranged from 0.9% (disaster helpline) to 82.5% (prayers, readings, and the on-call chaplain-all ""somewhat helpful""). The results correlate with the progressive trend of increased mental health concerns among intensive care unit employees. Survey results prompted an expansion of hospital resources. COVID-19 has brought unique mental health challenges and stressors to intensive care unit staff. By adapting and expanding resources, hospitals can improve staff resiliency and mitigate some mental health concerns with the aim of decreasing the overall psychological impact of the pandemic.","Bucca, Ullrich, Rahman, Smith, Johnson, Allanson-Dundon, Corwin, James, Marchionni, Bratis, Bendas","https://doi.org/10.4037/ccn2022769","20220508","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31140,""

"Fear of Covid-19 and health-related outcomes: results from two Brazilian population-based studies","Fear is a reaction that can influence multiple aspects of health and life. During the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been serious pathophysiological, social, behavioral and mental consequences that can be related to fear. This study aimed to assess the fear of Covid-19 and its association with sociodemographic, behavioral and health variables. Data were gathered from two cross-sectional population-based studies conducted in 2020 with adults from two cities from Southern Brazil. The Fear of Covid-19 scale was used to evaluate fear of Covid. Exposure variables were socioeconomic, demographic, health and pandemic-related factors. Adjusted Poisson regression was performed to assess the association between fear of Covid-19 and the exposure variables. A total of 2,152 subjects were assessed. Higher fear of Covid-19 was found among women and in individuals with symptoms of Covid-19. Living alone, being richer, and testing positive for Covid-19 were associated with lower prevalence of fear. Higher prevalence of fear of Covid-19 was related to worse sleep quality, worse health perception, sadness, higher stress, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. There was a linear association between fear of Covid-19 and health outcomes. The results provide evidence that fear of Covid-19 seems to be associated with socioeconomic, demographic, health and pandemic-related factors.","Meller, SchÃƒÂ¤fer, Quadra, Demenech, Paludo, da Silva, Neiva-Silva, Dumith","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114596","20220508","Behavior; Mental health; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31142,""
"Behavioral, Affective, and Cognitive Parenting Mechanisms of Child Internalizing and Externalizing Problems during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased mental health concerns, including depression and anxiety among parents and internalizing and externalizing problems among youth. To better understand the mechanisms and moderators of child mental health during the pandemic, the current study tested two moderated mediation models in which parent depression and anxiety indirectly impacted child internalizing and externalizing problems through negative effects on multiple parenting variables, with these associations moderated by families' exposure to COVID-19-stressors. A national sample representative of U.S. parents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°796, 48.2% female, M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38.87Ã‚Â years, 60.3% Non-Hispanic white, 18.1% Hispanic/Latinx, 13.2% Non-Hispanic Black/African-American, 5.7% Asian, 2.8% Other Race) completed a cross-sectional online survey in February-April 2021. Children ranged from 5-16Ã‚Â years old (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.35Ã‚Â years, 59.8% Non-Hispanic white, 17.2% Hispanic/Latinx, 13.7% Non-Hispanic Black/African-American, 4.5% Asian, 4.8% Other Race). Parent depression/anxiety was directly and indirectly associated with child internalizing and externalizing problems. For both internalizing and externalizing problems, indirect associations occurred by means of increased parent hostility and inconsistent discipline and decreased routines and parent supportiveness. There were also specific indirect effects through decreased monitoring (internalizing problems) and parenting self-efficacy (externalizing problems). Multiple indirect effects were moderated by number of COVID-19-stressors experienced. Notably, COVID-19-stressors did not have direct effects on child mental health when other variables were considered. Findings highlight the buffering effects of parents for child mental health, the need to address parent depression/anxiety in child interventions, the utility of existing evidence-based parent interventions during the pandemic, and the need to assess families' level of exposure to COVID-19-stressors.","Penner, Elzaki, Contreras, Santos, Sarver","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-022-00920-6","20220508","COVID-19 pandemic; Child mental health; Families; Moderated mediation; Parent anxiety; Parent depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31143,""
"Sleep quality and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea","The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has produced remarkable effects on the sleep quality and mental status of the general population and more dramatic effects on patients with chronic illness. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), already suffering from disordered sleep, might be more susceptible to the effect of the pandemic on their sleep quality and mental health. We therefore performed a case-control study to compare sleep quality, depression and anxiety symptoms reported by patients with severe OSA and age-matched healthy subjects during the first wave of the COVID-19. In June-July 2020 we enrolled a total of 222 patients with severe OSA, all treated with continuous positive airway pressure, and 164 healthy controls. Self-reported sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire module 9 (PHQ-9), while the specific ""Coronavirus Anxiety Scale"" (CAS) evaluated the level of anxiety. Patients with OSA (61% males, 65Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.6Ã‚Â years old, BMI 30.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.6) and healthy controls had similar characteristics except for BMI slightly lower in controls. The perceived quality of sleep, referred to the pre-pandemic period, was significantly worse in patients with OSA than in controls. During the pandemic the rate of reported sleep disturbance increased from 54 to 66% in patients with OSA and from 29 to 40% in controls. A high percentage of patients and controls reported symptoms of depression (61% OSA and 65% controls), whereas lower levels of anxiety, similar in the two groups, were observed. In patients with OSA the PSQI score significantly positively correlated with the PHQ-9 score (r<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.81) and the CAS score (r<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.65). The rate of reported sleep disturbance in patients with OSA during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the highest evidenced in literature so far. As for the general population, in these patients there is a strict link between the perceived sleep quality and the psychological distress caused by the pandemic. A further deterioration of sleep quality is a fearsome event in the life of these patients who face life-long sleep problems.","Spicuzza, Mancuso, Campisi, Vancheri","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-022-00454-x","20220509","Anxiety; COVID-19; CPAP; Coronavirus Anxiety Scale; Depression; Obstructive sleep apnea; PSQI; Sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","",31144,""
