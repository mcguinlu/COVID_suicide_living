"Predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection trend using technical analysis indicators","COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Without efficacious drugs or vaccines, mass quarantine has been the main strategy adopted by governments to contain the virus spread. This has led to a significant reduction in the number of infected people and deaths and to a diminished pressure over the health care system. However, an economic depression is following due to the forced absence of worker from their job and to the closure of many productive activities. For these reasons, governments are lessening progressively the mass quarantine measures to avoid an economic catastrophe. Nevertheless, the reopening of firms and commercial activities might lead to a resurgence of infection. In the worst-case scenario, this might impose the return to strict lockdown measures. Epidemiological models are therefore necessary to forecast possible new infection outbreaks and to inform government to promptly adopt new containment measures. In this context, we tested here if technical analysis methods commonly used in the financial market might provide early signal of change in the direction of SARS-Cov-2 infection trend in Italy, a country which has been strongly hit by the pandemic. We conclude that technical analysis indicators can be usefully adopted to this aim.","Paroli, M.; Sirinian, M.

"Depression and loneliness during COVID-19 restrictions in the United States, and their associations with frequency of social and sexual connections","Purpose: To estimate the prevalence of depression and loneliness during the US COVID-19 response, and examine their associations with frequency of social and sexual connections. Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of American adults (n=1010), aged 18-94, running from April 10-20, 2020. We assessed depressive symptoms (CES-D-10 scale), loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), and frequency of in-person and remote social connections (4 items, e.g. hugging family member, video chats) and sexual connections (4 items, e.g. partnered sexual activity, dating app use). Results: One-third of participants (32%) reported depressive symptoms, and loneliness was high [mean (SD): 4.4 (1.7)]. Those with depressive symptoms were more likely to be women, age 20-29, unmarried, and low-income. Frequent in-person connections were associated with lower depression and loneliness; frequent remote connections were not. Conclusions: Depression and loneliness were elevated during the early US COVID-19 response. Those who maintained frequent in-person, but not remote, social and sexual connections had better mental health outcomes. While COVID-19 social restrictions remain necessary, it will be critical to expand mental health services to serve those most at-risk and identify effective ways of maintaining social and sexual connections from a distance.","Rosenberg, M.; Luetke, M.; Hensel, D.; Kianersi, S.; Herbenick, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.20101840v1?rss=1""","20200520","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1061,""

Using data from a prospective study of young, low-income mothers who survived Hurricane Katrina, we find that bereavement, fearing for loved ones' well-being, and lacki","Raker, Zacher, Lowe","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006706117","20200519","COVID-19 pandemic; Hurricane Katrina; disasters; mental health; physical health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1099,""

"Cadaveric Simulation of Endoscopic Endonasal Procedures: Analysis of Droplet Splatter Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The primary mode of viral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to occur through the spread of respiratory droplets. The objective of this study was to investigate droplet and splatter patterns resulting from common endoscopic endonasal procedures. Cadaver simulation series. Dedicated surgical laboratory. After instilling cadaver head specimens (n = 2) with fluorescein solution, endoscopic endonasal procedures were systematically performed to eva","Sharma, Rubel, Ye, Shipchandler, Wu, Higgins, Burgin, Ting, Illing","https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820929274","20200519","COVID-19; droplet; nasal endoscopy; sinus surgery; skull base surgery; splatter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1102,""
