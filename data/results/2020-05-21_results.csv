"The COVID-19 pandemic from an acute psychiatric perspective; a London Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit experience","COVID-19 presents a unique challenge to the inpatient psychiatry setting due to the natureof psychiatric illness and its treatment. This London Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) isa female, 10 bed locked ward comprising of two corridors each with five single bedrooms  and two shared bathrooms. There is an extra care area, a seclusion suite, a communal areaincluding a dining room and sensory, interview and clinical rooms.Patients who require PICU are in an acutely disturbed phase of a serious mental disorderwhere the associated risks â€“ to self and others â€“ cannot be safely managed on an acuteward. Such behaviour includes externally or internally directed aggression, unpredictabilityand vulnerability (over activity and disinhibition). The PICU model â€“ including ward size,staffing ratio and reduced stimulus environment â€“ allow for the rapid assessment,management and stabilisation of these patients.During the COVID-19 outbreak, support and advice was provided by the Trustâ€™s infectioncontrol team. The ward was closed to visitors and staff began wearing full personalprotective equipment (PPE) at the point that the first COVID-19 case was suspected. Thisarticle uses the experience of a London PICU to highlight the challenges that inpatientpsychiatric services will face over the coming weeks and offer learning from an evolvingsituation.","Skelton, Luke; Pugh, Ria; Harries, Bethan; Blake, Lucy; Butler, Margaret; Sethi, Faisil","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.54","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1105,""

"Preliminary Reflections of CAMHS in COVID-19 Lockdown","The CAMHS service in Co Clare consists of two teams (East and West sectors) serving acatchment area of 100,000 population. This piece reflects on and examines various questions/issues which have arisen for our Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) inCo Clare, in the first four weeks of the nationwide COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Giventhe considerable uncertainty in current times, it is intended to highlight some preliminaryviews, with the aim of re-visiting issues in post-pandemic times. It describes some of thechanges observed in the service since the restrictions imposed in mid-March and how thesemight inform service provision in CAMHS going forward.The emerging literature relating to mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests thatpsychological reactions to pandemics which include maladaptive behaviours, emotionaldistress and defensive responses are all features which are in clear evidence during thecurrent COVID-19 pandemic (Cullen et al., 2020). Since the enforced reduction of theCAMHS services in Co Clare in response to the COVID-19 crisis, these responses have,however, not yet come to our attention.These tentative observations have prompted reflections on the human response to adversityand the purpose, role and function of a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service.While routine out-patient appointments took place over the phone following the nationwidelockdown imposed in mid-March 2020, in only twenty-five cases was it deemed necessaryfor the patient and family to attend in person. Twenty-one of these cases were seen in clinicand four were seen at their homes.

"Secondary Traumatic Stress","I am writing this editorial whilst in lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. Heartrending stories of the trauma being experienced by families and professionals fill our news broadcasts and it is clear that many professionals are experiencing secondary traumatic stress. Social workers always operate in challenging environments and part of the training and professional development for social workers focuses on developing resilience. Nonetheless there are circumstances where additional attention to secondary traumatic stress is needed, since it can lead to reduced performance in both the professional and personal spheres of a social workers life, and we have two articles in this edition of Practice which address this. The first article by Francine Masson and Jacqueline Moodley, â€˜Secondary Traumatic Stress: The Experiences of Social Workers in the South African Police Serviceâ€™, reports on a study of occupational and forensic social workers employed by the South African Police Service (SAPS). To remain an effective practitioner, the mental health of a social worker is an important aspect that needs to be nurtured and safeguarded. The research revealed that social workers employed within SAPS, whether in an occupational or forensic capacity, are exposed to secondary trauma. Practitioners were particularly affected by certain cases: Cases where children died from abuse and neglect, police suicides and femicide-suicides were emotionally challenging cases. The study also reports significant differences in Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS) between Black and White social workers, as STS levels in White social workers were higher. They suggest that Black South Africans have been exposed to excessive amounts of trauma through the apartheid system and it is possible that they may have become desensitised and developed a level of hardiness that enable them to cope better. This study highlights the need for organisations which employ social workers to ensure that there are workplace policies which incorporate strategies to ameliorate secondary traumatisation and promote self-care. In the second article, â€˜Individual and Organisational Practices Addressing Social Workersâ€™ Experiences of Vicarious Traumaâ€™, Simon Ashley-Binge and Carolyn Cousins suggest that organisations employing social workers do not always take a preventative or proactive approach to addressing vicarious trauma, often assuming the provision of supervision and encouraging worker self-care will be sufficient. They present a narrative literature review which argues that organisations should be encouraged to accept responsibility for addressing vicarious trauma as a work health and safety issue, examining the contribution of workplace culture and workload expectations to vicarious trauma experiences. While the literature review revealed strong support for the recognition of organisational contributions to vicarious trauma alongside individual responsibilities, most organisations themselves do not appear to yet accept this link as requiring a response. The next paper in this edition, by Orlanda Harvey and Margarete Parrish, â€˜Social Work Implications of Anabolicâ€“Androgenic Steroid Use, Particularly Among Young People: A Literature Reviewâ€™, considers what knowledge social workers might require to work effectively in this domain. They hypothesise that although rarely addressed in the existing social work literature, the risks associated with anabolic-androgenic steroid (ASS) use, particularly in young people, necessitate more awareness and attention from social work practitioners particularly in todayâ€™s image conscious society. An awareness of the risks associated with AAS use is both relevant and important knowledge for social work practice with an array of services users and further research into the psychosocial factors related to young peopleâ€™s use of ASS is needed. The final paper in this edition, â€˜Does Training Enhance Professional Practice in Infant Mental Health?â€™, by Teresa Hughes, Anne McGlade and Campbell Killick contextualises their stud by noting the lack of robust evaluation of training outcomes in the delivery of Health & Social Care and the impact on adult mental health of poor emotional care during infancy and early childhood. The paper reports that their study (pre- and post- training) validates the effectiveness of infant mental health training for social workers and other professionals. Their findings also confirm that the confidence gained from increased knowledge encourages staff to put their learning into practice. Higher levels of confidence in oneâ€™s ability to perform correlates with increased persistence levels and peopleâ€™s sense of empowerment. The study has also found an improvement in the capacity of adult services staff to identify vulnerability in infants if engaging in family inclusive practice.","Akister, Jane","https://doi.org/10.1080/09503153.2020.1758397","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1109,""
"Posttraumatic stress disorder and depression of survivors 12<U+2009>months after the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea","The 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea is a recent and representative occurrence of nationwide outbreaks of Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs). In addition to physical symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are common following outbreaks of EID. The present study investigated the long-term mental health outcomes and related risk factors in survivors of MERS. A prospective nationwide cohort study was conducted 12<U+2009>months after the MERS outbreak at multi-centers throughout Korea. PTSD and depression as the main mental health outcomes were assessed with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised Korean version (IES-R-K) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) respectively. 42.9% of survivors reported PTSD (IES-R-K<U+2009>=<U+2009>25) and 27.0% reported depression (PHQ-9<U+2009>=<U+2009>10) at 12<U+2009>months post-MERS. A multivariate analysis revealed that anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.76; 95%CI, 1.29â€“25.58; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.021), and a greater recognition of stigma (aOR, 11.09, 95%CI, 2.28â€“53.90; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003) during the MERS-affected period were independent predictors of PTSD at 12<U+2009>months after the MERS outbreak. Having a family member who died from MERS predicted the development of depression (aOR, 12.08, 95%CI, 1.47â€“99.19; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.020). This finding implies that psychosocial factors, particularly during the outbreak phase, influenced the mental health of patients over a long-term period. Mental health support among the infected subjects and efforts to reduce stigma may improve recovery from psychological distress in an EID outbreak.","Park, Hye Yoon; Park, Wan Beom; Lee, So Hee; Kim, Jeong Lan; Lee, Jung Jae; Lee, Haewoo; Shin, Hyoung-Shik","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-08726-1","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1110,""

"COVID-19 social distancing and sexual activity in a sample of the British Public","ABSTRACT Background On 23rd March 2020 the UK government released self-isolation guidance to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-Cov-2. The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known. Aim To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation in a sample of the UK public. Methods This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. Outcomes Sexual activity was measured using the following question: â€œOn average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?â€ Demographic and clinical data was collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. Clinical Implications In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. Strength and Limitations This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic. Conclusion Interventions to promote health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.","Jacob, Louis; Smith, Lee; Butler, Laurie; Barnett, Yvonne; Grabovac, Igor; McDermott, Daragh; Armstrong, Nicola; Yakundi, Annita; Tully, Mark","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2020.05.001","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1112,""
"The impact of VOVID-19 infections on public psychology: does the spread of infection increase suicide risk?","Many countries around the world are restricting or refraining from various economic and social activities in order to control the spread of 2019 novel coronavirus infection infection (COVID-19). Even if the number of deaths caused directly by COVID-19 can be controlled, a rapid increase in the number of suicides caused by the spread of the infection does not make sense. Based on existing research, the spread of COVID-19 infection is thought to have psychological effects through the following three channels: (1) anxiety and fear of infecting oneself, (2) a sense of isolation that deepens as opportunities for human contact decrease, and (3) worsening economic conditions, such as wage cuts and unemployment, as well as worsening corporate performance due to self-restraint in economic and social activities. In this paper, we focus on the psychological effects of COVID-19 on depression, isolation, and suicidal ideation in Japan, and the factors that contribute to them. As a result, although the number of people having suicidal thoughts was not rapidly increasing as of the end of March 2020, the number of severely depressed people was increasing mainly in their early 20s, such as new employees, and in their late 30s, such as mid-career workers. It was not the fear of infecting themselves with COVID-19 that was affecting them, but the fear of worsening economic conditions such as unemployment and bankruptcy. From this perspective, economic policies that remove economic uncertainty are essential. As Sawada et al. (2010) point out, the rapid increase in suicides in 1997-98 was an economic and social problem along with a health problem. We need to make sure that this crisis does not become a repeat of 1998. It is highly likely that factors will change depending on the future spread of infection and economic and social conditions, and the associated further increase in the risk of suicide will require continued close attention. Traditionally, most people in Japan do not talk to anyone about suicidal thoughts (73.9% in the Nippon Foundation (2016)). For example, 12 locations of the Inochi-no-telephone, which receives more than 600,000 suicide consultations every year and is the largest in Japan, have stopped accepting suicide consultations. Although prefectural and other prefectures have established mental health counseling centers and are increasingly using social networking services, there is a need to proactively promote social contact with people whose elderly parents are living apart, such as by calling them and asking them how they are doing. In addition, mental health care for COVID-19-positive patients, healers, and medical personnel who provide treatment, which has been the subject of unwarranted criticism, will also be an issue.","Takahashi, Yoshiaki","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+VOVID-19+infections+on+public+psychology:+does+the+spread+of+infection+increase+suicide+risk?","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1113,""
"Visualization of Countermeasures against COVID-19 Infections in Japan by Systems Thinking : The reason why the Japanese government and its Council of Experts couldn't increase PCR tests","Many people in Japan and around the world have questioned whether Japan's ""number of tests"" for COVID-19 infection control is sufficient. Because the scope of influence caused by infection is broad and complex, it is difficult to see the whole picture by only cutting one aspect of the situation, and there are differences among the sectors involved. This misunderstanding can be seen as a communication failure in Japan's countermeasures against COVID-19 infection, and it is important for science and technology to clarify the reasons for the failure. Why has the number of tests been narrowed down? The problem is not limited to the government's ability to execute, but there are also systemic impediments and overlooked issues in the effective implementation of countermeasures against new coronavirus infection. In this paper, we first used a systems thinking technique (causal loop diagram) to visualize the situation related to COVID-19 infection, and confirmed its characteristics as a system. Our causal loop diagram consists of an ""infection model"" and an ""incidence response model"". The government and the Council of Experts) have separated the ""infection model"" from the ""incidence model"" with the goal of reducing the number of deaths and, by extension, serious illnesses as much as possible. In the process, attention has been paid to avoiding the depletion of medical resources, which is probably one of the reasons why the number of tests has not been able to increase so far. However, while this approach is reasonable when each model is taken separately, it turns out that there are serious systemic weaknesses that occur at the interface between the two models. For example, raising the testing hurdle will increase the number of mild cases that are active in the city without being tested, increasing the chance of infection and increasing the number of new cases. This will create a new spread of infection. Considering this, the following two measures need to be implemented. It is necessary to implement blockades or other measures to reduce the number of opportunities for infection as soon as possible, or equivalent measures to reduce the number of opportunities for infection (e.g., school closures, refraining from going outside, cancellation of events, city blockades, etc.). In order to expand inspections, it is necessary to introduce an inspection system that minimizes the connection with medical resources, such as the combination of drive-through inspections and walk-through inspections, which are famous in Korea, with Internet interviews. However, in the current situation where infection is spreading to a certain extent and medical resources are tight, a two-sided strategy, such as increasing the number of tests, is necessary to control the spread of infection by lightly infected people (and subclinical infected people) who spread infection in the city in order to deal with the serious systemic problems at the interface between the two models. The causal loop diagram shows that citizens are also required to take measures to prevent infection, such as masks and hand washing, and to change their behavior in order to reduce the chance of infection. This case is an example of the importance of system-wide understanding of the situation for both citizens and experts, and of sharing that understanding.

"Mental health issues and psychological crisis interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and earthquakes in Croatia","The newly discovered coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2, was first detected in Wuhan, China as a cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome, disease called COVID-19. From the beginning of 2020 it rapidly spread, affecting the whole world, but with a major impact in Europe and North America. At the moment of writing, there are more than 2 million confirmed cases with more than 125.000 confirmed deaths related to COVID-19 globally. In Croatia, there are currently 1.741 confirmed cases with 34 deaths related to the virus. The COVID-19 rapid spread and magnitude of pandemic unleashed panic among people which warrants public health officials to also address the epidemic of fear. Research on the psychological reactions to previous epidemics and pandemics suggests that various psychological factors may play a role in coronaphobia. Nov-elty and uncertainty what the unknown brings is likely the cause of COVID-19 fear. With the sharp increase in number of affected persons by pandemic, both infected or suspected cases in isolation, fear and anxiety grew in general population, which warranted a significant increase in need for psychiatric support for both patients and medical staff. After initial stabilization of the situation and a prompt response to increased needs for mental support, during this time of pandemic, self-isolations and imposed social distancing, the strongest earthquake this city has experienced in the last 140 years hit Croatian capital Zagreb. During these trying times, maintaining good mental health of both medical personnel as well as the general population is crucial for both health and mental damage control. In Croatia, crisis interventions aimed for those most exposed to mental impact of pandemic and natural disasters is limited.","Peitl, V.; Zatezalo, V.

"COVID-19: Concerns and behaviours in Croatia","Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty that has heightened fear and worry worldwide, thus elevating the potential for a growth in anxiety. This study aims to examine changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. These changes were examined with respect to gender and family circumstances. Design The repeated cross-sectional data were conducted over two time points over the 3 weeks (N1 = 888; N2 = 966). Methods Participants completed online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention. Results Findings demonstrate dramatic increase in concern and safety behaviours among participants during the 3 weeks between the first identified case and the first fatality. The results suggest that parents, and mothers especially, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. People with chronic health conditions also expressed greater concern and safety behaviour than healthy participants, but with small effect size. Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of developing clear guidelines for alleviating the negative effects on mental health through effective communication strategies that minimize fear and emphasize positive behavioural change. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? In times of pandemic, people react with elevated levels of anxiety and some will adjust their behaviours in order to protect themselves as well as their family and friends. Some of the measures introduced to protect the spread of the COVID-19 disease have induced an atmosphere of fear, which in turn can lead to an increase in maladaptive anxiety and a greater burden on mental health. What does this study add? By conducting the research in two waves representing two critical time points in the developing COVID-19 situation in Croatia, we were able to trace a large increase in anxiety levels and safety behaviours among the general population. There is a discordance between those who are at most risk from serious consequences of the disease and those who are at greatest risk for maladaptive anxiety. Parents, and mothers in particular, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. Lockdown measures have allowed us to ensure the safety of those vulnerable for serious COVID-19 illness. Now, we must focus on preserving the mental health of our whole community.","Lauri Korajlija, Anita; Jokic-Begic, Natasa","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12425","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1116,""
"Flattening the mental ill-health curve: the importance of primary prevention in managing the mental health impacts of COVID19","The COVID19 pandemic is one the biggest challenges the global community has faced. The threat of the virus coupled with the impacts of the social and economic shut-down measures required to slow its spread, already appear to be impacting on people's mental health and wellbeing. Over the weeks, months and years ahead it is likely that many countries will experience a â€˜waveâ€™ of COVID19 related mental disorders as a result of an increase in risk factors linked to the pandemic such as social isolation; child-maltreatment; intimate partner violence; unemployment; housing and income stress; workplace trauma; and grief and loss. The â€˜two-prongedâ€™ approach used to deal with COVID19, provides an excellent blueprint for managing its mental health impacts as well. Nations must focus on preventing the occurrence of new cases of mental disorders as well as strengthening their mental healthcare response to support people who become mentally unwell. A focus on primary prevention is particularly important to â€˜flatten the curveâ€™ and avoid a surge in incidence of mental disorders stemming from the COVID19 pandemic. Many evidence-based interventions designed to prevent common disorders are already available and should be scaled-up. These interventions include parenting programs, social and emotional learning programs, self-care strategies, and workplace mental wellbeing programs, among others.","Carbone, Stephen R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mhp.2020.200185","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1117,""

But veterans' advocates still are waiting for a report by a White House task force established by President Donald Trump last year that was charged with developing a national roadmap to boost mental health care and stem persistently high suicide numbers among veterans, who have been hard hit in the pandemic. Release of the task force report had been scheduled in March but was abruptly shelved due to the outbreak.

Mercy said that it's closing the facility because of its inability to recruit and retain psychiatrists to run it, because of two reimbursements paid by insurers for mental health care and because of the age of the facility and the expense of maintaining it. Advocates say those beds are needed now more than ever with people feeling stress from COVID-19, those in crisis unable to stay safely in an emergency room and the lack of any other pediatric beds for children and teens in the region.","","https://doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32368","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1122,""

"Maintaining high quality multidisciplinary pain medicine fellowship programs: Part I: Innovations in pain fellowsâ€™ education, research, applicant selection process, wellness and ACGME implementation during the Covid-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Pain fellowship programs are facing unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions from state governments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resulted in a rapidly changing and evolving learning environment for todaysâ€™ fellows. Innovative solutions must be sought to guarantee proper education is maintained and ensure the well-being of our trainees. METHODS: We assembled a panel of pain program directors who serve as officers/board members of the Association of Pain Program Directors to provide guidance and formulate recommendations to pain fellowship directors nationally. This guidance is based on reviewing current changes to Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and American Board Anesthesiology policies and best available evidence and expert opinion on use of remote educational activities, research endeavors, and trainee wellness. CONCLUSIONS: The country is in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. The impact on pain management fellowships has been severe and will likely last for months, resulting in extraordinary challenges to the administration of pain fellowship programs and the education of our fellows. Understanding revisions in ACGME policies, use of technology to promote remote learning opportunities, and providing trainees with opportunities to alleviate their anxieties and encourage mental health are beneficial strategies to implement. Together, we can implement innovative solutions to help overcome these challenges.","Kohan, Lynn; Moeschler, Susan; Spektor, Boris; Przkora, Rene; Sobey, Cristopher; Brancolini, Scott; Wahezi, Sayed; Anitescu, Magdalena","https://www.doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnaa168","20200429","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1125,""
"PTSD as the second tsunami of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic","Since the first cases, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread around the world, with hundred-thousand cases and thousands of deaths. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common consequence of major disasters. Exceptional epidemic situations also promoted PTSD in the past. Considering that humanity is undergoing the most severe pandemic since Spanish Influenza, the actual pandemic of COVID-19 is very likely to promote PTSD. Moreover, COVID-19 was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). With a poor understanding of viruses and spreading mechanisms, the evocation of SARS is generating a great anxiety contributing to promote PTSD. Quarantine of infected patients evolved to quarantine of â€˜infectedâ€™ towns or popular districts, and then of entire countries. In the families of cases, the brutal death of family members involved a spread of fear and a loss of certainty, promoting PTSD. In the context of disaster medicine with a lack of human and technical resources, healthcare workers could also develop acute stress disorders, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD. Globally, WHO estimates 30â€“50% of the population affected by a disaster suffered from diverse psychological distress. PTSD individuals are more at-risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and deaths by suicide â€“ considering that healthcare workers are already at-risk occupations. We draw attention towards PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, both for general population, patients, and healthcare workers. Healthcare policies need to take into account preventive strategy of PTSD, and the related risk of suicide, in forthcoming months.","Dutheil, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Mondillon, Laurie; Navel, Valentin","https://www.doi.org/10.1017/s0033291720001336","20200424","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1126,""
"Ã‰pidÃ©mie de COVID-19 et prise en charge des conduites suicidaires: challenge et perspectives","Resumen Objectifs: La pandÃ©mie de Covid-19 touche Ã  ce jour plus de 3,000,000 de personnes Ã  travers le monde et les mesures de prÃ©vention ont conduit au confinement de plus de la moitiÃ© de lâ€™humanitÃ©. La communautÃ© scientifique et les autoritÃ©s politiques redoutent une Ã©pidÃ©mie de suicides secondaires Ã  cette crise. Lâ€™objectif de cette revue de la littÃ©rature est dâ€™analyser lâ€™impact de la pandÃ©mie de Covid-19 sur les dimensions du processus suicidaire, son interaction avec les diffÃ©rents facteurs de risque. Nous proposons Ã©galement des solutions innovantes pour y remÃ©dier. MÃ©thodes: Nous avons rÃ©alisÃ© une revue narrative des articles internationaux traitant des grandes pandÃ©mies (Covid-19, SRAS) et de leur influence sur la vulnÃ©rabilitÃ© suicidaire. RÃ©sultats: De nombreux facteurs sont susceptibles de majorer lâ€™Ã©mergence dâ€™idÃ©es de suicide et le passage Ã  lâ€™acte suicidaire au cours de cette crise. La distanciation et le confinement pourraient favoriser un sentiment de dÃ©connexion et la perception dâ€™une douleur sociale chez les individus vulnÃ©rables. Certaines populations dÃ©jÃ  Â«Ã  risque suicidaire Ã©levÃ©Â» pourraient Ãªtre encore fragilisÃ©es par la pandÃ©mie actuelle: personnes Ã¢gÃ©es, personnel mÃ©dical et individus exposÃ©s Ã  une forte prÃ©caritÃ© Ã©conomique. Plusieurs solutions innovantes adaptÃ©es aux contraintes de la distanciation et du confinement permettront de prÃ©venir le risque suicidaire: outils de santÃ© connectÃ©e, protocole VigilanS, ThÃ©rapie Comportementale et Cognitive de troisiÃ¨me vague et pratique artistique. Conclusions: Il est possible que cette crise inÃ©dite exacerbe certaines dimensions du processus suicidaire. Cependant, Ã  lâ€™heure de lâ€™innovation, plusieurs outils de prÃ©vention du suicide ont toute leur place dans les nouveaux modes de soins et devront Ãªtre expÃ©rimentÃ©s Ã  grande Ã©chelle. Abstract Objective: The Covid-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods: We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (Covid-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results: Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions: This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.","Conejero, IsmaÃ«l; Berrouiguet, Sofian; Ducasse, Deborah; Leboyer, Marion; Jardon, Vincent; OliÃ©, Emilie; Courtet, Philippe","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001","20200508","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1127,""
"Prisons confinÃ©es: quelles consÃ©quences pour les soins psychiatriques et la santÃ© mentale des personnes dÃ©tenues en France?","RÃ©sumÃ© Objectif. En France, les mesures de confinement ont Ã©tÃ© accompagnÃ©es de dispositions spÃ©cifiques pour les prisons: suspension des activitÃ©s, parloirs et interventions extÃ©rieures. Plus de dix mille personnes dÃ©tenues ont en outre Ã©tÃ© libÃ©rÃ©es pour diminuer le taux dâ€™occupation des Ã©tablissements et limiter la propagation du virus. Lâ€™objectif de cet article est de dÃ©crire la rÃ©organisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pÃ©nitentiaire en contexte de pandÃ©mie de Covid-19 et dâ€™interroger les consÃ©quences du confinement et des libÃ©rations anticipÃ©es sur la santÃ© mentale des personnes dÃ©tenues. MÃ©thode. Ce travail sâ€™appuie sur une enquÃªte menÃ©e en avril 2020 auprÃ¨s des soignants de 42 unitÃ©s sanitaires en milieu pÃ©nitentiaire et des 9 unitÃ©s hospitaliÃ¨res spÃ©cialement amÃ©nagÃ©es en France. Une synthÃ¨se de la littÃ©rature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pÃ©nitentiaire durant lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie de Covid-19 a Ã©galement Ã©tÃ© rÃ©alisÃ©e. RÃ©sultats. Lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie de Covid-19 semble avoir Ã©tÃ© plutÃ´t contenue dans les prisons franÃ§aises au cours de la pÃ©riode de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcÃ©rale est important. Les 3 niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pÃ©nitentiaire ont instaurÃ© des mesures spÃ©cifiques pour assurer la continuitÃ© des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcÃ©rÃ©es et contenir lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la crÃ©ation de Â« secteurs Covid Â», la dÃ©programmation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures dâ€™hygiÃ¨ne et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontÃ©s Ã  des sevrages forcÃ©s, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des dÃ©compensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libÃ©rations anticipÃ©es sont aussi trÃ¨s prÃ©occupantes, pouvant entraÃ®ner des ruptures de soins, par manque de prÃ©paration des relais de prise en charge. Discussion. Les remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilitÃ© accrue au fossÃ© qui sÃ©pare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pÃ©nitentiaire. Il nous apparaÃ®t important de rappeler la vulnÃ©rabilitÃ© des personnes incarcÃ©rÃ©es qui doivent impÃ©rativement Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ©es dans les politiques de santÃ© publique. Abstract Objective. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detaineesâ€™ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10 000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods. This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called â€œUHSAsâ€ (which stands for â€œunitÃ©s hospitaliÃ¨res spÃ©cialement amÃ©nagÃ©esâ€, and can be translated as â€œspecially equipped hospital unitsâ€). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results. The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infectionâ€™s spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of â€œCovid unitsâ€, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relativesâ€™ wellbeing) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside, could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known â€œrevolving prison doorsâ€ effect. Discussion. The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.","Fovet, Thomas; Lancelevee, Camille; Eck, Marion; Scouflaire, Tatiana; Becache, Eve; Dandelot, Dominique; Giravalli, Pascale; Guillard, Alexandre; Horrach, Pierre; Lacambre, Mathieu; Lefebvre, Tiphaine; Moncany, Anne-HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Touitou, David; David, Michel; Thomas, Pierre","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002","20200508","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1128,""

"Pediatric Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry: An Update and Review","Abstract Background In recent years, there has been an increasing burden of child and adolescent mental illness recognized in the United States, and the need for pediatric mental health care is growing. Pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatrists are increasingly playing a role in the management of medical and psychiatric disease for pediatric patients. The field is a fast-moving one, with understanding of new neuropsychiatric disease entities; reformulation of prior disease entities; and new, interdisciplinary treatments and models of care. Methods In this study, we aim to review recent advances in the field of pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatry, including new diagnostic entities, updated management of frequently encountered clinical presentations, and developments in systems of care. Conclusion The advances in pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatry are broad and serve to promote more streamlined, evidence-based care for the vulnerable population of psychiatrically ill pediatric medical patients. More work remains to determine the most effective interventions for the wide array of presentations seen by pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatrists.","Becker, Jessica E.; Smith, Joshua R.; Hazen, Eric P.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.04.015","20200425","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1130,""
"Isolation of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: An ethical, legal, and practical challenge","Abstract Psychiatric inpatients are particularly vulnerable to the transmission and effects of COVID-19. As such, healthcare providers should implement measures to prevent its spread within mental health units, including adequate testing, cohorting, and in some cases, the isolation of patients. Respiratory isolation imposes a significant limitation on an individual's right to liberty, and should be accompanied by appropriate legal safeguards. This paper explores the implications of respiratory isolation in English law, considering the applicability of the common law doctrine of necessity, the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Mental Health Act 1983, and public health legislation. We then interrogate the practicality of currently available approaches by applying them to a series of hypothetical cases. There are currently no â€˜neatâ€™ or practicable solutions to the problem of lawfully isolating patients on mental health units, and we discuss the myriad issues with both mental health and public health law approaches to the problem. We conclude by making some suggestions to policymakers.","Brown, Christian; Keene, Alex Ruck; Hooper, Carwyn Rhys; O'Brien, Aileen","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101572","20200508","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1131,""

"Overdose and Risk Factors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Abstract Background There have been significant efforts to respond to the two public health emergencies of COVID-19 and overdose in British Columbia (BC) Canada. The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of known risk factors associated with mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) for persons who have had a non-fatal overdose (2015-2017) in comparison to persons who have not had an overdose. Methods Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort (ODC) which includes a 20% random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015-December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. Results Persons who had an overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. Conclusion Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.","Slaunwhite, Amanda Kathleen; Gan, Wen Qi; Xavier, Chloe; Zhao, Bin; A Buxton, Jane; Desai, Roshni","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108047","20200508","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1133,""
"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Abstract Background COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), who stand in the frontline of this crisis. It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. Methods A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17th, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Findings Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23Â·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22Â·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38Â·9% across 4 studies. Interpretation Early evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience mood and sleep disturbances during this outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.","Pappa, Sofia; Ntella, Vasiliki; Giannakas, Timoleon; Giannakoulis, Vassilis G.; Papoutsi, Eleni; Katsaounou, Paraskevi","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.026","20200508","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1134,""
"Adolescentsâ€™ Motivations to Engage in Social Distancing during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations with Mental and Social Health","Abstract Purpose Reducing the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted recommendations for individuals to socially distance. Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Using a large sample of adolescents from across the US, this study examined adolescentsâ€™ motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. Methods Data were collected March 29th and 30th 2020, two-weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the US. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescentsâ€™ motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Results Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescentsâ€™ anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Conclusions Understanding adolescentsâ€™ motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Oosterhoff, Benjamin; Palmer, Cara A.; Wilson, Jenna; Shook, Natalie","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.05.004","20200508","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1135,""
"Early career psychiatristsâ€™ perspectives on the mental health impact and care of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world","Abstract The emergence of mental health (MH) problems during a pandemic is extremely common, though difficult to address due to the complexities of pandemics and the little evidence about the epidemiology of pandemic-related MH problems and the potential interventions to tackle them. Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, what could be due to a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists, from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation of their countries, existing myths and misinformation, and the possible resources available. They were also asked to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CFâ€™s were prepared based on the extant literature and the views expressed; they illustrate the epidemiology of MH issues, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans/innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and probable outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research in pandemic. It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts and to develop evidence based MH interventions. However further research focusing on the individual components of this framework is needed.","Ransing, Ramdas; Adiukwu, Frances; Pereira-Sanchez, Victor; Ramalho, Rodrigo; Orsolini, Laura; Schuh Teixeira, AndrÃ© Luiz; Gonzalez-Diaz, Jairo M.; da Costa, Mariana Pinto; Soler-Vidal, Joan; BytyÃ§i, Drita Gashi; El Hayek, Samer; Larnaout, Amine; Shalbafan, Mohammadreza; Syarif, Zulvia; Nofal, Marwa; Kundadak, Ganesh Kudva","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102085","20200414","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1136,""

"Centralized and decentralized isolation strategies and their impact on the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics","The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized (C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to understand and control over an extended period of time.","Topirceanu, Alexandru; Udrescu, Mihai; Marculescu, Radu","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200408","","ArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-21","",1138,""
