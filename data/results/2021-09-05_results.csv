"The impact of mental health and substance use issues on COVID-19 vaccine readiness: a cross sectional community-based survey in Ontario, Canada","Background: COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use in Canada since December 2020. However, data about factors associated with vaccine hesitancy and the impact of mental health and/or substance use (MHSU) issues on vaccine uptake are currently not available. The goal of this study was to explore factors, particularly MHSU factors, that impact COVID-19 vaccination intentions in Ontario, Canada. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional survey with recruitment based on age, gender, and geographical location (to ensure a representative population of Ontario), was conducted in February 2021. Multinomial logistic regression was used to test the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination status and plans and sociodemographic background, social support, anxiety about contracting COVID-19, and MHSU concerns. Results: Of the total sample of 2528 respondents, 1932 (76.4%) were vaccine ready, 381 (15.1%) were hesitant, and 181 (7.1%) were resistant. Significant independent predictors of vaccine hesitancy compared with vaccine readiness included younger age (OR=2.11, 95%CI=1.62-2.74), female gender (OR=1.36, 95%CI=1.06-1.74), Black ethnicity (OR=2.11, 95%CI=1.19-3.75), lower education (OR=1.69, 95%CI=1.30-2.20), lower SES status (OR=.88, 95%CI=.84-.93), lower anxiety about self or someone close contracting COVID-19 (OR=2.06, 95%CI=1.50-2.82), and lower depression score (OR=.90, 95%CI=.82-.98). Significant independent predictors of vaccine resistance compared with readiness included younger age (OR=1.72, 95%CI=1.19-2.50), female gender (OR=1.57, 95%CI=1.10-2.24), being married (OR=1.50, 95%CI=1.04-2.16), lower SES (OR=.80, 95%CI=.74-.86), lower satisfaction with social support (OR=.78, 95%CI=.70-.88), lower anxiety about contracting COVID-19 (OR=7.51, 95%CI=5.18-10.91), and lower depression score (OR=.85, 95%CI=.76-.96). Interpretation: COVID-19 vaccination intention is affected by sociodemographic factors, anxiety about contracting COVID-19, and select mental health issues.","Kamna Mehra; Roula Markoulakis; Sugy Kodeeswaran; Donald Redelmeier; Mark Sinyor; James MacKillop; Amy Cheung; Emily E Levitt; Tracey Addison; Anthony J Levitt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.30.21262844","20210903","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17637,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with epilepsy: Findings from the Brazilian arm of the COV-E study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on people and healthcare services. The disruption to chronic illnesses, such as epilepsy, may relate to several factors ranging from direct infection to secondary effects from healthcare reorganization and social distancing measures. As part of the COVID-19 and Epilepsy (COV-E) global study, we ascertained the effects of COVID-19 on people with epilepsy in Brazil, based on their perspectives and those of their caregivers. We also evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the care delivered to people with epilepsy by healthcare workers. We designed separate online surveys for people with epilepsy and their caregivers. A further survey for healthcare workers contained additional assessments of changes to working patterns, productivity, and concerns for those with epilepsy under their care. The Brazilian arm of COV-E initially collected data from May to November 2020 during the country's first wave. We also examined national data to identify the Brazilian states with the highest COVID-19 incidence and related mortality. Lastly, we applied this geographic grouping to our data to explore whether local disease burden played a direct role in difficulties faced by people with epilepsy. Two hundred and forty-one people returned the survey, 20% were individuals with epilepsy (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯48); 22% were caregivers (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯53), and 58% were healthcare workers (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯140). Just under half (43%) of people with epilepsy reported health changes during the pandemic, including worsening seizure control, with specific issues related to stress and impaired mental health. Of respondents prescribed antiseizure medication, 11% reported difficulty taking medication on time due to problems acquiring prescriptions and delayed or canceled medical appointments. Only a small proportion of respondents reported discussing significant epilepsy-related risks in the previous 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months. Analysis of national COVID-19 data showed a higher disease burden in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro compared to Brazil as a whole. There were, however, no geographic differences observed in survey responses despite variability in the incidence of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that Brazilians with epilepsy have been adversely affected by COVID-19 by factors beyond infection or mortality. Mental health issues and the importance of optimal communication are critical during these difficult times. Healthcare services need to find nuanced approaches and learn from shared international experiences to provide optimal care for people with epilepsy as the direct burden of COVID-19 improves in some countries. In contrast, others face resurgent waves of the pandemic.","Andraus, Thorpe, Tai, Ashby, Hallab, Ding, Dugan, Perucca, Costello, French, O'Brien, Depondt, Andrade, Sengupta, Delanty, Jette, Newton, Brodie, Devinsky, Helen Cross, Li, Silvado, Moura, Cosenza, Messina, Hanna, Sander, Sen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108261","20210904","Coronavirus; Epilepsy risk; Non-communicable disease; SUDEP; Seizures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17638,""
"The challenge of COVID-19 for adult men and women in the United States: disparities of psychological distress by gender and age","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of psychological distress rose from 11% in 2019 to more than 40% in 2020. This study aims to examine the disparities among US adult men and women. We used 21 waves of cross-sectional data from the Household Pulse Survey that were collected between April and December 2020 for the study. The Household Pulse Survey was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau to document the social and economic impact of COVID-19. The study population included four groups of adults: emerging adults (18-24 years); young adults (25-44 years); middle-aged adults (45-64 years); and older adults (65-88 years). Psychological distress was measured by their Generalized Anxiety Disorder score and the Patient Health Questionnaire. The prevalence of psychological stress was calculated using logistic models adjusted for socio-demographic variables including race/ethnicity, education, household income, and household structure. All descriptive and regression analysis considered survey weights. Younger age groups experienced higher prevalence of psychological distress than older age groups. Among emerging adults, the prevalence of anxiety (42.6%) and depression (39.5%) was more than twice as high as older adults who experienced prevalence of anxiety at 20% and depression at 16.6%. Gender differences were also more apparent in emerging adults. Women between 18 and 24 years reported higher differential rates of anxiety and depression than those with men (anxiety: 43.9% vs. 28.3%; depression: 33.3% vs. 24.9%). Understanding the complex dynamics between COVID-19 and psychological distress has emerged as a public health priority. Mitigating the negative mental health consequences associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, for younger generations and females in particular, will require local efforts to rebuild capacity for social integration and social connection.","Zhang, Walkover, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.07.017","20210904","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Disparities; Emerging Adults; Gender","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17639,""
"Changes of psychotic-like experiences and their association with anxiety/depression among young adolescents before COVID-19 and after the lockdown in China","Lockdown policies during COVID-19 pandemic have potential adverse psychological impacts on youth. However, little is known about their influence on the changes of psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) among adolescents, nor about the possible association between changes in PLEs and changes in anxiety/depression symptoms. We investigated these two questions through a longitudinal comparative study. In total, 1825 adolescents were surveyed before COVID-19 and after the lockdown in China (T0, October 20th, 2019 and T1, May 18th, 2020). PLEs, anxiety, and depression were measured with paranoia, anxiety and depression subscales of the Mental Health Inventory of Middle school students (MMHI-60). Within-subjects Wilcoxon test, Spearman correlation test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were adopted. Significant increase in adolescent PLEs scores was observed after the lockdown (Wilcoxon's wÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9.302, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). We also found positive correlation between changes of PLEs and changes of anxiety/depression (Spearman's rhoÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.59/0.53, both pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Furthermore, four PLEs trajectories were identified based on the report of PLEs at two timepoints: 60.4% with no PLEs, 9.3% remitted PLEs, 16.7% new PLEs, and 13.6% persistent PLEs. Significant difference was found in changes of anxiety/depression among four groups (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001); notably, the group with new-onset PLEs had the greatest exacerbation in anxiety/depression symptoms (both p Bonferroni &lt;0.001). This work is the first to identify increases in adolescent PLEs across the COVID-19 pandemic and suggested a close longitudinal association between PLEs and anxiety/depression. Our findings have implications for adolescent mental health crisis interventions during the pandemic.","Wu, Liu, Zou, Wang, Zhu, Zhang, Tao, Ross, Long","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2021.08.020","20210904","Adolescent mental health; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Psychotic-like experiences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17640,""
"Evaluation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting of maltreatment cases to the National Family Safety Program in Saudi Arabia","The COVID-19 pandemic represents a global and nationwide public health crisis. Although protective, socially restrictive measures may cause social isolation, which amounts to an increased ecological risk for mental health disturbance in vulnerable populations. Previous reports have suggested a significant association between the occurrence of public health crises and increased rates of multiple risk factors related to child mental health disturbances, domestic violence, and child-maltreatment. We conducted a retrospective data review of reported child maltreatment cases from the National Family Safety Program during the period of September 2019 to September 2020. A descriptive analysis approach was used to compare rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. During COVID-19, abuse was significantly more reported by a family member than by the victims themselves or by a healthcare worker. However, before COVID-19, the offender was less often reported to be known to the victim; was both parents or the mother but was more often described as male, older, single, less educated; and currently unemployed with no significant change observed in their health status (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Interestingly, the predicted type of abuse also significantly differed and was more emotional or sexual than other types (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). The types of abuse and the characteristics of both abused children and offenders saw significant changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sexual and emotional abuses were reported more frequently, and the male gender is considered to feature more commonly in reports prior to the pandemic era than during the pandemic.","Alenezi, Alnamnakani, Temsah, Murshid, Alfahad, Alqurashi, Alonazy, Alothman, Aleissa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105297","20210904","Emotional abuse; Neglect; Physical abuse; Saudi Arabia; Sexual abuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17641,""
"Children's Daily Lives and Well-being: Findings from the CORONA-CODOMO Survey #1","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed people's lives dramatically. Few data on the acute effects of the pandemic on children's daily lives and well-being have been published to date. This study aimed to capture the effects on Japanese children during the first peak of the outbreak. We conducted a web-based, anonymous cross-sectional survey targeting Japanese children aged 7-17 years and parents/guardians of children aged 0-17 years. Eligible individuals were invited to the survey from April 30 to May 31, 2020. This self-report questionnaire examined daily life and behaviors, psychological symptoms, well-being, quality of life, and positive parenting or abusive behaviors at the very beginning of the outbreak. A total of 2,591 children and 6,116 parents/guardians participated in our survey. Sixty-two percent of children reported screen time exceeding 2 hours. Twenty percent of children reported abusive behaviors by family members. Nine in ten parents/guardians of school-aged children reported their child had at least one acute stress symptom in the past month. Average mental health subscale scores from KINDL-R questionnaire on quality of life were lower than the national average for all grades. Nearly half of parents/guardians refrained from seeking medical care for the child's symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic had serious acute impacts on Japanese children's daily lives, well-being, family relationships and health care utilization, including some impacts that are potentially long-lasting; thus, proactive interventions and services are needed, as well as longitudinal surveys.","Hangai, Piedvache, Sawada, Okubo, Sampei, Yamaoka, Tanaka, Hosozawa, Morisaki, Igarashi","https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.14981","20210904","COVID-19; Children; Outbreak; Survey; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17642,""
"Covid-19 and development of heart failure: mystery and truth","Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a novel worldwide pandemic caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During Covid-19 pandemic, socioeconomic deprivation, social isolation, and reduced physical activities may induce heart failure (HF), destabilization, and cause more complications. HF appears as a potential hazard due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, chiefly in elderly patients with underlying comorbidities. In reality, the expression of cardiac ACE2 is implicated as a target point for SARS-CoV-2-induced acute cardiac injury. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, like other febrile illnesses, high blood viscosity, exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and endothelial dysfunction-induced coagulation disorders may increase risk of HF development. Hypoxic respiratory failure, as in pulmonary edema, severe acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may affect heart hemodynamic stability due to the development of pulmonary hypertension. Indeed, Covid-19-induced HF could be through the development of cytokine storm, characterized by high proliferation pro-inflammatory cytokines. In cytokine storm-mediated cardiac dysfunction, there is a positive correlation between levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine and myocarditis-induced acute cardiac injury biomarkers. Therefore, Covid-19-induced HF is more complex and related from a molecular background in releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines to the neuro-metabolic derangements that together affect cardiomyocyte functions and development of HF. Anti-heart failure medications, mainly digoxin and carvedilol, have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-inflammatory properties that may mitigate Covid-19 severity and development of HF. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to the development of HF due to direct acute cardiac injury or through the development of cytokine storms, which depress cardiomyocyte function and cardiac contractility. Anti-heart failure drugs, mainly digoxin and carvedilol, may attenuate severity of HF by reducing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the development of cytokine storms in severely affected Covid-19 patients.","Onohuean, Al-Kuraishy, Al-Gareeb, Qusti, Alshammari, Batiha","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-021-02147-6","20210904","Covid-19; Development; Heart failure; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17643,""
"The Relationship between Pain and Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Is Social Technology Use Protective?","The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shelter-in-place orders have profoundly changed the everyday social environment. This study examines the relationship between pain and psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and loneliness) among US adults ages 54+ during the pandemic. We also test whether use of technology for social purposes moderates the association between pain severity and psychological distress. Using cross-sectional data on 1,014 adults ages 54Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°(pain-free, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°637; mild pain, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°106; moderate pain, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°227; and severe pain, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°64) from the 2020 Health and Retirement Study COVID-19 Project (Early, Version 1.0), we conducted regression analyses to test the association between pain severity and psychological outcomes, and to assess social technology use frequency as a moderator. Compared to their pain-free peers, participants with mild-to-moderate pain reported more depressive symptoms and greater loneliness; those with severe pain reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Social technology use was associated with lower levels of depression and loneliness. However, interaction analyses show that social technology use predicted an increase in depression for individuals with pain, but a decrease in depression among pain-free individuals. For anxiety and loneliness, no significant effects of social technology use were observed. Older adults with pain are at high risk of depression, anxiety, and loneliness during the pandemic. Although social technologies have become a common alternative to face-to-face interactions during the COVID-19 crisis, and overall they can provide mental health benefits, our results suggest that social technologies can be detrimental to psychological well-being among people with pain. These findings can inform technology-based interventions aiming to promote well-being among older adults with pain.","Yang, Grol-Prokopczyk, Reid, Pillemer","https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnab262","20210904","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; loneliness; technology use for social purpose","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17644,""
"Aerosol boxes decrease aerosol exposure only in depressurized rooms during aerosol-generating procedures in a simulation study","The aim of this study was to compare aerosol exposure with or without an aerosol box in a pressurized/depressurized room during aerosol-generating procedures using an experimental model. Cake flour (aerosol model) was expelled from an advanced life support training mannequin. The primary outcome measure was the number of 0.3-10Ã‚Â Ã‚Âµm-sized particles at three locations corresponding to the physician, medical staff, and environmental aerosol exposure levels. The aerosol dispersion was visualized using a high-resolution video. The number of expelled particles was measured after artificial coughing during simulated tracheal intubation and extubation in four situations, with or without an aerosol box in a pressurized or depressurized room (Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.5Ã‚Â Pa). The particles arising from tracheal intubation at the three positions in the four groups differed significantly in size (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The sizes of particles arising from extubation at the physicians' and medical staff's faces in the four groups differed significantly in size (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Post hoc analysis showed that the counts of all particles at the three positions were significantly lower in the depressurized room with an aerosol box than in the pressurized room without an aerosol box during tracheal intubation (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 at three positions) and extubation (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) at the physician's and medical staff's positions).

"Early Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Telehealth Patterns in Primary Care, Mental Health, and Specialty Care Facilities in Texas","Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many US clinics have shifted some or all of their practice from in-person to virtual visits. In this study, we assessed the use of telehealth among primary care and specialty clinics, by targeting healthcare administrators via multiple channels. Using an online survey, we assessed the use of, barriers to, and reimbursement for telehealth. Respondents included clinic administrators (chief executive officers, vice presidents, directors, and senior-level managers). A total of 85 complete responses were recorded, 79% of which represented solo or group practices and 63% reported a daily patient census &gt;50. The proportion of clinics that delivered Ã¢â€°Â¥50% of their consults using telehealth increased from 16% in March to 42% in April, 35% in May, and 30% in June. Clinics identified problems with telehealth reimbursement; although 63% of clinics reported that Ã¢â€°Â¥75% of their telehealth consults were reimbursed, only 51% indicated that Ã¢â€°Â¥75% of their telehealth visits were reimbursed at par with in-person office visits. Sixty-five percent of clinics reported having basic or foundational telehealth services, whereas only 9% of clinics reported advanced telehealth maturity. Value-based care participating clinics were more likely to report advanced telehealth services (27%), compared with non-value-based care clinics (3%). These findings highlight the adaptability of clinics to quickly transition and adopt telehealth. Uncertainty about reimbursement and policy changes may make the shift temporal, however.","Adepoju, Chae, Ayadi, Matuk-Villazon, Liaw","https://doi.org/10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001289","20210904","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17646,""

The PHQ-9, GAD-7, and CPDI scales were used to assess the emotional impact. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to measure differences between groups, considering potential confounding factors. Regarding CPDI values, all other groups showed reduced values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. However, the general population, preclinical and clinical medical students showed increased PHQ-9 values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. Finally, confounding factors, gender and age correlated negatively with higher CPDI and PHQ-9 scores. Being frontline personnel is associated with increased COVID-19-related stress.

Patients, who satisfy all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups in a ratio 2:1 (IFN-treated versus control patients). Randomization will be stratified by gender. Stratified randomization will balance the presence of male and female in both study arms. Male and female adults aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild COVID-19 symptoms are eligible for the study. The trial is being conducted in Rome. Participants will be either hospitalized or home isolated. A group of physicians belonging to the Special Unit for Regional Continued Care (USCAR), specifically trained for the study and under the supervision of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases ""Lazzaro Spallanzani"", will be responsible for the screening, enrolment, treatment and clinical monitoring of patients, thus acting as a bridge between clinical centers and territorial health management. Inclusion criteria are as follows: Ã¢â€°Â¥ 65 years of age at time of enrolment; Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by PCR, in any specimen &lt; 72 hours prior to randomization; Subject (or legally authorized representative) provides written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures; Understands and agrees to comply with planned study procedures; Agrees to the collection of nasopharyngeal swabs and venous blood samples per protocol; Being symptomatic for less than 7 days before starting therapy; NEWS2 score Ã¢â€°Â¤2. Exclusion criteria are as follows: Hospitalized patients with illness of any duration, and at least one of the following: Clinical assessment (evidence of rales/crackles on exam) and SpO2 Ã¢â€°Â¤ 94% on room air at rest or after walking test, OR Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen; Patients currently using IFN-ÃŽÂ² (e.g., multiple sclerosis patients); Patients undergoing chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive treatments; Patients with chronic kidney diseases; Known allergy or hypersensitivity to IFN (including asthma); Any autoimmune disease (resulting from patient anamnesis); Patients with signs of dementia or neurocognitive disorders; Patients with current severe depression and/or suicidal ideations; Being concurrently involved in another clinical trial; HIV infection (based on the anamnesis); Use of any antiretroviral medication; Impaired renal function (eGFR calculated by CKD-EPI Creatinine equation &lt; 30 ml/min); Presence of other severe diseases impairing life expectancy (e.g. patients are not expected to survive 28 days given their pre-existing medical condition); Any physical or psychological impediment in a patient that could let the investigator to suspect his/her poor compliance; Lack or withdrawal of informed consent INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Control arm: No specific antiviral treatment besides standard of care. Treatment arm: 11ÃŽÂ¼g (3MIU) of IFN-ÃŽÂ²1a will be injected subcutaneously at day 1, 3, 7, and 10 in addition to standard of care. The drug solution, contained in a pre-filled cartridge, will be injected by means of the RebiSmartÃ‚Â® electronic injection device. Interferon ÃŽÂ²1a (RebifÃ‚Â®, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The dose selected for this study is expected to exploit the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of the cytokine without causing relevant toxicity or inducing refractoriness phenomena sometimes observed after high-dose and/or chronic IFNÃŽÂ² treatments. Primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients experiencing a disease progression, during at least 5 days, according to the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2). The NEWS2 score is a standardized approach aimed at promptly detecting signs of clinical deterioration in acutely ill patients and establishing the potential need for higher level of care. It is based on the evaluation of vital signs, including respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, blood pressure, pulse/heart rate, AVPU response. The resulting observations, compared to a normal range, are combined in a single composite ""alarm"" score. Any other clinical sign clearly indicating a disease worsening will be considered as disease progression. Sixty patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive IFN-ÃŽÂ²1a plus the standard of care or the standard of care only. Eligible patients will be randomized (no later than 36 h after enrolment) by means of a computerized central randomization system. All patients will receive a unique patient identification number at enrolling visit when signing the informed consent and before any study procedure is performed. This number remains constant throughout the entire study. The randomization of patients will be closed when 60 patients have been enrolled. The randomization will be stratified by sex; for each stratum a sequence of treatments randomly permuted in blocks of variable length (3 or 6) will be generated. This is an open-label study. After the randomization, patients will be notified whether they will be in the experimental arm or in the control arm. The study plans to enrol 60 patients: 40 in the IFN-ÃŽÂ²1a arm, 20 in the control arm, according to a 2:1 - treated: untreated ratio.

"Physical activity on mental wellbeing in senior English Premier League soccer players during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown created new stressors that could potentially attenuate mental wellbeing (MW) in athletes, who are already susceptible to poor MW. This study aims to describe fluctuations to MW during 'lockdown' and subsequent 'return to sport' protocols, in comparison to the normal 'in-season' in professional soccer.Twenty-five English Premier League (EPL) soccer players completed the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) every two weeks, during the 2019/2020 season, and every week during 'lockdown' and 'return to training' for 28 weeks. The duration of each physical activity (PA) session completed was recorded. No significant differences were found for MW between time points (In-season, lockdown, return to training, and the restart) (51.5Ã‚Â±5.6 vs. 50.7Ã‚Â±4.8 vs. 50.8Ã‚Â±5.7 vs. 50.7Ã‚Â±5.6 (<i>p</i> &gt;0.05)) respectively. Individually, differences were identified; in-season weekly session duration (243Ã‚Â±38 min) was higher than during lockdown (180Ã‚Â±62 min) (<i>p</i> &lt;0.05). During lockdown, weekly MW scores were related to the previous 7-day number of sessions (<i>r</i> = 0.151) and active min (<i>r</i> = 0.142) (<i>p</i> &lt;0.05). Furthermore, participants that exercised &gt;250 min in lockdown, had higher MW scores (52.46 Ã‚Â± 4.65) than &lt;250 min (50.35Ã‚Â±6.55) (<i>p</i> &lt;0.05). MW responses to lockdown were best understood on an individual basis. Additionally, PA only had a measurable effect on MW when &gt;250 min. Further, stressors imposed upon players during an EPL season, are potentially greater than those inflicted by the lockdown. Implications for monitoring MW in EPL soccer players and the potential inclusion of an in-season break are discussed.","Grimson, Brickley, Smeeton, Abbott, Brett","https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2021.1976841","20210904","COVID-19 Pandemic; Mental Health; Physical Activity; Professional Soccer; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17650,""
"Perspectives of board-certified healthcare chaplains on challenges and adaptations in delivery of spiritual care in the COVID-19 era: Findings from an online survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges for healthcare systems to meet patients' and families' complex care needs, including spiritual care needs. Little data are available about spiritual care delivery in light of the pandemic. This study examined the impact of COVID-19 on spiritual care by healthcare chaplains in the United States. An online survey of 563 board-certified chaplains was conducted from March to July 2020. The survey, designed to identify chaplains' roles in facilitating conversations about goals of care, included an open-ended question asking how COVID-19 affected chaplaincy practices; 236 chaplains responded. Quantitative data and written qualitative responses were analyzed using descriptive analysis and content analysis, respectively. Majority of participants were white (88%), female (59%), Protestant (53%), and employed full time (86%). Almost half were working in community hospitals (45%) and designated to one or more special units (48%) including ICU, palliative care, and oncology. Three major themes emerged from chaplains' qualitative responses: (1) COVID-19-related risk mitigation and operational changes; (2) impact of social distancing guidelines; and (3) increased need for and provision of psychosocial and spiritual support. Chaplains reported that COVID-19 challenges contributed to greater social isolation, and mental health concerns for patients, families, and healthcare staff, and substantially changed the way healthcare chaplains provided spiritual care. With evolving healthcare contexts, developing safer, more creative modes of spiritual care delivery while offering systematic support for chaplains can help meet the increasing psychosocial and spiritual needs of patients, families, and healthcare team members.","Kwak, Rajagopal, Handzo, Hughes, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1177/02692163211043373","20210904","COVID-19; Healthcare chaplain; psychosocial support; spiritual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17651,""
"Clinical Decision Support Systems and Computerized Provider Order Entry: Contributions from 2020","To summarize research contributions published in 2020 in the field of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE), and select the best papers for the Decision Support section of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook 2021. Two bibliographic databases were searched for papers referring to clinical decision support systems. From search results, section editors established a list of candidate best papers, which were then peer-reviewed by seven external reviewers. The IMIA Yearbook editorial committee finally selected the best papers on the basis of all reviews including the section editors' evaluation. A total of 1,919 articles were retrieved. 15 best paper candidates were selected, the reviews of which resulted in the selection of two best papers. One paper reports on the use of electronic health records to support a public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The second paper proposes a combination of CDSS and telemedicine as a technology-based intervention to improve the outcomes of depression as part of a cluster trial. As shown by the number and the variety of works related to clinical decision support, research in the field is very active. This year's selection highlighted the application of CDSS to fight COVID-19 and a combined technology-based strategy to improve the treatment of depression.","Borbolla, Ficheur","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1726534","20210903","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17652,""
"COVID-19 and suicidal behavior: A bibliometric assessment","The paper examines the global research output on suicidal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Scopus database was used to identify the publications on suicidal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of the pandemic to upÃ‚Â to 17th May 2021. The 686 publications emerging from 78 countries were found on the topic. These publications received 7970 citations, with an average of 11.62 citations per paper. About one-sixth (16.33%) of the total publications were funded, and these publications averaged 17.24 citations per paper. The publications from the top 10 most productive countries accounted for 92.71% of all publications. The highest number of publications emerged from United States, United Kingdom, and India. However, the relative citation index was highest for publications arising from France, Bangladesh, and Germany. The total number of organizations and authors involved in these publications were 286 and 290, respectively. The top 20 most productive organizations and authors contributed to 35.13% and 17.64% of publications and 79.15% and 58.61% global citations share, respectively.

"Associations Between the Perceived Severity of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Cyberchondria, Depression, Anxiety, Stress, and Lockdown Experience: Cross-sectional Survey Study","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused great panic among the public, with many people suffering from adverse stress reactions. To control the spread of the pandemic, governments in many countries have imposed lockdown policies. In this unique pandemic context, people can obtain information on pandemic dynamics over time on the internet. However, searching for health-related information on the internet frequently increases the public's possibility for being troubled by online information and experiencing symptoms of cyberchondria. This study aimed to examine the relationships between people's perceived severity of the COVID-19 pandemic (PSCP) and their depression, anxiety, and stress to explore the role of cyberchondria, which is closely relates to using the internet in these relationship mechanisms. In addition, we also examine the moderating role of lockdown experience. In February 2020, a total of 486 participants were recruited from pandemic areas in China via an online platform. We used questionnaires to measure participants' PSCP, the severity of their cyberchondria, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms as well as their lockdown experiences. AMOS 7.0 software was used to test for CFA. SPSS 24.0 software was used to test for exploratory factor analysis, common method bias, descriptive statistical analysis, and correlation analysis. Moderated mediation models were examined using SPSS PROCESS Version 3.5 software. The results showed a positive association between PSCP and depression (ÃŽÂ² = 0.36, t = 8.51, p &lt; 0.001), anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = 0.41, t = 9.84, p &lt; 0.001), and stress (ÃŽÂ² = 0.46, t = 11.45, p &lt; 0.001), which were mediated by cyberchondria (ÃŽÂ² = 0.36, t = 8.59, p &lt; 0.001). The direct effects of PSCP on anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = 0.07, t = 2.01, p = 0.045) and stress (ÃŽÂ² = 0.09, t = 2.75, p = 0.006) and the indirect effects of cyberchondria on depression (ÃŽÂ² = 0.10, t = 2.59, p = 0.009) and anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = 0.10, t = 2.50, p = 0.01) were moderated by lockdown experience. The higher individuals' PSCP was, the more serious the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were. In addition, the associations were partially mediated by cyberchondria. Individuals with higher PSCP were more likely to develop cyberchondria, which aggravated individuals' depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Negative lockdown experience exacerbated the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mental health.","Han, Zhan, Li, Xu, Xu, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.2196/31052","20210903","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17654,""
"High Work-related Stress and Anxiety Response to COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey Study in South Korea","Healthcare workers experienced severe psychological impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. It is important to establish a process of psychological assessment and interventions for healthcare workers affected by epidemics. We investigated the risk factors associated with the psychological impact of each healthcare worker group, to help optimize psychological interventions for healthcare workers in countries affected by COVID-19. Participants (N = 1,787) from two hospitals in Korea, completed an online survey from April 14 to 30, 2020, by obtaining information on demographics, psychiatric history and the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess contributing factors as predictor variables and healthcare workers' depression as outcome variables. Among the 1,783 healthcare workers, compared with other healthcare workers, nursing professionals had significantly higher levels of depression (PHQ-9 score; 5.5 Ã‚Â± 4.6 vs. 3.8 Ã‚Â± 4.2; P &lt; .01), general anxiety (GAD-7 score; 4.0 Ã‚Â± 4.1 vs. 2.7 Ã‚Â± 3.6; P &lt; .01), and virus-related anxiety symptoms (SAVE-9 score; 21.6 Ã‚Â± 5.9 vs. 18.6 Ã‚Â± 6.3; P &lt; .01). In the nursing professionals group, single workers reported more severe depressive symptoms than married workers (PHQ-9 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10; 20.3% vs. 14.1%; P &lt; .01), and junior (&lt;40 years) workers reported more anxiety about the viral epidemic (SAVE-9 anxiety score; 15.6 Ã‚Â± 4.1 vs. 14.7 Ã‚Â± 4.4; P &lt; .01). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the hospital factor (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval, CI [1.06-1.99]), nursing professionals (aOR = 1.37, 95% CI [1.02-1.98]), single workers (aOR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.05-2.16]), higher stress and anxiety to the viral infection (high SAVE-9 score, aOR = 1.20, 95% CI [1.17-1.24]), and past psychiatric history (aOR = 3.26, 95% CI [2.15-4.96]) were positively associated with depression.

"The Association Between School Closures and Child Mental Health During COVID-19","In-person schooling has been disrupted for most school-aged youth during the COVID-19 pandemic, with low-income, Black, and Hispanic populations most likely to receive fully remote instruction. Disruptions to in-person schooling may have negatively and inequitably affected children's mental health. To estimate the association between school closures and child mental health outcomes and how it varies across sociodemographic factors. This cross-sectional population-based survey study included a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 18 to 64 years with at least 1 child in the household. The survey was administered between December 2 and December 21, 2020, via web and telephone in English and Spanish. Participants were recruited from the NORC AmeriSpeak panel, an address-based panel with known probability sampling and coverage of 97% of US households. Schooling modality (in person, fully remote, or hybrid), household income, age. Child mental health difficulties were measured with the parent-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, with small, medium, and large effect sizes defined as 1.3-, 3.3-, and 5.2-point differences, respectively. A total of 2324 adults completed the survey. Overall, 1671 respondents (71.9%) were women, 244 (10.5%) were Black, 372 (16.0%) were Hispanic, and 421 (18.1%) had a high school education or less. Children attending school in-person had higher household incomes (mean difference, $9719; 95% CI, $4327 to $15Ã¢â‚¬Â¯111; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and were more likely to be White compared with those attending remotely (366 of 556 [65.8%] vs 597 of 1340 [44.5%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Older children in remote schooling had more mental health difficulties than those attending in-person schooling (standardized effect size, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.39] per year older; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.006), corresponding to small effect sizes in favor of in-person schooling for older children and very small effect sizes favoring remote schooling for younger children. Children from families with higher income benefitted more from attending schools in-person compared with their peers from families with lower income (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.20 [95% CI, -0.10 to -0.30] per $10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000-increase in annual income; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), although this advantage was not apparent for children attending hybrid school (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.05 [95% CI, -0.16 to 0.06] per $10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000-increase in annual income; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.34), and directionally lower but not significantly different for children attending remote school (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.12 [95% CI, -0.04 to -0.20] per $10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000-increase in annual income; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Learning pods fully buffered the associations of hybrid schooling (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.25; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.04) but not remote schooling (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.18) with negative mental health outcomes. The findings of this study suggest that older and Black and Hispanic children as well as those from families with lower income who attend school remotely may experience greater impairment to mental health than their younger, White, and higher-income counterparts. Ensuring that all students have access to additional educational and mental health resources must be an important public health priority, met with appropriate funding and workforce augmentation, during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hawrilenko, Kroshus, Tandon, Christakis","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.24092","20210903","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17656,""
"Exploring Well-being of Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Longitudinal Study Protocol","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have experienced several stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural stressors, including extended work hours, re-deployment, and changes in organizational mandates often intersect with interpersonal and personal stressors, such as caring for those with COVID-19 infections, worrying about infection to self, family and loved ones, working despite shortages of personal protective equipment, and encountering various difficult moral-ethical dilemmas. The paper describes the protocol for a longitudinal study seeking to capture the unique experiences, challenges, and changes faced by HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study seeks to explore: (a) the impact of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of HCWs with a particular focus on moral distress, and (b) perceptions and satisfaction with delivery of care, and (c) how changes in work structure are tolerated among HCWs providing clinical services. A prospective longitudinal design is employed to assess HCWs' experiences across domains of mental health (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and well-being), moral distress and moral reasoning, work-related changes and telehealth, organizational responses to COVID-19 concerns, and experiences with COVID-19 infections to self and to others. We recruited HCWs from across Canada through convenience snowball sampling to participate in either a short-form or long-form online survey at baseline. Respondents to the baseline survey are invited to complete a follow-up survey every three months, for a total of 18 months. A total of 1926 participants completed baseline surveys between June 26, 2020, and December 31, 2020, and 1859 participants provided their emails for contact to participate in follow-up surveys. As of July 2021, data collection is ongoing, with participants nearing the 6 or 9-month follow-up periods depending on their initial time of self-enrollment. The current protocol describes a study that will provide unique insights into the immediate and longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dimensions of mental health, moral distress, healthcare delivery, and workplace environment in HCWs. The feasibility and acceptability of implementing a short-form and long-form survey on participant engagement and data retention will also be discussed.","Liu, Nazarov, Plouffe, Forchuk, Deda, Gargala, Le, Bourret-Gheysen, Soares, Nouri, Hosseiny, Smith, Roth, MacDougall, Marlborough, Jetly, Heber, Albuquerque, Lanius, Balderson, Dupuis, Mehta, Richardson","https://doi.org/10.2196/32663","20210903","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17657,""
"[Mental illnesses: the playground for new technologies]","The current health care crisis, induced by the coronavirus pandemic, is at the origin of significant global changes within our societies and profoundly modifies the health care sector as well, especially in the field of mental health. Nowadays, this latter is particularly poorly equipped in financial and human resources. Without major and immediate changes, the mental health sector will not be able to cope with the expected exponential rise of care needs, exacerbated by the rapid deterioration of mental health in the general population and among health care providers. We intend to illustrate the potential role and benefit of new technologies, able to solve the imbalance. Without any possible doubt, the health care crisis has provided a formidable momentum for their arousal, but we still have to determine their accessibility, feasibility, efficacy and efficiency by running controlled clinical trials.

"Does pandemic lockdowns affect the burn patient's admission?","2020 has started with Covid-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, govermental stringent precautions and lockdown measures have applied in Turkey. Although there was no limition for health care, people hesitate to go hospitals with the fear of Coronovirus transmission and all addmisions to hospitals decreased. Data of all patients admitted to our burn outpatient clinic during the pandemic period between March16, 2020 and June 1, 2020 compered with the same period in 2019. Demographic information and burn-specific variables of each patient were analysed. Thirty nine patient admited to our clinic at covid period and 130 patient at 2019. There was a 70% reduction of admissions. In this stduy during pandemic period patients delayed days for admission, number of dressing change and total healing times were significantly longer, higher and longer (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, respectively). The number of surgery-required patients, hospitalization rates and the number of grafting were significantly high at the pandemic time (p=0.003, p=0.007 and p=0.036, respectively). Burn wound infection at admission has also found more frequent at covid-period (p&lt;0.001). Covid-19 pandemic made people hesitate to go to hospital even for emergencies. Unfortunately this fear caused unexpected consequences. Patients have developed complications due to delayed addmisions to specified medical centers for specific health problems. As a result, patients requiring special treatment, should be encouraged to immediatly seek professional medical advice especially for reel emergencies even during pandemic.","AkÃ„Â±n, YastÃ„Â±","https://doi.org/10.14744/tjtes.2021.34694","20210903","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17660,""
"Ancient Roots of Today's Emerging Renaissance in Psychedelic Medicine","An international ban on psychedelics initiated by the United Nations' Convention on Psychotropic Substances in 1971 restricted the clinical use of these ancient psychoactive substances. Yet, in an era marked by rising mental health concerns and a growing ""Deaths of Despair"" epidemic (i.e., excess mortality and morbidity from suicide, drug overdose, and alcoholism), the structured psychedelic use that has long been a part of ritual healing experiences for human societies is slowly regaining credibility in Western medicine for its potential to treat various mental health conditions. We use a historical lens to examine the use of psychedelic therapies over time, translate ancient lessons to contemporary clinical and research practice, and interrogate the practical and ethical questions researchers must grapple with before they can enter mainstream medicine. Given the COVID-19 pandemic and its contributions to the global mental health burden, we also reflect on how psychedelic therapy might serve as a tool for medicine in the aftermath of collective trauma. Ultimately, it is argued that a ""psychedelic renaissance"" anchored in the lessons of antiquity can potentially help shift healthcare systems-and perhaps the broader society-towards practices that are more humane, attentive to underlying causes of distress, and supportive of human flourishing.","George, Hanson, Wilkinson, Garcia-Romeu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11013-021-09749-y","20210903","Clinical medicine; Ethics; Health humanities; Mental health; Psychedelic medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17661,""
"Safety and Feasibility of an Interdisciplinary Treatment Approach to Optimize Recovery From Critical Coronavirus Disease 2019","Examine the safety and feasibility of a multimodal in-person or telehealth treatment program, administered in acute recovery phase for patients surviving critical coronavirus disease 2019. Pragmatic, pre-post, nonrandomized controlled trial with patients electing enrollment into one of the two recovery pathways. ICU Recovery Clinic in an academic medical center. Adult patients surviving acute respiratory failure due to critical coronavirus disease 2019. Patients participated in combined ICU Recovery clinic and 8 weeks of physical rehabilitation delivered: 1) in-person or 2) telehealth. Patients received medical care by an ICU Recovery Clinic interdisciplinary team and physical rehabilitation focused on aerobic, resistance, and respiratory muscle training. Thirty-two patients enrolled with mean age 57 Ã‚Â± 12, 62% were male, and the median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 9.5. There were no differences between the two groups except patients in telehealth pathway (<i>n</i> = 10) lived further from clinic than face-to-face patients (162 Ã‚Â± 60 vs 31 Ã‚Â± 47 kilometers, <i>t</i> = 6.06, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Four safety events occurred: one minor adverse event in the telehealth group, two minor adverse events, and one major adverse event in the in-person group. Three patients did not complete the study (two in-person and one telehealth).

"Differences in Psychological and Behavioral Changes between Children following School Closure due to COVID-19","School closure due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pushed children across ages and nationalities into a state of mental health crisis. In Japan, children between the ages of 6 and 18 were ordered to stay at home and observe social distancing for several months. This study is aimed at investigating the effects of quarantine due to COVID-19 on children belonging to different developmental stages in life. Data were collected from mothers of typically developing children aged between 6 and 18 years. The differences in psychological and behavioral changes following school closure during the COVID-19 pandemic were explored. A total of 535 children, including 145 students in lower grades of elementary school (6-9 years), 124 students in higher grades of elementary school (9-12 years), 132 students in junior high school (12-15 years), and 134 students in high school (15-18 years), were recruited. Children in lower grades of elementary school (lower grades group) gained significantly lower understanding about COVID-19 and the necessity of COVID-19 restrictions than children in the other groups. Moreover, they had more psychological problems: they easily cried and complained, were unable to keep calm, and were dependent on parents and family members. Changes in sleep patterns were more prevalent in junior and senior high school students. We concluded that mental health care should be provided based on the growth period of each child not only during school closure but also after school reopening.","Nakachi, Kawabe, Hosokawa, Yoshino, Horiuchi, Ueno","https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5567732","20210904","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17663,""
"Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspectives of medical students","The objective of the study was to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and lifestyle of our medical students. This observational study was conducted on medical students of Shifa College of Medicine, Islamabad from June to August 2020. The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires were used for anxiety and depression assessment. Different aspects of changes in lifestyle were evaluated and students were inquired about their views regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The chi-square test was applied to assess the associations between levels of anxiety and depression with student's responses to the concerns and lifestyle changes. The binomial logistic analysis was used to highlight important predictors of anxiety and depression. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the time spent on various activities before and during the pandemic. There were 234 participants in the study. The depression and anxiety were detected in 151 (64.5%) and 146 (66.7%) students. The college closure led to a significant increase in sleeping time, sedentary time, and time on gadgets (Z=-4.67, Z=-7.23, Z= -6.72, respectively) on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The binomial regression analysis identified study years be the significant predictors for the development of depression and anxiety (p&lt;0.05).

"Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Patients With Mental or Physical Diseases","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and the consequences of the pandemic on individuals' social, economic, and public lives are assumed to have major implications for the mental health of the general population but also for patients already diagnosed with psychological disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate the psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with psychological disorders or physical health conditions in inpatient mental and physical treatment programs. A total 2710 patients completed COVID-19 related questions concerning their psychological distress and financial burden during the pandemic. Patients with psychological disorders reported the highest level of psychological distress and financial burden compared to patients with physical health conditions. Furthermore, most patients with psychological disorders attributed their individual psychological distress to the COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison to patients with physical health conditions, patients with psychological disorders are more strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and have an additional need for psychological/psychotherapeutic treatment due to the COVID-19 crisis. The findings stress the importance of continuous psychosocial support and availability of psychosocial support services for patients with psychological disorders during the pandemic.","Oppenauer, Burghardt, Kaiser, Riffer, Sprung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.703488","20210904","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; psychological distress; psychotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17665,""
"Mental Health of Nursing Students amid Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global disaster, and recent studies have shown its association with increasing mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and stress. Nursing students, especially nursing interns, may be shunned, harassed, and even blamed as potential COVID-19 spreaders, though they were an important reserve force against COVID-19 and other diseases. Of note, the psychological influences of COVID-19 on nursing students remained unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mental health of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on nursing students in a vocational college from April 12 to 23, 2020. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised, 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to assess the degree of symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the potential risk factors for the psychological symptoms. A total of 1,780 college nursing students were asked to participate in this online survey, with 1,532 complete responses. In total, 682 (44.5%) college nursing students reported having PTSD, 358 (22.8%) students reported insomnia, and few students reported depression (<i>n</i> = 45, 2.9%), anxiety (<i>n</i> = 44, 2.9%), and stress (<i>n</i> = 17, 1.1%) symptoms. As compared with junior, female, and rural nursing students, the senior, male, and urban nursing students had higher rates of PTSD, depression, anxiety, stress, respectively, whereas male nursing students had a higher insomnia rate. Multivariable analysis showed that senior nursing students had higher risks of PTSD, depression, anxiety; being male was associated with higher risks of PTSD, depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia; and urban nursing students had higher risks of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress. In summary, a considerable number of nursing students reported mental symptoms of PTSD and insomnia, though few reported mental symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, senior, male, and urban nursing students are at risk for developing mental symptoms. Appropriate psychological interventions should be implemented to assure the mental health of nursing students.","Gao, Wang, Guo, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.699558","20210904","COVID-19; PTSD; anxiety; depression; mental health; nursing students; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17666,""
"Applying digital technology to promote active and healthy confinement lifestyle during pandemics in the elderly","Although recognized as effective measures to curb the spread of the COVID19 outbreak, social distancing and home confinement have generated a mental health burden with older adults who are considered to be more vulnerable to psychosocial strains. To date, the application of digital technologies in response to COVID-19 pandemic has been narrowed to public-health needs related to containment and mitigation. However, information and communications technology (ICT)-based initiatives directed toward prediction and prevention of psychosocial support are still limited. Given the power of digital health solutions to allow easy and accurate characterization and intervention for health and disease, as well as to flatten the COVID19 incidence curves in many countries, our ECLB-COVID19 consortium is highlighting the importance of providing innovative ICT-based solutions (ICT-COVID-Companion) to improve elderly physical and mental health, thereby preventing/dampening psychosocial strain during pandemics. Based on innovative approaches (e.g., emotional/social computing, open social platform, interactive coaching, gamification, fitness-tracker, internet of things) and smart digital solutions (smartwatch/smartphone), smart companions must provide safe personalised physical, mental and psychosocial health surveillance. Additionally, by delivering personalised multi-dimension crisis-oriented health recommendations, such innovative crisis-oriented solutions would help (i) facilitate a user's adherence to active and healthy confinement lifestyle (AHCL), (ii) achieve a rapid psychosocial recovery in case of depression issues and (iii) enhance preparedness for eventual future pandemics.","Ammar, Bouaziz, Trabelsi, Glenn, Zmijewski, MÃƒÂ¼ller, Chtourou, Jmaiel, Chamari, Driss, HÃƒÂ¶kelmann","https://doi.org/10.5114/biolsport.2021.100149","20210904","Digital health; Home confinement; Information and communications; Mental health; Physical activity; Psychosocial strain; SARS-CoV-2; Seniors; technology (ICT)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17667,""

"Mental well-being during the first months of Covid-19 in adults and children: behavioral evidence and neural precursors","Pandemics such as the Covid-19 pandemic have shown to impact our physical and mental well-being, with particular challenges for children and families. We describe data from 43 adults (31Ã¢â„¢â‚¬, agesÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22-51; 21 mothers) and 26 children (10Ã¢â„¢â‚¬, agesÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7-17Ã‚Â years) including pre-pandemic brain function and seven assessment points during the first months of the pandemic. We investigated (1) changes in child and adult well-being, (2) mother-child associations of mental well-being, and (3) associations between pre-pandemic brain activation during mentalizing and later fears or burden. In adults the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety-levels was 34.88% and subthreshold depression 32.56%. Caregiver burden in parents was moderately elevated. Overall, scores of depression, anxiety, and caregiver burden decreased across the 11Ã‚Â weeks after Covid-19-onset. Children's behavioral and emotional problems during Covid-19 did not significantly differ from pre-pandemic levels and decreased during restrictions. Mothers' subjective burden of care was associated with children's emotional and behavioral problems, while depression levels in mothers were related to children's mood. Furthermore, meeting friends was a significant predictor of children's mood during early restrictions. Pre-pandemic neural correlates of mentalizing in prefrontal regions preceded later development of fear of illnesses and viruses in all participants, while temporoparietal activation preceded higher subjective burden in mothers.","BorbÃƒÂ¡s, Fehlbaum, Dimanova, Negri, Arudchelvam, Schnider, Raschle","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96852-0","20210903","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17669,""
"Association between mental health trajectories and somatic symptoms following a second lockdown in Israel: a longitudinal study","To identify mental health prospective trajectories before and after a second lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic and their associations with somatic symptoms. Prospective Study. Population-based study drawn from a probability-based internet panel of over 100 000 Israelis. Adults aged 18 years or more, representative of the adult Israeli population. The participants were measured at two time points (time 1 (T1) pre-second lockdown N=1029; response rate=76.17%; time 2 (T2) post-second lockdown N=764; response rate=74.24%). Trajectories of anxiety and adjustment disorder based on clinical cut-off score for probable diagnoses across T1-T2, somatic symptoms at T2. The four trajectories: stable-low, (no probable diagnosis), stable-high (stable probable diagnosis), exacerbation (no probable diagnosis at T1, probable diagnosis at T2), recovery (probable diagnosis at T1, no probable diagnosis at T2). Three anxiety trajectories predicted probable somatic symptoms (stable-high OR=6.451; exacerbation OR=5.379; recovery OR=2.025) compared with the stable-low trajectory. The three adjustment disorder trajectories also predicted somatic symptoms (stable-high OR=4.726; exacerbation OR=6.419; recovery OR=4.666) compared with the stable-low trajectory. Our data show elevated somatic symptoms among those whose mental health trajectories were poor, exacerbated and those who recovered following the second lockdown. The presentation of somatic symptoms may mask psychological vulnerabilities, even among those who appear to have recovered from the stressor. This indicates that lockdown may be a double-edged sword and should be carefully administered given these populations vulnerabilities.","Ben-Ezra, Hamama-Raz, Goodwin, Leshem, Levin","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050480","20210903","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; epidemiology; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17670,""

"Physical activity, resilience, emotions, moods, and weight control, during the COVID-19 global crisis","This study aimed at exploring the relationships between physical activity, weight control, and psycho-social aspects of the COVID-19 lockdown, which have characterized the Israeli population's behavior during the COVID-19 global crisis. Cross-sectional survey research. Participants included 1855 men and women aged 18 and above, from different regions in the country and representing different sectors. They were recruited through the social media in a ""snowball"" sampling, and filled out a self-administered six-part survey: Demographic background, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the positive and negative affect scales (PANAS), the Conor and Davidson resilience scale, a questionnaire for measuring depressive symptoms, and questions regarding weight change based on the Israeli National Health and Nutrition (MABAT) survey. Routine physical activity (PA) was reported by 76.3% of the participants before the lockdown, 19.3% stopped exercising during this period, and 9.3% began exercising during the lockdown. The participants who were physically active during the lockdown period reported a higher level of resilience and positive feelings, and a lower level of depression, compared with those who were not physically active. People who were physically active during the lockdown maintained their weight compared with those who were inactive. Concerning weight change, 44.8% of the respondents maintained their weight, and a higher percentage of people reported weight gain than those who reported weight loss. Continuous PA before and during the COVID-19 lockdown were associated with higher resilience and positive emotions, and depressive symptoms, in people aged 18 and above. Although a causal link cannot be established, in light of the results of the present study, encouraging physical activity may contribute to improving mental health and a sense of self-efficacy, as well as to maintaining weight during a crisis.","Zach, Fernandez-Rio, Zeev, Ophir, Eilat-Adar","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13584-021-00473-x","20210903","COVID-19 global crisis; Depressive symptoms; Exercise behavior; Feelings; Lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17673,""

Quality of life domains investigated include overall quality of life (four studies), food and taste dysfunction (two studies), mental health (two studies), cognitive function (one study), functional outcome (one study) and safety domains (one study). Quality of life deficit was reported to be 67.7 per cent among coronavirus disease 2019 patients with olfactory dysfunction. The high prevalence of persistent olfactory dysfunction prompts more serious research, as the long-standing consequences of olfactory dysfunction are detrimental.","Saniasiaya, Prepageran","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022215121002279","20210903","COVID-19; Olfactory Impairment; Quality Of Life; Smell","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17674,""
"Dispositional mindfulness mediates the relationship between conscientiousness and mental health-related issues in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously affecting the mental health of adolescents and triggering a series of mental health-related issues. The present study investigates the relationships between conscientiousness, dispositional mindfulness (DM), and adolescents' mental health-related issues including anxiety, depression, and perceived stress during this time. In this study, after obtaining informed consent from participants' parents, 5994 Chinese adolescents voluntarily and anonymously completed an online survey. Conscientiousness was found to be negatively associated with anxiety, depression, and perceived stress. It was found to be positively associated with DM, which, in turn, negatively predicts anxiety, depression, and perceived stress. Conscientiousness is thus related to mental health-related issues, and this relationship is mediated by DM. This mediation effect is stronger in females than in males. These findings provide new and strong evidence for the protective role of conscientiousness and DM in adolescents' mental health-related issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111223","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17675,""

"A not so perfect plan: An examination of the differential influence of multidimensional perfectionism on missed and gained events during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals missed out on important life events, but it was also a chance for some to engage with new interests or values. This research examined how individuals higher in perfectionism experienced missed and gained events during the pandemic, and how their perceptions of these events influenced their mental health. University students (NÂ =Â 350) were surveyed in September 2020, assessing perfectionism, depression, missed/gained events, and need satisfaction related to these events, and then followed up in December. A combined missed and gained event score was created to better understand overall need satisfaction from these changes. Individuals higher in self-critical perfectionism were more likely to experience need dissatisfaction overall and this partially explained why these individuals experienced more depressive symptoms over time during the pandemic. Conversely, those higher in personal standards perfectionism experienced more need satisfaction overall and this was related to reduced depressive symptoms. Results suggest that individuals higher in self-critical perfectionism were less flexible when things did not go according to their plan. This may be one reason these individuals had a more difficult time coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111214","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-05","",17678,""
