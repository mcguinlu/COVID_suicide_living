"LONG-TERM NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA SURVIVORS IN CTE D'OR: HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND LIVING CONDITIONS","Background: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the largest group of hematological malignancies and represented 12% of all new cancer cases in metropolitan France in 2018. The survival outcomes of NHL patients have improved due to important therapeutic advances. Age-standardized 5-year net survival from 2010 to 2015 in France was 86% for follicular lymphoma (FL) and 61% for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which are above the average survival rates in Europe (FL 72% and DLBCL 51%). In this context, the question of quality of life in NHL patients is garnering increasing interest. To the best of our knowledge, few data from France have addressed the issue of living conditions of long-term NHL survivors at the scale of the general population. Aims: To identify the clinical and social determinants of long-term health related quality of life (HRQoL) in NHL survivors in the general population and to describe their socio-professional reintegration, socio-economic status, sexual wellbeing and the impact of COVID. Methods: All patients were registered in the population-based cancer registry specialized in hematological malignancies in the CÃ´te d'Or area (A French Department with a total of 532,901 residents in 2019). We identified patients diagnosed with DLBCL or FL according to the third edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O- 3), from January 1st 2010 to December, 31st 2017, and who were still alive on March, 1st 2021, with an updated address. Patients under 18 years old and adults unable to provide consent were not eligible. In March 2021, patients completed standardized self-report questionnaires for HRQoL (SF-12), anxiety and depression (HADS), social support (SSQ6), socio-economic deprivation (EPICES). Reminders were sent to non-responders after one month. The determinants of HRQoL were identified using a generalized linear model. Results: Among 436 patients diagnosed, 248 were alive at the study endpoint, of whom 157 (FL 51% and DLBCL 49%) completed the questionnaires, yielding a response rate of 63.3%, the median of time since diagnosis was 76 months [39-133]. The mean age of participants was 67.3 years (SD = 12.4), 55% were men, 74% Ann Arbor stage III-IV, 78% were treated by chemotherapy and immunotherapy, with 99% in the DLBCL group, 11% relapsed after treatment, 64% had no comorbidities and 62% did not have socio-economic deprivation, 27% were employed at the time of the survey, 60% of survivors had not received information about sexuality, 29% reported a negative impact of the disease on their professional activities, 54% reported an impact of the COVID crisis on their life. This impact was socio-economic for 77% and psychological for 23% of respondents. The main factors associated with a negative impact on HRQoL were depression, anxiety, and loss of sexual desire. Summary/Conclusion: Six years after diagnosis, clinical parameters did not have a major influence on HRQoL, except for relapse. The main determinants of HRQoL identified were psychological and social factors. All these elements are potential targets for specific interventions by the social system to improve HRQoL in NHL patients.","Wasse, S.; Tienhan, S. D.

"Innovative virtual care in a Canadian paediatric tertiary care centre","Health systems and health workers have adapted quickly to the delivery of virtual care during this unprecedented period. Clinical programmes adopted various models of virtual care to maintain access, save on personal protective equipment, and limit the spread of infectious diseases. In this article, the authors first describe the context of paediatric care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, which propelled virtual care delivery. They then summarise the development, implementation and benefits of virtual care programs currently in use at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) for both inpatients and outpatients, including ambulatory clinics, emergency departments and the mental health program. They highlight the transferable and unique ways in which CHEO has integrated the delivery of virtual care through its governance structure, stakeholder engagement - including patients, families, health care workers and staff - the preparation and use of telehealth tools, and innovative approaches to the care of patients who require physical assessment. They conclude with their vision of the future of virtual care, which will be part of the paediatric care armoury after the COVID-19 pandemic, but will need to be subject to a common evaluation framework. Importantly, the rapid implementation of a predominantly virtual care model at CHEO has helped to maintain a high volume of quality paediatric care. The authors suggest that many of these programs should and will be maintained after the pandemic. A comprehensive and unified approach to evaluation is essential to provide constructive results that will inform sustainable care delivery models, including virtual care, and help ensure the best possible patient outcomes.","Goldbloom, E.

"Returning to class and wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic: the students' point of view according to a school simulation study","Objectives: This study examined children's views on returning to school after pandemic containment, mask use in the classroom, and the mental health of children and parents during the pandemic. Methodology: This cross-sectional study was part of a two-day school simulation exercise in which students were randomly assigned to various mask-wearing recommendations. Using multiple regression analyses, the researchers analysed parents' reports of mental health and, after the simulation, students' reports of anxiety about COVID-19 and mask wearing. Older students participated in semi-structured focus groups to complete the questionnaire data. Results: Among the 190 students in the present study, 31% did not make it past grade 4 and 95% were eager to get to school. Greater parental or close friend anxiety (beta= 0.67;rho &lt; 0.001) and lower educational attainment (beta=1.86;rho &lt; 0.002) were predictors of greater COVID-19 anxiety in children. Older pupils were more likely to find wearing the mask detrimental to peer interactions than younger pupils (chi(2)[1]=31.16;rho &lt; 0.001) and for their ability to understand the teacher (chi(2)[1]=13.97;p &lt; 0.001). Students in the no-mask group were more likely to fear contracting COVID-19 at school (chi(2)[1]=10.07;rho &lt; 0.05) than those in the mask group, and to anticipate having difficulty wearing it (chi(2)[1]=18.95;rho &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: In children with COVID-19 anxiety, parental anxiety and information about COVID-19 could be targets for intervention. Future research should investigate the effects of prolonged implementation of health mitigation measures on children's school achievement and mental health.","Coelho, S. G.; Segovia, A.; Anthony, S.

"Mental health profiles of children and adolescents with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives: The confinements in Canadian provinces adversely affected children's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and children with autism were particularly vulnerable. The purpose of this study was to identify subgroups of children with autism with distinct patterns of mental health change, in order to understand the child-, parent-, and system-specific factors associated with them and to inform future interventions. Method: The researchers extracted data from a large Ontario cohort (n=1,570), which included 265 children with autism (mean age=10.9 years, 76% male). They used dynamic cluster analysis to divide the distinct mental health profiles into six measures (mood, anxiety, OCD symptoms, irritability, inattention, hyperactivity) and examined differences between the groups. They also examined the characteristics of children who accessed acute mental health services. Results: The optimal number of clusters was set at two. The first included those who had experienced a deterioration in mental health across the six measures (61.3%, 95% confidence interval=54.9-67.4) and the second included young people whose mental health had not changed (38.7%, 95% confidence interval=32.6-45.1). Factors associated with poorer mental health in children were more pre-existing internalised symptoms and high levels of stress related to COVID-19. Parental mental health problems and system-specific factors, such as loss of learning support, access to doctors and material difficulties, were also linked to this deterioration. Access to acute mental health services was primarily a result of financial insecurity and loss of services. Conclusions: More than half of the children with autism experienced a deterioration in mental health, and individual (pre-existing mental health disorders, COVID-19 stress), parental (parental mental health) and systemic (loss of services and material hardship) characteristics were related, paving the way for multi-level clinical and policy interventions.","Charalampopoulou, M.; Choi, E.

"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children with physical health problems or disabilities, families and health professionals","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of the population. Families of children with health vulnerabilities were disproportionately affected by pandemic-related policies and service disruptions, as they rely heavily on the health and social care system. Researchers have identified the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with physical health vulnerabilities and disabilities, families and health professionals. Methodology: Children with a range of health vulnerabilities (heart transplants, respiratory conditions, sickle cell anaemia, autism spectrum disorder, mental health disorders and approaching the end of life due to a range of underlying causes), their parents and their health professionals participated in semi-structured interviews. The researchers used qualitative analysis methods and extracted impact themes and recommendations for improving practice. Results: A total of 262 participants (30 children, 76 parents, 156 health professionals) were interviewed. Children described loneliness and isolation, parents described burnout, and health professionals described pressure and feelings of moral distress. Themes reflected the effects of the pandemic on the mental health of children, families and health professionals, as well as inadequate resources to support mental health, organisational and policy influences that shaped service delivery, and recommendations for improving service delivery. Conclusion: The health restrictions imposed by the pandemic and changes in care have had a profound impact on the mental health of children with health vulnerabilities, families and health professionals. Recommendations include the development and adoption of targeted information on the pandemic and the implementation of mental health support services. These findings amplify the need for capacity building, including proactive strategies and risk mitigation planning in the event of a future pandemic.","Nicholas, D. B.; Zulla, R.

"Cohort study of the relationship between childhood inattention and hyperactivity symptoms, internalising symptoms and attentive parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives: Reports of mental health difficulties in Canadian children increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and new research suggests that children who exhibit marked symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity were disproportionately affected. As a result, the pandemic also had a deleterious effect on families. This study aimed to: 1) examine whether children's symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year were associated with mindful parenting (or mindfulness parenting) at the end of the school year;and 2) examine whether children's symptoms of depression and anxiety at the end of the year tempered this association. Methods: Parents of 114 young children in a large Canadian city participated in this study during the winter of 2020 and spring of 2021. Parents completed several rating scales to measure children's mental health symptomatology and attention to parenting practices. Results: Inattention and hyperactivity symptoms in children were significantly negatively associated with attentive parenting during the school year, and depressive symptoms in children tempered this relationship. In particular, when children's depressive symptoms were mild or moderate, higher levels of inattention and hyperactivity were associated with lower levels of attentive parenting. On the other hand, when depressive symptoms were severe in children, inattention and hyperactivity symptoms were not predictive of attentive parenting. Conclusions: Children's mental health, namely symptoms of inattention/hyperactivity and depression, is related to difficulties in attentive parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results may indicate to physicians which families need more support during the pandemic.","O'Reilly, H.; Rogers, M.; Ogg, J.; Ritchie, T.; Whitley, J.; Santuzzi, A.; Shelleby, E.

"IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN IBD PATIENT CARE","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting patients and healthcare providers worldwide. During the first wave of the pandemic, healthcare delivery shifted from in-person to virtual clinics. Non-urgent and some emergent procedures, including endoscopies, surgeries, and imaging, were delayed to limit the spread and divert resources to COVID-19. Aims: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in care to IBD patients Methods: A survey study was conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on IBD care. All patients had a virtual clinic appointment between March to July 2020 at either: University of Alberta Hospital or the University of Calgary Clinic. A section of the survey assessed patient experience of virtual clinics and delays in access to IBD care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 1581 patients were contacted to complete the survey. 628 patients agreed to participate in the survey, however not all patients completed each component. The mean age of patients who participated in the survey was 48 years (SD = 15.19). 408 patients responded to satisfaction/future use questions: 84.3% (344) patients agree/strongly agree they were comfortable communicating to the physician using the remote system, 77.5% (316) of patients agree/strongly agree that virtual clinic is an acceptable way to receive healthcare services, 84.8% (346) of patients agree/strongly agree they would use virtual care services again, and 82.6% (337) agree/strongly agree they were satisfied with the telehealth system. Additional challenges were reported by 228 patients. Fear and stress (infection risk/mental health concerns/unemployment) was reported by 57.4% (131) patients. Access to healthcare services, PPE, and community resources was a challenge experienced by 26.3% (60) patients. Additionally, 16.2% (37) patients experienced uncertainty around IBD-specific care, including procedures, treatments, labs, and medications. Overall, 17.3% of patients reported some type of delay in care by July 2020. Table 1 shows the proportion of patients with a delay by type of care and the median delay: 5.7% of patients with IBD had surgery delayed by a median of 10 weeks (8-16 weeks). Conclusions: While some delays in healthcare delivery occurred during the first wave of the pandemic, overall 82.7% of patients with IBD maintained their care without disruption. Sustaining healthcare delivery to the IBD community required adaptation to virtual care;however, patient satisfaction was overwhelming positive among patients with IBD.","Dahiya, M.; Olayinka, L.; Kaplan, G.

"RISK PERCEPTION AND KNOWLEDGE OF COVID-19 IN PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE","Background: Celiac disease (CeD) has been associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections, however, we recently demonstrated that the odds of contracting COVID-19 in patients with CeD is similar to that of the general population. Due to this discrepancy, how patients with CeD perceive their risk may differ from their actual risk. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the risk perceptions for contracting COVID-19 in patients with CeD and to determine the factors that may influence their perceptions. Methods: We distributed a survey throughout 10 countries between March and June 2020 and collected data on demographics, diet, COVID-19 testing, and risk perceptions of COVID-19 in patients with CeD. Participants were recruited through various celiac associations, clinic visits, and social media. Risk perception was assessed by asking individuals whether they believe patients with CeD are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the general population. Logistic regression was used to determine the influencing factors associated with COVID-19 risk perception, such as age, sex, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and comorbidities such as cardiac/respiratory conditions and diabetes. Data was presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs). Results: A total of 10,737 participants with CeD completed the survey. From them, 6,019 (56.1%) patients with CeD perceived they were at a higher risk or were unsure if they were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the non-CeD population. A greater proportion of patients with CeD had high levels of COVID-19 risk perceptions when compared to infections in general (56.1% vs 26.7%;p&lt;0.0001). Consequently, 28.8% reported taking extra COVID-19 precautions as a result of their CeD. Members of celiac associations had lower rates of perceiving an increased risk of COVID-19 when compared to non-members (49.5% vs 57.4%, p&lt;0.0001). Older age (aOR: 0.9;95% CI: 0.9 to 1, p&lt;0.001), male sex (aOR: 0.85;95% CI: 0.76 to 0.94, p=0.001), and strict adherence to a GFD (aOR: 0.89;95% CI 0.82 to 0.97, p=0.007) were associated with a lower perception of COVID-19 risk. Meanwhile, the presence of comorbidities was associated with a higher perception of COVID-19 risk (aOR: 1.34;95% CI: 1.20 to 1.51, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Overall, a large proportion of patients with CeD, particularly females, those with comorbidities, or those not adhering to a strict GFD, believed they were or were unsure if they were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their condition. As high levels of risk perception may increase an individual's pandemic-related stress and contribute to negative mental health consequences, healthcare providers should maintain consistent communication with the celiac community and provide them with evidence-based recommendations.","Zhen, J.; Stefanolo, J.; Montoro, M.; Uscanga, L.; Day, A.; Tye-Din, J.; Ciacci, C.; Lebwohl, B.; Pinto-Sanchez, M.

"Work Coping, Stress Appraisal, and Psychological Resilience: Reactionto the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Health Care Providers","Objective: This study examined the relationship between perceived stress appraisals and coping style during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting distress reaction and effects on work engagement. Method: The sample (N = 423) was 78.6% female with average age and education of 38.5 and 18.4 years, respectively. Most respondents reported working in psychology/neuropsychology (31.7%) and rehabilitation/other therapies (29.7%). Surveys were distributed via Qualtrics among health care providers via listservs and referral emails from medical providers. Measures included: the Brief COPE Inventory, Work and Well Being Survey (UWES), Stress Appraisal Measure (SAM), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7), and the Screening Tool for Psychological Distress (STOP-D). Results: Health care workers endorsing problem-focused coping styles had lower levels of perceived threat and higher levels of perceived control in their response to the pandemic. Problemfocused coping was negatively associated with anxiety and depression in reaction to the pandemic when compared with health care workers who endorsed an emotion-focused coping style. Higher stress appraisal in response to perceived threat from the pandemic was not associated with lower work engagement or enthusiasm. Conclusions: Findings support the impact of coping style on psychological distress and work engagement during pandemic, with implications that these factors may be important considerations for mitigation of distress and burnout for health care workers during times of high stress. Initiatives to improve resiliency and wellness in health care workers may examine modifiable interventions for coping style.","Rolin, S. N.; Flis, A.; Davis, J.

"Obese, rural endometrial cancer survivorsâ€™ health behaviors and lifestyle intervention preferences: What's COVID-19 got to do with it? (510)","Objectives: To determine (1) if health disparities experienced by rural, obese endometrial cancer survivors (ECS) were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) preferred components and delivery methods for behavioral interventions. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to obese, early- stage ECS to ascertain demographic information, physical activity (PA level), self-efficacy, lifestyle intervention preferences, as well as the impact of COVID-19 on PA, diet, and mental health. Responses were compared between obese (BMI= 30-39.9 kg/m2) and morbidly obese (BMI= 40+ kg/m2) survivors as well as those who did or did not meet national PA recommendations. Results: Among 335 eligible survivors, only 70 (20.9%) completed the survey. The median age was 63 years (IQR: 14 years). Survivors were 37 months from diagnosis (IQR: 37 months). The median BMI was 39.2 kg/m2 (IQR: 8.4 kg/m2). Overall, only one-quarter of ECS were fairly or fully confident in their ability to undertake moderate PA. More morbidly obese survivors reported low self-efficacy in performing moderate PA than obese survivors (90% vs 65%;p= 0.02). Pre COVID-19, 66% of survivors did not meet PA guidelines and were more likely to be morbidly obese than obese, but the difference was not significant (78% vs 58%;p=0.08). Post COVID-19, 83% of survivors did not meet PA guidelines, with no difference between BMI groups (82% vs 84%;p&gt;0.05). After COVID-19, 54% of survivors reported a decrease in PA, 32% made poorer nutritional choices, and 47% reported worsening mental health. Post COVID-19, no difference in the nutrition or mental health changes was seen between survivors who were meeting PA guidelines and those who were not (p&gt;0.05). Regarding lifestyle interventions, survivors preferred information delivered electronically (online (56%) or via email (41%)) versus in person (30%) or via text (21%). Preferences for PA included exercising at home (46%) or online with a coach (33%) versus with a group fitness class (18%) or at the gym (17%). Combining health promotion with exercise was appealing to the majority of participants (37%), while others were not interested (27%) or unsure (31%). Responses were similar between patients meeting and not meeting PA recommendations (p&gt;0.05). The most preferred lifestyle intervention components included tracking progress (56%), health recipes (56%), one-on-one counseling (46%), tips for cheap and healthy eating (41%), exercising alone (41%), and online sessions (39%). Conclusions: As a result of COVID-19, rural, obese ECS experienced a decrease in PA, worse nutritional decision-making, and poorer mental health. Preferred components of lifestyle interventions in this patient population were identified and can be used to develop future, evidence-based behavioral interventions. These interventions may be scalable in rural communities with limited access during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Armbruster, S.; Brow, K.; Locklear, T.; Ganjineh, B.; Harden, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0090-8258(22)01732-2","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Gynecologic Oncology; 166:S251, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38342,""
"Article soumis au Journal Psychologie FranÃ§aise dans le cadre dâ€™un appel Ã  article pour un numÃ©ro spÃ©cial sur la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19","RÃ©sumÃ© Introduction: Les Ã©tudiants reprÃ©sentent une population particuliÃ¨rement Ã  risque de dÃ©velopper des troubles de santÃ© mentale en gÃ©nÃ©ral et particuliÃ¨rement durant la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19. Si de nombreuses recherches montrent que le confinement a Ã©tÃ© vÃ©cu difficilement, peu ont explorÃ© lâ€™Ã©volution Ã  travers le temps. Objectif: Cet article explore le lien entre les caractÃ©ristiques individuelles, le contexte de vie, les capacitÃ©s de rÃ©gulation Ã©motionnelle et la dÃ©tresse psychologique des Ã©tudiants durant les deux premiers confinements en France. MÃ©thode: 160 Ã©tudiants (90% dâ€™Ã©tudiantes, 24 ans en moyenne) ont rÃ©pondu Ã  un questionnaire en ligne Ã  trois reprises : pendant et aprÃ¨s le premier confinement puis au second confinement. Les difficultÃ©s de rÃ©gulation Ã©motionnelle, la dÃ©tresse psychologique, le stress aigu, les inquiÃ©tudes universitaires, les ressources financiÃ¨res ainsi que les Ã©changes avec les enseignants ont Ã©tÃ© mesurÃ©s. RÃ©sultats: Un modÃ¨le dâ€™Ã©quation structurelles exploratoire a Ã©tÃ© dÃ©veloppÃ© pour Ã©valuer les facteurs en lien avec la dÃ©tresse psychologique (<U+03C7>2=1459,18, ddl=1064, CFI=0,910, RMSEA=0,049, SRMR=0,068). La dÃ©tresse psychologique au cours des deux confinements est expliquÃ©e par les inquiÃ©tudes universitaires et le manque de clartÃ© et dâ€™acceptation Ã©motionnelle. Une relation indirecte significative est prÃ©sente entre les difficultÃ©s financiÃ¨res, lâ€™absence dâ€™Ã©changes avec les enseignants lors du premier confinement, le manque de clartÃ© Ã©motionnelle et la dÃ©tresse psychologique vÃ©cue lors du second confinement. Des ANOVAs Ã  mesures rÃ©pÃ©tÃ©es identifient des niveaux Ã©levÃ©s de stress aigu au cours des deux confinements, mais diminuant durant le dÃ©confinement, indiquant un effet des mesures sanitaires sur la santÃ© mentale des Ã©tudiants. Conclusion: Dans le cadre du modÃ¨le transactionnel de Bruchon-Schweiser, les capacitÃ©s de rÃ©gulation Ã©motionnelle semblent jouer un rÃ´le central dans lâ€™expÃ©rience de la pandÃ©mie chez les Ã©tudiants. Cette population bÃ©nÃ©ficierait dâ€™interventions thÃ©rapeutiques adaptÃ©es dans le cadre de cette pandÃ©mie, mais aussi en temps normal. Introduction: Students are at risk for mental health issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of lockdowns as a means to curb the spread of the disease have had an impact on this population, as observed in many international studies. However, few studies have investigated the longitudinal impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on studentsâ€™ mental health. Objective: We explored the relation between individual characteristics of students, context of life, difficulties in emotion regulation and psychological distress over the first two lockdowns in France. Methodology: 160 university students (90% female, mean of 24 years old) responded to an online questionnaire at three times points: once during the first lockdown, a second time after this lockdown and a third time during the second lockdown. Difficulties in emotion regulation, psychological distress, acute stress, academic concerns, financial resources, and exchanges with professors were measured. Results: An exploratory structural equations model was developed to investigate the factors related to psychological distress (<U+03C7>2=1459,18, df=1064, CFI=0,910, RMSEA=0,049, SRMR=0,068). During both lockdowns, psychological distress was explained by academic concerns and lack of emotional clarity and acceptance. An indirect and negative significant relation was identified between financial difficulties, lack of exchanges with professors during the first lockdown, emotion clarity and experienced psychological distress during the second lockdown. Repeated measures ANOVAs identified high levels of acute stress during both lockdowns and a diminution during the deconfinement indicating an impact of sanitary measures on studentâ€™s mental health. Conclusion: Coherently with the Bruchon-Sweiser translational model of stress, emotion regulation capacities seem to have a central role in the experience of the pandemic for students. They would benefit greatly from appropriate therapeutic interventions in this pandemic situation and in general.","Enzo, Cipriani, Josephine, Klinkenberg, Cassandra, Guillemot, Aurelie, Croiset, Dylan, Muccia, Florence, Sordes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psfr.2022.09.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychologie FranÃ§aise;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38343,""
"What are the trends in the treatment of multiple sclerosis in recent studies? â€“ A bibliometric analysis with global productivity during 1980-2021","Background There is no bibliometric analysis in the literature on the subject of the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a disease with increasing prevalence, severely affecting the life and quality of life of patients. The purpose of this study was to analyze the scientific articles published on the subject of MS treatment, using bibliometric approaches and statistical methods, and thereby show the trend subjects and global productivity. Methods From 14,443 publications on the subject of MS between 1980 and 2021, 5,010 in the category of article were retrieved from the Web of Science and analyzed statistically. Bibliometric network visualisation diagrams were created to determine trend subjects, collaborations between countries and citation analyses. Exponential Smoothing estimation was used to predict the number of articles to be published in the next 5 years. Correlations were determined using Spearman's correlation analysis. Results The 3 countries contributing the most to literature were found to be the USA (1385, 37.6%), Italy (700, 13.9%), and Germany (694, 13.8%). The most productive author was Hartung Hans-Peter (n=82) and the most productive institution was the University of London (n=198). The three most productive journals were the Multiple Sclerosis Journal (n=354), Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders (n=224), and Neurology (n=204). The most studied subjects can be listed from past to present as interferon beta, disease-modifying treatment or drugs, relapsing, natalizumab, fingolimod, glatiramer acetate, fatigue, alemtuzumab, cytokines, mitoxantrone, MRI, adherence, depression, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, quality of life, and biomarkers. Conclusion The scientific production related to MS treatment shows growth chronologically over the years. According to the findings of the analysis done to identify trending subjects, the key words studied in recent years were determined to be fingolimod, alemtuzumab, disease-modifying therapy, ocrelizumab, teriflunomide, rituximab, dimethyl fumarate, safety, biomarkers, COVID-19, oxidative stress, inflammation, vitamin D, relapsing multiple sclerosis, cost-effectiveness, cladribine tablets, and medication adherence. Western countries, especially European countries, the USA, and Canada lead the way in research and scientific collaboration on the subject of MS treatment. These findings can contribute to a better understanding of this subject and can help provide new ideas for further studies.","AykaÃ§, Serdar, EliaÃ§ik, Sinan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2022.104185","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders;: 104185, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38344,""
"The association of physical activity, sleep, and screen time with mental health in Canadian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal isotemporal substitution analysis","Background The impact of COVID-19 on adolescent mental health is a global concern. Increased screen time and reduced physical activity due to the lockdown measures have been linked to detrimental mental health outcomes;however, the literature remains limited by cross-sectional and retrospective designs, and consideration of behaviours in isolation. Prospective evidence is necessary to examine whether moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sleep and screen time influenced changes in mental health. Method Analyses used data from a prospective cohort study of secondary school students in Canada with baseline data from the 2018â€“2019 school year and linked follow-up data from online surveys completed during the initial COVID-19 outbreak (Mayâ€“July 2020). Multilevel linear regression models were used to evaluate the within- and between-person isotemporal substitution effects of sleep, MVPA and screen time behaviours on depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, and trait emotional dysregulation. Results Linked longitudinal data from 2645 students attending 44 schools were available. Between-person effects indicated that individuals who engaged in more MVPA and sleep while minimizing screen time had lower depression scores, less severe emotional dysregulation, and better subjective well-being. While controlling for between-person effects, within-person year-on-year change suggests those who increased screen time while decreasing either MVPA or sleep experienced mental health decline on all outcomes. Conclusion MVPA and sleep were associated with youth mental health during the early COVID-19 lockdown. Increasing MVPA and sleep (or at least mitigating the increase of screen time) compared to the prior year was associated with better mental health during the early pandemic. A limitation to consider is that the screen time measure represents a combination of screen behaviours, and effects of replacing screen time may have varied if distinctions were made.","Duncan, Markus Joseph, Riazi, Negin Alivia, Faulkner, Guy, Gilchrist, Jenna Diane, Leatherdale, Scott Thomas, Patte, Karen Allison","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mhpa.2022.100473","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mental Health and Physical Activity;: 100473, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38345,""
"Changes in Burnout and Satisfaction With Work-Life Integration in Physicians Over the First 2 Years of the COVID-19 Pandemic",": Objective To evaluate the prevalence of burnout and satisfaction with work-life integration (WLI) in US physicians at the end of 2021, roughly 21 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, with comparison to 2020, 2017, 2014, and 2011. Methods Between December 9, 2021, and January 24, 2022, we surveyed US physicians using methods similar to our prior studies. Burnout, WLI, depression, and professional fulfillment were assessed using standard instruments. Results There were 2440 physicians who participated in the 2021 survey. Mean emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores were higher in 2021 than observed in 2020, 2017, 2014 and 2011 (all p&lt;.001). Mean emotional exhaustion scores increased 38.6% (2020 mean=21.0;2021 mean=29.1;p&lt;.001) while mean depersonalization scores increased 60.7% (2020 mean=6.1;2021 mean=9.8;p&lt;.001). Overall, 62.8% of physicians had at least one manifestation of burnout in 2021 compared with 38.2% in 2020, 43.9% in 2017, 54.4% in 2014, and 45.5% in 2011 (all P&lt;.001). While these trends were consistent across nearly all specialties, substantial variability by specialty was observed. Satisfaction with WLI declined from 46.1% in 2020 to 30.2% in 2021 (P&lt;.001). Mean scores for depression increased 6.1% (2020 mean=49.54;2021 mean=52.59;p&lt;.001). Conclusion A dramatic increase in burnout and decrease in satisfaction with WLI occurred in US physicians between 2020 and 2021. Differences in mean depression scores were modest suggesting the increase in physician distress was overwhelmingly work-related. Given the association of physician burnout with quality of care, turnover, and reductions in work effort, these findings have profound implications for the US healthcare system.","Shanafelt, Tait D.; West, Colin P.; Dyrbye, Lotte N.; Trockel, Mickey, Tutty, Michael, Wang, Hanhan, Carlasare, Lindsey E.; Sinsky, Christine","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2022.09.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mayo Clinic Proceedings;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38346,""
"Associations between psychosocial stressors at work and moral injury in frontline healthcare workers and leaders facing the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, Canada: A cross-sectional study","Healthcare workers (HCWs) on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic exhibit a high prevalence of depression and psychological distress. Moral injury (MI) can lead to such mental health problems. MI occurs when perpetrating, failing to prevent, or bearing witness to acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations. Since the start of the pandemic, psychosocial stressors at work (PSWs) might have been exacerbated, which might in turn have led to an increased risk of MI in HCWs. However, research into the associations between PSWs and MI is lacking. Considering these stressors are frequent and most of them are modifiable occupational risk factors, they may constitute promising prevention targets. This study aims to evaluate the associations between a set of PSWs and MI in HCWs during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, Canada. Furthermore, our study aims to explore potential differences between urban and non-urban regions. The sample of this study consisted of 572 HCWs and leaders from the Quebec province. Prevalence ratios (PR) of MI and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were modelled using robust Poisson regressions. Several covariates were considered, including age, sex, gender, socio-economic indicators, and lifestyle factors. Results indicated HCWs exposed to PSWs were 2.22â€“5.58 times more likely to experience MI. Low ethical culture had the strongest association (PR: 5.58, 95% CI: 1.34â€“23.27), followed by low reward (PR: 4.43, 95% CI: 2.14â€“9.16) and high emotional demands (PR: 4.32, 95% CI: 1.89â€“9.88). Identifying predictors of MI could contribute to the reduction of mental health problems and the implementation of targeted interventions in urban and non-urban areas.","Zahiriharsini, Azita, Gilbert-Ouimet, MahÃ©e, Langlois, Lyse, Biron, Caroline, Pelletier, JÃ©rÃ´me, Beaulieu, Marianne, Truchon, Manon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.09.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38347,""
"Leadership and resilience in adversity: The impact of COVID-19 on radiography researchers and ways forward","The recent coronavirus pandemic has greatly impacted research and academia in various ways. While it introduced new challenges and adversity, it has also presented some opportunities. Long-term physical and mental health issues, the need for research design/methodology adaptation and the isolation from the research community, have all been important barriers to radiography researchers worldwide. This work summarizes the main challenges associated with conducting research during the pandemic, as well as opportunities through adaptations of research workflows and routines. We also suggest ways forward to sustain research capacity, while ensuring integrity and quality. The personal reflections and lived experiences of our diverse group of radiography researchers were captured in a summative table. Our comments aligned with similar experiences expressed within the wider literature. Effective leadership and the ability to demonstrate resilience in such challenging situations are highlighted as ways to overcome such crises. Some practical solutions are also provided, which can be adopted not only by radiography researchers, but also by the wider research community in healthcare and beyond.","Stogiannos, Nikolaos, Skelton, Emily, Rogers, Charlie, Sharma, Meera, Papathanasiou, Stamatia, Venter, Riaan van de, Nugent, Barbara, Francis, Jane M.; Walton, Lucy, Sullivan, Chris O.; Abdurakman, Edwin, Mannion, Liam, Thorne, Richard, Malamateniou, Christina","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmir.2022.09.011","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38348,""

"Poor mental health is associated with loneliness and boredom during Covid-19-related restriction periods in patients with pre-existing depression","Background In 2020â€“2021, many European countries put in place temporary lockdown measures due to the increase in COVID-19 cases, although such measures have negative psychological effects. As pre-existing mental disorders are a risk factor of negative psychological consequences during pandemics, it is important to identify specific predictors of psychological distress caused by restrictive measures in patients with history of depressive episodes. The aims of this study were i) to determine whether depressive, anxious symptomatology and suicidal ideation (i.e. mental health outcomes) were influenced by stay-at-home orders, and ii) to identify the psychosocial dimensions that influenced these mental health outcomes in patients with pre-existing depression during/after COVID-19-related restrictions. Methods This study concerned 296 psychiatric patients with history of depressive episode in the 2Â years before the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants received a computerized form to self-measure depression, suicidal ideation, and anxiety (5 times during 2020â€“2021, two lockdown periods and three non- lockdown periods). Loneliness, boredom, habits, substance consumption, and access to psychiatric care also were self-reported. Results Loneliness and boredom were independent risk factors of anxiety and depression, and their changes dynamically affected the psychological state. Suicidal ideation was mostly driven by depressive symptomatology. Conclusions Our results highlight the need to target these dimensions in the most vulnerable patients in order to prevent the psychological consequences of the repeated COVID-19-related restrictions.","OliÃ©, Emilie, Dubois, Jonathan, Benramdane, Myriam, Guillaume, SÃ©bastien, Courtet, Philippe","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.040","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38350,""
"Hidradenitis suppurativa on Reddit: Natural language processing for thematic analysis","Background: Patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) face high psychosocial burden and difficulty in managing their chronic disease. Online support groups and forums are important spaces for patients to share emotional support and management strategies. Objective: To analyze patient-generated online forum posts in Reddit in order to uncover significant HS-related patient concerns and identify HS topics of particular interest to patients. Methods: We collected posts made in the subreddit forum â€œ/r/hidradenitisâ€ between July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2021. Latent derelict allocation (LDA), an unsupervised machine learning model, was applied to split the posts into topics. Keywords for each topic supplied by LDA were used to manually assign topic labels. Results: 61,627 posts by 6948 unique users met inclusion criteria. After applying LDA to the posts, 28 significant topics of conversation emerged that could be organized into 4 major themes: management (56.7%), mental health (20.6%), clinical presentation (13.1%), and logistics (7.6%). The top four topics were support (10.0%), diet (9.5%), wound care (7.3%) and intimate relationships (6.2%). Contemporary topics of interest included biologics (3.5%), COVID-19 (1.2%), and cannabis (1.1%). Limitations: LDA classifies posts into topics based on frequencies of words within the posts without an understanding of the language or context. Conclusions: This LDA-based analysis demonstrated a wide breadth of discussion occurring in an online forum, Reddit, with strong participation.

Resilience has been shown to be an important protective factor of seniors mental health, although its potential buffering role of public health risk factors with cumulative impact on mental health, such as loneliness and ageism, needs to be more studied. Aim To assess the potential mediator role of resilience between the effects of ageism and loneliness on PD in seniors. Methods A sample of 349 Portuguese seniors aged 60 years and over was collected through an online survey and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Seniors completed the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), the Short-Form of UCLA Loneliness Scale (USL-6), the Ambivalent Ageism Scale (AAS) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). A mediation analysis model was developed with resilience as a mediating variable. Results There were moderate to high levels of PD and moderate levels of ageism, loneliness and resilience. Resilience fully mediated the effect of ageism on PD and partially mediated the effect of loneliness on PD. Conclusions Resilience was an important protective factor of mental health against the effects of ageism, and partially protected mental health from the effects of loneliness among seniors. It is suggested that resilience be considered as a factor to be integrated in future intervention programs for mental health. The practical applicability of this study is discussed.","Ribeiro-GonÃ§alves, JosÃ© Alberto, Costa, Pedro Alexandre, Leal, Isabel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2022.100339","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology; 23(1):100339, 2023.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38352,""
"Perceived stigma among Tunisian healthcare workers during the covidâ€“19 pandemic","Background and objectives: Stigma was a major issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. It posed a serious threat to the lives of healthcare workers (HCWs) who were expected to experience higher levels of stigma and increased psychological distress. This is the first survey to investigate forms and correlates of perceived stigma in Tunisian HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted between October 8th and November 10th 2020, among 250 Tunisian HCWs. Data were collected using an online questionnaire using the Google FormsÂ® platform. We used a self-reported instrument measuring COVID-19-related stigma, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) to measure the perceived adequacy of social support from three sources: family, friends, and significant other. Results: The mean stigma score was 18.6Â±8. Participants sometimes to often experienced stigma in their relationships with friends (22%), neighbors (27.2%), parents (22,4%), and in social activities (30.8%). This stigma was perceived mainly through avoidance (68.4%), and rarely through verbal (6%) or physical aggression (1.2%). The mean MSPSS total score was 5.26Â±1.24. In multivariate analysis, depression history (p&lt;0.001), long working experience (p&lt;0.001), having presented ageusia/anosmia (p=0.007) and lower total social support scale (p&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with higher perceived stigma score. Conclusion: Our findings showed that HCWs perceived stigma in professional, societal and familial domains. Social support from family, friends and others seemed to protect against perceived stigma. Proper health education targeting the public appears to be an effective method to prevent social harassment of both HCWs and COVID-19 survivors. RÃ©sumÃ© Introduction et objectifs : La stigmatisation est un problÃ¨me majeur pendant la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19. En effet, de telles pandÃ©mies crÃ©ent de la peur et de lâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ©, ce qui peut entraÃ®ner une stigmatisation sociale envers certains groupes, y compris les personnes infectÃ©es, celles qui ont voyagÃ© Ã  lâ€™Ã©tranger, ou mÃªme les personnes associÃ©es aux personnes atteintes de la maladie, comme les membres de la famille et les professionnels de la santÃ© (PS). En fait, travailler avec des patients potentiellement trÃ¨s contagieux peut conduire Ã  une stigmatisation considÃ©rable. La stigmatisation sociale avait ainsi constituÃ© une menace sÃ©rieuse pour le bien-Ãªtre des PS, pouvant Ãªtre Ã  lâ€™origine dâ€™une dÃ©tresse psychologique accrue. Le but de cette Ã©tude Ã©tait de dÃ©crire les manifestations de la stigmatisation sociale perÃ§ues par les PS Tunisiens durant la pandÃ©mie COVID-19 et dâ€™Ã©valuer ses facteurs prÃ©dictifs. Population et mÃ©thodes : Nous avons menÃ© une Ã©tude transversale descriptive et analytique entre le 8 octobre et le 10 novembre 2020, auprÃ¨s de 250 PS Tunisiens, moyennant un questionnaire en ligne. Nous avons utilisÃ© un auto-questionnaire mesurant la stigmatisation liÃ©e Ã  la pandÃ©mie COVID-19, et lâ€™Ã©chelle â€œMultidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support<U+203F> (MSPSS) mesurant le niveau de soutien social perÃ§u Ã  partir de trois sources diffÃ©rentes (famille, amis, autrui significatif). Lâ€™approbation Ã©thique a Ã©tÃ© obtenue du Â« ComitÃ© de protection des personnes Â» de lâ€™universitÃ© de Sfax, en Tunisie. Lâ€™analyse statistique a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©alisÃ©e via le logiciel Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Une analyse multivariÃ©e a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©alisÃ©e pour dÃ©gager les facteurs indÃ©pendants de la stigmatisation. RÃ©sultats : Le score moyen de stigmatisation Ã©tait de 18,6Â±8. Les participants percevaient parfois Ã  souvent la stigmatisation dans leurs relations avec les amis (22 %), les voisins (27,2 %), leurs parents (22,4 %) et les activitÃ©s sociales (30,8 %). Cette stigmatisation Ã©tait perÃ§ue principalement par lâ€™Ã©vitement (68,4 %), et rarement par une agression verbale (6 %) ou physique (1,2 %). Le score total moyen du MSPSS Ã©tait de 5,26Â±1,24. Lâ€™analyse univariÃ©e a montrÃ© que les PS Ã¢gÃ©s de plus de 40 ans, ainsi que ceux ayant des enfants ont rapportÃ© des scores de stigmatisation perÃ§ue significativement plus Ã©levÃ©s (p = 0,032 et p = 0,005 respectivement). Les participants ayant des antÃ©cÃ©dents de dÃ©pression Ã©taient significativement plus susceptibles de prÃ©senter des niveaux plus Ã©levÃ©s de stigmatisation perÃ§ue (p&lt;0,001). Les PS exerÃ§ant depuis plus de 5 ans percevaient une stigmatisation sociale significativement plus importante (p=0,001). Ceux qui ont prÃ©sentÃ© une anosmie et/ou une agueusie, ainsi que ceux ayant Ã©tÃ© testÃ©s pour la COVID-19 ont signalÃ© un score de stigmatisation plus Ã©levÃ© (p=0,015 et p=0,037 respectivement). Des sous-Ã©chelles de soutien social plus faibles (famille;amis et proches) ainsi quâ€™un faible score total Ã©taient associÃ©s Ã  une stigmatisation perÃ§ue plus Ã©levÃ©e (p=0,002;p&lt;0,001;p=0,001 et p&lt;0,001). En analyse multivariÃ©e, lâ€™antÃ©cÃ©dent de trouble dÃ©pressif (p&lt;0,001);une longue carriÃ¨re (p&lt;0,001), le fait de prÃ©senter une agueusie/anosmie (p = 0,007) et un faible score total MSPSS (p&lt;0,001) Ã©taient significativement associÃ©s Ã  un score de stigmatisation perÃ§ue plus Ã©levÃ©. Conclusion : Nos rÃ©sultats ont montrÃ© que les PS percevaient de la stigmatisation dans tous les domaines professionnels, sociÃ©taux et familiaux. Le soutien social semble protÃ©ger contre la stigmatisation perÃ§ue. Une Ã©ducation sanitaire appropriÃ©e ciblant le public pourrait Ãªtre une mÃ©thode efficace pour prÃ©venir le harcÃ¨lement social des PS et des patients atteints de COVID-19.","Turki, Mariem, Ouali, Reehab, Ellouze, Sahar, Ayed, Houda Ben, Charfi, Rihab, Feki, Habib, Halouani, Najla, Aloulou, Jihene","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2022.08.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: L'EncÃ©phale;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38353,""
"Day-to-day impact of COVID-19 and other factors associated with risk of nonfatal overdose among people who use unregulated drugs in five cities in the United States and Canada","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the longstanding drug poisoning crisis in Canada and the United States (US). Research is needed to understand the contributions of COVID-19 and subsequent infection control measures. We sought to estimate the prevalence of and factors associated with nonfatal overdose among participants in nine prospective cohorts of people who use unregulated drugs (PWUD) in in Canada and the US. Methods Data were derived from nine cohorts of PWUD in urban centres in Canada (Vancouver, BC) and the US (Baltimore, MD;Miami, FL;Chicago, IL;Los Angeles, CA) between May, 2020 and April, 2021. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with nonfatal overdose among participants who used unregulated drugs in the past month. Results Among 885 participants (including 253 females), 41 (4.6%) experienced a non-fatal overdose in the past month, and 453 (51.2%) reported being highly impacted day-to-day by the pandemic. In multivariable analyses, people who experienced a non-fatal overdose were more likely to be female (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=2.18;95% Confidence Interval [CI]=1.10â€“4.30);unstably housed/homeless (AOR=2.16;95% CI=1.11â€“4.26);engaged in medications for opioid use disorder (AOR=2.45;95% CI=1.19â€“4.97);and highly impacted day-to-day (AOR=2.42;95% CI=1.22â€“5.10). Conclusion Our findings may reflect characteristics of participants who experienced a compounding of vulnerabilities during the pandemic and thus are vulnerable to overdose, including women, those unstably housed/homeless, and those who perceived their daily lives were highly impacted by the pandemic. Multi-level interventions are needed to remediate the vulnerabilities and address the main driver of poisoning crisis.","Moallef, Soroush, Genberg, Becky L.; Hayashi, Kanna, Mehta, Shruti H.; Kirk, Gregory D.; Choi, JinCheol, DeBeck, Kora, Kipke, Michele, Moore, Richard D.; Baum, Marianna K.; Shoptaw, Steven, Gorbach, Pamina M.; Mustanski, Brian, Javanbakht, Marjan, Siminski, Susanne, Milloy, M.

"Studying the implementation of Zero Suicide in a large health system: Challenges, adaptations, and lessons learned","Background Suicide remains the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Many patients presenting to healthcare settings with suicide risk are not identified and their risk mitigated during routine care. Our aim is to describe the planned methodology for studying the implementation of the Zero Suicide framework, a systems-based model designed to improve suicide risk detection and treatment, within a large healthcare system. Methods We planned to use a stepped wedge design to roll-out the Zero Suicide framework over 4 years with a total of 39 clinical units, spanning emergency department, inpatient, and outpatient settings, involving ~310,000 patients. We used Lean, a widely adopted a continuous quality improvement (CQI) model, to implement improvements using a centralize â€œhubâ€ working with smaller â€œspokeâ€ teams comprising CQI personnel, unit managers, and frontline staff. Results Over the course of the study, five major disruptions impacted our research methods, including a change in The Joint Commission's safety standards for suicide risk mitigation yielding massive system-wide changes and the COVID-19 pandemic. What had been an ambitious program at onset became increasingly challenging because of the disruptions, requiring significant adaptations to our implementation approach and our study methods. Conclusions Real-life obstacles interfered markedly with our plans. While we were ultimately successful in implementing Zero Suicide, these obstacles led to adaptations to our approach and timeline and required substantial changes in our study methodology. Future studies of quality improvement efforts that cut across multiple units and settings within a given health system should avoid using a stepped-wedge design with randomization at the unit level if there is the potential for sentinel, system-wide events.","Boudreaux, Edwin D.; Larkin, Celine, Sefair, Ana Vallejo, Mick, Eric, Clements, Karen, Pelletier, Lori, Yang, Chengwu, Kiefe, Catarina","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2022.100999","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications;: 100999, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38355,""
"Online HOPE intervention on help-seeking attitudes and intentions among young adults in Singapore: A randomized controlled trial and process evaluation","Introduction Despite the high prevalence of mental health disorders, professional help seeking was often unsought, worsening impairments in overall functioning among those who experienced them. Aim This study aimed to evaluate the online HOPE intervention on help-seeking attitudes and intentions among young adults 18 to 24Â years old in a University in Singapore. The study also described the process evaluation of the online HOPE intervention. Method The study adopted a parallel two arms RCT. Outcome measurements measured at baseline, post-test and two-month follow-up were (1) recognition of depression, (2) barriers of help-seeking, (3) help-seeking intentions (4) attitudes about interventions, help sources and medications and (5) participants' perceptions about the intervention. Results At post-test, intervention group had significantly lower acknowledgement of depression as stress. At two months, control group was significantly more concerned about side effects of medications. There were no significant differences in all barriers of help-seeking between groups, pre and post intervention. The intervention group had greater acknowledgement of antidepressants, tranquilisers and antipsychotics. Thematic analysis revealed four main themes. Discussion There was high baseline recognition of depression. Improvements in helpâ€“seeking intentions were partially attributed to decreased help-seeking barriers. Implication for practice The online HOPE intervention could be promptly implemented for young adults to enhance the identification of mental health disorders, early help-seeking and recovery. Nurses played an important role in patient education, and online interventions are especially crucial during this Covid period which mandated social distancing.

"The effect of laughter therapy on depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness among nursing students during the Covid-19 pandemic","Background Nursing students experienced mental symptoms when they switched to distance education due to the pandemic. Aims This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of online laughter therapy sessions on depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness levels in first-year nursing students. Methods In this randomized controlled trial, 61 healthy nursing students were randomly assigned to intervention (nÂ =Â 32) and control groups (nÂ =Â 29). The intervention group received online laughter therapy twice weekly for four weeks. The control group received no intervention. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale at the study initiation and week four in both groups. Results There was no difference between the mean scores of the groups in the pre-test (pÂ &gt;Â 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between groups in terms of depression after online laughter therapy sessions (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05), but there was no significant difference between anxiety, stress, and loneliness levels (pÂ &gt;Â 0.05). Conclusions Online laughter therapy sessions significantly reduced depression but had no effect on anxiety, stress, and loneliness.

"Trends in US Depression Prevalence From 2015 to 2020: The Widening Treatment Gap","Introduction Major depression is a common and potentially lethal condition. Early data suggest that the population-level burden of depression has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prepandemic estimates of depression prevalence are required to quantify and comprehensively address the pandemic's impact on mental health in the U.S. Methods Data were drawn from the 2015â€“2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a nationally representative study of U.S. individuals aged =12 years. The prevalence of past-year depression and help seeking for depression were estimated from 2015 to 2019, and time trends were tested with Poisson regression with robust SEs. Point estimates were calculated for 2020 and not included in statistical trend analyses because of differences in data collection procedures. Results In 2020, 9.2% (SE=0.31) of Americans aged =12 years experienced a past-year major depressive episode. Depression was more common among young adults aged 18â€“25 years (17.2%, SE=0.78), followed closely by adolescents aged 12â€“17 years (16.9%, SE=0.84). Depression increased most rapidly among adolescents and young adults and increased among nearly all sex, racial/ethnic, income, and education groups. Depression prevalence did not change among adults aged =35 years, and the prevalence of help seeking remained consistently low across the study period. Conclusions From 2015 to 2019, there were widespread increases in depression without commensurate increases in treatment, and in 2020, past 12-month depression was prevalent among nearly 1 in 10 Americans and almost 1 in 5 adolescents and young adults. Decisive action involving a multipronged public health campaign that includes evidence-based prevention and intervention to address this ongoing mental health crisis is urgently needed.","Goodwin, Renee D.; Dierker, Lisa C.; Wu, Melody, Galea, Sandro, Hoven, Christina W.; Weinberger, Andrea H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2022.05.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Journal of Preventive Medicine;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38358,""

"â€œOnline delivery gave me privacy and distance from othersâ€: feasibility trial and qualitative evaluation of an online intervention for refugees and asylum seekers;LTP Â +Â  EMDR G-TEP","Rates of mental health difficulties are high among refugees and asylum seekers who are parents, which makes their family members vulnerable to further negative outcomes such as behavioural problems or withdrawal. Maternal health and responsive parenting can stimulate the well-being of family members. However, displaced parents may fail to fulfil this role due to their own personal emotional issues. This current study is the first trial that tested the acceptability and feasibility of a remote multi-component parenting intervention for refugees and asylum seekers: Learning Through Play and EMDR Group Traumatic Episode Protocol. The study was a single-arm feasibility trial with an embedded qualitative component, and took place in the UK. We recruited caregivers of children under three years of age and offered eight sessions of a remote group Learning Through Play parenting intervention and Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing Group Traumatic Episode Protocol (LTP+ EMDR G-TEP). We administered assessments, including the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale, International Trauma Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, followed by qualitative interviews. Of the 16 participants approached, 14 consented and were eligible to participate. Both qualitative and quantitative results showed the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention based on a recruitment rate of 88% of eligible participants and a 78% attendance rate for all sessions. Participants showed improvements in all outcome measures, an increase in parental self-esteem and a reduction in mental health symptoms. Findings also suggest that remote interventions are promising as a scalable approach for displaced families.","Kaptan, Safa Kemal, Varese, Filippo, Yilmaz, Betul, Andriopoulou, Panoraia, Husain, Nusrat","https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12580","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Counselling and Psychotherapy Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38360,""

"An Interdisciplinary Approach to the Challenges of Patient Care in the Post-Covid-19 Era","Background: The aim of the article is to present selected spiritual-ethical topics that highlighted the time of the pandemic in the feedback of health professionals themselves during their concurrent university studies at the Faculty of Health Studies, University of Pardubice in the Czech Republic. Methods: The method of work is an interdisciplinary interpretation of a pilot survey among health professionals who have served in the COVID-19 departments at the ethical, philosophical, and spiritual levels. Results: In contrast to the already existing outputs from sociological surveys among health professionals, the inherent value of the article is its interdisciplinary approach to the interpretation of the obtained data. The topic of the first chapter reflects the legitimate need to protect oneself from the spread of the disease with the help of respirators and other protective equipment, which has limited the possibilities of communication between healthcare professionals and patients. This has proven the importance of the human face in communication. Another topic concerns the care of mental health of health professionals in the prevention of burnout syndrome, which they face due to work overload in covid department. Finally, the topic of the noon third chapter presents the current discussion of moral dilemmas and moral distress among health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a new burden on health professionals on a physical, mental and spiritual level. The pre-existing post-lid syndrome among health professionals will require an interdisciplinary approach, the establishment of interdisciplinary counseling teams, mentoring and forms of support at the level of ethical, psychological and spiritual support for health professionals.","Sladek, K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+Interdisciplinary+Approach+to+the+Challenges+of+Patient+Care+in+the+Post-Covid-19+Era","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Acta Missiologica; 16(1):40-50, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38364,""

"Correlation between psychological status and social support in non-anti-epidemic clinical nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional observational study","Objectives: To explore the psychological status and perceived social support in non-anti-epidemic clinical nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and the correlation between these two factors. Methods: Data of nonanti-epidemic clinical nurses from medical institutions in Nantong City of Jiangsu Province were collected using the Psychological Questionnaire for Emergent Events of Public Health (PQEEPH) and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) from February to March, 2020. Results: A total of 1,187 non-anti-epidemic clinical nurses were included into this study.

"A Case of Cotard Syndrome and Neurosyphilis","BACKGROUND: Cotard syndrome is a rare neuropsychiatric condition in which individuals have delusions of being deceased or losing their organs. It is often seen in patients with severe depression and is associated with catatonia.1 Neurosyphilis is a severe sequelae of untreated treponema pallidum infection in which the paretic form of this disorder commonly has a psychiatric presentation. 2 We present a rare case of Cotard syndrome in a patient with neurosyphilis with successful treatment. OBJECTIVE: To understand Cotard syndrome and underlying neuropsychiatric conditions, and characterize the diagnosis and management of psychiatric symptoms in a patient with neurosyphilis. METHODS: Review of a case using electronic medical records and relevant literature. Key terms searched: 'Cotard syndrome,' 'neurosyphilis,' 'COVID-19 infection' using Medscape and Google Scholar. RESULTS: We present a 49-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder in remission, depression, and history of COVID-19 (asymptomatic) 6 months prior. The patient presented to the emergency department for recent changes in behavior. He was agitated, threatening, and required chemical and physical restraint. Evaluation was notable for illogical thought processes with somatic delusions. He repeatedly stated, 'I am already dead, my organs have died,' and had an episode of catatonia. All tests including drug screen and COVID-19 were negative. Rapid plasma regain (RPR) titer was 1:64. Neurology and Infectious Disease were consulted. Lumbar puncture revealed positive venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) titer of 1:4. The patient was diagnosed with neurosyphilis and major depressive disorder with psychosis with Cotard syndrome. He was treated with intravenous (IV) penicillin G and was discharged on oral mirtazapine 30 mg and olanzapine 20 mg nightly at bedtime, oral donepezil 5 mg daily, thiamine, and folate. CONCLUSIONS: Cotard syndrome is often seen in depression with psychotic features.1 Neurosyphilis can present with depression, anxiety, psychosis, and dementia. Early identification is the key for successful treatment. This is a unique case of neurosyphilis with features of Cotard syndrome in a patient with a history of depression with treatment noncompliance. Studies show that quetiapine and risperidone improve psychosis in neurosyphilis.5 In this case, neurosyphilis was successfully treated with IV penicillin G for 2 weeks. The patient was also tried on antipsychotics and mood stabilizers ' specifically aripiprazole, valproic acid, and haloperidol ' and was eventually stabilized on oral olanzapine 20 mg taken nightly at bedtime. Our differential diagnosis also included COVID-19 delirium with Cotard syndrome, which was ruled out due to a negative COVID test. To our knowledge, there are 2 cases of COVID-19 delirium with Cotard syndrome.6 We present this case to inform clinicians of rare manifestations of neurosyphilis in patients with comorbid psychiatric illness and to advance research into treatment options for psychosis in neurosyphilis.","Peteru, S.; Irani, M.; Orr, M.; Katehis, E.; Green, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Case+of+Cotard+Syndrome+and+Neurosyphilis","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Clinical Psychiatry; 34(3):15-16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38369,""
"A Case of Autosarcophagy in a Pediatric Patient With Depression","BACKGROUND: Self-mutilating behavior in the pediatric population is associated with psychiatric and psychosocial factors. Autosarcophagy, or self-cannibalism, is an extremely rare form of self-mutilation and is predominantly seen with psychosis or substance use.1 We report a case of oral autosarcophagy in a pediatric patient in the absence of substance use or psychosis. OBJECTIVE: To learn about autosarcophagy and its treatment in the pediatric population and to explore other neuropsychiatric disorders in which it is a predominant manifestation. METHODS: Review of a case using electronic medical records and relevant literature. Key terms: 'autosarcophagy,' 'body focused repetitive behavior,' 'oral self injury,' 'pediatric self-mutilation' using Medscape and Google Scholar. RESULTS: We present a 14-year-old female with history of seizure disorder in full remission, depression, self-cutting behavior, and suicidal ideation with 2 psychiatric hospitalizations, who presented to the pediatric emergency department with oral bleeding after eating one-third of her tongue over the course of a month. Evaluation was notable for poverty of speech and constricted affect. Patient stated she was 'trying to remove an infection' and alleviate discomfort. She denied that this behavior was an attempt to end her life but endorsed past suicidal ideations and cutting behavior. History revealed emergency room evaluation for aggressive behavior and episodes of volitional enuresis. We diagnosed major depressive disorder, recurrent episode in remission without psychosis. Drug screen, complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, COVID-19, urinalysis, thyroid-stimulating hormone, head computed tomography, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin were negative. Patient continued home oral medications aripiprazole 10 mg daily, fluoxetine 30 mg daily, and levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily and was discharged the next day. CONCLUSIONS: Self-harm is observed in 17.2% of adolescents, 13.4% of young adults, and 5.5% of older adults.2 Cases of self-mutilation in pediatric patients typically present as cutting, burning, or head banging.3 Our differential diagnoses include borderline personality disorder due to repeated impulsivity and self-harm, and body focused repetitive behavior disorder (obsessive-compulsive disorder-related disorder), which presents with repetitive strain injuries and dental malocclusions. Treatment of self-mutilation involves treating the underlying psychiatric condition with psychotropic medications.4,5 In pediatric patients, dialectical behavioral therapy has been shown to reduce parasuicidal behaviors after 1 year of therapy.6 Our patient, under constant 24-hour observation, was cleared by medical, psychiatric, and dental teams. The patient followed up with outpatient psychotherapy and psychiatry. We are presenting this rare case for clinicians to identify and manage pediatric patients presenting with unique forms of self-harm tendencies.","Peteru, S.; Irani, M.; Orr, M.; Askandaryan, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Case+of+Autosarcophagy+in+a+Pediatric+Patient+With+Depression","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Clinical Psychiatry; 34(3):10-11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38370,""

"Impact of a Yogic Breathing Technique on the Well-Being of Healthcare Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for healthcare providers (HCPs), resulting in stress-related disorders, insomnia, and burnout. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY), a mind-body intervention, was explored as a tool to positively impact the wellbeing of HCPs during the pandemic. METHODS: A pilot study with a single-arm pre-/post-assessment follow-up design was conducted. SKY was taught to participants in a 4-day online workshop between the months of April and June, 2020. Outcomes related to depression, anxiety, resilience, life satisfaction, and quality of sleep were measured using the following scales: Depression, Anxiety & Stress Scale, Connor- Davidson Resilience Scale, Satisfaction With Life Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients completed the pre-/post- and 40-day assessments. A significant reduction was noted in the outcomes of stress, anxiety, depression, resilience, life satisfaction, and quality of sleep immediately after the program (P &lt; .001). At 40 days of practice, significant improvements in resilience (P = .015) and life satisfaction (P &lt; .001) were noted. CONCLUSIONS: SKY demonstrated a positive impact on the well-being of HCPs, even during the dire stresses of the pandemic, with improvements observed in both physical and mental health parameters. A significant, immediate reduction in stress, anxiety, and depression was noted. In addition, sustained improvements in quality of sleep, satisfaction with life, and resilience were experienced among those who practiced SKY. Interventions like SKY may serve as prudent low-cost, high-impact, easy-to-implement options for lowering stress and burnout among physicians.","Kanchibhotla, D.; Bharati, S.; Ramrakhyani, S.; Darshan, M.

"Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of PH94B in Adjustment Disorder With Anxiety: Design of an Exploratory Phase 2A Clinical Trial","BACKGROUND: Adjustment disorders are now primary diagnoses in the trauma and stressrelated disorders section of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Adjustment disorder with anxiety (AjDA) is the development of emotional or behavioral symptoms considered excessive in response to stressful events, significantly impairing a person's ability to function in social, occupational, and/ or other situations. Traumatic experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have increased rates of adjustment disorders, especially among those whose life routines were disrupted by pandemic-associated stress and anxiety. PH94B (3b-hydroxy-androsta-4,16-dien-ol) has shown rapid-onset efficacy in the treatment of social anxiety disorder (Liebowitz et al. Am J Psychiatry. 2014). PH94B is a neuroactive steroid administered as a nasal spray that engages olfactory chemosensory neurons, activating subsets of olfactory bulb neurons that project directly to the limbic amygdala regulating fear and anxiety circuits. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PH94B in adults with AjDA. METHODS: This is an exploratory, phase 2A, randomized, double-blind, 4-week, placebo-controlled, 2-arm study in adults with AjDA. The primary outcome is change from baseline to week 4 in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total score after intranasal administration of PH49B 4 times daily vs placebo. Patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of AjDA confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) with Adjustment Disorders Module and a clinician-rated HAM-A score of =20 at screening (Visit 1), with =15% decrease at baseline (Visit 2, randomization) are eligible for inclusion. Secondary outcomes include change from baseline to week 4 in the Adjustment Disorder New Module Scale (ADNM), the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire (IADQ), the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), and the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C). Change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was exploratory. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients will be randomized (1:1 drug to placebo). The study design features the use of the ADNM and IADQ, newly developed according to ICD-11 criteria for evaluation of AjDA. While both are validated, neither has been tested in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Both scales begin with a list of stressors (18 for ADNM and 9 for IADQ);a yes answer to any 1 stressor triggers a series of questions about the frequency and duration of a patient's reaction to the stressor (ADNM) or quantifies symptoms in response to the stressor (IADQ). CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and a leading cause of disability. Anxiety and impaired functioning are increasing, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and no pharmacologic treatment is currently approved by the FDA for AjDA. PH94B, an investigational pherine nasal spray, is also being studied for treatment of other anxiety-related disorders.","Careri, J. M.; Smith, M. A.; Monti, L.; Baker, R.

"Psychological Inflexibility Predicts Depression and Anxiety During Covid-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has affected people across the globe in psychosocial and economic aspects. This process has been difficult for most people, even more for some others including (teachers, administrators at educational settings) working in educational settings. The purpose of this study was to understand the predictive effect of psychosocial factors (gender, age, marital status, Additional Time Spent (ATS) on social media, ATS internet compared to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic and expert programs), and psychological inflexibility on depression and anxiety for teachers employed in the Ministry of Education during the pandemic. Participants included 514 adults (49% women). The findings of the study revealed that psychological factors and psychological inflexibility together explained 47% of the variance in depression and 42% of the variance in anxiety. Specifically, gender, social media and psychological inflexibility were significant predictors of both depression and anxiety during the pandemic. In addition to the predictive effect of psychosocial factors, these results indicated that psychological flexibility was important to develop further evidence based mental health services to address psychopathology and enhanced wellbeing. The findings of the study were discussed in the light of literature, and some suggestions were provided for future research and practice.","Cicek, Ilhan, Tanhan, Ahmet, Bulus, Metin","https://doi.org/10.26634/jpsy.15.1.18198","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: i-Manager's Journal on Educational Psychology; 15(1):11-24, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38379,""
"From the Black Plague to the COVID-19 Pandemic : The Ubiquity and Obsolesce of Papercuts in Books","COVID-19 (2019â€“) appears to have accelerated the transition of movable books from ubiquitous multimodal learning tools into artifacts and artworks, exhibited in museums and galleries. In their place, children are embracing interactive digital books. Whether they offer the same pedological value as their material counterparts remains a point of contention amongst early childhood educators. Both movable books and computers, evolved from volvelles. The devices, constructed using cut paper, emerged in Europe during the thirteenth century. Like papermaking, the technology had precedents in the orient. Their establishment in Europe coincided with The Black Plague (c.1346â€“1351). This article examines the inclusion or omission of papercuts in books, in relation to the broader application of papercutting within their respective communities. Primary and secondary sources were examined from Europe between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries, from the United States during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and from China between the nineth and twentieth centuries. Reference is also made to recent exhibitions featuring artist books and papercuts in in the museum and galleries sectors of Australia, the US, Asia, and Europe.","See, Pamela","https://doi.org/10.18848/2691-1507/CGP/v19i02/27-41","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Information, Medium and Society; 19(2):27-41, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38380,""
"Teachersâ€™ Attitudes toward Remote Instruction","COVID-19 pandemic is a global catastrophe that has negatively impacted peopleâ€™s ability to sustain normal life after its outbreak. This virus is regarded as the greatest challenge that faces governments and civil society organizations around the globe. Educational institutions were among the first ones that took action to deal with the damages caused by the pandemic. However, some problems have prevented the progress of the online teaching process. In this study, the researcher discusses the effects of the social and physical challenges on the progress of online teaching encountered by teachers who are working from home. Specifically, the study aims to explore the social and physical factors that could influence the teaching methods teachers normally use. The study included a sample of 338 male and female teachers in Al Ain, the United Arab Emirates, who used an electronic platform as an alternative plan to share knowledge since classrooms were unavailable for use. The participants filled in a questionnaire which was distributed via social media platforms. Furthermore, the researcher studied the differences between the participantsâ€™ responses and attempted to establish a relationship between the standard deviation values and a group of variables, that is, gender, sector, and marital status. The study concluded with some recommendations to enhance teachersâ€™ performance and help them deal with the workload without getting nervous or depressed.","Al-Tkhayneh, Khawlah M.","https://doi.org/10.18848/1835-9795/CGP/v14i02/21-32","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ubiquitous Learning; 14(2):21-32, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38381,""
"Mediating role of resilience in relationship between occupational stress and depression of staff of centers for disease control and prevention","[Background] Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, staff of the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) have been burdened with heavy epidemic prevention control, and excessive occupational stress can cause depression and other psychological problems. [Objective] To explore the status of occupational stress, resilience, and depression of CDC staff and potential relationships between them. [Methods] From December 2020 to April 2021, a survey was conducted at provincial and municipal levels, and the stratified cluster sampling method was used at county (district) level to select a total of 3514 samples. Their occupational stress, resilience, and depression status were evaluated using the Chinese Effort-Reward Imbalance Scale (ERI), the Chinese Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Independent samplet test, analysis of variance, <U+03C7>2 test, Pearson correlation analysis, and mediation test (structural equation model) were conducted. [Results] The positive rate of occupational stress was 34.29% in the CDC staff, the resilience score was 66.28Â±15.32, and the positive rate of depression was 48.58%. Significant differences were found in the positive rates of occupational stress among different groups of gender, age, education background, marital status, administrative duty, weekly exercise frequency, chronic disease prevalence, and participation in epidemic control (P&lt;0.05);in the resilience scores among different groups of gender, age, administrative duty, weekly exercise frequency, chronic disease prevalence, and participation in epidemic control (P&lt;0.05);in the positive rates of depression among different groups of gender, age, educational background, personal monthly income, weekly exercise frequency, chronic disease prevalence, and participation in epidemic control (P&lt;0.05). Occupational stress was negatively correlated with resilience (r=-0.165,P&lt;0.01). Resilience was negatively correlated with depression (r=-0.383,P&lt;0.01). Occupational stress was positively correlated with depression (r=0.343, P&lt;0.01). The structural equation embracing a partial mediating effect of resilience on the relationship occupational stress and depression was established, and the partial mediating effect was 0.039, accounting for 10.46% of the total effect. [Conclusion] High positive rates of occupational stress, reduced resilience, and depression are shown among CDC staff in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, and resilience partially mediates the effect of occupational stress on depression. The study findings suggest that improving resilience may reduce occupational stress and depression in CDC staff.","Hao, Junyao, Zhao, Junqin, Zhao, Chunxiang, Zhang, Ruo, Shi, Jinmei, Dong, Qiuying, Li, Jianguo","https://doi.org/10.11836/JEOM22049","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Huanjing yu Zhiye Yixue = Journal of Environmental & Occupational Medicine; 39(8):871, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38382,""
"Recovering mixtures of fast-diffusing states from short single-particle trajectories","Concerns about the mental health of students, trainees and staff at universities and medical schools have been growing for many years. Recently, these have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and a period of heightened reckoning and protests about systemic racism in the United States in 2020. To better understand the mental health of medical students and biomedical doctoral students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during this challenging period, we performed a cross-sectional study (n=957) using institutional annual survey data on measures of depression, anxiety, hazardous alcohol use, problems related to substance use, and suicidal ideation. These data were collected in 2019 and 2020, and were analyzed by type of training program, race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and survey year. Results indicated significant differences for rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, with biomedical doctoral students showing greater incidence than medical students, and historically excluded students (e.g., people of color, women, LGBQ+ trainees) showing greater incidence compared to their peers. Of note, mental health remained poor for biomedical doctoral students in 2020 and declined for those belonging to historically excluded populations. The high rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported suggest that training environments need to be improved and support for mental health increased.

"Physical activity and the development of general mental health problems or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children and adolescents: A cross-lagged panel analysis of long-term follow-up epidemiological data","Studies have shown that physical activity (PA) can provide a helpful, low-risk, and cost-effective intervention for children and adolescents suffering from mental health problems. The present longitudinal study aimed to assess whether PA prevents the development of mental health problems such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. Data were analyzed from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) collected from more than 15.000 children and adolescents at three different time points over a period of more than 10 years. Parents scored the PA of the study participants on three frequency levels according to WHO recommendations, and mental health problems were assessed by means of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The total problem score (SDQ-Total) as well as the hyperactivity/inattention symptoms sub-scale (SDQ-H/I) were used in an autoregressive cross-lagged model to examine their relationship with PA. The results showed that PA of boys and girls at preschool age was inversely associated with the occurrence of mental health problems and, in particular, ADHD symptoms about 6 years later. Higher levels of PA were associated with better general mental health and fewer ADHD symptoms at the next time point (Wave 1). These effects were not observed from preadolescence (Wave 1) to adolescence (Wave 2), neither for girls nor for boys. These findings indicate that medium-to-high PA may be a supportive factor for good mental health in children in preschool and elementary school. Future studies will have to show whether PA may be a helpful add-on for interventional programs for improving general mental health and alleviating ADHD symptoms among children and adolescents.","Ganjeh, Parisa, Hagmayer, York, Meyer, Thomas, Kuhnert, Ronny, Ravens-Sieberer, Ulrike, von Steinbuechel, Nicole, Rothenberger, Aribert, Becker, Andreas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2022.933139","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38384,""
"Inequality in Household Job Insecurity and Mental Health: Changes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Using nationally representative data from the Household Pulse Survey (April 2020-March 2021), we examined how associations between household job insecurity and mental health changed throughout the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (n = 1,248,043). We also documented changes in the unequal distribution of job insecurity by race/ethnicity and educational attainment over time. We find that job insecurity was strongly associated with depression and anxiety throughout the study period, and the associations strengthened as the pandemic continued, especially in fall 2020. Moreover, racial/ethnic minorities with lower levels of educational attainment had the greatest risk of job insecurity, and educational disparities in job insecurity changed over time. Psychological distress during the pandemic, including disparities therein, must be considered a public health priority.

"Conspiracy Illusion, Superstitions, and Death Anxiety of Older Adults Who Refused Covid-19 Vaccination in Iran: A Cross-Sectional Study on Their Beliefs","The study was aimed to assess mental health of the older adults who did not participate in the three stages of national vaccination program. As a descriptive-analytical study, about 285 Iranian older people were interviewed in 2022. Data collection tools included demographic characteristics, conspiracy scale, superstitious beliefs instrument, and Templer death anxiety. The convenience sampling method was used and data were analyzed using BIM-SPSS version 28. Death anxiety statistically effect on conspiratory and superstitions with scores 0.190 and 0.320 using adjusted Eta squared, respectively and superstitious beliefs effected 81% of conspiracy as well (p = 0.001). Using ROC analysis, the cutoff points for conspiracy of men and women and final SEM model were extracted too. Interaction of conspiracy illusion, superstitions with death anxiety during the pandemic time among vulnerable groups i.e ageing community can shape a decision line in health policy making.

"A Natural Language Processing (NLP) Evaluation on COVID-19 Rumour Dataset Using Deep Learning Techniques","Context and Background: Since December 2019, the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic has sparked considerable alarm among the general community and significantly affected societal attitudes and perceptions. Apart from the disease itself, many people suffer from anxiety and depression due to the disease and the present threat of an outbreak. Due to the fast propagation of the virus and misleading/fake information, the issues of public discourse alter, resulting in significant confusion in certain places. Rumours are unproven facts or stories that propagate and promote sentiments of prejudice, hatred, and fear. Objective. The study's objective is to propose a novel solution to detect fake news using state-of-the-art machines and deep learning models. Furthermore, to analyse which models outperformed in detecting the fake news. Method. In the research study, we adapted a COVID-19 rumours dataset, which incorporates rumours from news websites and tweets, together with information about the rumours. It is important to analyse data utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches. Based on the accuracy, precision, recall, and the f1 score, we can assess the effectiveness of the ML and DL algorithms. Results. The data adopted from the source (mentioned in the paper) have collected 9200 comments from Google and 34,779 Twitter postings filtered for phrases connected with COVID-19-related fake news. Experiment 1. The dataset was assessed using the following three criteria: veracity, stance, and sentiment. In these terms, we have different labels, and we have applied the DL algorithms separately to each term. We have used different models in the experiment such as (i) LSTM and (ii) Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN). The TCN model has more performance on each measurement parameter in the evaluated results. So, we have used the TCN model for the practical implication for better findings. Experiment 2. In the second experiment, we have used different state-of-the-art deep learning models and algorithms such as (i) Simple RNN;(ii) LSTM + Word Embedding;(iii) Bidirectional + Word Embedding;(iv) LSTM + CNN-1D;and (v) BERT. Furthermore, we have evaluated the performance of these models on all three datasets, e.g., veracity, stance, and sentiment. Based on our second experimental evaluation, the BERT has a superior performance over the other models compared.

"Fundamental drivers of nurses' experiences of ICU surging during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic","Nurses working in intensive care units have been heavily impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review summarizes the current state of the evidence regarding intensive care nurses experience of the pandemic. The pandemic has had an impact on: nursing workload, the organization of nurse staffing, experiences of staff redeployed into ICU, nurses' perceptions of the safety and quality of patient care, and staff health. In the few comparative studies, mental health was worse for nurses than other healthcare workers in intensive care. Despite some of this evidence being published early in the pandemic, no studies were found to evaluate interventions to improve nurses' experiences. Many of the adverse impacts of the pandemic are interdependent; for example, reducing nurses' workload is likely to have benefits for mental health indicators.Adverse mental health outcomes are likely to have an impact on future recruitment and retention for intensive care nursing.More studies are needed to understand the longer term impact of the pandemic on intensive care nurses.","Endacott, Blot","https://doi.org/10.1097/MCC.0000000000000995","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38388,""
"[Specially protected or stereotyped? How persons older than 65Ã‚Â years experienced the COVID-19 pandemic]","In the COVID-19 pandemic, in Switzerland people agedÃ‚Â 65+ years were categorized as aÃ‚Â high-risk group, as they are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 due to higher rates of underlying health conditions. This focused attention on older adults, mostly with respect to frailty and helplessness. What is lacking is older adults' subjective views, including their state of mind and their experiences. This study explores the subjective view of older adults and aims to examine their everyday coping during the pandemic, particularly the concrete impacts on their lives, their self-assessment as aÃ‚Â vulnerable group, and fears about COVID-19. The longitudinal study was conducted from April to June 2020 using aÃ‚Â mixed methods design comprising both closed and open-ended questions. We conducted guided biweekly interviews by telephone with 40Ã‚Â people (22Ã‚Â were women) aged 65-90 years. The quantitative data included descriptive analyses. The qualitative data were evaluated by structured content analysis with inductive category formation. The respondents reported little change in their everyday lives. Overall, aÃ‚Â good mood was reported. Social restrictions were experienced as aÃ‚Â great burden. The respondents perceived their classification as aÃ‚Â risk group as undifferentiated and arbitrary. Fear or worry about contracting the coronavirus was low. Respondents appear to have coped much better with the crisis than public discourse suggested. Activities and routines as well as support services may have been protective as strategies in everyday life. The homogeneous classification of older adults as an at-risk group ignores their resources and promotes both negative stereotypes and ageism. HINTERGRUND: Zu Beginn der Coronapandemie wurden auch in der Schweiz Personen im Alter ab 65Ã‚Â Jahren der besonders gefÃƒÂ¤hrdeten BevÃƒÂ¶lkerungsgruppe zugeordnet. Aufgrund vermehrter Vorerkrankungen wurde vermutet, sie seien einem erhÃƒÂ¶hten Risiko fÃƒÂ¼r schwere KrankheitsverlÃƒÂ¤ufe ausgesetzt. Dadurch rÃƒÂ¼ckten ÃƒÂ¤ltere Personen in den Fokus der Aufmerksamkeit, wodurch deren gebrechliche und hilflose Seite betont wurde. Dies lÃƒÂ¤sst Fragen offen, bezÃƒÂ¼glich der SelbsteinschÃƒÂ¤tzung der ÃƒÂ¤lteren Menschen, was ihr konkretes subjektives Befinden und Erleben wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Pandemie betrifft. Die Studie ergrÃƒÂ¼ndet die subjektive Sichtweise von Personen ab 65Ã‚Â Jahren und hat zum Ziel, ihre AlltagsbewÃƒÂ¤ltigung wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Pandemie zu untersuchen, insbesondere in Bezug auf die Auswirkungen auf ihre Lebenssituation, ihre SelbsteinschÃƒÂ¤tzung als vulnerable Gruppe und ihre Ãƒâ€žngste rund um COVID-19. Es handelt sich um eine LÃƒÂ¤ngsschnittstudie im Mixed-Methods-Design, bei welcher von Ende April bis Mitte Juni 2020 2Ã¢â‚¬â€˜wÃƒÂ¶chentlich ein leitfadengestÃƒÂ¼tztes Telefoninterview mit geschlossenen und offenen Fragen durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt wurde. Es wurden 40Ã‚Â Personen (mÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18, wÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22) im Alter zwischen 65 und 90Ã‚Â Jahren zu verschiedenen Aspekten der AlltagsbewÃƒÂ¤ltigung wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Coronapandemie und ihren Folgen befragt. Die quantitativen Daten wurden deskriptiv ausgewertet. Die qualitativen Daten wurden mittels strukturierter Inhaltsanalyse mit induktiver Kategorienbildung evaluiert. Die Studie zeigte, dass sich das Alltagsleben der Befragten trotz des Lockdowns zu Hause kaum verÃƒÂ¤nderte. Auch wurde mehrheitlich ÃƒÂ¼ber eine gute Stimmungslage berichtet. Als groÃƒÅ¸e Belastung wurden die sozialen EinschrÃƒÂ¤nkungen erlebt. Die Einordnung als Risikogruppe wurde als undifferenziert und willkÃƒÂ¼rlich empfunden. Angst oder Sorgen hinsichtlich einer Ansteckung mit dem Coronavirus waren wenig vorhanden. Die Befragten schienen die Krise deutlich besser bewÃƒÂ¤ltigt zu haben, als der ÃƒÂ¶ffentliche Diskurs nahelegte. AktivitÃƒÂ¤ten und Routinen kÃƒÂ¶nnen als Strategien im Alltag schÃƒÂ¼tzend gewirkt haben.

"Pre-pandemic resilience to trauma and mental health outcomes during COVID-19","The stress-sensitization hypothesis posits that individuals with prior trauma are at elevated risk for poor mental health when faced with subsequent stressors. Little work has examined whether those whoÃ‚Â have demonstrated psychological resilience to priorÃ‚Â trauma wouldÃ‚Â showÃ‚Â either increased resilience or vulnerability to subsequent stressors. We examined pre-pandemic psychological resilience to lifetime trauma in relation to mental health outcomes amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a major societal stressor. The sample included 16,900 trauma-exposed women from the Nurses' Health Study II. Pre-pandemic resilience was defined by psychological health in 2017-2019 (characterized by levels of both distress and positive emotional well-being) relative to lifetime trauma. Resilience was defined categorically by cross-classifying unfavorable, adequate, and favorable psychological healthÃ‚Â byÃ‚Â higher versus lower traumaÃ‚Â burden, and continuously as the residual difference in predicted versus actual psychological health regressed on trauma burden. Mental health outcomes as of May-August 2020 included psychological distressÃ‚Â symptoms and overall positive emotional well-being. Associations were assessed using covariate-adjusted regression models. Pre-pandemic resilience was associated with lower distress and higher well-being early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Relative to the womenÃ‚Â showing highest resilience (favorable psychological health despite higher trauma), only those with lower trauma and favorable prior psychological health had significantly lower distress and higher positive emotional well-being during the pandemic. Higher continuous pre-pandemic resilience was also significantly associated with lower distress and higher positive emotional well-beingÃ‚Â during the pandemic. Preventing mental health problems following trauma may contribute to protecting population well-being amid major stressors.","Choi, Nishimi, Jha, Sampson, Hahn, Kang, Koenen, Kubzansky","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02367-y","20220928","COVID-19; Longitudinal; Mental health; Psychological resilience; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38390,""

"Evaluating the impact of naloxone dispensation at public health vending machines in Clark County, Nevada","Implementing public health vending machines (PHVMs) is an evidence-based strategy for mitigating substance use-associated morbidity and mortality <i>via</i> the dispensation of essential supplies to people who use drugs, including overdose prevention resources. PHVMs have been implemented throughout the world; however, their implementation in the United States (US) is a recent phenomenon. In 2017, Trac-B Exchange (a syringe services program in Clark County, Nevada) installed three PHVMs. In 2019, naloxone dispensation was launched at PHVMs in Clark County. The purpose of this research is to examine the extent to which naloxone dispensation at PHVMs was associated with changes in opioid-involved overdose fatalities. Monthly counts of opioid-involved overdose fatalities among Clark County residents that occurred from January 2015 to December 2020 were used to build an autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) model to measure the impact of naloxone dispensation at PHVMs. We forecasted the number of expected opioid-involved overdose fatalities had naloxone dispensation at PHVMs not occurred and compared to observed monthly counts. Interrupted time series analyses (ITSA) were used to evaluate the step (i.e. the immediate impact of naloxone dispensation at PHVMs on opioid-involved overdose fatalities) and slope change (i.e. changes in trend and directionality of monthly counts of opioid-involved overdose fatalities following naloxone dispensation at PHVMs). During the 12-months immediately following naloxone dispensation at PHVMs, our model forecasted 270 opioid-involved overdose fatalities, but death certificate data indicated only 229 occurred, suggesting an aversion of 41 deaths. ITSA identified a significant negative step change in opioid-involved overdose fatalities at the time naloxone dispensation at PHVMs was launched (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-8.52, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0022) and a significant increasing slope change (<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.01, <i>p</i>&lt;.0001). Forecasts that extended into the COVID-19 pandemic suggested worsening trends in overdose fatalities. Naloxone dispensation at PHVMs was associated with immediate reductions in opioid-involved overdose fatalities.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in parents of infants with colic and on health care use","To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of parents of infants with colic and on health care use. Retrospective cohort study. Data of 64 parents of infants with colic pre-pandemic and 43 parents of infants with colic during the pandemic were analyzed using validated questionnaires on parental stress, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, we evaluated the number of outpatient clinic visits and admission rates pre- and during the pandemic by collecting data on the diagnosis treatment combination 'excessive crying' from electronic patient files in three secondary hospitals in the Netherlands. Mothers in the pandemic group reported significantly higher levels of depression than mothers in the pre-pandemic group (12.3 Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.0 and 8.8 Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.2) (p=0.04). Moreover, mothers showed a trend toward higher stress levels during the pandemic (29.6 Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.6 and 25.2 Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.1; p=0.06). During the pandemic, admission numbers of infants with colic compared to pre-pandemic data increased with 34% (146 vs. 196). Mothers of infants with colic reported significantly more feelings of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the pandemic was associated with increased healthcare use amongst infants with colic.

"Psychosocial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia and Their Families","This study aimed to investigate the psychosocial impact of the pandemic in pediatric patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and their families and whether congenital adrenal hyperplasia imposes an additional burden compared to other endocrine disorders. Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38) and congenital hypothyroidism (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41) and their families were enrolled in the prospective longitudinal survey study. Questionnaires that were completed remotely in June 2020 and in July 2021 included Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short form, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, and purpose-built daily routine, parent, and child COVID information scores, factors affecting drug usage, and parents' thoughts about the pandemic. At the end of 1 year, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short form and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were repeated in the congenital adrenal hyperplasia group and they were questioned about the incidence and severity of coronavirus infection. Median Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short form and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children scores were similar between the congenital adrenal hyperplasia and congenital hypothyroidism groups. In the congenital adrenal hyperplasia group, median purpose-built daily routine was higher in those who had a State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children-State score above the threshold (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.048), also Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short form-Depression, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short form-Anxiety, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short form-Stress, Parent COVID Information Score were higher among parents who followed news/data because of chronic diseases/medications of the child (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.010, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.034, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.044, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.045, respectively), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children-State was higher among parents who believed ""having chronic diseases"" and ""using medications"" increase the risk of COVID-19 infection (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.011, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.016, respectively).

"Cortisol changes in healthy children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused massive disruptions to daily life in the United States, closing schools and businesses and increasing physical and social isolation, leading to deteriorations in mental health and well-being in people of all ages. Many studies have linked chronic stress with long-term changes in cortisol secretion, which has been implicated in many stress-related physical and mental health problems that commonly emerge in adolescence. However, the physiological consequences of the pandemic in youth remain understudied. Using hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), we quantified average longitudinal changes in cortisol secretion across a four-month period capturing before, during, and after the transition to pandemic-lockdown conditions in a sample of healthy youth (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°49). Longitudinal changes in HCC were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Perceived levels of pandemic-related stress were measured and compared to the physiological changes in HCC. In children and adolescents, cortisol levels significantly increased across the course of the pandemic. These youth reported a multitude of stressors during this time, although changes in HCC were not associated with self-reported levels of COVID-19-related distress. We provide evidence that youth are experiencing significant physiological changes in cortisol activity across the COVID-19 pandemic, yet these biological responses are not associated with perceived stress levels. Youth may be especially vulnerable to the deleterious impacts of chronic cortisol exposure due to their current status in the sensitive periods for development, and the incongruency between biological and psychological stress responses may further complicate these developmental problems.","Fung, Taylor, Embury, Spooner, Johnson, Willett, Frenzel, Badura-Brack, White, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2022.2125798","20220928","Coronavirus; development longitudinal; hair cortisol concentration (HCC); neuroendocrinology; puberty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38395,""
"Mental Health in Non-Oncologic Urology Patients","This article is a literature review of mental health concerns in non-oncologic urology patients. Pathologies represented in this review include Peyronie's Disease (PD), erectile dysfunction (ED), urinary incontinence and urinary tract infections (UTI), infertility, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), kidney stones, and urinary retention. While there has been great interventional focus as of late for urogenitary malignancies (i.e.Ã‚Â prostate cancer awareness with the Movember campaign), literature studies and intervention focused on non-oncologic urology patients has been limited. As such, we conducted a review on urology patients with non-oncologic pathologies as an effort to increase clinician awareness of mental health concerns among such patients, increase the comfort level for clinician communication on socially sensitive topics surrounding pathologies, and review ongoing interventions conducted within these pathologies. We outlined different ongoing Mental Health Illness (MHI) needs and treatments for various pathologies. Patients with non-cancerous urologic pathologies had lower quality of life and higher incidence of MHI than the general population. As such, in line with the American Urological Association recommendations, psychological and social support from peers, therapists, and healthcare providers further prove to be crucial for some subpopulations. The review also yielded pathology specific interventions such as group therapy for ED patients. Given the higher incidence of MHI in the patient population after the Covid-19 pandemic, MHI awareness in the sphere of non-oncologic urology treatment continues to be crucial when creating a collaborative treatment platform for patients.","Anderson, Kumar, Divya, Zepeda, Razzak, Hasoon, Viswanath, Kaye, Urits","https://doi.org/10.52965/001c.38352","20220928","Anxiety; Depression; Erectile Dysfunction; Infertility; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Sexual Health; Urinary Incontinence; Urology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38396,""

Data management was performed using MAXQDA-2018 software and its scrutiny was done by the Graneheim and Lundman analysis method. After analyzing the data, 2 main categories and 15 subcategories were obtained, including 1- Activities (instruction and training; production and distribution of hygiene items; economic aid; psychological and social support for COVID-19 affected people; cooperation with government organizations to implement quarantine; environmental disinfection; cooperation with and support of the medical staff; encouraging and persuading people to participate in voluntary work; attending and cooperating in high-risk centers) and 2- Challenges (fear and worry of getting infected; rejection; being different from other voluntary activities; experience of failure and helplessness; the difficulty of the recruitment and cooperation process; lack of adequate instruction on how to help). Volunteers have played wide and diverse roles in confrontation with COVID-19 and have been able to provide various types of support to government, health and social organizations and the general public in various ways, but due to the special circumstances of the COVID-19 epidemic, they have experienced many challenges at the same time.","Irandoost, Sedighi, Hoseini, Ahmadi, Safari, Ebadi Fard Azar, Yoosefi Lebni","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103314","20220928","Activities; Atm, Automated teller machine; COVID-19; Challenges; Iran; Qualitative study; Volunteers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38397,""
"Disparities in food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic: A two-year analysis","While the overall level of food insecurity in the United States has remained stable during the COVID-19 pandemic, certain individuals and regions have fared worse than others. This study examines state-level variables affecting individual- and household-level food insecurity during the recent two years of the pandemic beginning in 2020 by utilizing the Household Pulse Survey, a new nationally representative dataset developed by the United States Census Bureau. The results of this study suggest a set of statewide factors, such as pandemic-driven market conditions, COVID-19 prevalence, and the implementation of federal programs, are associated with the level of food insecurity that individuals have experienced during the pandemic over the past two years. The associations varied by household income levels, indicating a strong relationship between higher-income households and market conditions, as well as the importance of federal programs and state policies in alleviating food insecurity among lower-income households. The food insecurity indices also overlapped with different socioeconomic and health hardships caused by the pandemic, such as employment income loss, housing instability, and mental health problems. The findings of this study highlight state-level contexts, particularly the role of state governments, in responding to pandemic-related food insecurity.","Park, Kim, Son","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.104003","20220928","Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; Disparity; Food assistance program; Food insecurity; Food market condition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38398,""
"Exploration of the Role of Relationships and Virtual Learning on Academic Performance and Mental Health","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused medical schools to rapidly transition to online/distance learning. Online learning is often associated with poorÃ‚Â academic performance, mental health, and student-to-faculty relationships.Ã‚Â The purpose of this study is to determine if correlations exist between academic performance, mental health, study location, and student/faculty relationships among medical students. Methodology First-year medical students received a survey asking them to reflect on their study location, mental health, and student/faculty relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second- and third-year medical students received a similar survey asking them to reflect on their experiences from the perspective of their first year of medical school (pre-pandemic). The first five exam scores were gathered for all participants. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between all variables. Results Academic performance was found to be positively correlated with both mental health (R = 0.215, p = 0.016) and relationships among students (R = 0.0259, p = 0.004), while negatively correlated with the percentage of time spent studying at home (R = -0.185, p = 0.039). Mental health was additionally found to be positively correlated with relationships to faculty (R = 0.230, p = 0.01) and relationships to students (R = 0.245, p = 0.006). Conclusions Academic performance and mental health are correlated with relationships and study location. These correlations may explain the negative outcomes associated with online learning in medical education.","Patel, Andersen, Leon, Lee, Simanton","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.28338","20220928","academic performance; covid-19; medical education; medical school curriculum; medical students; mental health; online learning; student relationships","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38399,""
"Functional and Clinical Characteristics of Individuals Attending Pulmonary Rehabilitation After Severe COVID-19","A proportion of patients with COVID-19 need hospitalization due to severe respiratory symptoms. We sought to analyze characteristics of survivors of severe COVID-19 subsequently admitted to in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation and identify their rehabilitation needs. From the COVID-19 Registry of Fondazione Don Gnocchi, we extracted 203 subjects admitted for in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation after severe COVID-19 from April 2020-September 2021. Specific information on acute-hospital stay and clinical and functional characteristics on admission to rehabilitation units were collected. During the acute phase of disease, 168 subjects received mechanical ventilation for 26 d; 85 experienced delirium during their stay in ICU. On admission to rehabilitation units, 20 subjects were still on mechanical ventilation; 57 had tracheostomy; 142 were on oxygen therapy; 49 were diagnosed critical illness neuropathy; 162 showed modified Barthel Index &lt; 75; only 51 were able to perform a 6-min walk test; 32 of 90 scored abnormal at Montreal Cognitive Assessment; 43 of 88 scored abnormal at Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; 65 scored Ã¢â€°Â¥ 2 at Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, and 95 showed dysphagia needing logopedic treatment. Our analysis shows that subjects admitted for in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation after severe COVID-19 represent an extraordinarily multifaceted and clinically complex patient population who need customized, comprehensive rehabilitation programs carried out by teams with different professional skills. The need for step-down facilities, such as sub-intensive rehabilitation units, is also highlighted.","Gigliotti, Campagnini, Arienti, Banfi, Mannini, Bianchi, Mancini, CalabrÃƒÂ², Pianigiani, Lanini, Romagnoli, Chellini, Binazzi, Ruggeri, Monteleone, Porta","https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.10128","20220927","COVID-19 survivors; functional dependency; multidisciplinary rehabilitation program; prolonged hospitalization; pulmonary rehabilitation; severe disability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38400,""
"COVID-19 pandemic fatigue and its sociodemographic and psycho-behavioral correlates: a population-based cross-sectional study in Hong Kong","Pandemic fatigue is a growing public health concern of the lingering COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its widespread mass media coverage, systematic empirical investigations are scarce. Under the Hong Kong Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project, we conducted online and telephone surveys amid the pandemic in February to March 2021 to assess self-reported pandemic fatigue (range 0-10) in Hong Kong adults (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4726) and its associations with sociodemographic and psycho-behavioral (high vs low to moderate) variables. Data were weighted by sex, age, and education of the general population. Binary logistic regression models yielded adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for high pandemic fatigue (scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°7) for sociodemographic and psycho-behavioral variables. 43.7% reported high pandemic fatigue. It was less common in older people (55-64Ã‚Â years: aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.82; 65Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°years: 0.33, 0.21-0.52) versus age group 18-24Ã‚Â years, but more common in those with tertiary education (1.36, 1.15-1.62) versus secondary or below. High pandemic fatigue was positively associated with depressive symptoms (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.55-2.17), anxiety symptoms (1.87, 1.58-2.20), loneliness (1.75, 1.32-2.31), personal fear of COVID-19 (2.61, 2.12-3.23), family fear of COVID-19 (2.03, 1.67-2.47), and current alcohol use (1.16, 1.00-1.33), but negatively associated with self-rated health (0.79, 0.68-0.92), personal happiness (0.63, 0.55-0.72), personal adversity coping capability (0.71, 0.63-0.81), family adversity coping capability (0.79, 0.69-0.90), family well-being (0.84, 0.73-0.97), family communication quality (0.86, 0.75-0.98), and frequent home exercise (0.82, 0.69-0.96; versus less frequent).

"The effect of lockdowns and distant learning on the health-related behaviours of school students in the United Arab Emirates","The COVID-19 pandemic began to affect the world in early 2020. As a preventive measure, schools in the UAE adopted remote learning. This study aimed to assess the effects of the lockdown and remote learning on the health-related behaviours of school students in the UAE. A cross-sectional study using an online survey comprising 33 questions related to physical activity, eating, sleeping and screen time was answered by the students' parents. Chi-square tests, paired Student's t tests and frequency tables were used for analysis. A total of 27,754 responses were received: 46.3% of the parents indicated a significant decrease in physical activity; 44.6% indicated an increase in unhealthy snack consumption; and 51.9% indicated decreased food ordering from restaurants. The percentage of students who slept more than 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours and those who slept less than 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours increased. Screen time increased significantly for both educational and entertainment purposes (P value &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). The study showed changes in the lifestyle and health-related behaviours of school students as indicated by their parents. Risk factors such as a lack of physical activity, increased food consumption, sleeping and screen time were directly affected. Therefore, it is important to further investigate these changes and their effects to help design targeted health education programs and promotion campaigns.","Sajwani, Qawas, Al Ali, Sajwani, Alrustamani, Al Maamari, Al Mazrouei, Al Shehhi, Al Rand, Fikri","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-022-01856-y","20220927","COVID-19; Children behaviour; Health related habits; Physical activity; School Students; Screen time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38402,""
"The human toll and humanitarian crisis of the Russia-Ukraine war: the first 162 days","We examined the human toll and subsequent humanitarian crisis resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on 24 February 2022. We extracted and analysed data resulting from Russian military attacks on Ukrainians between 24 February and 4 August 2022. The data tracked direct deaths and injuries, damage to healthcare infrastructure and the impact on health, the destruction of residences, infrastructure, communication systems, and utility services - all of which disrupted the lives of Ukrainians. As of 4 August 2022, 5552 civilians were killed outright and 8513 injured in Ukraine as a result of Russian attacks. Local officials estimate as many as 24Ã¢â‚¬â€°328 people were also killed in mass atrocities, with Mariupol being the largest (n=22Ã¢â‚¬â€°000) such example. Aside from wide swaths of homes, schools, roads, and bridges destroyed, hospitals and health facilities from 21 cities across Ukraine came under attack. The disruption to water, gas, electricity, and internet services also extended to affect supplies of medications and other supplies owing to destroyed facilities or production that ceased due to the war. The data also show that Ukraine saw an increase in cases of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and Coronavirus (COVID-19). The 2022 Russia-Ukraine War not only resulted in deaths and injuries but also impacted the lives and safety of Ukrainians through destruction of healthcare facilities and disrupted delivery of healthcare and supplies. The war is an ongoing humanitarian crisis given the continuing destruction of infrastructure and services that directly impact the well-being of human lives. The devastation, trauma and human cost of war will impact generations of Ukrainians to come.","Haque, Naeem, Wang, Espinoza, Holovanova, Gutor, Bazyka, Galindo, Sharma, Kaidashev, Chumachenko, Linnikov, Annan, Lubinda, Korol, Bazyka, Zhyvotovska, Zimenkovsky, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2022-009550","20220927","Child health; Epidemiology; Health systems; Mental Health &amp; Psychiatry; Public Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38403,""
"Advancing virtual primary care for people with opioid use disorder (VPC OUD): a mixed-methods study protocol","The emergence of COVID-19 introduced a dual public health emergency in British Columbia, which was already in the fourth year of its opioid-related overdose crisis. The public health response to COVID-19 must explicitly consider the unique needs of, and impacts on, communities experiencing marginalisation including people with opioid use disorder (PWOUD). The broad move to virtual forms of primary care, for example, may result in changes to healthcare access, delivery of opioid agonist therapies or fluctuations in co-occurring health problems that are prevalent in this population. The goal of this mixed-methods study is to characterise changes to primary care access and patient outcomes following the rapid introduction of virtual care for PWOUD. We will use a fully integrated mixed-methods design comprised of three components: (a) qualitative interviews with family physicians and PWOUD to document experiences with delivering and accessing virtual visits, respectively; (b) quantitative analysis of linked, population-based administrative data to describe the uptake of virtual care, its impact on access to services and downstream outcomes for PWOUD; and (c) facilitated deliberative dialogues to co-create educational resources for family physicians, PWOUD and policymakers that promote equitable access to high-quality virtual primary care for this population. Approval for this study has been granted by Research Ethics British Columbia. We will convene PWOUD and family physicians for deliberative dialogues to co-create educational materials and policy recommendations based on our findings. We will also disseminate findings via traditional academic outputs such as conferences and peer-reviewed publications.","Hedden, McCracken, Spencer, Narayan, Gooderham, Bach, Boyd, Chakanyuka, Hayashi, Klimas, Law, McGrail, Nosyk, Peterson, Sutherland, Ti, Yung, Cameron, Fernandez, Giesler, Strydom","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-067608","20220927","COVID-19; PRIMARY CARE; Substance misuse; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38404,""
"The Impact of Traumatic Stress, Resilience, and Threats to Core Values on Nurses During a Pandemic","The aim of this study was to understand the traumatic stress and resilience of nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19. Studies have shown a high proportion of healthcare workers are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder after a pandemic. Resilience factors are believed to play an important role in the well-being of healthcare professionals. This was a triangulated mixed methods study; a phenomenological qualitative approach with survey data was used to triangulate the findings, and sensemaking was used as the theoretical framework. Four themes emerged from the study: 1) phases of traumatic stress response to perceived threats; 2) honoring their sacrifice; 3) professional self-identity; and 4) sustaining resilience in a stressful work environment. Quantitative results on traumatic stress, general resilience, and moral resilience supported the themes. The findings will help leaders understand the potential for postpandemic mental health problems and the role of resilience in maintaining well-being.","Swavely, Romig, Weissinger, Holtz, Alderfer, Lynn, Adil, Rushton","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNA.0000000000001194","20220927","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38405,""
"Association of SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity With Myalgic Encephalomyelitis and/or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Among Children and Adolescents in Germany","During the COVID-19 pandemic, a reduction in quality of life and physical and mental health among children and adolescents has been reported that may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or containment measures. To assess the association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with symptoms that may be related to myalgic encephalomyelitis and/or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) among children and adolescents. This substudy of the cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys in Germany (SARS-CoV-2 KIDS) was performed in 9 pediatric hospitals from May 1 to October 31, 2021. Pediatric patients were recruited during an inpatient or outpatient visit regardless of the purpose of the visit. Parental questionnaires and serum samples were collected during clinically indicated blood draws. The parental questionnaire on demographic and clinical information was extended by items according to the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, a pediatric screening tool for ME/CFS in epidemiological studies in patients aged 5 to 17 years. Seropositivity was determined by SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Key symptoms of ME/CFS were evaluated separately or as clustered ME/CFS symptoms according to the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, including fatigue. Among 634 participants (294 male [46.4%] and 340 female [53.6%]; median age, 11.5 [IQR, 8-14] years), 198 (31.2%) reported clustered ME/CFS symptoms, including 40 of 100 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive (40.0%) and 158 of 534 SARS-CoV-2-seronegative (29.6%) children and adolescents. After adjustment for sex, age group, and preexisting disease, the risk ratio for reporting clustered ME/CFS symptoms decreased from 1.35 (95% CI, 1.03-1.78) to 1.18 (95% CI, 0.90-1.53) and for substantial fatigue from 2.45 (95% CI, 1.24-4.84) to 2.08 (95% CI, 1.05-4.13). Confinement to children and adolescents with unknown previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°610) yielded lower adjusted risks for all symptoms except joint pain ME/CFS-related symptoms. The adjusted risk ratio was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.80-1.46) for reporting clustered ME/CFS symptoms and 1.43 (95% CI, 0.63-3.23) for fatigue. These findings suggest that the risk of ME/CFS in children and adolescents owing to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be very small. Recall bias may contribute to risk estimates of long COVID-19 symptoms in children. Extensive lockdowns must be considered as an alternative explanation for complex unspecific symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sorg, Becht, Jank, Armann, von Both, Hufnagel, Lander, Liese, Niehues, Verjans, Wetzke, Stojanov, Behrends, Drosten, Schroten, von Kries","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.33454","20220928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38406,""

"Practitioners' Perspectives on Barriers and Benefits of Telemental Health Services: The Unique Impact of COVID-19 on Resettled US Refugees and Asylees","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated sequelae have disproportionately exacerbated refugee mental health due to health disparities, poverty, and unique risk factors. In response to the pandemic, most mental health providers have shifted to virtual platforms. Given the high need for services in this population, it is essential to understand the effectiveness and potential barriers to serving refugees via telehealth. This study is one of the first to examine the extent that socio-cultural and structural barriers impact telemental health services received by resettled refugees during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also addresses the potential benefits of telemental health service delivery to refugees. We surveyed 85 providers serving refugee and non-refugee clients in the United States. Statistical analyses revealed that more significant socio-cultural and structural barriers, including access to technology, linguistic challenges, and privacy limitations, exist for refugees compared to non-refugee clients. Potential benefits of telemental health for refugees during the pandemic included fewer cancellations, fewer transportation concerns, and better access to childcare. These results highlight the need to address the disparity in telemental health service delivery to refugees to limit inequities for this population.","Weith, Fondacaro, Khin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-022-01025-6","20220927","COVID-19; Refugees; Social determinants of health; Telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38408,""
"Can bupropion treat COVID-19-induced brain fog? A case series","COVID-19-induced neurocognitive complications that include brain fog have affected a large portion of individuals who survived COVID-19. These symptoms can include inattention, mental fatigue, forgetfulness, amotivation, and distractibility. This can cause significant anxiety and depression, which may worsen disease progression. To date, there are no known specific treatments that target COVID-19-related brain fog. Here, two patients are presented that develop symptoms of brain fog that persisted after they recovered from an acute COVID-19 infection. Both had memory impairment, mental exhaustion, and inattention with associated depressed mood. They were given bupropion extended release and though varied with dosing and time to resolution, they recovered dramatically. The dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor is known to have effects on the brain that may treat symptoms of brain fog including blocking hippocampal cell loss, increased neural activity in the cingulate cortex, and decreasing proinflammatory cytokines. Bupropion may be a possible option for those suffering from this growing and debilitating post-COVID-19 complication.","Reinfeld","https://doi.org/10.1097/YIC.0000000000000436","20220927","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38409,""
"Long-term psychological profile of general population following COVID-19 outbreak: symptom trajectories and evolution of psychopathological network","COVID-19 has long-term impacts on public mental health, while few research studies incorporate multidimensional methods to thoroughly characterise the psychological profile of general population and little detailed guidance exists for mental health management during the pandemic. This research aims to capture long-term psychological profile of general population following COVID-19 by integrating trajectory modelling approaches, latent trajectory pattern identification and network analyses. Longitudinal data were collected from a nationwide sample of 18 804 adults in 12 months after COVID-19 outbreak in China. Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 and Insomnia Severity Index were used to measure depression, anxiety and insomnia, respectively. The unconditional and conditional latent growth curve models were fitted to investigate trajectories and long-term predictors for psychological symptoms. We employed latent growth mixture model to identify the major psychological symptom trajectory patterns, and ran sparse Gaussian graphical models with graphical lasso to explore the evolution of psychopathological network. At 12 months after COVID-19 outbreak, psychological symptoms generally alleviated, and five psychological symptom trajectories with different demographics were identified: normal stable (63.4%), mild stable (15.3%), mild-increase to decrease (11.7%), mild-decrease to increase (4.0%) and moderate/severe stable (5.5%). The finding indicated that there were still about 5% individuals showing consistently severe distress and approximately 16% following fluctuating psychological trajectories, who should be continuously monitored. For individuals with persistently severe trajectories and those with fluctuating trajectories, central or bridge symptoms in the network were mainly 'motor abnormality' and 'sad mood', respectively. Compared with initial peak and late COVID-19 phase, aftermath of initial peak might be a psychologically vulnerable period with highest network connectivity. The central and bridge symptoms for aftermath of initial peak ('appetite change' and 'trouble of relaxing') were totally different from those at other pandemic phases ('sad mood'). This research identified the overall growing trend, long-term predictors, trajectory classes and evolutionary pattern of psychopathological network of psychological symptoms in 12 months after COVID-19 outbreak. It provides a multidimensional long-term psychological profile of the general population after COVID-19 outbreak, and accentuates the essentiality of continuous psychological monitoring, as well as population- and time-specific psychological management after COVID-19. We believe our findings can offer reference for long-term psychological management after pandemics.","Lu, Shi, Que, Zheng, Wang, Liu, Huang, Shi, Bao, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796022000518","20220928","COVID-19; general population; long term; psychological profile; Adult; COVID-19; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38410,""
"Gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19: the long and the short of it","A large and growing number of patients have persistent gastrointestinal symptoms that they attribute to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, replicates within the gut and acute COVID-19 is associated with alteration of the gut microbiome. This article reviews recent observational data related to gastrointestinal symptoms in 'long COVID' and discusses pathophysiologic mechanisms that might explain persistent post-COVID gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms are present in half of the patients with acute COVID-19, persist 6 months after COVID-19 in 10-25% of patients, and are rated as the most bothersome symptom in 11% of all patients. These symptoms include heartburn, constipation, diarrhoea and abdominal pain and decline in prevalence with the passage of time. Long COVID gastrointestinal symptoms are associated with mental health symptoms (anxiety and depression) that predate COVID-19 and also with mental health symptoms that are concurrent, after recovery from COVID-19. The cause of long COVID gastrointestinal symptoms is unknown and hypotheses include the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself, which infects the gastrointestinal tract; COVID-19, which can be accompanied by gut microbiome changes, a profound systemic inflammatory response and critical illness; and/or effects of pandemic stress on gastrointestinal function and symptom perception, which may be unrelated to either SARS-CoV-2 or to COVID-19. New, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly reported after recovery from COVID-19.

A rapid review was conducted to provide a quick synthesis of the literature in English identified in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS), PubMed, and Scopus databases. A total of 68 articles qualified for the final analysis. The findings illustrated that health organisations were often guided by staffing ratios to estimate capacity to care, aimed to modify the scope of practice of providers, redeployed both internal and external staff to ICUs, created and adapted the Covid-19-specific staffing models, and implemented technological innovations to provide services to the unprecedented number of patients while protecting the physical and mental health of their staff. The insights of this research should be helpful for health leaders, HR Managers, and policymakers who have faced unprecedented challenges and tough decisions during this emergency. The findings could also inform beyond-Covid-19 ICU policies and guide future research.","Tursunbayeva, Di Lauro","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3569","20220927","Covid-19; health; management; planning; workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38412,""
"Suicide and Self-Harm in Youth Presenting to a US Rural Hospital During COVID-19","Rural-residing children in the United States experience higher suicide mortality than urban-residing children but are underrepresented in research. We examined changes in emergency department (ED) utilization and subsequent hospitalization for suicide or self-harm in a rural hospital after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic onset. This retrospective cohort study involved children aged 5 to 17 years visiting a rural, Northeastern hospital from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2021. We used autoregressive integrated moving average modeling, an interrupted time series analysis, to examine monthly changes after the pandemic onset (March 2020) in ED visits with a primary mental health diagnosis, number of mental health visits with a suicide or self-harm diagnosis, proportion of patients with suicide or self-harm admitted to hospital, and length of stay for suicide or self-harm. Prepandemic, there was an average of 20.6 visits per month for mental health conditions, with 23.3 visits per month postpandemic (P = .16). Monthly visits for suicide or self-harm were greater in the postpandemic (15.6 visits per month) versus prepandemic months (11.4 visits per month, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). In autoregressive integrated moving average modeling, pandemic onset related to an additional 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.31 to 1.36) primary mental health visits with suicide or self-harm diagnoses per month. Of these visits, there was an immediate, absolute increase of 39.6% (95% confidence interval: 26.0% to 53.1%) in the proportion resulting in admission; admission rates declined in subsequent months. Pandemic onset was not associated with significant changes in the number of visits for mental health conditions or length of stay. Pediatric ED visits for suicide or self-harm increased at a significant rate during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and a greater proportion resulted in hospitalization, highlighting the acute mental health needs of rural-residing children.","Arakelyan, Emond, Leyenaar","https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2022-006635","20220927","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38413,""
"Predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms, COVID-related functional impairment, and burnout among medical professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Physicians are particularly vulnerable to mental health symptoms during global stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such stressors can increase death anxiety, which is a vulnerability factor for psychological dysfunction. Thus, exposure to COVID-related death may play a unique role in physicians' mental health during the pandemic. This cross-sectional study collected self-reported data from 485 resident physicians and fellows. Participants reported mental health symptoms, including posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), burnout, and functional impairment due to the pandemic. Participants also reported death anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, cognitive accessibility of death-related thoughts (DTA), and workplace exposure to COVID-19. Death anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, DTA, and workplace COVID-19 exposure all independently predicted PTSS. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety and DTA interacted to predict PTSS, such that high levels of COVID-19 anxiety predicted higher PTSS, regardless of DTA level. Death anxiety and COVID-19 workplace exposure interacted to predict PTSS as well, such that death anxiety predicted PTSS only when COVID-19 exposure was high. Burnout was predicted by COVID-19 anxiety and workplace exposure, and COVID-related functional impairment was predicted by death anxiety and COVID anxiety. These findings demonstrate that death-related and COVID-related concerns, independently and in interaction with each other, play an important role in psychological distress among physicians.","Lockett, Fergerson, Pyszczynski, Greenberg","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2129082","20220927","Physician mental health; death anxiety; resident mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38414,""

We examined the associations of COVID-19 testing uptake with certain mental disorders, through a nationally representative cohort of adults in US post-secondary education (<i>N</i> = 65 360). Adults with test-confirmed COVID-19 were at significantly lower risk than those with unconfirmed COVID-19 for severe depression, severe anxiety, eating disorders, and suicidal ideation.

"Longitudinal comparisons of mental health, burnout and well-being in patient-facing, non-patient-facing healthcare professionals and non-healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the CoPE-HCP study","The COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect the mental health of healthcare professionals (HCPs), especially patient-facing HCPs. To longitudinally examine mental health in HCPs versus non-HCPs, and patient-facing HCPs versus non-patient-facing HCPs. Online surveys were distributed to a cohort at three phases (baseline, July to September 2020; phase 2, 6 weeks post-baseline; phase 3, 4 months post-baseline). Each survey contained validated assessments for depression, anxiety, insomnia, burnout and well-being. For each outcome, we conducted mixed-effects logistic regression models (adjusted for <i>a priori</i> confounders) comparing the risk in different groups at each phase. A total of 1574 HCPs and 147 non-HCPs completed the baseline survey. Although there were generally higher rates of various probable mental health issues among HCPs versus non-HCPs at each phase, there was no significant difference, except that HCPs had 2.5-fold increased risk of burnout at phase 2 (emotional exhaustion: odds ratio 2.50, 95% CI 1.15-5.46, <i>P</i> = 0.021), which increased at phase 3 (emotional exhaustion: odds ratio 3.32, 95% CI 1.40-7.87, <i>P</i> = 0.006; depersonalisation: odds ratio 3.29, 95% CI 1.12-9.71, <i>P</i> = 0.031).

"Associations Between Childhood Stressors, COVID-19-Related Anxiety, and Sleep Quality of Adults During the Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Israel","Studies point to a persistent effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quality and mental health, including anxiety. Exposure to stressors during childhood increases the susceptibility to anxiety in later life. Given the negative effects of anxiety on sleep quality, the present study aimed to examine the associations between various childhood stressors and poor sleep quality of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether these associations are mediated by COVID-19-related anxiety. A total of 586 participants aged 18-40 (mean age 27.53Ã‚Â± 6.48 years, 301 females) were recruited to take part in an online survey conducted in Israel between February 7 and 15, 2021, during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed questionnaires assessing retrospectively adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), childhood harshness (indexed separately by exposure to morbidity and mortality and low socioeconomic status, SES), and childhood unpredictability. COVID-19-related anxiety was assessed using two items. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and insomnia symptoms with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Participants were asked to complete the ISI concerning two time points: (a) retrospectively, before the COVID-19 outbreak, and (b) currently, during the pandemic. Path analysis indicated that poor sleep quality (PSQI) was directly and indirectly (through COVID-19-related anxiety) predicted by the number of ACEs and childhood morbidity-mortality exposure, directly predicted by childhood low SES, and indirectly predicted by childhood unpredictability. Insomnia symptoms increase (ISI) was indirectly predicted by the number of ACEs, childhood morbidity-mortality exposure, and childhood unpredictability. ACEs as well as harsh and unpredictable childhood environments are predictive of poorer sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19-related anxiety mediates the effects of childhood stressors (other than low SES) on sleep. These findings may have clinical implications relevant to stressful periods in general.","Haimov, Szepsenwol, Cohen","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S378271","20220928","childhood environments; harshness; sleep efficiency; stressful periods; unpredictability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38421,""
"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and HHV-8 from a large pericardial effusion in an HIV-positive patient with COVID-19 and clinically diagnosed Kaposi sarcoma: a case report","Pericardial effusion is a late manifestation of HIV more commonly observed in individuals with depressed CD4 counts. Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains to be one of the most frequently identified pathogens in the pericardial fluid among people living with HIV, less commonly described etiologies include SARS-CoV-2 that causes coronavirus disease and human herpesvirus-8 which is associated with Kaposi sarcoma. Isolation of more than one pathogen in normally sterile sites remains challenging and rare. We report the first documentation of both SARS-CoV-2 and HHV-8 in the pericardial fluid. We present the case of a young man in his 20s with a recent history of clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis who was admitted for progressive dyspnea and cough. He had multiple violaceous cutaneous lesions on the face, neck, and trunk and diffused lymphadenopathies. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. The patient was clinically diagnosed with pneumonia, Kaposi sarcoma, and HIV/AIDS. Empiric broad spectrum antimicrobial regimen was subsequently initiated. HIV with low CD4 count was confirmed during hospitalization. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion, in impending cardiac tamponade. Frond-like fibrin strands, extending to the parietal pericardium, were also observed. Pericardiostomy yielded hemorrhagic, exudative effusion with lymphocytic predominance. SARS-CoV-2 and HHV-8 were detected in the pericardial fluid, and bacterial, fungal, and tuberculous studies were negative. The patient had clinical improvement after pericardial drainage. However, despite our best clinical care, he developed a nosocomial infection leading to clinical deterioration and death. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and HHV-8 in the pericardial fluid is rare, and interpretation of their significance in clinical care is challenging.

In order to examine heterogeneity during the pandemic, the current study aimed to identify whether subgroups of adolescents could be distinguished based on their levels of perceived stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition, we examined which prepandemic factors predicted these trajectories. Adolescents were assessed before the pandemic (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°188, M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.49, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.81) and at three timepoints during the pandemic (i.e., eight, ten, and 15Ã‚Â months after the start of the pandemic in the Netherlands). Results showed no support for distinct trajectories of perceived stress, adolescents experienced stable moderate levels during the pandemic. In contrast, results showed three trajectories for depression and anxiety. The majority of adolescents reported stable low or moderate levels and one small subgroup reported high levels of depression and anxiety that decreased during the pandemic. Certain prepandemic factors predicted higher initial levels of stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety during the pandemic. To support adolescents with prepandemic vulnerabilities, strategies could be developed, for instance enhancing adolescents' social support.","van Loon, Creemers, Vogelaar, Saab, Miers, Westenberg, Asscher","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20344-y","20220928","Adolescent; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Humans; Pandemics; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38423,""

This rate was similar to the one of 15% reported prior to the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.6). Combined EPDS&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°12 or PPQÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°6 scores were observed in 20.7% of the mothers [95%CI: 14.8-0.28]. Maternal hypertension/preeclampsia (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007), emergency cesarean section (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03), and neonatal complications (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.008) were significantly associated with an EPDS&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°12 both in univariate and multivariate analysis (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10 [95%CI: 1.5-68.7], ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.09[95%CI: 1.2-14], ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.02[95%CI: 1.4-11.6], respectively).

"Maternal mental health and breastfeeding amidst the Covid-19 pandemic: cross-sectional study in Catalonia (Spain)","Covid-19 pandemic became an unexpected stressor for the entire population and, particularly, for pregnant women and lactating mothers. The alarming infectious risk together with the lockdown period could affect the emotional state of mothers-to-be, as well as breastfeeding rates, mother-baby bonding, or neonatal weight gain. The aim of this study is to describe the impact of this world health emergency in mother-baby pairs right after the first wave of Sars-Cov-2 pandemic (from March to May 2020). A prospective observational study was carried out in mother-child dyads from those women who gave birth between June and August 2020 in a tertiary hospital. 91 mother-baby pairs were initially enrolled and 56 of them completed the follow-up. The study design had two separate steps: i) Step one: A clinical interview plus three psychometric tests (EPDS: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, PBQ: Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire and STAI-S: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory); ii) Step two: mother-child dyads were followed using a round of three brief telephone interviews (conducted at the newborn's 7, 14 and 28Ã‚Â days of age) to accurately depict the newborn's outcome in the neonatal period. In terms of maternal mental health, 25% of the sample screens positively in the EPDS, requiring further evaluation to rule out depressive symptoms. STAI-state and PBQ detect no abnormalities in either anxiety levels or mother-child bonding in our sample, as 100% of the mothers score below the cut-off points in each test (34 and 26 respectively). When comparing feeding practices (breast/bottle feeding) in 2020 to those practices during pre-pandemic years (2017-2019), a significant increase in breastfeeding was found in pandemic times. All newborns in the sample showed an adequate weight gain during their first month of life. Women and newborns in our sample did not experience an increase in adverse outcomes in the neonatal period in terms of maternal mental health, breastfeeding rates, bonding and further neonatal development.","NicolÃƒÂ¡s-LÃƒÂ³pez, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-ÃƒÂlvarez, Sala de la ConcepciÃƒÂ³n, Giralt-LÃƒÂ³pez, Lorente, Velasco, Wichner, Ginovart","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-05036-9","20220928","Bonding; Breastfeeding; Covid-19; Maternal mental health; Breast Feeding; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lactation; Mental Health; Mothers; Pandemics; Pregnancy; SARS-CoV-2; Spain; Weight Gain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38427,""
"15Ã¢â‚¬Â¯year pandemic - Psychological burden over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: A nine-wave longitudinal community study","The dynamic COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with mental strain. However, most studies focused primarily on the beginning of the pandemic and rarely took into account the long-term course. The aim of this prospective-longitudinal study was to investigate levels and changes of pandemic-related fears, unspecific anxiety, depressive symptoms, and psychosocial-behavioral factors over the first 1.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years of the pandemic. We conducted a nine-wave longitudinal online-survey from March 2020 to October 2021 with a total of 8148 participants of the adult general population in Germany. Descriptive examination and multilevel analysis were carried out to assess psychological burden, risk-bearing and protective psychosocial-behavioral factors, and associations with sociodemographics and the pandemic's duration and severity over the course of the pandemic. Symptoms of mental strain fluctuated across the pandemic and displayed a relative maximum at the pandemic's early beginning and during the second and third COVID-19 waves. Most participants (approximately 67.4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%-82.1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) reported mild and transient symptoms, but a substantial portion (approximately 17.9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%-32.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) experienced pronounced mental health problems during the pandemic. Symptom severity was negatively associated with the duration of the pandemic and positively associated with the rate of new infections. The observational study design, non-probability-sampling methods, and online self-report assessments limit the generalizability of our results. The fluctuating course of psychological burden during the pandemic emphasizes the relevance of continuous monitoring during this challenging time. Particularly individuals with pronounced subclinical symptoms or manifesting mental disorders should be targeted with adequate prevention and early intervention programs.","Bendau, Asselmann, Plag, Petzold, StrÃƒÂ¶hle","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.105","20220926","Anxiety; Corona; Depression; Distress; Fear; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38428,""
"The association of mindfulness and psychological well-being among individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 in Jianghan District, Wuhan, China: A cross-sectional study","In the global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have commonly occurred among COVID-19 patients, whose experiences of infection and subsequent treatment might develop negative consequences on their mental well-being even after recovery. Despite the general recognition of efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing psychological distress among various populations, there were insufficient studies on the relationship between mindfulness and mental health among individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. The current study aims to identify the prevalence of common mental health challenges among recovered COVID-19 patients in Jianghan District, Wuhan, China and to explore the potential mechanism through which mindfulness alleviate depression and PTSD. A cross-sectional survey on mental health was conducted among a convenience sample of adults recovered from COVID-19 in Jianghan District, Wuhan, China. The study participants completed questionnaires under the assistance of trained investigators. The questionnaire included Chinese version of Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form (FFMQ-SF), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), Resilience Style Questionnaire (RSQ), Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to measure mindfulness, anxiety, resilience, PTSD, and depression respectively. Structural equation modeling was used to explore the relationship between mindfulness and mental health outcomes of this population. 1541 respondents (654 [42.4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%] men and 887 [57.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%] women) completed the questionnaire between June 10 and July 25, 2021, of whom 36.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% and 27.1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% had mild and severe levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively, and 15.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% was indicated with PTSD. The average score of mindfulness of the study participants was (3.100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.387), and that of resilience was (3.560Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.877). The structural equation model fit the data well, demonstrating that mindfulness was negatively associated with depressive symptoms directly (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.031, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.021) or indirectly through the mediation effect of resilience (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.019, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.009) and anxiety symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.208, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001), and was negatively associated with PTSD through the mediation effect of anxiety symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.142, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 commonly experienced psychological distress. Mindfulness is associated with alleviation of depressive and PTSD symptoms directly or indirectly.

"COVID-19 stressors and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a community sample of children and adolescents","The COVID-19 public health crisis has created abrupt and unparalleled disruptions to the daily lives of children and adolescents across the world, placing them at significant risk for developing symptoms of anxiety and depression. The current study used two data collection periods to determine which types of COVID-19-related stressors were associated with the greatest risk of anxiety and depression symptoms in a community sample of children and adolescents in the United States (U.S.) from May-August 2020 (T1) to February-April 2021 (T2). Seventy-nine youth (ages 10-17; MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.41, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.10; 54.4% female) completed a battery of online standardized questionnaires about COVID-19 stress and psychiatric symptoms at T1 and 56 of these also participated at T2. The majority of children and adolescents reported experiencing the COVID-19-related stressors in multiple domains including daily routines, interpersonal relationships, education, finances, and health. A substantial proportion of the sample reported clinical levels of depression and anxiety symptoms at both T1 and T2. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that, controlling for T1 anxiety and depression symptoms, T2 interpersonal stressors were significantly associated with elevated depression and anxiety scores at T2. The findings highlight the salience of social connection for children and adolescents, and may also underscore the risk associated with lockdown restrictions, social distancing, and school closures during the pandemic.","Watson, Coiro, Ciriegio, Dakkak, Jones, Reisman, Kujawa, Compas","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12598","20220926","COVID-19; adolescents; anxiety; children; depression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38430,""
"A non-randomized comparative study of olfactory and gustatory functions in children who recovered from COVID-19 (1-year follow-up)","The experimental group included 68 children over 6 years of age who had recovered from COVID-19. The control group included 22 children over 6 years of age who have never had COVID-19. Research methods included neurological examination, verification of cognitive status, examination by an otolaryngologist, and smell and taste assessment. The examination was performed 6-8 weeks after COVID-19 recovery and after 1 year in some patients. Children who recovered from COVID-19 had a reduction in their ability to smell compared to children who had never had COVID-19. The olfactory thresholds and taste identification scores after recovery from COVID-19 were identical, whether the parents had reported anosmia in their children during COVID-19 or not, and irrespective of hyperthermia level and the presence or absence of headache and hyperhidrosis during COVID-19. Analysis of correlation with neuropsychiatric symptoms showed no differences in the olfactory thresholds in children irrespective of the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (tics, tremors, enuresis, compulsive movements, seizures, speech disorders, attention deficit, and easy fatigability) both in general, and in particular among subjects performing or not any compulsive movements, and experiencing or not a combination of easy fatigability and daytime sleepiness. Evidence suggests that in children and adolescents, partial hyposmia is associated with depressive symptoms, varying in severity from low to high, but symptoms of depression were not caused by COVID-19 infection itself. Analysis in subgroups with different degrees of state and trait anxiety did not reveal any significant differences in the olfactory threshold. A re-examination of 21 children was performed after 1 year. An objective olfactometric examination showed that the sensitivity to odorants increased significantly. In 1 year, we compared the thresholds of smell in children who had COVID-19 and those who did not have this disease: olfactory sensitivity after COVID-19 in children is restored to normal values. Schulte correction test showed that none of 14 children with asthenic manifestations in the form of fluctuations or exhaustion when performing the test immediately after COVID-19 had these manifestations after 1 year. Thus, asthenization of cognitive activity was recorded within the next 1.5 months after suffering from COVID-19 but was absent after 1 year.","Namazova-Baranova, Karkashadze, Zelenkova, Vishneva, Kaytukova, Rusinova, Ustinova, Sergienko, Nesterova, Yatsyk, Kratko, Gubanova, Gankovskiy, Gogberashvili, Konstantinidi, Bushueva, Rykunova, Shirdanina, Sadilloeva, Sergeeva, Lamasova, Leonova, Pankova, Dubonosova","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.919061","20220928","COVID-19; children; cognitive functions; olfactometry; olfactory and gustatory functions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38431,""
"Coping with adverse childhood experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: Perceptions of mental health service providers","Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have been associated with long-term physical and mental health conditions, toxic stress levels, developing unstable interpersonal relationships, and substance use disorders due to unresolved childhood adversities. This study assessed the perspectives of mental health providers (MHPs) regarding their adult patients' coping with ACEs during COVID-19 in Houston, Texas. Specifically, we explored how individuals with ACEs are coping with the increased stresses of the pandemic, how MHPs may provide therapeutic support for individuals with ACEs during this pandemic, pandemic-related challenges of accessing and utilizing mental health services for individuals with ACEs, and the awareness and treatment of ACEs among MHPs. Ten in-depth semi-structured virtual interviews were conducted with licensed MHPs from November 2021 to April 2022 in Houston, Texas. Interviews were coded and analyzed for emerging themes through an inductive open coding approach to discover insights regarding coping with ACEs during COVID-19. Four key themes experienced by individuals with ACEs emerged from the MHP interviews: (1) Maladaptive emotional dissonance and coping outlets during the pandemic, (2) Difficulties with social connectedness and significance of social support, (3) Heightened daily life stressors and coping with the ongoing disruption of the pandemic, and (4) Changing interactions with the mental health system. Themes from this study highlighted that resilience, seeking treatment, and strong social support can help develop healthy coping strategies among individuals with ACEs. This study may help inform best clinical practices to develop interventions and policies regarding ACEs such as a resilience-promotion approach that targets all the socio-ecological levels. In addition, findings highlight the synergy of psychotherapeutic and pharmacological management <i>via</i> tele-health modalities, in helping individuals with ACEs continue receiving the care they deserve and need during a persistent pandemic and an uncertain future.","Choudhury, Yeh, Markham","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.975300","20220928","COVID-19; adverse childhood experience; mental health services; resilience; social connectedness; trauma-informed therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38432,""
"Fear of COVID-19 and secondary trauma: Moderating role of self-efficacy","COVID-19 has affected millions of people around the globe. People's mental health, especially those of nurses, has been primarily affected by the fear of this virus. More focus has been paid to vaccination and treatment of the virus, but less attestation has been given to addressing the mental health of people affected by the virus. Empirical studies show that different external factors are not easily manageable and controllable by the individual. This study preliminarily explores the connection between fear of COVID-19 and secondary traumatic stress in nurses. Further, it examines the moderating effects of occupational self-efficacy on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and secondary traumatic stress. Data for the study was collected from the nurses of six large hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. The final analysis was performed on 243 samples. Studies on COVID-19 suggest that increased occupational self-efficacy decreases fear and its impact. This study offers insights for managers to develop stress management programs and provide proper training and counseling sessions to the nurses to motivate them emotionally. Theoretically, this study broadens the understanding of the theory of emotions by using the pandemic as a stressor. Future studies may explore different roles of occupational self-efficacy and study its influential role in managing different kinds of emotions explained by the theory of emotions. Managers at the workplace could design different self-efficacy training for nurses to increase their self-motivation to fight different types of stress they face at the workplace.","Li, Abbas, Manthar, Hameed, Asad","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.838451","20220928","Smart PLS; fear of COVID-19; nurses; occupational self-efficacy; secondary trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38433,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 epidemic anxiety on college students' employment confidence and employment situation perception in China","The psychological problems and employment problems of college students have always been the focus of attention of all sectors of society. The COVID-19 epidemic has a great impact on the mental health and employment of Chinese college students. Under this background, this study discusses how epidemic anxiety affects the employment confidence and perception of employment situation of Chinese college students. Through the online questionnaire survey of 1,132 college students nationwide, and the ordinal logistic regression analysis of the survey data using Stata 16.0 software, the results show that: (1) Epidemic anxiety negatively affects Chinese college students' employment confidence and employment situation perception, and has a significant impact on employment confidence. The three control variables of employment guidance, older age and higher education have a significant positive impact on college students' employment confidence and employment situation perception. College students in the eastern region have stronger employment confidence and more optimistic employment situation perception. But the expected monthly salary is negatively correlated with employment confidence. (2) Male college students and Science and Engineering students' epidemic anxiety have a stronger negative impact on employment confidence and employment situation perception. (3) Employment guidance has a moderating effect on the relationship between epidemic anxiety, employment confidence and employment situation perception. Employment guidance can enhance college students' employment confidence and reduce their sense of employment crisis by alleviating epidemic anxiety. Combined with the research conclusions, it is proposed that the state and schools should pay attention to the psychological counseling of college students, strengthen the employment guidance of colleges and universities, vigorously support the development of small, medium-sized and micro enterprises, and improve the employment and entrepreneurship service system of college students, so as to promote the employment of college students.","Zheng, Wu, Zhao, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.980634","20220928","COVID-19; college student; employment; employment confidence; employment guidance; employment situation; epidemic anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38434,""
"Maintenance of Self-Care Activities During COVID-19 Lockdown in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes That Received a Comprehensive Care Program Training","In 2020, several countries established a global emergency state. Lockdowns restricted people's lifestyles and daily activities to prevent coronavirus spread. These measures hindered diabetes mellitus control and lifestyle changes. This study aims to evaluate if attending a multidisciplinary program before the pandemic helped maintain a good metabolic state, lifestyle modifications, and mental health in patients with diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 lockdown. Patients included in this study attended a multidisciplinary program, with &lt;5 years of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, without disabling complications, between 18-70 years old. The complete lockdown occurred from February 27, 2020, to May 31, 2020. The first patient (non-COVID) to return to the center for face-to-face consultation was in March 2021. Consultations in 2019 were face-to-face and changed to a virtual modality during 2020. We analyzed metabolic, lifestyle, mental health, and diabetes education parameters. A total of 133 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included with complete information in visits before and during the lockdown. Metabolic parameters and self-care measures (nutrition plan, foot evaluation, and self-glucose monitoring) evaluated on our patients had no change during the lockdown. We found a significant increase in the time patients spent sitting during the day (p&lt;0.05). Barriers to exercise increased during lockdown, being joint pain (3.8% to 12.0%, p&lt;0.01) and lack of time to exercise (4.5% to 7.5%, p=0.33) being the most common.

"Unraveling the effect of ambivalence over emotional expression on subjective wellbeing in Chinese college students in romantic relationships: A multiple mediation model","The sudden and unpredictable outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has severely threatened young adults' physical and mental health and damaged the quality of relationships. As a critical stage of development, their well-being is more vulnerable to adverse environments which may lead to profound negative long-life mental health status. The current study aimed to investigate the mediation effects of fear of intimacy and attachment avoidance in the association between ambivalence over emotional expression and subjective wellbeing. A sample of 555 Chinese college students who are currently involved in romantic relationships (Mean age = 19.69, SD age = 1.36, 52% females) completed anonymous questionnaires regarding ambivalence over emotional expression, fear of intimacy, attachment avoidance, and subjective wellbeing. The findings revealed that ambivalence over emotional expression can predict negative subjective wellbeing of college students in romantic relationships significantly, and fear of intimacy and attachment avoidance played a sequentially mediating role in the association between ambivalence over emotional expression and subjective wellbeing. Surprisingly, when considering attachment avoidance independently, we found it had an inhibitory action on the link between ambivalence over emotional expression and subjective wellbeing. The present study contributes to a better understanding of how ambivalence over emotional expression can decrease subjective wellbeing, and also has implications for the intervention of students' subjective wellbeing and closeness during the period of COVID-19.","Wang, Zheng, Wang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.982406","20220928","COVID-19; ambivalence over emotional expression; attachment avoidance; fear of intimacy; subjective wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38436,""
"The impact of the social isolation in elderly Brazilian mental health (anxiety and depression) during the COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of social isolation in the pandemic context on elderly Brazilian mental health is little known, especially about the occurrence of depressive symptoms. In this study, we evaluated elderly people undergoing social isolation in order to identify factors associated with depression and which of these are more important to characterize elderly Brazilians with depression. In a cross-sectional, exploratory, and analytical study of a quantitative nature, the mental profile of elderly individuals subjected to social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic period was used. A total of 450 participants was divided into normal and depressive groups, and a form covering sociodemographic data, opinions/perceptions about the pandemic, and a Reduced Geriatric Depression Scale was used to assess participants' mental health. To assess the statistical significance between the variables, chi-square test was applied, considering the <i>p</i>-value &lt;0.05. The effect size was analyzed to identify the magnitude of the difference between groups. To identify the most important characteristics to define the groups Multilayer Perceptron algorithm were applied. We found that elderly people with a depressive profile are (in Multilayer Perceptron rank order) (1) showing signs of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) of low education, (3) being divorced, (4) having more than one mental disorder, (5) reading, watching, or listening to information about COVID-19, and (6) being previously diagnosed with depression. In conclusion, elderly Brazilians in social isolation tend to develop depressive disorders during quarantine.

"Gut and oral microbiota associations with viral mitigation behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic","Imposition of social and health behavior mitigations are important control measures in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although postulated that these measures may impact the human microbiota including losses in diversity from heightened hygiene and social distancing measures, this hypothesis remains to be tested. Other impacts on the microbiota and host mental and physical health status associations from these measures are also not well-studied. Here we examine changes in stool and oral microbiota by analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequence taxonomic profiles from the same individuals during pre-pandemic (before March 2020) and early pandemic (May-November 2020) phases. During the early pandemic phase, individuals were also surveyed using questionnaires to report health histories, anxiety, depression, sleep and other lifestyle behaviors in a cohort of predominantly Caucasian adults (mean age = 61.5 years) with the majority reporting at least one underlying co-morbidity. We identified changes in microbiota (stool n = 288; oral n = 89) between pre-pandemic and early pandemic time points from the same subject and associated these differences with questionnaire responses using linear statistical models and hierarchical clustering of microbiota composition coupled to logistic regression. While a trend in loss of diversity was identified between pre-pandemic and early pandemic time points it was not statistically significant. Paired difference analyses between individuals identified fewer significant changes between pre-pandemic and early pandemic microbiota in those who reported fewer comorbidities. Cluster transition analyses of stool and saliva microbiota determined most individuals remained in the same cluster assignments from the pre-pandemic to early pandemic period. Individuals with microbiota that shifted in composition, causing them to depart a pre-pandemic cluster, reported more health issues and pandemic-associated worries. Collectively, our study identified that stool and saliva microbiota from the pre-pandemic to early pandemic periods largely exhibited ecological stability (especially stool microbiota) with most associations in loss of diversity or changes in composition related to more reported health issues and pandemic-associated worries. Longitudinal observational cohorts are necessary to monitor the microbiome in response to pandemics and changes in public health measures.","Li, MethÃƒÂ©, Fitch, Gentry, Kessinger, Patel, Petraglia, Swamy, Morris","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2022.966361","20220928","16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; COVID-19; ecological stability; gut microbiota; microbiome; saliva microbiota; Adult; COVID-19; Humans; Microbiota; Middle Aged; Pandemics; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38440,""
"Bibliometric analysis of the top-50 cited articles on COVID-19 and physical activity","Since the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia outbreak in late 2019, an endless stream of research has emerged surrounding physical activity. This study analyzes the 50 most influential articles on COVID-19 and physical activity over the past 2 years to describe the research landscape and hotspots from bibliometric citation analysis. The top-50 cited articles were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database, and bibliometric citation analysis was performed by Excel 2019 and VOSviewer software. The top-50 articles were cited 160.48 Ã‚Â± 106.90 (range: 70-587). Most of the articles were from the United States (14), followed by Italy (11) and England (9). The <i>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</i> (<i>n</i> = 10) is the journal with the top-50 cited articles. The collaboration between authors was mainly among three teams, including Smith L, Musumeci G, and Napoli C. The hotspot of research around COVID-19 and physical activity focused on lifestyle change (sedentary behavior, sitting time), mental health (depressive, anxiety, loneliness), the credibility of physical activity assessment tools (reliability, validity), and physical activity of different populations (gender, youth, children). Based on a bibliometric analysis of high-impact articles on COVID-19 and physical activity highlights physical activity as an essential lifestyle change and developments and hotspots in this field.

"Depression and anxiety of medical students at Kunming Medical University during COVID-19: A cross-sectional survey","An isolation strategy was used to control the transmission and rapid spread of COVID-19 in Yunnan. As a result, students were supposed to stay at home and disrupted their outside activities. It led to a detrimental influence on students' mental health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of depression and anxiety among medical students and to provide ideas for the prevention of depression and anxiety in medical students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2,116 medical students at Kunming Medical University from July 8 to July 16, 2020. Participants' demographic and living conditions were collected. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and General Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to detect risk factors associated with depression and anxiety. The prevalence rates of depression and anxiety among medical students were 52.5 and 29.6%, respectively. Depression was more likely to be caused by low grades, lack of physical exercise, drug use, irregular diet, extensive screen time on mobile phones, being greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and inadaptability to offline courses. Anxiety was more likely to be caused by lack of physical exercise, drug use, irregular diet, and inadaptability to offline courses. Depression and anxiety are highly comorbid. Our study showed predictive factors for depression and anxiety and identified a major mental health burden on medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak. More targeted measures should be taken to improve the mental state of students to reduce the incidence of depression and anxiety.","Guo, Li, Zhang, Xuan, He, Ye, Ma, Peng, Xiong, Yang, Yu, Xie, Shao, Yuan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.957597","20220928","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; medical students; mental health; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; COVID-19; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Students, Medical; Universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38442,""
"Anxiety, depression, stress, worry about COVID-19 and fear of loneliness during COVID-19 lockdown in Peru: A network analysis approach","This study aims to examine the relationships between symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, worry about COVID-19 and fear of loneliness during COVID-19 lockdown in Peru using network analysis. There were 854 participants aged 18 to 50 years (Mean = 36.54; <i>SD</i> = 9.23); 634 females (74.20%) and 220 males (25.80%), who completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Preoccupation with COVID-19 Contagion (PRE-COVID-19), Brief Scale of Fear of Loneliness (BSFL). A partial unregularized network was estimated through the <i>ggmModSelect</i> function. Expected influence (EI) and bridging EI values were calculated to identify central symptoms and bridging symptoms respectively. The results reveal those two symptoms of depression-stress and anxiety-were the most central symptoms in the network. Depressive symptoms are at the same time the most comorbid and it is shown that there are no differences in the network when compared between those who left home and those who did not leave home during lockdown. Depressive symptoms are concluded to be central and bridging in the network and interconnected with some symptoms of stress and anxiety. These findings may be important to understand the experience of COVID-19 lockdown in Peru.","Ventura-LeÃƒÂ³n, LÃƒÂ³pez-Jurado, Porturas, LeÃƒÂ³n-Mostacero, Canchanya-Balbin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.946697","20220928","COVID-19 lockdown; clinical disorders; fear of loneliness; network analysis; worry about COVID-19; Anxiety; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Depression; Depressive Disorder, Major; Fear; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Peru","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38443,""
"Factors associated with anxiety symptoms among medical laboratory professionals in Khobar: Single institution study","A clinical professional has a challenging role during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in providing timely and accurate results with limited resources and a rapid increase in the number of samples to be tested. However, during the ongoing pandemic, the anxiety level of Medical Laboratory Professionals (MLT) has not been studied in Saudi Arabia within the hospital environment. To determine the associated factors related with anxiety level of MLT at King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study design was a cross-sectional quantitative study. Data were collected by administering a paper-based questionnaire that was distributed among MLT at KFHU. The questionnaire consisted of three sections. The first two sections were prepared by the researchers and included participant demographics and questions related to COVID-19. The third section used the Hamilton Anxiety Scale to assess anxiety levels. The study revealed that 70.4% of MLT showed no signs of anxiety, while 19.2% showed mild/moderate anxiety levels, and approximately 10.4% showed severe to extreme anxiety levels. In addition, a significant association between the anxiety level and difficulty breathing among MLT wearing personal protective equipment was observed. Moreover, a significant association between sex and anxiety level was identified. Females MLT had higher percentages of severe anxiety (12.8% vs. 5.1%) and mild/moderate anxiety (24.4 vs. 7.7%) than males. Protecting the mental health status of MLT is an essential part of public health measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","Althumairi, Ayed AlOtaibi, Alumran, Alrayes, Owaidah","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.917619","20220928","COVID-19; PPE; anxiety level; laboratory; mental status; pandemic; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38444,""
"Perceived access to general and mental healthcare in primary care in Colombia during COVID-19: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact both in general and mental healthcare, challenged the health systems worldwide, and affected their capacity to deliver essential health services. We aimed to describe perceived changes in ease of access to general and mental healthcare among patients with a diagnosis of depression and/or unhealthy alcohol use in Colombia. This study is embedded in the DIADA project, a multicenter implementation research study aimed at evaluating the integration of mental healthcare in primary care in Colombia. Between November 2020 and August 2021, we conducted a COVID-19 pandemic impact assessment in a cohort of participants with newly diagnosed depression and/or unhealthy alcohol use part of DIADA project. We assessed the ease of access and factors related to perceived ease of access to general or mental healthcare, during the COVID-19 pandemic. 836 participants completed the COVID-19 pandemic impact assessment. About 30% of participants considered their mental health to be worse during the pandemic and 84.3% perceived access to general healthcare to be worse during the pandemic. Most of participants (85.8%) were unable to assess access to mental health services, but a significant proportion considered it to be worse. Experiencing worse ease of access to general healthcare was more frequent among women, patients with diagnosis of depression, and patients with comorbidities. Experiencing worse ease of access to mental healthcare was more frequent among patients aged between 30 and 49.9 years, from socioeconomic status between 4 and 6, affiliated to the contributive social security regime, attending urban study sites, and those who perceived their mental health was worse during the pandemic. Despite the overall perception of worse mental health during the pandemic, the use of mental healthcare was low compared to general healthcare. Ease of access was perceived to be worse compared to pre-pandemic. Ease of access and access were affected by geographical study site, socioeconomic status, age and gender. Our findings highlight the need for improved communication between patients and institutions, tailored strategies to adapt the healthcare provision to patients' characteristics, and continued efforts to strengthen the role of mental healthcare provision in primary care.","GÃƒÂ³mez-Restrepo, Cepeda, Torrey, Suarez-Obando, Uribe-Restrepo, Park, Acosta, Camblor, Castro, Aguilera-Cruz, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Chaparro, GÃƒÂ³mez-Gamez, Bell, Marsch","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.896318","20220928","COVID-19; depression; healthcare access; mental health; mental healthcare; primary health care; unhealthy alcohol use; Adult; COVID-19; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Primary Health Care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38445,""
"Analyzing the changing relationship between personal consumption and suicide mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, using governmental and personal consumption transaction databases","During the early stages of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, suicides did not increase in most countries/regions. Japan, however, was an exception to this, reporting increased numbers of female suicides with no changes in male suicide. To explore the trends of increasing suicides, the fluctuations of personal consumption (as an indicator of lifestyle) and standardized suicide death rate (SDR) disaggregated by age, sex, and prefecture, were determined using a linear mixed-effect model. Additionally, fixed effects of personal consumption on SDR during the pandemic were also analyzed using hierarchical linear regression models with robust standard errors. During the first wave of the pandemic, SDR for both sexes decreased slightly but increased during the second half of 2020. SDR of females younger than 70 years old and males younger than 40 years old continued to increase throughout 2021, whereas SDR for other ages of both sexes did not increase. Personal consumption expenditures on out-of-home recreations (travel agencies, pubs, and hotels) and internet/mobile communication expenses decreased, but expenditures on home-based recreations (contents distribution) increased during the pandemic. Increased expenditures on internet/mobile communication were related to increasing SDR of both sexes. Increasing expenditures on content distributions were related to increasing females' SDR without affecting that of males. Decreasing expenditures on pubs were related to increasing SDR of both sexes in the non-metropolitan region. These findings suggest that transformed individual lifestyles, extended time at home with a decreased outing for contact with others, contributed to the progression of isolation as a risk of suicide. Unexpectedly, increasing compensatory contact with others using internet/mobile communication enhanced isolation resulting in increased suicide risk.","Matsumoto, Kawano, Motomura, Shiroyama, Okada","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.982341","20220928","COVID-19; Japan; lifestyle; personal consumption; suicide; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Internet; Japan; Male; Pandemics; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38446,""
"Mental health and psychosocial support concerns among frontline workers within the Eastern and Southern Africa COVID-19 response","We carried out a mental health assessment survey of frontline workers in Eastern and Southern Africa regarding COVID-19 pandemic in the region. A total of 723 people responded to the anonymous survey which was available in English, French and Portuguese. Two thirds of respondents felt overwhelmed and the remaining one third expressed fear of the pandemic. Concern about self and oneÃ‚Â´s wellbeing was associated with the feeling of being supported by oneÃ‚Â´s supervisor. Frontline workers that acknowledged supervisor support also expressed a significantly better wellbeing than others that did not receive supportive supervision. It is important to strengthen supervisorsÃ‚Â´ capacity for psychological support to their subordinates. It is also necessary to emphasise the importance of giving attention to staff mental health concerns. Supervisors should provide information on referral opportunities and encourage their staff to take advantage of them when in need of specialised services. While frontline workers have been celebrated worldwide for their efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, reports also indicate that some of them are exposed to stigma, discrimination and even violence within their communities, at workplace and surroundings.

"Digital competency of Psychologists in Aotearoa New Zealand: A cross-sectional survey","The increasing implementation of digital health into psychological practice is transforming mental health services. Limited clinical resources and the high demand for psychological services, alongside the restrictions imposed on services during the global COVID-19 pandemic, have been a catalyst for significant changes in the way psychologists work. Ensuring Psychologists have the skills and competence to use these tools in practice is essential to safe and ethical practice. This study aimed to explore the digital competence of psychologists working in Aotearoa New Zealand and their use of digital tools in the practice. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with Aotearoa New Zealand Registered Psychologists (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°195) between July and November 2021. Participants reported varying degrees of competence across the digital tasks presented, with participants most commonly reporting moderate to high competence for engaging in remote supervision <i>via</i> digital means (86%) and obtaining client's informed consent for digital work (82%). In contrast, tasks that participants most reported not being moderately or highly competent in included working with interpreters remotely and evaluating the effectiveness and security of smartphone apps. Motivations to use digital technologies included meeting client preferences and needs, necessity for continuity of care, and the benefits of increased accessibility and reach. In contrast, the barriers to using digital technologies included client characteristics or preference, clinical factors, clinician preferences and skills, and workplace or technical issues or concerns. The majority (91.1%) were potentially interested in further training in this area. The current study offers insights into the digital competencies of a workforce that has required rapid incorporation of technologies into professional practice over recent years. This snapshot of the digital skills of psychologists demonstrates a large variation in digital competence. In the current context, developing digital competencies seems a fundamental requirement for psychologists to work in ways that appropriately and safely deliver client-centred care.","Dobson, Variava, Douglas, Reynolds","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2022.951366","20220928","digital health; professional standards for psychological service; psychology; skills &amp; competencies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38448,""

Event-based surveillance was active at the beginning of 2021 and in week 32. However, there was inadequate sample collection to investigate acute watery diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and acute jaundice syndrome alerts. Respondents in all cadres had substantial experience working in IDSR/EWARN. All respondents performed the various IDSR/EWARN tasks and duties as expected, but needed more resources and training. while IDSR/EWARN is performing relatively well, confirmation of priority diseases by the laboratories needs to be strengthened. Health facilities need more regular supervision from the higher levels. Community health workers need more training on IDSR/EWARN.

We hypothesized to investigate the effect of sleep and eating behavior also got affected during unlock imposed due to the second wave. The data collection was done by using an online google form by making them available to participants through various social media apps via smartphone. Total participants (n=115) mean age was 25.86Ã‚Â±9.52 (MeanÃ‚Â±SD). The results were analyzed by using RM One-Way ANOVA, Pearson correlation test by using SPSS 26. We found that the sleep behavior including time to sleep which was delayed by 46min, time to wake up was 58min, and sleep duration was increased by 6min during the unlock days when compared with weekdays before unlock. The eating behavior during unlock including the time of breakfast, lunch, and dinner was delayed by 1-hour 3min, 23min, and 19min, respectively. The social jetlag was reduced by 6min and eating jetlag was increased by approximately 8.4min. We found a strong positive correlation between eating jetlag and social jetlag during unlock (r=0.262, <i>p</i>&lt;0.005).

"Geriatric Health Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Managing the Health Crisis","COVID-19 pandemic significantly threatens the health and well-being of older adults. Aging-related changes, including multimorbidity, weakened immunity and frailty, may make older people more susceptible to severe infection and place them at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Various quarantine measures have been implemented to control the spread of COVID-19. Nevertheless, such social distancing has disrupted routine health care practices, such as accessibility of medical services and long-term continuous care services. The medical management of older adults with multimorbidity is significantly afflicted by COVID-19. Older persons with frailty or multiple chronic disease may poorly adapt to the altered health care system, having detrimental consequences on their physical and mental health. COVID-19 pandemic has posed great challenges to the health of older adults. We highlighted the difficulties and obstacles of older adults during this unprecedented time. Also, we provided potential strategies and recommendations for actions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic threats. Certain strategies like community primary health care, medication delivery and home care support are adopted by many health facilities and caregivers, whereas other services such as internet hospital and virtual medical care are promoted to be accessible in many regions. However, guidelines and policies based on high-quality data are still needed for better health promotion of older groups with increasing resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhu, Liu, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S376519","20220928","COVID-19; chronic diseases; health care promotion; older adults; primary health care; telemedicine; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Frailty; Health Facilities; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38452,""
"Does COVID-19 related symptomatology indicate a transdiagnostic neuropsychiatric disorder? - Multidisciplinary implications","The clinical presentation that emerges from the extensive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mental health literature suggests high correlations among many conventional psychiatric diagnoses. Arguments against the use of multiple comorbidities for a single patient have been published long before the pandemic. Concurrently, diagnostic recommendations for use of transdiagnostic considerations for improved treatment have been also published in recent years. In this review, we pose the question of whether a transdiagnostic mental health disease, including psychiatric and neuropsychiatric symptomology, has emerged since the onset of the pandemic. There are many attempts to identify a syndrome related to the pandemic, but none of the validated scales is able to capture the entire psychiatric and neuropsychiatric clinical presentation in infected and non-infected individuals. These scales also only marginally touch the issue of etiology and prevalence. We suggest a working hypothesis termed Complex Stress Reaction Syndrome (CSRS) representing a global psychiatric reaction to the pandemic situation in the general population (Type A) and a neuropsychiatric reaction in infected individuals (Type B) which relates to neurocognitive and psychiatric features which are part (excluding systemic and metabolic dysfunctions) of the syndrome termed in the literature as long COVID. We base our propositions on multidisciplinary scientific data regarding mental health during the global pandemic situation and the effects of viral infection reviewed from Google Scholar and PubMed between February 1, 2022 and March 10, 2022.

"Fear of COVID-19 and emotional dysfunction problems: Intrusive, avoidance and hyperarousal stress as key mediators","There is mounting empirical evidence of the detrimental effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on mental health. Previous research has underscored the effects of similar destabilizing situations such as war, natural disasters or other pandemics on acute stress levels which have been shown to exacerbate current and future psychopathological symptoms. To explore the role of acute stress responses (intrusive, avoidance and hyperarousal) as mediators in the association between fear of COVID-19 and emotional dysfunction-related problems: Depression, agoraphobia, panic, obsessive-compulsive, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and health anxiety symptoms. A sample of 439 participants from a university community in Spain (age: mean Ã‚Â± SD: 36.64 Ã‚Â± 13.37; 73.1% females) completed several measures assessing their fear of COVID-19, acute stress responses and emotional dysfunction syndromes through an online survey. Data collection was carried out from the start of home confinement in Spain until May 4, 2020, coinciding with initial de-escalation measures. Processing of the dataset included descriptive and frequency analyses, Mann-Whitney U Test of intergroup comparisons and path analysis for direct and indirect effects. This is an observational, descriptive-correlational and cross-sectional study. The prevalence of clinical symptoms in our sample, reported since the beginning of the pandemic, reached 31.44%. The female group presented higher scores although the effect size was small. Overall, the participants who exceeded the clinical cut-off points in emotional problems showed higher levels of fear of COVID-19 and of cognitive, motor and psychophysiological responses of acute stress, unlike the group with normative scores. In addition, the results show significant mediated effects of hyperarousal stress among fear of COVID-19 and emotional dysfunction psychopathology. However, the clinical syndromes most related to the consequences of the pandemic (<i>e.g.</i>, social contact avoidance or frequent hand washing), such as agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, were in fact predicted directly by fear of COVID-19 and/or the acute stress response associated with the pandemic and had a greater predictive power. The present study illustrates a clearer picture of the role of acute stress on several forms of psychopathology during the COVID-19 crisis and home confinement.","FalcÃƒÂ³, Vidal-Arenas, Ortet-Walker, Marzo, Piqueras","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v12.i8.1088","20220928","Acute stress; Emotional dysfunction; Fear of COVID-19; Mediated effects; Psychophysiological activation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38454,""
"Cross-sectional survey following a longitudinal study on mental health and insomnia of people with sporadic COVID-19","In the post-pandemic era, the emergence of sporadic cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the scale of the pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, the impact of sporadic cases of COVID-19 and isolation measures on mental health and sleep in different groups of people need to be analyzed. To clarify the severity of psychological problems and insomnia of staff and community residents around a hospital with sporadic cases of COVID-19, and their relationship with quarantine location and long-term changes. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on community residents and medical staff. Many of these medical staff had been subjected to different places of quarantine. Community residents did not experience quarantine. Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), acute stress disorder scale (ASDS) and insomnia severity index (ISI) were used to evaluate anxiety and depression, acute stress disorder symptoms, and the severity of insomnia. Additionally, we conducted a 1-year follow-up study on medical staff, with related scales measurement immediately after and one year after the 2-wk quarantine period. We included 406 medical staff and 226 community residents. The total scores of ISI and subscale in HADS of community residents were significantly higher than that of medical staff. Further analysis of medical staff who experienced quarantine showed that 134 were quarantined in hotels, 70 in hospitals and 48 at home. Among all subjects, the proportions of HADS, ASDS and ISI scores above normal cutoff value were 51.94%, 19.17% and 31.11%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that subjects with higher total ASDS scores had a greater risk to develop anxiety and depression. The total ISI score for medical staff in hotel quarantine was significantly higher than those in home quarantine. Total 199 doctors and nurses who completed the 1-year follow-up study. Compared with baseline, HADS and ASDS scores decreased significantly one year after the end of quarantine, while ISI scores did not change significantly. Sporadic COVID-19 cases had a greater psychological impact on residents in surrounding communities, mainly manifested as insomnia and depressive symptoms. Hotel quarantine aggravated the severity of insomnia in medical staff, whose symptoms lasted Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1 year.","Li, Guo, Xie, Bao, Si, Li, Xiong, Li, Li, Lu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v12.i8.1076","20220928","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Insomnia; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38455,""
"Motivation to train during a pandemic: The role of fitness resources, mental health, and motivational profiles among student-athletes in team sports","The sporting season across post-secondary institutions was canceled in March 2020 due to COVID-19, and student-athletes had to maintain their training at home. It is unclear what personal and contextual factors facilitated student-athletes' ability to maintain their training routines at home when social distancing and lockdown (SD/L) policies were put in place. Our cross-sectional study of 433 student-athletes examined (a) how athletes adapted their training, (b) what training barriers they experienced, (c) whether motivational profiles were associated with differences in training behaviors and mental health, and (d) what variables predicted athletes' motivation to train during this prolonged offseason. Student-athletes across Canada were recruited to complete an online survey between August and September 2020. Results showed that athletes significantly reduced their training load and intensity, with approximately 25% exercising two or fewer days a week. Barriers to training included limited access to fitness resources and equipment, having inconsistent training schedules, and experiencing emotional distractions, with some of these barriers more common among female athletes than male athletes. For motivation profiles, athletes with higher levels of intrinsic motivation tended to maintain the intensity of their workouts and experienced lower mood disturbance. A hierarchical multiple regression revealed that being male, being younger, having higher levels of intrinsic and introjected motivation, having access to fitness resources, maintaining a steady training schedule, having fewer emotional distractions, and lower mood disturbance were significant predictors to being motivated to train during the pandemic. We discuss strategies coaches and trainers can implement to best support their student-athletes.","Purc-Stephenson, Zimmerman, Edwards","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.954086","20220928","COVID-19; mental health; motivation; return to sport; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38456,""
"Exploring the Impact of The NEST Collaborative's Remote Social Intervention on Feelings of Depression and Isolation","Early evidence of remote, volunteer-led social support interventions to reduce social isolation in older adults has been encouraging; however, evaluation data on outcomes related to social isolation associated from these interventions is scarce. Here, we share programmatic details of a novel, statewide initiative, called the NEST Collaborative, rolled out to meet immediate emotional, informational, and instrumental needs of older adults in Nevada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evaluation included 31 older adults participating in weekly one-to-one empathy-based phone calls with multi-generational volunteers seeking to enhance participants' social networks through meaningful friendships. The calls were associated with programmatically meaningful, though not statistically significant, improvements in modified Hawthorne Friendship Scale and PHQ-2 Depression Scale scores over two waves of survey responses. These results suggest that social isolation and depression among older adults decreased among our sample over a period of increased isolation and mental health burden across the general population. With the potential for sustained impact in reducing social isolation over time, remote social support programs, such as the NEST Collaborative, may have persistent value long-term, beyond time-limited crisis response contexts.","Nolan, Friedman, Carson, Gibb, Acklin, Reed","https://doi.org/10.1177/23337214221125357","20220928","anxiety; cognitive impairment; depression; qualitative methodology; quantitative methodology; social determinants of health; volunteering","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38457,""
"Salivary cortisol in university students after the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic required people to navigate lockdowns and unfamiliar restrictions for the first time. It is known that situations characterised by uncontrollability and novelty heighten the physiological response to stress. The data presented here was collected as part of an experimental stress study and offered an opportunity to compare cortisol levels upon arrival to the lab before and after the first UK lockdown, when students had to navigate novel health and safety restrictions on campus. Participants (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 152) were students who took part in an experiment designed to measure salivary cortisol levels as a response to a stress task. All provided a baseline cortisol sample after arriving to the lab but before the experimental task. Pre-lockdown participants (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 72) were familiar with the campus rules whereas post-lockdown participants (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 80) had to adhere to novel restrictions, including health questionnaires, PPE and social distancing. The post-lockdown sample had significantly higher levels of baseline cortisol, cortisol output (AUCg) and cortisol response (AUCi) than the pre-lockdown group. This effect remained significant even after controlling for sample characteristics. These findings suggest that navigating new restrictions may lead to heightened levels of anticipatory stress even if there is no difference in recent general mental health before and after the lockdown.","Andelic, Allan, Bender, Theodossiou, Powell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpnec.2022.100160","20220928","COVID-19; Cortisol; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38458,""
"Remote Monitoring of COVID-19 Patients Using Multisensor Body Area Network Innovative System","As of late 2019, the COVID19 pandemic has been causing huge concern around the world. Such a pandemic posed serious threats to public safety, the well-being of healthcare workers, and the overall health of the population. If automation can be implemented in healthcare systems, patients could be better cared for and health industries could be less burdened. To combat such challenges, e-health requires apps and intelligent systems. Using WBAN sensors and networks, a doctor or medical professional can advise patients on the best course of action. Patients' fitness could be assessed using WBAN sensors without interfering with their daily activities. When designing a monitoring system, system performance reliability for competent healthcare is critical. Existing research has failed to create a large device capable of handling a large network or to improve WBAN topologies for fast transmitting and receiving patient data. As a result, in this research, we create a multisensor WBAN (MSWBAN) intelligent system for transmitting and receiving critical patient data. To gather information from all cluster nodes and send it to multisensor WBAN, a novel additive distance-threshold routing protocol (ADTRP) is proposed. In small networks where data are managed by the transmitting node and the best data route is determined, this protocol has less redundancy. An edge-cutting-based routing optimization (ES-EC-R ES-EC-RO) is used to find the best route. The Trouped blowfish MD5 (TB-MD5) algorithm is used to encrypt and decrypt data, and the encrypted data are stored in a cloud database for security. The performance metrics of our proposed model are compared to current techniques for the best results. End-to-end latency is 63Ã¢â‚¬â€°ms, packet delivery is 95%, security is 95.7%, and throughput is 9120Ã¢â‚¬â€°bps, according to the results. The purpose of this article is to encourage engineers and front-line workers to develop digital health systems for tracking and controlling virus outbreaks.","Al-Barazanchi, Hashim, Ahmed Alkahtani, Rasheed Abdulshaheed, Muwafaq Gheni, Murthy, Daghighi, Shawkat, Jaaz","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9879259","20220928","Algorithms; COVID-19; Computer Communication Networks; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Reproducibility of Results; Wireless Technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38459,""
"Workability and Life Satisfaction: Effects of Workers' Positive Perceptions on Their Return to Jobs","The death rate of workers due to industrial accidents in South Korea (3.61 persons in 2017) is higher than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average (2.43) and the fifth highest among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries. Although the pandemic of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has changed, the socioeconomic aspects of Korean society, the number of Koreans suffering accidents and the number of deaths in 2020 have increased. It is necessary to take measures to prevent accidents and make comprehensive efforts to return to work. This study proposes research questions about the effect of workers' positive perception on whether to work after accidents and the impact of the experience of rehabilitation services on the return to work. This research performed a panel logistic regression analysis using data on workers' compensation insurance in Korea for two years (2018-2019). This research finds that workers' positive perceptions of workability and life satisfaction contributed affirmatively to their re-employment. Several factors related to employment (e.g., work period, the number of job qualifications) also positively affect their return to work. However, the experience of rehabilitation services did not have a significant effect on re-employment. The variables of their health conditions (e.g., disability grade, feelings of health problems, age) negatively influenced their return to jobs. These results suggest the importance of workers' mental recovery and the need to innovate rehabilitation services for their employment. Positive thinking and self-rehabilitation could be critical for workers, parallel with social welfare policies.","Kang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2022.05.002","20220928","Industrial management; Mental health; Policy analysis; Psychological recovery; Safety management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38460,""

"Resilience of primal world beliefs to the initial shock of the COVID-19 pandemic","People hold general beliefs about the world called primals (e.g., the world is Safe, Intentional), which are strongly linked to individual differences in personality, behavior and mental health. How such beliefs form or change across the lifespan is largely unknown, although theory suggests that beliefs become more negative after disruptive events. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to test whether dramatic world changes and personal adversity affect beliefs. In a longitudinal, quasi-experimental, pre-registered design, 529 US participants (51% female, 76% White) provided ratings of primals before and several months after pandemic onset, and information about personal adversity (e.g., losing family, financial hardship). Data was compared to 398 participants without experience of the pandemic. The average person in our sample showed no change in 23 of the 26 primals, including Safe, in response to the early pandemic, and only saw the world as slightly less Alive, Interactive, and Acceptable. Higher adversity, however, was associated with slight declines in some beliefs. One limitation is that participants were exclusively American. Primals were remarkably stable during the initial shock wrought by a once-in-a-century pandemic, supporting a view of primals as stable lenses through which people interpret the world.","Ludwig, Crone, Clifton, Rebele, Schor, Platt","https://doi.org/10.1111/jopy.12780","20220926","COVID-19 pandemic; adversity; belief updating; primal world beliefs; trauma; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38462,""
"Comparison of Quality Performance Measures for Patients Receiving In-Person vs Telemedicine Primary Care in a Large Integrated Health System","Despite its rapid adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unknown how telemedicine augmentation of in-person office visits has affected quality of patient care. To examine whether quality of care among patients exposed to telemedicine differs from patients with only in-person office-based care. In this retrospective cohort study, standardized quality measures were compared between patients with office-only (in-person) visits vs telemedicine visits from March 1, 2020, to November 30, 2021, across more than 200 outpatient care sites in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Patients completing telemedicine (video) visits. Ãâ€¡2 tests determined statistically significant differences in Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality performance measures between office-only and telemedicine-exposed groups. Multivariable logistic regression controlled for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities. The study included 526Ã¢â‚¬Â¯874 patients (409Ã¢â‚¬Â¯732 office-only; 117Ã¢â‚¬Â¯142 telemedicine exposed) with a comparable distribution of sex (196Ã¢â‚¬Â¯285 [49.7%] and 74Ã¢â‚¬Â¯878 [63.9%] women), predominance of non-Hispanic (348Ã¢â‚¬Â¯127 [85.0%] and 105Ã¢â‚¬Â¯408 [90.0%]) and White individuals (334Ã¢â‚¬Â¯215 [81.6%] and 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯586 [85.9%]), aged 18 to 65 years (239Ã¢â‚¬Â¯938 [58.6%] and 91Ã¢â‚¬Â¯100 [77.8%]), with low overall health risk scores (373Ã¢â‚¬Â¯176 [91.1%] and 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯076 [85.4%]) and commercial (227Ã¢â‚¬Â¯259 [55.5%] and 81Ã¢â‚¬Â¯552 [69.6%]) or Medicare or Medicaid (176Ã¢â‚¬Â¯671 [43.1%] and 52Ã¢â‚¬Â¯513 [44.8%]) insurance. For medication-based measures, patients with office-only visits had better performance, but only 3 of 5 measures had significant differences: patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) receiving antiplatelets (absolute percentage difference [APD], 6.71%; 95% CI, 5.45%-7.98%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), patients with CVD receiving statins (APD, 1.79%; 95% CI, 0.88%-2.71%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and avoiding antibiotics for patients with upper respiratory infections (APD, 2.05%; 95% CI, 1.17%-2.96%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001); there were insignificant differences for patients with heart failure receiving ÃŽÂ²-blockers and those with diabetes receiving statins. For all 4 testing-based measures, patients with telemedicine exposure had significantly better performance differences: patients with CVD with lipid panels (APD, 7.04%; 95% CI, 5.95%-8.10%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), patients with diabetes with hemoglobin A1c testing (APD, 5.14%; 95% CI, 4.25%-6.01%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), patients with diabetes with nephropathy testing (APD, 9.28%; 95% CI, 8.22%-10.32%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and blood pressure control (APD, 3.55%; 95% CI, 3.25%-3.85%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001); this was also true for all 7 counseling-based measures: cervical cancer screening (APD, 12.33%; 95% CI, 11.80%-12.85%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), breast cancer screening (APD, 16.90%; 95% CI, 16.07%-17.71%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), colon cancer screening (APD, 8.20%; 95% CI, 7.65%-8.75%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), tobacco counseling and intervention (APD, 12.67%; 95% CI, 11.84%-13.50%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), influenza vaccination (APD, 9.76%; 95% CI, 9.47%-10.05%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), pneumococcal vaccination (APD, 5.41%; 95% CI, 4.85%-6.00%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and depression screening (APD, 4.85%; 95% CI, 4.66%-5.04%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In this cohort study of patients with telemedicine exposure, there was a largely favorable association with quality of primary care. This supports telemedicine's value potential for augmenting care capacity, especially in chronic disease management and preventive care. This study also identifies a need for understanding relationships between the optimal blend of telemedicine and in-office care.","Baughman, Jabbarpour, Westfall, Jetty, Zain, Baughman, Pollak, Waheed","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.33267","20220928","Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; COVID-19; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Diabetes Mellitus; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Lipids; Male; Medicare; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Telemedicine; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38463,""

"Self-compassion predicted joint trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A five-wave longitudinal study on Chinese college students","The long-term protective effect of self-compassion on mental health remained unclear in the pandemic context. This study aimed to investigate the trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms and the role of self-compassion during the pandemic. In this one-year five-wave longitudinal study (retested every three months from February 2020 to February 2021), 494 Chinese college students completed the study through online questionnaires and provided information on depression and anxiety symptoms, self-compassion, and sociodemographic variables. Independent and joint trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms were explored by growth mixture models. Predictive effects of self-compassion on trajectories were examined by logistic regression models. Four and three heterogeneous latent trajectories were identified for depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Three distinct joint trajectories of depression and anxiety were determined: low symptoms group (54.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), mild symptoms group (34.4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), and risk group (13.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%). Participants with higher levels of self-compassion were more likely to follow the low symptoms trajectory of depression and anxiety symptoms (all pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Group heterogeneity existed in the trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms. Improving the levels of self-compassion would help to prevent and alleviate depression and anxiety symptoms.

The change detected was greater when measured by the SOM (<i>p</i>&lt;.0001). Changes in optimism were correlated with concurrent changes in perceived stress, positive affect, and negative affect.<b>Conclusion:</b> Our results suggest that the SOM has a greater sensitivity to detect within-person changes in optimism than the LOT-R and highlight the SOM's utility for longitudinal studies assessing changes in optimism.","Hoeppner, Millstein, Siegel, Carlon, Harnedy, Chung, Huffman, Hoeppner","https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2022.2126472","20220926","COVID-19 pandemic; Optimism; measurement; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38467,""
"Gene Therapy Cargos Based on Viral Vector Delivery","Viral vectors have proven useful in a broad spectrum of gene therapy applications due to their possibility to accommodate foreign genetic material for both local and systemic delivery. The wide range of viral vectors has enabled gene therapy applications for both acute and chronic diseases. Cancer gene therapy has been addressed by delivery of viral vectors expressing anti-tumor, toxic, and suicide genes for destruction of tumors. Delivery if immunostimulatory genes such as cytokines and chemokines has also been applied for cancer therapy. Moreover, oncolytic viruses specifically replicating in and killing tumor cells have been used as such for tumor eradication or in combination with tumor killing or immunostimulatory genes. In a broad meaning, vaccines against infectious diseases and various cancers can be considered as gene therapy, which has been highly successful not the least for development of effective COVID-19 vaccines. Viral vector-based gene therapy has also demonstrated encouraging and promising results for chronic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), muscular dystrophy, and hemophilia. Preclinical gene therapy studies in animal models have demonstrated proof-of-concept for a wide range of disease indications. Clinical evaluation of drugs and vaccines in humans has showed high safety levels, good tolerance, and therapeutic efficacy. Several gene therapy drugs such as the adenovirus-based drug GendicineÃ‚Â® for non-small-cell lung cancer, the reovirus-based drug ReolysinÃ‚Â® for ovarian cancer, lentivirus-based treatment of SCID-X1 disease, and the rhabdovirus-based vaccine Ervebo against Ebola virus disease, and adenovirus-based vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed.","Lundstrom","https://doi.org/10.2174/1566523222666220921112753","20220926","Viral vectors; approved drugs/vaccines.; cancer therapy; clinical trials; gene therapy; preclinical studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38468,""
"Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Type 1 Diabetes Management: A Qualitative Study","The purpose of this study was to understand impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on pediatric type 1 diabetes management. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 parents of children (age 6-12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) with type 1 diabetes. Parents responded to 8 open-ended questions about their experiences managing their children's type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. All interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using qualitative thematic methods. Parents reported both positive and negative aspects of managing their children's type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Facilitators of diabetes management included spending more time together at home and enhanced convenience of telehealth appointments and online supply ordering. Parents also described difficulties managing their children's type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic, including a lack of structure in their child's daily routine, which led to increases in sedentary behavior. Furthermore, they reported psychosocial challenges of type 1 diabetes management, which were exacerbated by the pandemic. While the COVID-19 pandemic was described as having overall positive impacts on pediatric type 1 diabetes management, efforts to support parents in increasing children's physical activity and reducing screen time are needed, along with readily accessible mental health resources for both parents and their children with type 1 diabetes.","Ferguson, Moore, Kaidbey, Khattak, Saeed, Cogen, Streisand, Sylvetsky","https://doi.org/10.1177/26350106221125701","20220926","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38469,""
"Characteristics of House-Tree-Person Drawing Test in Junior High School Students with Depressive Symptoms","This study aims to explore the drawing characteristics of the house-tree-person drawing test (HTP) in junior high school students with depressive symptoms. A total of 167 junior high school students were recruited and completed HTP and questionnaires. 12 drawing characteristics of HTP were extracted and compared to explore the potential drawing characteristics of depressive symptoms. Among 12 drawing characteristics, eight drawing characteristics appeared more frequently in the depressed group (CES-D Ã¢â€°Â¥ 20) than in the non-depressed group (CES-D &lt; 20), while one drawing characteristic appeared with a lower frequency. Further, controlling for the risk perception of COVID-19, seven drawing characteristics, not suggestive of movement, lacking details, blackening the paper, drawing in an only dark color, drawing a detailed crown, hands behind the back, and omitting expression, emerged as predictors of depressive symptoms (CES-D Ã¢â€°Â¥ 20) in junior high school students. Seven drawing characteristics of HTP are significantly associated with depressive symptoms in junior high school students. HTP is insightful for early screening for junior high school students with depressive symptoms.","Guo, Yu, Wang, Qin, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045221129706","20220926","Depressive symptom; Drawing characteristic; House-Tree-Person drawing test; Junior high school student; Quantitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38470,""
"Psychological distress and anxiety in Arab refugees and migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with various psychological stressors due to health-related, social, economic, and individual consequences, especially for minority groups such as refugees and other migrants who live in unstable conditions and have lost their social support groups. The aim of this study was to explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on this specific population in Germany.This study used a mixed-method approach. A total of 85 migrants took part in an online survey in Germany from April to July 2020. The questionnaire included demographic information and measures of psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as risk and protective factors for psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with 10 refugees were conducted between May and June 2020. In our sample, 54.5% expressed fear of being infected with COVID-19. Participants spent several hours per day thinking about COVID-19 (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>=</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.13 hours). Psychological and social determinants of mental health showed stronger associations with anxiety regarding COVID-19 than experiences with the disease. Interviews showed that especially for refugees with limited information regarding access to medical treatment, the pandemic increased already-existing psychological symptoms and worries about their families back home and reminded them of their flight from their home country to Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with psychological distress, anxiety, and depression in refugees and migrants in Germany. Information on where to get medical treatment, if needed, is of utmost importance to this population group, in addition to other strategies such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and social contacts, and acceptance of strategies to cope with anxiety and negative emotions.","Jumaa, Bendau, StrÃƒÂ¶hle, Heinz, Betzler, Petzold","https://doi.org/10.1177/13634615221122536","20220926","SARS-CoV-2 mental health; inequity; psychological health; public mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38471,""
"Multidisciplinary care of patients with narcolepsy during COVID-19 pandemic in Italy via televisit: the TElemedicine for NARcolepsy (TENAR) feasibility study","Narcolepsy is a rare chronic central disorder of hypersomnolence with frequent endocrine-metabolic comorbidities. To address the complex care needs of patients during the COVID-19 emergency, we carried out a feasibility study of the TElemedicine for NARcolepsy (TENAR) protocol with the aim of assessing the feasibility of a multidisciplinary care approach via televisit for patients with narcolepsy. A feasibility single open arm study on the multidisciplinary care of children (&gt;7 y.o.) and adults with narcolepsy who required a follow-up visit was realized during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency period in Italy. The study included a sleep, metabolic, and psychosocial assessment via televisit at baseline, at 6, and at 12 months from the study inclusion period (15 th May - 26 th June 2020). Thirty-nine out of 44 eligible patients (89%) entered the study (30 adults, nine children); 37 patients (95%) ended the 12-month follow-up. At baseline, the median Epworth sleepiness scale score (ESS) was 10 (IQR 8-14), and the median body mass index (BMI) was 25.6 (IQR 22.1-30.9). During the follow-up period, the ESS score decreased from the 6th month onward (p=0.003), and BMI decreased at the 1-year follow-up (p=0.047), while there were no differences in depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life, compliance with treatment, adverse drug reactions, or accidents. High response and retention rates, stability of ESS and lack of side effects indicate that telemedicine is a feasible and safe approach for adults and children with narcolepsy.","Pizza, Vignatelli, Oriolo, Zenesini, Mangiaruga, Rossetti, Moresco, Vandi, Citeroni, Pagotto, Ingravallo, Plazzi","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac228","20220925","care; management; narcolepsy; quality of life; sleepiness; telemedicine; televisit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38472,""
"Queers in quarantine: Young LGBTQ+ people's experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden","The COVID-19 pandemic led to major restrictions of everyday life activities. This worsened the social situation of many people, and marginalized groups have been especially affected. This article explores how LGBTQ+ young adults in Sweden have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent recommendations and restrictions. Fifteen participants between 20-29Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, who self-identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+), were interviewed about their experiences. A thematic analysis of the data showed that the participants perceived their psychological wellbeing to have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Several reported symptoms of clinical depression, as well as anxiety, worry, rumination, and a heightened sensitivity to stress. Stressors included fear of the disease itself, and fear of spreading the virus, as well as the negative consequences of adhering to the recommendations of social distancing, which constantly interplayed with the marginalized position of being a young LGBTQ+ person. Most participants experienced a decrease in minority stress in face-to-face interaction with social distancing measures in place, but an increase in minority stress online. Those who faced minority stress at home experienced the isolation as particularly stressful. Limited access to the LGBTQ+ community was a common stressor. For transgender participants, the effects on transgender healthcare, such as prolonged waiting times for gender dysphoria assessment and hormone treatment, were a major challenge. Our results have added valuable knowledge to research indicating how vulnerable young adults were highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.","Malmquist, Bredenberg, Melin, Wurm, Tasker, Gato","https://doi.org/10.1111/sjop.12871","20220925","COVID-19; LGBTQ+; minority stress; pandemic restrictions; social distance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38473,""
"Responding to Ontario's Overdose Crisis in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the overdose crisis in Canada. Using data from ICES and the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario, the authors characterized changing patterns of medication use and health services utilization during the pandemic. This analysis suggests that responses to the overdose crisis must confront the rapidly changing unregulated drug supply with a tailored response that addresses varied population needs, expands accessible treatment and harm reduction services and responds to the missed opportunities for engagement and support within various healthcare settings.","Gomes, Kitchen, Campbell, Murray, Leece, Kolla","https://doi.org/10.12927/hcq.2022.26896","20220928","COVID-19; Drug Overdose; Humans; Ontario; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38474,""

"Effectiveness of Case Management with Problem-Solving Therapy for Rural Older Adults with Depression","Objective To evaluate the effect of case management with problem solving therapy (CM-PST) on depression and disability among rural older adults and compare its effect with outcomes derived from a previous, but similar study among 84 urban older adults. Methods This study examined the comparative effectiveness of a CM-PST intervention for older adults with depression and unmet needs across rural and urban settings. Participants received 12 one-hour sessions of CM-PST with a master's-level clinician. A total of 56 rural and 84 urban adults aged 60 and older experiencing mild to moderate depression received services in their homes. Results The rural CM-PST intervention resulted in significantly reduced depression (reduction of 13.9 points, 95% CI 12.2 to 15.7, t(422)= 15.35, p<0.0001) and disability by week 12 (reduction of 6.7 points, 95% CI 4.8 to 8.5, t(425)= 7.01, p<0.0001). Reductions in depression and disability were sustained through week 24. The reductions in depression (F=3.98 df=4,388. p=0.0035) and disability (F=2.71, df=4,381, p=0.03) found in the rural sample were comparable to, or better than, those found in the urban sample. Improvements in unmet need and resilience predicted lower depression scores at 12 weeks, while improvements in unmet need and hopelessness predicted improvements in disability. No moderators of depression were identified, but baseline values of self-efficacy, resilience, and hopelessness moderated disability. Conclusions CM-PST was as effective at reducing depression and disability among rural older adults as it was for urban older adults. Home-delivered CM-PST can be successfully adapted to meet the specific needs of rural seniors using resources often available in rural communities.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.03.001","20221001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-29","",38476,""
