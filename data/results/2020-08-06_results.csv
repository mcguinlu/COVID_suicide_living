"A contextual-behavioral perspective on chronic pain during the COVID-19 pandemic and future times of mandated physical distancing","For people who struggle with chronic pain, the COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges in treatment accessibility and may heighten pre-existing anxiety related to their health condition  Likewise, many mental health providers are struggling to adapt to a new way of caring for these individuals  The current paper aims to provide evidence of the ways in which COVID-19 is impacting people with pain and to offer a contextual-behavioral perspective on treatment of patients with chronic pain during the current pandemic and any future periods of mandated physical distancing  Past research shows that adolescents and adults with chronic pain struggle with loneliness and social isolation, which emphasizes the importance of remaining connected with these patients while they are remaining at home  Further, many individuals with chronic pain have physical and mental health comorbidities that may increase the risk of COVID-19 infection and/or morbidity and mortality  Specific functional-contextual and biopsychosocial concepts common in multidisciplinary treatment of chronic pain can be usefully incorporated into a telehealth model of ACT treatment for pain  These include the use of pandemic-related metaphors, modeling acceptance of technical glitches that occur during telehealth sessions, and mindfully observing facial expressions on the computer screen when the patient is in pain  Moreover, powerful experiential exercises that make use of pandemic-related themes (e g , wearing a mask, washing hands) are described  While barriers to the widespread implementation of ACT-consistent telehealth exist, connecting with patients in new and creative ways will be essential as the field moves forward","Rhodes, Amanda; Martin, Staci; Guarna, Joel; Vowles, Kevin; Allen, Taryn","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.009","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science;17:152-158, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science;17:152-158, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-06","",3681,""

"Evaluation of drugs for potential repurposing against COVID-19 using a tier-based scoring system","BACKGROUND: As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic grows daily, we remain with no prophylactic and only minimal therapeutic interventions to prevent or ameliorate severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Prior to SARS-CoV-2 emergence, high throughput screens utilizing clinically developed drugs identified compounds with in vitro inhibitory effect on human coronaviruses that may have potential for repurposing as treatment options for COVID-19. However, caution should be applied to repurposing of these drugs when they are taken out of context of human pharmacokinetic parameters associated with normal therapeutic use. METHODS: Our aim was to provide a tier-based scoring system to interrogate this data set and match each drug with its human pharmacokinetic criteria, such as route of administration, therapeutic plasma levels and half-life, tissue distribution, and safety. RESULTS: Our analysis excluded most previously identified drugs but identified members of 4 drug classes (antimalarial amino-quinolones, selective estrogen receptor modulators; SERMs, low potency tricyclic antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants) as potential drug candidates for COVID-19. Two of them, the tricyclic antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants were further excluded based on a high adverse event profile. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our findings using a new pharmacokinetic-based scoring system supports efficacy testing of only a minority of candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jarvis, Michael A; Hansen, Frederick A; Rosenke, Kyle; Haddock, Elaine; Rollinson, Christopher; Rule, Simon; Sewell, Graham; Hughes, Andrew; Feldmann, Heinz","https://dx.doi.org/10.3851/IMP3368","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Antivir Ther;2020 Aug 03.; Publication details: Antivir Ther;2020 Aug 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-06","",3686,""
"Comparing eating behaviours, and symptoms of depression and anxiety between Spain and Greece during the COVID-19 outbreak: Cross-sectional analysis of two different confinement strategies","We compared eating behaviours, and depressive and anxiety symptoms in two countries with different confinement strictness strategies and different levels of COVID-19 pandemic. A web-based cross-sectional survey was administered during and shortly after the COVID-19 related lockdown in Spain and Greece. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify country differences associated with eating behaviour, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. This study included 1,002 responders in Spain and 839 in Greece. The meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD of restraint, emotional and external eating was 2.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.79, 2.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.81 and 2.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.65 in Spain, whereas 2.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.85, 2.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.99 and 2.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.74 in Greece. Spanish participants had lower average scores of restraint and external eating compared to Greek participants (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), but no difference was seen for emotional eating. In Spain, 13.6%, and 12.3% of the survey respondents reported moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, whereas in Greece the respective values were 18.8 and 13.2%. After adjusting for several risk factors, a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms was observed in Spain compared to Greece (p = .001), but no difference was seen for depressive symptoms. This study demonstrated high scores of inappropriate eating behaviours and a high frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms in two Mediterranean countries during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings revealed that compared to Greek participants, Spanish participants, that faced more severe COVID-19 pandemic and stricter lockdown measures, were associated with lower restraint and external eating and increased anxiety symptoms, but not with depressive symptoms or emotional eating.","Papandreou, Arija, Aretouli, Tsilidis, BullÃƒÂ³","https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2772","20200805","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; eating behaviour","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-06","",3687,""

"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Planetary Health A Critical Review of Epidemiology, Prevention, Clinical Characteristics and Treatments for Oral, Head and Neck Health Professionals Do We Have a Roadmap?","<b>Introduction</b> Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is potentially the greatest global public health crisis of this century. This disease emerged as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei province in China, in December 2019. Otolaryngologists, head and neck surgeons and dentists are at an increased risk of occupational disease. <b>Objective</b> Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The present review summarizes currently published evidence of Covid-19 epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment and prevention. No proven effective treatments for this disease currently exist. <b>Data Synthesis</b> Ã¢â‚¬Æ’COVID-19 started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, and it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person transmission was also occurring. Symptoms are varied, and not all patients develop all of them. <b>Conclusion</b> Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Social distancing seems to have been successful in several places in the world. However, this recommendation alone is not enough to contain the disease, and it is not a long-term solution. Large-scale testing by health professionals of representative samples of the population may give an estimate of the progression of the disease. Different treatments are under test and bring hope of a cure to the population. However, no current treatments (April 27, 2020) have been proven to be the key to success in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Planetary health is a useful concept to understand the current drivers of this pandemic and to draw a roadmap for science and healthcare that may guide actions to fight economic depression and ensure a healthy recovery.","Jotz, Stein, Sirena, Barros, Baldisserotto, Figueiredo, Lavinsky, Steier, Dora","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1714143","20200805","COVID-19; clinical characteristics; epidemiology; planetary health; prevention; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-06","",3689,""
"The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Health Professionals: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic had a massive impact on health care systems, increasing the risks of psychological distress in health professionals. This study aims at assessing the prevalence of burnout and psychopathological conditions in health professionals working in a health institution in the Northern Italy, and to identify socio-demographic, work-related and psychological predictors of burnout. <b>Methods:</b> Health professionals working in the hospitals of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano were asked to participate to an online anonymous survey investigating socio-demographic data, COVID-19 emergency-related work and psychological factors, state anxiety, psychological distress, post-traumatic symptoms and burnout. Predictors of the three components of burnout were assessed using elastic net regression models. <b>Results:</b> Three hundred and thirty health professionals participated to the online survey. Two hundred and thirty-five health professionals (71.2%) had scores of state anxiety above the clinical cutoff, 88 (26.8%) had clinical levels of depression, 103 (31.3%) of anxiety, 113 (34.3%) of stress, 121 (36.7%) of post-traumatic stress. Regarding burnout, 107 (35.7%) had moderate and 105 (31.9%) severe levels of emotional exhaustion; 46 (14.0%) had moderate and 40 (12.1%) severe levels of depersonalization; 132 (40.1%) had moderate and 113 (34.3%) severe levels of reduced personal accomplishment. Predictors of all the three components of burnout were work hours, psychological comorbidities, fear of infection and perceived support by friends. Predictors of both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were female gender, being a nurse, working in the hospital, being in contact with COVID-19 patients. Reduced personal accomplishment was also predicted by age. <b>Conclusions:</b> Health professionals had high levels of burnout and psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 emergency. Monitoring and timely treatment of these conditions is needed.","Giusti, Pedroli, D'Aniello, Stramba Badiale, Pietrabissa, Manna, Stramba Badiale, Riva, Castelnuovo, Molinari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01684","20200805","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; clinical psychology; cross-sectional study; depression; post-traumatic stress; predictors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-06","",3690,""

"The Effect of Social Support on Mental Health in Chinese Adolescents During the Outbreak of COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak impacts physical and mental health. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between the levels of social support and mental health among Chinese adolescents during the outbreak. A total of 7,202 adolescents aged 14-18 years completed online survceys from March 8 to 15, 2020, in China. Researchers assessed the associations between depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety symptoms (Chinese version of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and social support (Social Support Rate Scale). COVID-19 exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of depression symptoms (odds ratio [OR]Ã‚Â = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.66) and anxiety symptoms (ORÃ‚Â = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.52). Only 24.6% of adolescents reported high levels of social support. Most adolescents (70%) reported medium levels of support, and 5.4% reported low support. Low support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (ORÃ‚Â = 4.24, 95% CI: 3.38-5.33) and anxiety symptoms (ORÃ‚Â = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.54-3.98), while controlling for gender, grade, living situation, and COVID-19 exposure; similarly, medium support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (ORÃ‚Â = 2.79, 95% CI: 2.48-3.15) and anxiety (ORÃ‚Â = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.94-2.48) symptoms.

"Early life adversity, dispositional mindfulness, and longitudinal stress experience during the COVID-19 pandemic","Experiencing severe or prolonged stressors in early life is associated with increased risk for mental and physical disorders in adulthood. Further, individuals who experienced early life stress (ELS) may use dysfunctional coping strategies like stress-related eating, in contrast to more beneficial stress buffering mechanisms e.g. based on mindfulness. Whether these mechanisms contribute to increased levels of perceived stress and symptoms of mental disorders in individuals with ELS in times of crisis is yet unclear. As part of a larger project, we assessed changes in perceived stress and psychopathological symptoms in a sample of N=102 participants (81% female; meanage=23.49, SDage= 7.11, range 18â€“62) from October/December 2019 (prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) to April/June 2020 (after the German government introduced Covid-19 related restrictions). Additionally, we assessed ELS and dispositional mindfulness. Perceived stress and depression significantly increased while anxiety levels decreased. No significant change was observed for somatization. ELS and dispositional mindfulness were not associated with change scores, but with perceived stress and psychopathological symptoms at both assessments. The increase in perceived stress during the pandemic in a majority of participants demonstrates the impact of the pandemic in the general population.","Annika Benz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46149-FB9-288","20200806","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; longitudinal data; anxiety; mental health; covid-19; depression; early life stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-06","",3696,""
