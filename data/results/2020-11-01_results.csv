"Psychological and social impact of COVID-19 in Pakistan: Need for Gender Responsive Policies","COVID-19 has rapidly crossed borders, infecting people throughout the world. Women may be especially vulnerable to depression and anxiety due to the pandemic, This study attempted to assess how gender impacts risk perceptions, anxiety levels behavioral responses to the COVID 19 pandemic in Pakistan in order to recommend gender responsive health policies A cross-sectional online survey was conducted.. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and questions on their risk perceptions, preventive behavior and information exposure. Regression analysis was used to assess effects of factors such as age, gender and household income on anxiety levels. Of the 1390 respondents, 478 were women, and 913 were men. Women considered their chances of survival to be relatively lower than men ( 59 % women vs 73% men). They were also more anxious (62% women vs 50% men), and more likely to adopt precautionary behavior, such as avoiding going to the hospital (78% women vs. 71% men), not going to work (72% women and 57% men), and using disinfectants (93% women and 86% men). Men were more likely to trust friends, family and social media as reliable sources of COVID-19 information, while women were more likely to trust doctors. Women experience a disproportion burden of the psychological and social impact of the pandemic compared to men. Involving doctors in healthcare communication targeting women, might prove effective. Social media and radio programs may be effective in disseminating information related to COVID among men.","Dr. Fauziah Rabbani; Dr. Hyder Ali Khan; Dr. Suneel Piryani; Areeba Raza Khan; Dr. Fahad Abid","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.28.20221069","20201101","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-01","",6646,""
