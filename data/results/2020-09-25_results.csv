"A Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) as a potential tool to prevent collapse of the health care task force during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where overloaded health systems seem inevitable, there is a need for reliable, conceptually adequate, and easily applied measurement tools to identify health professionals at risk. Objective: to present the preliminary psychometric properties of a Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) and its association with important outcomes, i.e., moderate to severe depression and suicidal ideation. Methods: The BBES has 4 Likert-type items and was tested as part of a cross-sectional study that included 401 medical students. Reliability analysis and validity studies were performed. Results: In the parallel analysis, two factors were extracted, explaining 84.4% of the variance. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.78, showing high internal consistency. Considering a cut-off point of 12, the odds ratio for moderate to severe depression was 3.01 (CI 1.7-5.22; p<0.001) and for last month suicidal ideation 2.96 (CI 1.6-5.48). Conclusion: The results suggest good psychometric characteristics for the BBES, thus reinforcing its utility as an assessment tool for evaluating the well-being or distress of health professionals. It carries with it the potential to implement early interventions and to prevent the descent into burnout so common today in the health care task force during the pandemic.","Anjelina Velazquez; Mhealyssah Bustria; Youwen Ouyang; Niema Moshiri; Julia Bielicki; Tim Roloff; Roland Bingisser; Christian Nickel","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198804""","20200923","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5018,""
"Challenges and opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic for perinatal mental health care: a mixed methods study of mental health care staff","Purpose: the aim of this study was to explore staff perceptions of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health service delivery and outcomes for women who were pregnant or in the first year after birth (perinatal women). Methods: secondary analysis of an online mixed-methods survey open to all mental health care staff in the UK involving 363 staff working with women in the perinatal period. Results: staff perceived the mental health of perinatal women to be particularly vulnerable to the impact of stressors associated with the pandemic such as social isolation (rated by 79.3% as relevant or extremely relevant; 288/363) and domestic violence and abuse (53.3%; 192/360). As a result of changes to mental health and other health and social care services, staff reported feeling less able to assess women, particularly their relationship with their baby (43.3%; 90/208), and to mobilise safeguarding procedures (29.4%; 62/211). While 42% of staff reported that some women engaged poorly with virtual appointments, they also found flexible remote consulting to be beneficial for some women and helped time management due to reductions in travel time. Conclusions: delivery of perinatal care needs to be tailored to the needs of women; virtual appointments are perceived not to be appropriate for assessments but may be helpful for some women in subsequent interactions. Safeguarding and other risk assessment procedures must remain robust in spite of modifications made to service delivery during pandemics.","Marco-Felipe King; Amanda Marie Wilson; Mark H Weir; Martin Lopez-Garcia; Jessica Proctor; Waseem Hiwar","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20199927""","20200923","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5019,""
"The impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal and reproductive health care services in governmental health institutions of Dessie town, North-East Ethiopia, 2020 GC","Background: The COVID 19 pandemic is causing huge stress on the health care system of all countries in the world. The impact of the pandemic is both social and economic. Pregnancy is an exciting and sometimes stressful experience. Being pregnant during a disease outbreak may add extra anxiety and concern for pregnant women and for those who provide care for them [1, 2]. During the initial stages of the pandemic, it appeared Africa would be spared the burden of COVID-19. However, by April 7th, a total of 45 countries within the WHO African region had reported over 7000 cases (although some place it at over 10 000), with at least 292 deaths and 612 people recovered. Ethiopia, being one of the developing countries trying to address the diverse needs of its people, is currently at the verge of the epidemic [5, 7]. Objectives: The general objective of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal and reproductive health care services among mothers getting service in governmental health institutions of Dessie town, 2020 G.C. Methods: Institution based cross sectional study design using mixed (quantitative supplemented with qualitative) method was employed to identify the impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal and reproductive health care services among women who get service in governmental health institutions of Dessie town. The study was conducted from July 1-15 / 2020. Result: According to this study, Six percent (6%) of antenatal care attendees, 18% of delivery care attendees and nearly half (46.7%) of postnatal care attendees reported inappropriate service delivery due to fear of health care providers, shortage medical supplies and staff work load. The study also showed that utilization of these services was decreased due to fear of clients to go to health institutions. Conclusion and recommendation: This study concluded that COVID-19 significantly affects the quality and utilization of maternal and reproductive health care services. The study also showed that utilization of these services was decreased due to fear of clients to go to health institutions. Ministry of health should continue maternity and reproductive health care services such as family planning to be prioritized as an essential core health service.

"Short-term Neuropsychiatric Outcomes and Quality of Life in COVID-19 Survivors","Background: The general medical impacts of coronavirus (COVID-19) are increasingly appreciated. However, its impact on neurocognitive, psychiatric health and quality of life (QoL) in survivors after the acute phase is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate neurocognitive function, psychiatric symptoms, and QoL in COVID-19 survivors shortly after hospital discharge. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors followed-up for 2 months after discharge. A battery of standardized instruments evaluating neurocognitive function, psychiatric morbidity, and QoL (mental and physical components) was administered by telephone. Findings: Of the 229 screened patients, 179 were included in the final analysis. Among survivors, the prevalence of moderately impaired immediate verbal memory and learning was 38%, delayed verbal memory (11.8%), verbal fluency (34.6%), and working memory (executive function) (6.1%), respectively. Moreover, 58.7% of patients had neurocognitive impairment in at least one function. Rates of positive screening for anxiety were 29.6%, depression (26.8%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (25.1%) respectively. In addition, 39.1% of the patients had psychiatric morbidity. Low QoL for physical and mental components was detected in 44.1% and 39.1% of patients, respectively. Delirium and stress-related symptoms increased approximately 4-fold the odds of developing neurocognitive impairment. Female gender and neurocognitive impairment diagnosis were related with an increase of 2.5 and 4.56-fold odds respectively of psychiatric morbidity. Interpretation: Hospitalized COVID-19 survivors showed a high prevalence of neurocognitive impairment, psychiatric morbidity, and poor QoL in the short-term. It is uncertain if these impacts persist over the long-term.","Fabian Valka; Carla Schuler; Ritwik Bhaduri; Ritoban Kundu; Xuelin Gu; Maxwell Salvatore; Swapnil Mishra; Bhramar Mukherjee; Brockett Horne; Pooja Yesantharao; Bo Soo Kim; Broc Burke; Michael Montana; Michael Talcott; Bradford Winters","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20190090""","20200923","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5021,""
"Mental health of healthcare workers during early phase of COVID19: Variable performance on different factors of stress","Background: Risks to healthcare workers (HCWs) escalate during pandemics and they are likely to experience a greater level of stress. This cross-sectional study investigated mental distress among HCWs during the early phase of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Method: 140 HCWs of a tertiary care hospital in India were assessed for perceived stress and insomnia. A factor analysis with principal component method reduced these questions to four components which were categorized as insomnia, Stress-related Anxiety, Stress-related Irritability, and Stress-related Hopelessness. Further statistical analyses were done on these factor scores to identify the predictors and investigate the differences between the different categories of HCWs. Result: Doctors were the most anxious among the HCWs. Both doctors and nurses perceived a greater level of irritability than the other HCWs. Compared to the doctors and nurses, other HCWs were more likely to experience insomnia. Lower age, higher education, female gender, and urban habitat were associated with the perception of anxiety. Older age, quarantine, single marital-status predicted irritability. Female gender, single marital-status, and greater ailments contributed to perceived hopelessness. Quarantine significantly predicted insomnia. Conclusion: Different categories of HCWs might experience disparate mental health problems owing to their heterogeneous socio-demographic backgrounds. Customized and personalized care might prove to be helpful in alleviating their problems.","Victoria Bridgland; Ella Moeck; Deanne Green; Taylor Swain","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199323""","20200922","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5022,""
"Prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms among pregnant women during COVID-19-related lockdown in Abakaliki, Nigeria","Introduction: Several studies on COVID-19 and pregnancy have been published recently, but few studies have evaluated the impact of this pandemic on maternal mental health particularly in low-resource setting. Aim: To determine the prevalence and predictors of COVID-19-related depression, anxiety and stress symptoms among pregnant women. Materials and methods: This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted among 456 pregnant women attending prenatal care at Abakaliki, Nigeria during COVID-19-related lockdown. They were screened for psychological morbidities using DASS 21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale). Results: Severe and extremely severe depression were reported in 33 (7.2%) and 29 (6.4%) participants respectively. 15 (3.3%) and 35 (7.7%) women had severe and extremely severe anxiety respectively. 105 (23%) had severe anxiety whereas 76 (16.7%) reported extremely severe stress. Multiparity (2 - 4) and occupations such as trading and farming were predictors of depression whereas grandmultiparity, urban residence and trading were identified as predictors of anxiety and stress. Conclusion: Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were relatively common among pregnant women during COVID-19-related lockdown in Abakaliki, Nigeria. There is a need to integrate screening for depression, anxiety and stress in existing antenatal care programs so as to identify and prevent long term adverse psychological outcome related to COVID-19 pandemic.","Graham Bell; Birte Blankenhaus; Catarina Mota","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.30.20184697""","20200902","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5023,""
"Investigating the effect of national government physical distancing measures on depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic through meta-analysis and meta-regression","Background: COVID-19 physical distancing measures can potentially increase the likelihood of mental disorders. It is unknown whether these measures are associated with depression and anxiety. Objectives: To investigate meta-analytic global levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and how implementation of mitigation strategies (i.e. public transportation closures, stay-at-home orders, etc.) impacted such disorders. Data sources: Pubmed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, Current Content Connect, PsycINFO, CINAHL, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv databases for depression and anxiety prevalences; Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker for the containment and closure policies indexes; Global Burden of Disease Study for previous levels of depression and anxiety. Study eligibility criteria: Original studies conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, which assessed categorical depression and anxiety, using PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales (cutoff [&ge;] 10). Participants and interventions: General population, healthcare providers, students, and patients. National physical distancing measures. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Meta-analysis and meta-regresssion. Results: In total, 226,638 individuals were assessed within the 60 included studies. Global prevalence of both depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic were 24.0% and 21.3%, respectively. There was a wide variance in the prevalence of both anxiety and depression reported in different regions of the world and countries. Asia, and China particularly, had the lowest prevalence of both disorders. Regarding the impact of mitigation strategies on mental health, only public transportation closures increased anxiety prevalence. Limitations: Country-level data on physical distancing measures and previous anxiety/depression may not necessarily reflect local (i.e., city-specific) contexts. Conclusions and implications of key findings: Mental health concerns should not be viewed only as a delayed consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also as a concurrent epidemic. Our data provides support for policy-makers to consider real-time enhanced mental health services, and increase initiatives to foster positive mental health outcomes.","Graham Bell; Birte Blankenhaus; Catarina Mota; Andreia Gomes","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.28.20184119""","20200902","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5024,""
"Suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","The prolonged uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, fear and anxiety regarding infections, precautionary social isolation, and the resulting economic disruption could deteriorate psychological health and exacerbate the suicidal risk. Utilizing month-level suicide records covering the entire Japanese population (126 million) in 1,861 administrative units, we assessed if suicide mortality changed during the pandemic. We employed difference-in-difference estimation and found that overall suicide rate declined by 14.8% (95% CI: -18.9% to -10.8%) after the outbreak and the subsequent measures (school closure and the state of emergency). The decline is larger among males than females and among adults than children and older adults. The government's generous subsidies, reduced working hours, and fewer school sessions potentially account for its sizable decline.","Luisa Enria; Naomi Waterlow","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.30.20184168""","20200902","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5025,""
"Take-Home Dosing Experiences among Persons Receiving Methadone Maintenance Treatment During COVID-19","Purpose: Methadone maintenance treatment is a life-saving treatment for people with opioid use disorders (OUD). The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) introduces many concerns surrounding access to opioid treatment. In March 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued guidance allowing the expansion of take-home methadone doses. We sought to describe changes to treatment experiences from the perspective of persons receiving methadone at outpatient treatment facilities for OUD. Methods: We conducted an in-person survey among 104 persons receiving methadone from three clinics in central North Carolina. Surveys collected information on demographic characteristics, methadone treatment history, and experiences with take-home methadone doses in the context of COVID-19 (i.e., before and since March 2020). Results: Before COVID-19, the clinic-level percent of participants receiving any amount of days supply of take-home doses at each clinic varied ranged from 56% to 82%, while it ranged from 78% to 100% since COVID-19. The clinic-level percent of participants receiving a take-homes days supply of a week or longer (i.e., [&ge;]6 days) since COVID-19 ranged from 11% to 56%. Of the 87 participants who received take-homes since COVID-19 began, only four reported selling their take-home doses. Conclusions: Our study found variation in experiences of take-home dosing by clinic and little diversion of take-home doses. While SAMSHA guidance should allow expanded access to take-home doses, adoption of these guidelines may vary at the clinic level. The adoption of these policies should be explored further, particularly in the context of benefits to patients seeking treatment for OUD.","Luisa Enria; Naomi Waterlow; Nina Trivedy Rogers; Hannah Brindle; Sham Lal","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.31.20185249""","20200902","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5026,""
"Mental healthcare and service user impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: results of a UK survey of staff working with people with intellectual disability and developmental disorders","Background Very little is known about the impact of previous epidemics on the care of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, particularly in terms of mental health services. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to exacerbate existing health inequalities as well as expose gaps in service provision for this vulnerable population group. Methods We investigated the responses of 648 staff working in mental healthcare with people with intellectual disabilities and/or developmental disabilities. Participants contributed to a UK-wide online survey undertaken by the National Institute for Health Research Mental Health Policy Research Unit between 22nd April and 12th May 2020. Recruitment was via professional networks, social media and third sector organisations. Quantitative data describing staff experience over three domains (challenges at work, service user and carer problems, sources of help at work) were summarised and differences between groups explored using Chi square tests. Content analysis was used to organise qualitative data focusing on service changes in response to the pandemic. Results The majority of survey respondents worked in the NHS and in community mental health services. One third had managerial responsibility. Major concerns expressed by mental healthcare staff were: difficulties for service users due to lack of access to usual support networks and health and social care services during the pandemic; and difficulties maintaining adequate levels of support secondary to increased service user need. Staff reported having to quickly adopt new digital ways of working was challenging; nevertheless, free text responses identified remote working as the innovation that staff would most like to retain after the pandemic subsides. Conclusions Understanding the experiences of staff working across different settings in mental healthcare for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential in guiding contingency planning and fostering service developments to ensure the health of this vulnerable group is protected in any future disease outbreaks.","Luisa Enria; Naomi Waterlow; Nina Trivedy Rogers; Hannah Brindle; Sham Lal; Rosalind M Eggo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.01.20178848""","20200902","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5027,""
"Predictors of healthcare worker burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective We aim to provide a snapshot of the levels of burnout, anxiety, depression and distress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, setting, participants We distributed an online survey via social media in June 2020 that was open to any healthcare worker. The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout as measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety and distress as measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Scale-7, and Impact of Events Scale-Revised were recorded along with subjective measures of stress. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burnout, depression, anxiety and distress. Results Of 539 persons responding to the survey, 90% were female, and 26% were aged 41-50 years, 53% were nurses. Participants with moderate-to-severe burnout were younger (49% [206/424] versus 33% [38/115] under 40 years, P=0.004), and more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities (21% versus 12%, P=0.031). They were twice as likely to have been redeployed from their usual role (22% versus 11%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.3, P=0.042), or to work in an area dedicated to COVID-19 patients (50% versus 32%, adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8, P<0.001), and were almost 4-times more likely to have previous depression (24% versus 7%; adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.2-5.9, P=0.012). A supportive workplace team and male sex protected against burnout reducing the odds by 40% (adjusted OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7, P<0.001) and 70% (adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, P=0.003), respectively. Conclusion Independent predictors of burnout were younger staff, redeployment to a new working area, working with patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, and being female or having a previous history of depression. Evaluation of existing psychological support interventions is required with targeted approaches to ensure support is available to those most at risk.","Nicola Innes; Ilona Johnson; Waraf Al-Yaseen; Rebecca Harris","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.26.20182378""","20200901","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5028,""
"Previous psychopathology predicted severe COVID-19 concern, anxiety and PTSD symptoms in pregnant women during lockdown in Italy","Italy was the first COVID-19 pandemic epicenter among European countries and established a period of full lockdown, consisting of travel bans, mandatory staying at home and temporary closure of non-essential businesses. Similar measures are known risk factors for psychological disturbances in the general population, still very little is known about their impact on pregnant women's mental health during COVID-19 pandemic. The national survey 'COVID-19 related Anxiety and StreSs in prEgnancy, poSt-partum and breaStfeeding' (COVID-ASSESS) was conducted during the first month of full lockdown in Italy. The questionnaire was specifically developed to examine COVID-19 concerns and included the psychometric tests NSESSS for PTSD and STAI-Y for anxiety. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to explore the association of the concern, anxiety and PTSD symptoms with age, gestational weeks, parity, days of lockdown, assisted reproductive technology use, psychopathological history and previous perinatal losses. Out of 1015 pregnant women reached, 737 (72.6%) fully answered the questionnaire; no woman reported a COVID-19 infection. Median age was 34.4 years [quartiles 31.7, 37.2], median days in lockdown were 13.1 [11.0, 17.0], median gestational weeks were 27.8 [19.8, 34.0]. Clinically significant PTSD symptoms were present in 75 women (10.2%, NSESSS cut-off 24) and clinically significant anxiety symptoms were present in 160 women (21.7%, STAI-Y1 cut-off 50).

In Belgium, by the end of August, 93% of deaths due to COVID-19 were aged 65 or older. Similar trends were observed in other countries. As a consequence, older adults were identified as a group at risk, and strict governmental restrictions were imposed on them. This has caused concerns about their mental health. Using an online survey, this study established the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults aged 65 years or older, and which factors moderate this impact. Participants reported a significant decrease in activity level, sleep quality and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was strongly related to reported declines in activity level, sleep quality, wellbeing and cognitive functioning.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population: a comparison between Germany and the UK","In March 2020 the SARS-CoV-2infection (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic. In response to its world-wide outbreak radical measures were taken by governments across the world including curfew, quarantine, travel bans, social distancing, work place and school closures, etc, to reduce the transmission of the virus. These measures led to dramatic social and economic changes for the general population, in addition to the fears and worries related to the disease and its contraction. First studies report the impact of the pandemic on mental well-being of the general population showing increased levels of anxiety, stress and depression. In this study, we compare the impact of the pandemic on two European countries: the UK and Germany, which reported their first cases within a week. 241 residents of the UK and 541 residents of Germany filled in an online survey, including questions on COVID-19 exposure, impact on financial situation and work, substance and media consumption, self-reported mental and physical health, as well as including two clinical questionnaires, the general mental health Symptom Check List-27 (SCL-27) and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. Data collection was completed between 27/04/20-31/05/20. We found distinct differences between the two countries. UK responders reported a stronger direct impact on their health, financial situation and their families. UK responders had higher clinical scores on the SCL-27, with a higher percentage being above cut-off. Interestingly, however, we found that German responders were less hopeful for an end of the pandemic and more concerned about their life-stability. Generally, we found that a younger age, being female, lower education, poorer mental and physical health before the pandemic, as well as more social media and substance consumption was associated with a higher clinical risk. As 25% of all responders report a subjective worsening of the general psychological symptoms and 20-50% of responders reaching the clinical cut-off for depressive, dysthymic and anxieties, future pandemics require a tailored intervention system to assist not only people vulnerable for mental health problems, but also large proportions of the general public.","Justin Kua; Reshma Patel; Eveliina Nurmi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.27.20182980""","20200901","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5031,""
"Social Determinants Associated with COVID-19 Mortality in the United States","This study examines social determinants associated with disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates in the United States.Using county-level data, 42 negative binomial mixed models were used to evaluate the impact of social determinants on COVID-19 outcome. First, to identify proper controls, the effect of 24 high-risk factors on COVID-19 mortality rate was quantified. Then, the high-risk terms found to be significant were controlled for in an association study between 41 social determinants and COVID-19 mortality rates. The results describe that ethnic minorities, immigrants, socioeconomic inequalities, and early exposure to COVID-19 are associated with increased COVID-19 mortality, while the prevalence of asthma, suicide, and excessive drinking is associated with decreased mortality. Overall, we recognize that social inequality places disadvantaged groups at risk, which must be addressed through future policies and pro-grams. Additionally, we reveal possible relationships between lung disease, mental health, and COVID-19 that need to be explored on a clinical level.","Adem Dirican; Tugce Uzar; Irem Karaman; Aziz Uluisik; Sevket Ozkaya; Magdalini Lourda; Majda Dzidic; Mira Akber","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.28.20183848""","20200901","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5032,""
"Post-infection depression, anxiety and PTSD: a retrospective cohort study with mild COVID-19 patients","Background: It remains unclear whether COVID-19 is associated with psychiatric symptoms during or after the acute illness phase. Being affected by the disease exposes the individual to an uncertain prognosis and a state of quarantine. These factors can predispose individuals to the development of mental symptoms during or after the acute phase of the disease. There is a need for prospective studies assessing mental health symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the post-infection period. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests were collected at patients homes under the supervision of trained healthcare personnel. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were classified as mild cases (N=895) at treatment intake were further assessed for the presence of mental health disorders (on average, 56.6 days after the intake). We investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 symptoms at intake and depression, anxiety and PTSD, adjusting for previous mental health status, time between baseline and outcome, and other confounders. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear models were employed for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. Findings: Depression, anxiety and PTSD were reported by 26.2% (N=235), 22.4% (N=201), and 17.3% (N=155) of the sample. Reporting an increased number of COVID-related symptoms was associated with depression (aOR=1.059;95%CI=1.002-1.119), anxiety (aOR=1.072;95%CI=1.012-1.134), and PTSD (aOR=1.092;95%CI=1.024-1.166). Sensitivity analyses supported findings for both continuous and categorical measures. Interpretation: Exposure to an increased number of COVID-19 symptoms may predispose individuals to depression, anxiety and PTSD after the acute phase of the disease.

"Stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19: A multinational survey from six Asian regions","People may experience a heightened level of stress reactions during a pandemic event and in an isolated social environment. A multi-national survey about such mental health information about COVID-19 was conducted in May 2020 across six Asian regions: Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Data were collected from a population representative sample of 11,895 adults on their stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19 and the related public health measures. 59.1% of the respondents showed at least one substantial stress symptom. The situation was particularly worrying in South Korea, where 75% of the respondents reported substantial stress symptoms. Respondents who were young, educated, lived in an urban area, had a high socio-economic status, had a history of chronic illness or mental illness, or who lived with a pregnant woman, elderly or children were most vulnerable to stress during the pandemic. Stress reactions showed a positive relationship with the amount of time spent following news about the COVID-19 outbreak. Asian adults coped with their stress by preparing safety equipment and extra daily commodities (62.4%) and by following government-issued public health measures (60.1%). Most Asian (71%) also frequently checked on the safety of family members and friends to keep each other safe. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated stringent public health measures have largely increased the prevalence of substantial stress symptoms across multiple Asian regions. Governments should prepare this mental health pandemic and the associated social repercussions.","Abhishek Dubey; Aastha Bansal; Subash Chandra Sonkar; Binita Goswami","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.24.20179762""","20200826","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5035,""
"The Relationship between Deteriorating Mental Health Conditions and Longitudinal Behavioral Changes in Google and YouTube Usages among College Students in the United States during COVID-19: Observational Study","Background: Mental health problems among the global population are worsened during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Yet, current methods for screening mental health issues rely on in-person interviews, which can be expensive, time-consuming, blocked by social stigmas and quarantines. Meanwhile, how individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube undergoes drastic shifts due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in mental health profiles of users through a non-invasive manner. Objective: The goal of this study is to examine, among college students in the United States, the relationship between deteriorating mental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. Methods: This study recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (N=49) from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. The anxiety level was assessed via the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The depression level was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data of all participants were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental health profiles in terms of these features. Results: Of the 49 participants, 41% (n=20) of them reported a significant increase (increase in the PHQ-9 score > 5) in depression, denoted as DEP; 45% (n=22) of them reported a significant increase (increase in the GAD-7 score > 5) in anxiety, denoted as ANX. Of the 5 features proposed to quantify online behavior changes, statistical significances were found between the DEP and non-DEP groups for all of them (P<.01, effect sizes \eta_{partial}^2 ranging between 0.130 to 0.320); statistical significances were found between the ANX and non-ANX groups for 4 of them (P<.02, effect sizes \eta_{partial}^2 ranging between 0.115 to 0.231). Significant features included late-night online activities, continuous usages and time away from the internet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions, social activities, and personal affairs. Conclusions: The results suggested strong discrepancies between college student groups with and without deteriorating mental health conditions in terms of behavioral changes in Google Search and YouTube usages during the COVID-19. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to establish non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.","Animesh Ray; Komal Singh; Souvick Chattopadhyay; Farha Mehdi; Gaurav Batra","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.22.20178640""","20200825","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5036,""
"The Effects of Coronavirus Victimization Distress and Coronavirus Racial Bias on Mental Health Among Black, Indigenous and Latinx Young Adults in the United States","Background. People of color in the U.S. have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic in terms of rates of infection and morbidity. Explanations for these disparities include over-representation as essential workers and long-standing inequities in access to health services. Prior to the pandemic, racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of discrimination and racial bias specific to the Coronavirus on mental health has not been examined. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs on the mental health of young adult people of color. Method. An online survey administered to a national sample of 350 Black, Indigenous and Latinx adults (18 to 25 years) included Coronavirus health risks, prescription and financial security, measure of depression and anxiety and 2 new psychometrically validated measures for Coronavirus related victimization distress and racial bias. Results. Employment, number of Coronavirus health risks, Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias were positively correlated with each other and with depression and anxiety. By contrast, household income and perceived financial and prescription security were negatively correlated with Coronavirus victimization, Coronavirus racial bias and with the mental health indices. Structural equation modeling controlling for demographic variables indicated perceived Coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health measures across all groups. Conclusions. Results suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial/ethnic minorities during the current and future health crises.","Adeteju Ogunbameru; Kali Barrett; Arinola Joda","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.19.20178343""","20200822","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5037,""
"The Mental Health of Healthcare Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic: It Depends on How Much They Work and Their Age","Background: Healthcare staff are the forefront of fight against COVID-19 and they are under enormous pressure due to the fast growth in the number and severity of infected cases. This creates their mental issues such as distress, depression and anxiety. Exploring healthcare staff's mental health during the pandemic contributes to improving their persistence in the growing challenges created by COVID-19 and enabling effective management of their mental health. Methods: An online survey of 280 healthcare staff in all the 31 provinces of Iran was conducted during April 5-20, 2020. The survey assessed staff's distress, depression and anxiety in the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Nearly a third of healthcare staff suffered from distress, depression and anxiety. Females and more educated healthcare staff were more likely to experience distress. Compared to personnel who did not have COVID-19, those who were unsure whether they had COVID-19 were more likely to experience distress and depression. The number of COVID-19 cases among the staff's colleagues or friends positively predicted their anxiety. Compared to radio technologists, doctors were less likely to experience distress and anxiety. Technicians and obstetrics experienced less anxiety. Analysis the interaction between weekly working days and age of the staff indicated the chance of experiencing distress and depression varied greatly by working days among younger but not older healthcare staff. Conclusion: The predictors of mental health issues assists healthcare organizations to identify healthcare staff with mental health issues in sever crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research highlight the need to identify more working characteristics as predictors for healthcare staff at different ages.","Jennifer N. Dines; Thomas J. Manley; Emily Svejnoha; Heidi M.

"REPERCUSSIONS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF PREGNANT AND PUERPERAL WOMEN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused negative impacts on the physical and mental health of the population worldwide. Pregnant and puerperal women comprise the population most vulnerable to impacts on mental health. Objective: To synthesize the scientific evidence on the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnant and puerperal women. Methods: systematic review focused on answering the question what is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnan and puerperal women?. In order to perform the search of the studies, we used combinations among the keywords: pregnan*, puerper*, prenatal, perinatal, mental health, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. In total, we identified 150 studies from the databases and 14 studies were selected from preprints. We identified another four studies through manual search, totaling 18 studies to compose the final sample of this review. Results: Anxiety and depression were the main outcomes found, being shown in 15 and 11 studies, respectively. Other outcomes found in more than one study were: concerns related to several factors, loneliness, stress and fear. Conclusion: From this review, we can infer that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of pregnant and puerperal women, with depression and anxiety being the most frequent changes. The social detachment, the media pressure, the fear of contracting the infection, the economic scenario and the rupture of family rituals are shown as intensifying factors of psychological distress, thus causing changes in the mental health of these women.","Jennifer N.

"Time-use and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a panel analysis of 55,204 adults followed across 11 weeks of lockdown in the UK","There is currently major concern about the impact of the global COVID 19 outbreak on mental health. But it remains unclear how individual behaviors could exacerbate or protect against adverse changes in mental health. This study aimed to examine the associations between specific activities (or time use) and mental health and wellbeing amongst people during the COVID 19 pandemic. Data were from the UCL COVID 19 Social Study; a panel study collecting data weekly during the COVID 19 pandemic. The analytical sample consisted of 55,204 adults living in the UK who were followed up for the strict 11 week lockdown period from 21st March to 31st May 2020. Data were analyzed using fixed effects and Arellano Bond models. We found that changes in time spent on a range of activities were associated with changes in mental health and wellbeing. After controlling for bidirectionality, behaviors involving outdoor activities including gardening and exercising predicted subsequent improvements in mental health and wellbeing, while increased time spent on following news about COVID 19 predicted declines in mental health and wellbeing. These results are relevant to the formulation of guidance for people obliged to spend extended periods in isolation during health emergencies, and may help the public to maintain wellbeing during future pandemics.","Fergus W Gardiner; Marianne Gillam; Leonid Churilov; Pritish Sharma","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.18.20177345""","20200821","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5040,""

Methods The data of 248 residents living in Anhui from February 4 to 6 of 2020 were collected through network survey including age, gender, occupation, the World Health Organization Quality of Life measurement Scale short form (World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument - brief, WHOQOL BREF), Zung Self rating Anxiety Scale (Self- rating Anxiety Scale, SAS and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Those surveyed, divided into two groups: medical staff (129 cases) and non-medical staff (119 cases), were made statistic analysis according to the factors mentioned above. Results The WHOQOL-BREF of medical staff in this region was lower than that of non-medical staff in the fields of physiology, psychology, social relations and environment, among whom female medical staff scored significantly lower than that of male medical staff in four fields. There was no significant statistical difference in SAS and SDS scores between the two groups, and gender had no significant influence on SAS and SDS scores of medical staff.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Primary Care Mental Health Services: A Descriptive, Cross-Sectional Timeseries of Electronic Healthcare Records","Introduction. There are growing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. With government-imposed restrictions as well as a general burden on healthcare systems, the pandemic has the potential to disrupt the access to, and delivery of, mental healthcare. Ultimately, this could potentially lead to unmet needs of individuals requiring mental health support. Methods. Electronic healthcare records from primary care psychological therapy services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapy) in England were used to examine changes in access to mental health services and service delivery during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, descriptive timeseries was conducted using data from 1st January 2019 to 24th May 2020 across five NHS trusts to examine patterns in referrals to services (n = 171,823) and appointments taking place (n = 865,902). Results. The number of patients accessing mental health services dropped by an average of 55% in the 9 weeks after lockdown was announced, reaching a maximum reduction of 74% in the initial 3 weeks after lockdown in the UK. As referrals began to increase again, there was a relatively faster increase in referrals from Black, Asian, and ethnic minority groups as well an increase in referrals from more densely populated areas. Despite a reduction in access, service providers adapted to infection control guidance by rapidly shifting to remote delivery of care. Interpretation. Services were able to rapidly adapt to provide continuity of care in mental healthcare. However, patients accessing services reduced dramatically, potentially placing a future burden on service providers to treat a likely backlog of patients in addition to a possible excess of patients as the long-term consequences of the pandemic become more apparent. Despite the observational nature of the data, which should be noted, the present study can inform the planning of service provision and policy.","Zaid Zoumot; Maria-Fernanda Bonilla; Ali Saeed Wahla; Irfan Shafiq; Mateen Uzbeck; Rania M El-Lababidi; Fadi Hamed; Mohamed Abuzakouk; Mahmoud El-Kaissi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.15.20175562""","20200817","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5042,""
"Bidirectional associations between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorder: a study of 62,354 COVID-19 cases","Background: Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. Methods: We addressed both questions using cohort studies derived from an electronic health records (EHR) network of 69 million patients including over 62,000 cases of COVID-19. Propensity score matching was used to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for more severe illness. Findings: In patients with no prior psychiatric history, COVID-19 was associated with an increased incidence of psychiatric diagnoses in the three months after infection compared to 6 other health events (hazard ratio [95% CI] 2.1 [1.8-2.5] compared to influenza; 1.7 [1.5-1.9] compared to other respiratory tract infections; 1.6 [1.4-1.9] compared to skin infection; 1.6 [1.3.1-9] compared to cholelithiasis; 2.2 [1.9-2.6] compared to urolithiasis, and 2.1 [1.9-2.5] compared to fracture of a large bone; all p<0.0001). The increase was greatest for anxiety disorders but also present for depression, insomnia, and dementia. The results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. There was a ~30% reduction in psychiatric diagnoses in the total EHR population over the same period. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a 65% higher incidence of COVID-19 (relative risk 1.65, 95% CI: 1.59-1.71, p<0.0001). This was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19. Interpretation: COVID-19 infection has both psychiatric sequelae and psychiatric antecedents. Survivors have an increased rate of new onset psychiatric disorders, and prior psychiatric disorders are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. The findings have implications for research into aetiology and highlight the need for clinical services to provide multidisciplinary follow-up, and prompt detection and treatment.","David A Meekins; Igor Morozov; Jessie D Trujillo; Natasha N Gaudreault","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.14.20175190""","20200816","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5043,""
"The Status and Risk Factors of COVID-19 Related Suicides in Bangladesh","In addition to physical health, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the global economy and mental health significantly. The economic and social consequence has sparked many psychological mediators. In severe cases, they led to suicidal behavior in individuals like as seen in the 1918-1919 flu pandemic and in the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. Previously, a few articles have been published with regard to COVID-19 suicides in Bangladesh. However, all these articles talked about sporadic cases of suicides with no clear picture of the holistic overview of suicides in Bangladesh. Herein, we looked into all COVID-19 suicide cases from March 01, 2020, to July 31, 2020, as reported in Bangladeshi media. Our study also reports the risk factors contributing to suicidal incidents. Moreover, we also identified the impact of gender, profession, and COVID-19 diagnosis status on committing suicide. This study will shed light on the topic with a clear understanding of the causalities influencing individuals to suicide. Furthermore, it will help the policymakers to take necessary actions to prevent any further suicides.","Jeff Lane; Michelle M Garrison","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.11.20171272""","20200814","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5044,""
"Immediate Effects of COVID-19 Outbreak on Psychiatric Outpatients: Posttraumatic Stress and Influencing Factors","We aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak and public health measures on the psychological well-being of patients with psychiatric disorders. This cross-sectional study assessed 436 outpatients recruited from a tertiary psychiatry clinic in Istanbul, Turkey, nearly one month after the government introduced strict measures of lockdown against the ongoing outbreak. Respondents completed a web-based survey on sociodemographic data, subjective sleep quality, and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Respondents reported high frequencies of clinically significant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (32.6%, IES-R score equal to or above 33), anxiety (36.4%, HADS anxiety score > 10), and depression (51%, HADS depression score > 10). 20.5% of respondents described that their psychological status worsened during the COVID-19 outbreak, and 12.1% of respondents described poor or very poor sleep in the prior month. Positive predictors of increased PTSD symptoms included the chronic medical diseases, knowing someone in the social vicinity diagnosed with the COVID-19 infection, job loss or being on temporary leave after the outbreak, and increased exposure time to TV or social media. In contrast, male gender, older age, higher educational attainment, and the psychiatric diagnoses of schizophrenia and (to a lesser degree) bipolar disorder were the negative predictors. Our results suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are prone to substantial psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak, and various individual, behavioral, and social factors mediate this effect.","Gouri Koduri; Sriya Gokaraju; Maria Darda; Vinod Warrier; Irina Duta; Fiona Hayes; Iman El Sayed; Yasser Noeman Ahmed","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.12.20173468""","20200814","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5045,""
"Deep Learning for Automated Recognition of Covid-19 from Chest X-ray Images","Abstract Background: The pandemic caused by coronavirus in recent months is having a devastating global effect, which puts the world under the most ever unprecedented emergency. Currently, since there are not effective antiviral treat- ments for Covid-19 yet, it is crucial to early detect and monitor the progression of the disease, thus helping to reduce mortality. While a corresponding vaccine is being developed, and different measures are being used to combat the virus, medical imaging techniques have also been investigated to assist doctors in diag- nosing this disease. Objective: This paper presents a practical solution for the detection of Covid-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images, exploiting cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques. Methods: We employ EfficientNet and MixNet, two recently developed families of deep neural networks, as the main classifica- tion engine. Furthermore, we also apply different transfer learning strategies, aiming at making the training process more accurate and efficient. The proposed approach has been validated by means of two real datasets, the former consists of 13,511 training images and 1,489 testing images, the latter has 14,324 and 3,581 images for training and testing, respectively. Results: The results are promising: by all the experimental configurations considered in the evaluation,our approach always yields an accuracy larger than 95.0%, with the maximum accuracy obtained being 96.64%. Conclusions: As a comparison with various existing studies, we can thus conclude that our performance improvement is significant.","Congwen Wei; Luming Wan; Qiulin Yan; Xiaolin Wang","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.13.20173997""","20200814","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5046,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on Italy web users: a quantitative analysis of regional hygiene interest and emotional response","Background: Between the end of February and the beginning of June 2020, Italy was certainly one of the worst affected countries in the world by the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, web interest in the novel coronavirus has undergone a drastic surge. Objective: The aim of this study was to quantitatively analyze the impact of COVID-19 on Web searches related to hygiene-preventive measures and emotional-psychological aspects as well as to estimate the effectiveness and limits of online information during an epidemic. We looked for significant correlations between COVID-19 relative search volumes and cases per region to understand the interest of the average Italian Web user during international, national, and regional COVID-19 situations. By doing so, from the analysis of Web searches, it will be possible to deduce the mental and physical health of the population. Methods: To conduct this research, we used the ""Google Trends"" tool, which returns normalized values, called ""relative search volumes"" (RSVs), ranging from 0 to 100 according to the Web popularity of a group of queries. By comparing the RSVs in periods before and after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Italy, we derived the impact of COVID-19 on the activity of Italian netizens towards novel coronavirus itself, specifically regarding hygiene, prevention, and psychological well-being. Furthermore, we calculated Pearson's correlations {rho} ; between all these queries and COVID-19 cases for each region. We chose a p-value (p) threshold =.1. Results: After the two initial spikes that occurred on February 23 and March 9, 2020, the general web interest in COVID-19 in Italy waned, as did the correlation with the official number of cases per region (p< .1 only until March 14, 2020). However, web interest was similarly distributed across the regions (ASV=92,SD=6). We also found that all trends depend significantly on the number of COVID-19 cases at national but not international or regional levels. Between February 20 and June 10, 2020, web interest relating to hygiene and prevention increased by 116% and 901%, respectively, compared to those from January 1 to February 19, 2020 (95% CIs: [115.3,116.3],[850.3,952,2]). Significant correlations between regional cumulative web searches and COVID-19 cases were found only between February 26 and March 7, 2020 ({rho}-best= .43, 95% CI:[.42.44],p= .07). During the COVID-19 pandemic until June 10, 2020, national web searches of the generic terms ""fear"" and ""anxiety"" grew by 8% and 21%, respectively (95% CIs: [8.0,8.2],[20.4,20.6]) compared to those of the period January 1, 2018 - December 29, 2019. We found cyclically significant correlations between negative emotions related to the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 official data. Conclusions: Italian netizens showed a marked interest in the COVID-19 pandemic only when this became a direct national problem. In general, web searches have rarely been correlated with the number of cases per region; we conclude that the danger, once it arrived in the country, was perceived similarly in all regions. We can state that the period of maximum effectiveness of online information, in relation to this type of situation, is limited to 3-4 days from a specific key event. If such a scenario were to occur again, we suggest that all government agencies focus their web disclosure efforts over that time. Despite this, we found cyclical correlations with web searches related to negative feelings such as anxiety, depression, fear, and stress. Therefore, to identify mental and physical health problems among the population, it suffices to observe slight variations in the trend of related web queries.

"COVID-19 and Mental Health: A Study of its Impact on Students","The purpose of this study was to identify and analyse the personal, social and psychological impact of COVID - 19 on the mental health of students of age group 16 to 25. A response from N= 351 students (from the most affected state in India), provided a comparative analysis based on the gender, and background to understand the pattern in issues related to mental health during the pandemic. The results show that female students are more concerned about health, and future, and are more prone to psychological issues like feelings of uncertainty, helplessness and outbursts than male students. Urban student population is more mentally affected than their rural counterparts, however time spent on the internet is almost the same despite the difference in infrastructure and resources. Also, there is an increase in need for solitude, being withdrawn and self-harm in male students require attention. A shift in perception from seeing family as a source of support to that of a restriction is indicated, although the benefits of a collectivist society are undisputed. The results indicate that there is overall increased awareness about mental health among the student population and with programs/strategies focusing on background and gender, a significant improvement is attainable.","Tjibbe Donker; Hajo Grundmann; Fabian B&uumlrkin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.05.20160499""","20200811","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5048,""
"Social Media Reveals Psychosocial Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused several disruptions in personal and collective lives worldwide. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multi-faceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. Despite noting this as a mental health tsunami, the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remains unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances. Objective: Our work aims to provide insights regarding people's psychosocial concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and support-seeking expressions in the pandemic context. Methods: We obtain 60M Twitter streaming posts originating from the U.S. from March, 24 to May, 25, 2020, and compare these with 40M posts from a comparable period in 2019 to causally attribute the effect of COVID-19 on people's social media self-disclosure. Using these datasets, we study people's self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions seeking support. We employ transfer learning classifiers that identify the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examine the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 datasets. Results: We find that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis, mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by ~14%, and support seeking expressions have increased by 5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observe a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. Our language analyses highlight that people express concerns that are contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis. Conclusions: We studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that people's mental health symptomatic and support-seeking expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their new normal. Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, healthcare and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness. This work shows the potential to provide insights to mental healthcare and stakeholders and policymakers in planning and implementing measures to mitigate mental health risks amidst the health crisis.","Laura Skrip; Mosoka P Fallah; Jamie Bedson; Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.07.20170548""","20200811","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5049,""
"A Long-Lasting Sanitizing Skin Protectant based on CAGE, a Choline and Geranic Acid Eutectic","The recent outbreak and rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and a massive public health crisis. COVID-19 has also had a severe impact on the quality of life and mental health. While different health authorities such as WHO and CDC are encouraging adoption of strategies including hand washing and use of facemasks to reduce the spread of the pathogens and infections, adoption of these approaches requires substantial commitment. Current hand sanitizers based on ethanol provide immediate protection, however, the protection rendered by such sanitizers is very short-lived due to their rapid evaporation. A long-lasting sanitizing skin protectant that can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and provide persistent efficacy over several hours will provide people the freedom to carry on with their activities without constant concerns about the cleanliness of their hands. Herein, we describe a skin protectant, IonLASTTM, based on an ionic liquid/deep eutectic solvent, formed by GRAS materials, choline and geranic acid (CAGE, CG-101), that provides protection for at least 4h after a single application. IonLASTTM was formulated as a gel that facilitates easy application on the skin. Tolerance of CG-101 was substantiated through a study in human volunteers. In vitro studies confirmed that IonLASTTM effectively inactivates a human coronavirus hCoV229E. A second human clinical study established that a single application of IonLASTTM imparts protection against microbes that lasts up to several hours.","Natalia Ruetalo; Ramona Businger; Karina Althaus; Simon Fink","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.04.20161067""","20200807","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5050,""

"Sooner than you think: a very early affective reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine in Argentina","The unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic pose serious challenges to mood stability and emotional regulation at all ages. Although many people tend to react resiliently to stress, others appear to display emotional anxiety and depression-related symptoms. In this study, we carried out a survey (N = 10,053) during the first week of the general lockdown (quarantine) in Argentina to measure early affective reactions in Argentine adults. Respondents showed substantial anxious and depressive symptoms, with 33 % and 23% of participants reporting possible depressive andanxious syndromes, respectively, with the youngest group (18 to 25 y.o.) showing the highest prevalence of symptoms. Even if prior mental health problems predisposed or aggravated the reaction, participants without prior complaints showed signs of psychological impact. Using linear regression, the most important independent variables related to depressive symptoms was the feeling of loneliness followed by daily stress. In the case of anxious states, the strongest variables were negative repetitive thinking and feeling of loneliness. Other psychological, economic, and social factors are discussed. This study is in line with previous literature that highlights the importance of the psychological impact of pandemics but additionally demonstrates that these reactions are present at a large scale immediately after the start of quarantine with very low infectious rates as an early anticipatory adaptive reaction leading to potentially negative outcomes from adjustment disorders to major disorders. In addition, the present results provide potentially relevant information about sudden environmental impacts on affective states and specific pathways for anxiety and depression to be expressed. We end by discussing implications for public policy based on considering the most vulnerable groups.","Xiaomeng Zhang; Xue Li; Ziwen Sun; Yazhou He; Wei Xu; Harry Campbell; Malcolm G Dunlop","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.31.20166272""","20200804","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5052,""
"The mental health and experiences of discrimination of LGBTQ+ people during the COVID-19 pandemic: Initial findings from the Queerantine Study","Objective: To assess mental health status and experiences of discrimination among a sample of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer people (LGBTQ+, the + including those who don't identify with any such label) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional web-based survey. Setting: Responses were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic between April 27th and July 13th. Participants: 398 LGBTQ+ respondents forming an analytical sample of 310 in the main models. Methods: We used a combined measure of gender identity or expression and sexual orientation as the main explanatory variable. We assessed mental health with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). We measured experiences of discrimination with a battery of questions that asked respondents whether they had experienced a set of discriminatory experiences because of their LGBTQ+ identity during the coronavirus pandemic. Experiences of discrimination was considered a mediating factor and examined both as an outcome as well as an explanatory variable. Models were adjusted for a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. Results: The prevalence of depression and stress were both high, with the majority of the sample exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (69%). Around one-in-six respondents reported some form of discrimination since the start of the pandemic because they were LGBTQ+ (16.7%). In regression models, the average score for perceived stress increased by 1.44 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.517-2.354) for those who had experienced an instance of homophobic or transphobic harassment, compared to respondents who had not. Similarly, the odds of exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (CES-D-10 scores of 10 or more) increased three-fold among those who had experienced harassment based on their gender or sexuality compared to those who had not (OR: 3.251; 95% CI: 1.168-9.052). These marked associations remained after adjustment for a number of socioeconomic and demographic covariates. Cis-female respondents who identify as gay or lesbian had the lowest scores for perceived social or depressive symptoms; conversely transgender and gender diverse individuals had the highest scores. Conclusions: We found high levels of stress and depressive symptoms, particularly among younger and transgender and gender diverse respondents. These associations were partially explained by experiences of discrimination which had a large, consistent and pernicious impact on stress and mental health.","Andrew Omame; Ndolane Sene","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.03.20167403""","20200804","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5053,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on maternal mental health and coping in the UK: Data from the COVID-19 New Mum Study","Background: Depression and anxiety affect up to 20% of new and expectant mothers during the perinatal period; this rate may have increased due to COVID-19 and lockdown measures. This analysis aimed to assess how mothers are feeling and coping during lockdown, and to identify the potential pathways that can assist them. Methods: 1329 women living in the UK aged [&ge;]18 years with an infant [&le;]12 months of age completed an anonymous online survey. Descriptive analysis of maternal mental health, coping, support received, activities undertaken and consequences of lockdown was conducted. Linear regression was used to predict maternal mental health and coping, using activities, support, and consequences of the lockdown as predictors, while adjusting for age, gestational age, ethnicity, income, marital status and number of children. Results: More than half of the participants reported feeling down (56%), lonely (59%), irritable (62%) and worried (71%), to some or high extent since lockdown began. Despite this, 70% felt able to cope with the situation. Support with her own health (95% CI .004, .235), contacting infant support groups (95% CI -.003, .252), and higher infant gestational age (95% CI .000, .063) predicted better mental health. Travelling for work (95% CI -.680, -.121), lockdown having a major impact on the ability to afford food (95% CI -1.202, -.177), and having an income lower than 30k (95% CI -.475, -.042) predicted poorer mental health. Support with her own health and more equal division of household chores were associated with better coping. Conclusion: During lockdown, a large proportion of new mothers experienced symptoms of poor mental health; mothers of infants with lower gestational age, with low income, and who are travelling to work were particularly at risk. However, greater support for maternal health and with household chores showed positive associations with maternal mental health and coping. These findings highlight the urgent need to assess maternal mental health, and to identify prevention strategies for mothers during different stages of lockdown.","Andrew Omame; Ndolane Sene; Ikenna Nometa; Cosmas Ifeanyi Nwakanma; Emmanuel Ugochukwu Nwafor","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.04.20168039""","20200804","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5054,""
"Loneliness, physical activity and mental health during Covid-19: a longitudinal analysis of depression and anxiety between 2015 and 2020","Background Loneliness and physical activity are important targets for research into the impact of COVID-19 because they have established links with mental health, could be exacerbated by social distancing policies and are potentially modifiable. Method We analysed mental health data collected during COVID-19 from adults aged 50 and over alongside comparable annual data collected between 2015 and 2019 from the same sample. Trajectories of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) were analysed with respect to loneliness, physical activity levels and a number of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Results 3,281 people completed the COVID-19 mental health questionnaire, all had at least one data point prior to 2020. In 2020, the adjusted PHQ-9 score for loneliness was 3.2. (95% CI: 3.0-3.4), an increase of one point on previous years and 2 points higher than people not rated lonely, whose score did not change in 2020 (1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3). PHQ-9 was 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.8) in people with decreased physical activity, an increase of 0.5 on previous years. In contrast, PHQ-9 in 2020 for people whose physical activity had not decreased was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.6-1.8), similar to previous years. A similar relationship was observed for GAD-7 though the differences were smaller and the absolute burden of symptoms lower. Conclusions After accounting for pre-COVID-19 trends, we show that experiencing loneliness and decreased physical activity are risk factors for worsening mental health during the pandemic. Our findings highlight the need to examine policies which target these potentially modifiable risk factors.","Marichi Gupta; Adity Bansal; Bhav Jain; Jillian Rochelle; Atharv Oak; Mohammad S.

"Outpatient screening of health status and lifestyle among post-bariatric patients during the Covid-19 pandemic in Sao Paulo, Brazil","Background/Objectives: This was an out-of-hospital screening of health status and lifestyle during the Covid-19 pandemic in post-operative bariatric patients from Sao Paulo, Brazil, prevented from face-to-face health care. Subjects/Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 66 patients were remotely (via phone call) and in-person (by home visit) assessed for health status and lifestyle habits. Results: Mean age was 47.4 years. Patients were obese grade I (30.0%), II (22.0%), and III (30.0%), and 94.2% had above reference waist circumference values. Sixty-four percent displayed high blood pressure, whereas 24% showed CRP levels above normal range. Nineteen percent of patients reported irregular use of nutritional supplementation and 6.0% reported binge eating habits. Thirty-three exhibited symptoms of depression. Mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms were reported by 27.4% and 11.3% of the patients; 4.5% exhibited suicidal ideation and were referred to a specialist for healthcare. Of relevance, inactive patients (59.6%) had poorer global mental and physical health scores as compared to active peers (both p<0.05).

"Job insecurity, financial threat and mental health in the COVID-19 context: The buffer role of perceived social support","The social distancing, confinement and quarantine adopted since March 2020 to confront the COVID-19 pandemic have affected multiple vital areas, and specially work, business and productive activities. Prior research has highlighted the relation between perceptions of risk in employment and its concomitant financial risk with a myriad of consequences for people's well-being and health. In order to analyze the potential negative consequences of temporary layoffs, downsizing or closure of companies and businesses, and the consequent insecurity about the continuity of employment, the aim of this study is twofold. Firstly, to analyze the relations between the perceptions of job insecurity and financial threat and overall mental health during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of the Chilean adult population. And secondly, to identify the potential buffer effect of perceived social support on this relation. To analyze this, we carried out a cross-sectional study on a non-probabilistic sample aimed at a general Chilean adult population. The results show that both perceptions of job insecurity and financial threat are associated with a decline in perceived mental health. Additionally, results indicate a moderate buffer effect of perceived social support relative to the size of the social network. Thus, in relation to job insecurity and financial threat, the network size mitigates the association of both with the decline in perceived mental health. The theoretical and applied scope of these findings are analyzed, and their challenges and limitations are discussed.","Chenyan Huang; Xi Long; Zhuozhao Zhan; Edwin van den Heuvel; Rickey E.

"Persistent fatigue following SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and independent of severity of initial infection","Fatigue is a common symptom in those presenting with symptomatic COVID-19 infection. However, it is unknown if COVID-19 results in persistent fatigue in those recovered from acute infection. We examined the prevalence of fatigue in individuals recovered from the acute phase of COVID-19 illness using the Chalder Fatigue Score (CFQ-11). We further examined potential predictors of fatigue following COVID-19 infection, evaluating indicators of COVID-19 severity, markers of peripheral immune activation and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Of 128 participants (49.5 {+/-} 15 years; 54% female), more than half reported persistent fatigue (52.3%; 45/128) at 10 weeks (median) after initial COVID-19 symptoms. There was no association between COVID-19 severity (need for inpatient admission, supplemental oxygen or critical care) and fatigue following COVID-19. Additionally, there was no association between routine laboratory markers of inflammation and cell turnover (leukocyte, neutrophil or lymphocyte counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein) or pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-6 or sCD25) and fatigue post COVID-19. Female gender and those with a pre-existing diagnosis of depression/anxiety were over-represented in those with fatigue. Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of post-viral fatigue in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection after the acute phase of COVID-19 illness. This study highlights the importance of assessing those recovering from COVID-19 for symptoms of severe fatigue, irrespective of severity of initial illness, and may identify a group worthy of further study and early intervention.","Chenyan Huang; Xi Long; Zhuozhao Zhan; Edwin van den Heuvel; Rickey E.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health outcomes among hospital fever clinic attendants across Nepal: A community-based cross-sectional study","Background: The COVID 19 pandemic has been creating a panic and distressing situations among the entire population globally including Nepal. No study has been conducted assessing the psychological impact of this pandemic on the general public in Nepal. The objective of this study is to assess the mental health status during COVID 19 outbreak and explore the potential influencing factors among the population attending the hospital fever clinics with COVID 19 symptoms. Methods: A cross sectional survey was conducted between May to June, 2020 with a sample of 645 participants aged 18 and above in 26 hospitals across Nepal. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire along with a validated psychometric tool, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS21) scale. The metrics and scores of symptoms and their severity were created and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of potential covariates with outcome variables. Results: The prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress were 14%, 7% and 5% respectively. Participants from Bagmati province reported higher level of anxiety (OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.42 10.59), while stress (OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.09 21.29) and depressive symptoms (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.10 10.35) observed higher among the participants in Province 1. Women were more at risk of anxiety (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.21 8.20) and depression (2.75, 95% CI 1.16 6.51) than men. Similarly, people with primary level education found more prone to all factors, stress (OR 20.35, 95% CI 2.06 201.19), anxiety (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.24 7.91), and depression (OR 4.41, 95% CI 1.29 15.07). More farmers than labors showed higher odds (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.01 5.01) for anxiety, while individuals surveyed who reported their health status as poor-had higher odds (OR 5.95, 95% CI 1.08 32.68) for depression. Also, people currently living in rented houses reported more stress (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.07 9.05) and those living far from family reported higher rates of depressive symptoms (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.01 12.58). Conclusion: The study identified increased prevalence of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the initial stage of COVID 19 pandemic in Nepal.

"Association between stress and depressive symptoms and the Covid-19 pandemic","Objective: To date, cross-sectional surveys reported frequency and distribution of mental health disorders on convenience samples impacted by Covid-19. Longitudinal assessment of mental health during Covid-19 in a representative population-based sample, however, is currently largely missing. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in perceived stress levels and depressive symptoms measured before and during Covid-19 pandemic in a representative population-based sample. Methods: Baseline data on stress levels and depressive symptoms from a well-established population-based sample were compared with those obtained from self-administered e-questionnaires distributed during Covid-19 pandemic. A total of 715 participants completed e-questionnaires. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test repeated-measure differences, while between-group differences were analysed using Mann-Whitney and the Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Perceived stress levels and depressive symptoms increased 1.4 and 5.5 times, respectively, during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the time prior Covid-19. Changes in stress and depressive symptoms were most significant in females and did not depend on whether one quarantined alone or with others. Feeling of loneliness during Covid-19 pandemic had the greatest impact on increased stress levels and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: This population-based longitudinal study showed that Covid-19 related measures had significant impact on mental health in a general population with the feeling of loneliness identified as the biggest risk factor. This impact indicates the need of timely and tailored treatment of mental health disorders and integration of preventive mental health measures into global public health policies to protect mental health during future pandemics.","Jan Sebastian Novotny; Juan Pablo Gonzalez Rivas; Sarka Kunzova; Maria Skladana; Anna Pospisilova; Anna Polcrova; Jose R Medina Inojosa; Francisco Lopez-Jimenez; Yonas E Geda; Gorazd B Stokin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.28.20163113""","20200729","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5061,""
"Associations of severe COVID-19 with polypharmacy in the REACT-SCOT case-control study","Objectives -- To investigate the relation of severe COVID-19 to prior drug prescribing. Design -- Matched case-control study (REACT-SCOT) based on record linkage to hospital discharges since June 2015 and dispensed prescriptions issued in primary care during the last 240 days. Setting -- Scottish population. Main outcome measure -- Severe COVID-19, defined by entry to critical care or fatal outcome. Participants -- All 4272 cases of severe COVID-19 in Scotland since the start of the epidemic, with 36948 controls matched for age, sex and primary care practice. Results -- Severe COVID-19 was strongly associated with the number of non-cardiovascular drug classes dispensed. This association was strongest in those not resident in care homes, in whom the rate ratio (95% CI) associated with dispensing of 12 or more drug classes versus none was 10.8 (8.7, 13.2), and was not accounted for by treatment of conditions designated as conferring increased risk. Of 17 drug classes postulated at the start of the epidemic to be ""medications compromising COVID"", all were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. The largest effect was for antipsychotic agents: rate ratio 4.14 (3.39, 5.07). Other drug classes with large effects included proton pump inhibitors (rate rato 2.19 (1.70, 2.80) for >= 2 defined daily doses/day), opioids (3.62 (2.65, 4.94) for >= 50 mg morphine equivalent/day) and gabapentinoids. These associations persisted after adjusting for covariates, and were stronger with recent than with non-recent exposure. Conclusions -- Severe COVID-19 is associated with polypharmacy and with drugs that cause sedation, respiratory depression or dyskinesia, have anticholinergic effects or affect the gastrointestinal system. These associations are not easily explained by co-morbidity. Although the evidence for causality is not conclusive, these results support existing guidance on reducing overprescribing of these drug classes and limiting inappropriate polypharmacy as a potential means of reducing COVID-19 risk.

"Targeting the endolysosomal host-SARS-CoV-2 interface by the clinically licensed antidepressant fluoxetine","The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency. As only very limited therapeutic options are clinically available, there is an urgent need for the rapid development of safe, effective, and globally available pharmaceuticals that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and ameliorate COVID-19. In this study, we explored the use of small compounds acting on the homeostasis of the endolysosomal host-pathogen interface, to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that fluoxetine, a widely used antidepressant and a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA), efficiently inhibited the entry and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in the cell culture model without cytotoxic effects and also exerted potent antiviral activity against two currently circulating influenza A virus subtypes, an effect which was also observed upon treatment with the FIASMAs amiodarone and imipramine. Mechanistically, fluoxetine induced both impaired endolysosomal acidification and the accumulation of cholesterol within the endosomes.

Method and Material Online and telephonic interviews are conducted among 274 HCPs working in 24 PHCs (17 rural and 7 urban), across 13 districts of Rajasthan. Five dimensions of vulnerability covering awareness, exposure to infection (daily contact; contact with high risk individuals), physical and mental health conditions, while three aspects of preparedness at individual (personal care) and facility (provider safety; management and supervision) level are measured by employing factor analysis. Generalized ordered logit regression model is used to measure the effect of preparedness on COVID19 related vulnerability. Result: Among the 274 HCPs, majority of the staff are from rural PHCs (76 %), less than 35 years (87%), female (57%) and married (57 %). Almost half have high level exposure to COVID19, with mean contact rate is 90. Overall, 26% have comprehensive knowledge on COVID19, and 32% have any mental health issues. Although more than 70% of HCPs have reported more than one individual level preparedness, mental health measures adopted by the HCPs are comparably low. The facility level preparedness for enhancing safety are high such as social distance (79%) and maintaining record of each visitor (75%). However, management related measures adopted by the PHCs are perceived to be lower than the safety measures. The regression analyses suggest that safety related preparedness is significantly associated with reduction of vulnerability by 50%. The management-level preparedness has statistically no significant effect in explaining the variations in level of vulnerability. Conclusion: The facility-level safety measures, which lowers chances of acquiring infection has a positive effect on reducing vulnerability of COVID19. However, the HCPs do not have adequate preparedness at individual, facility management (PHC) and system level to reduce COVID19 vulnerability. Findings suggest that there is a need for a non-conventional approach of monitoring and supervision, in the absence of such measures there is a chance of moral injury that will make the HCPs at the primary level vulnerable to both physiologically and psychologically.","Thomas Reiter; Sahra Pajenda; Ludwig Wagner; Martina Gaggl; Johanna Atamaniuk; Barbara Holzer","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.20149443""","20200726","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5064,""
"Healthcare Workers' Mental Health and Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK: Contrasting Guidelines with Experiences in Practice","Background Substantial evidence has highlighted the importance of considering healthcare workers' (HCW) mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and several organisations have issued guidelines with recommendations. However, the definition of wellbeing and the evidence-base behind such guidelines remains unclear. Objectives Assessing the applicability of wellbeing guidelines in practice; identify unaddressed HCWs' needs; and provide recommendations for supporting frontline staff during the current and future pandemics. Methods and Design This paper discusses the findings of a qualitative study based on interviews with frontline healthcare staff in the UK and examines them in relation to a rapid review of wellbeing guidelines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results 14 guidelines were included in the rapid review and 33 interviews with HCWs were conducted in the qualitative study. As a whole, the guidelines placed greater emphasis on wellbeing at an individual level, while HCWs placed greater emphasis on structural conditions at work, such as understaffing and the invaluable support of the community. This in turn had implications for the focus of wellbeing intervention strategies; staff reported an increased availability of formal mental health support, however, understaffing or clashing schedules prevented them from participating in these activities. Conclusion HCWs expressed wellbeing needs which align with social-ecological conceptualisations of wellbeing related to quality of life. This approach to wellbeing has been highlighted in literature about HCWs support in previous health emergencies, yet it has not been monitored during this pandemic. Wellbeing guidelines should explore staff's needs and contextual characteristics affecting the implementation of recommendations.","Thomas Reiter; Sahra Pajenda; Ludwig Wagner; Martina Gaggl; Johanna Atamaniuk; Barbara Holzer; Irene Zimpernik; Daniela Gerges; Katharina Mayer; Christof Aigner; Robert Strassl","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.20156711""","20200726","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5065,""
"We are at risk too: The disparate impacts of the pandemic on younger generations","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound global impact with high rates of morbidity and mortality. It is essential to understand the psychosocial impacts of the pandemic to identify appropriate prevention and intervention targets. Across generational groups, this study examined: (1) rates of precautions and adaptive and maladaptive health behaviours, (2) differences in levels of anxiety, and (3) rates of and changes in COVID-related concerns over time during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Canada. Methods: We analyzed data from two Canadian population-based datasets: the Canadian Perspective Survey Series: Impact of COVID-19 survey (N=4,627; March 29-April 3, 2020), and Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians: Your Mental Health (N=45,989; April 24-May 11, 2020). We categorized generational age group, participants self-reported changes in behaviours and COVID-related concerns, and a validated measure assessed anxiety symptoms. Results: There are age differences in behavioural responses to the pandemic; adaptive health habits (e.g., exercise) were stable across groups, while maladaptive health habits (e.g., substance use) were highest among younger groups. COVID-related precautions were also highest among the younger generations, with Generation X exhibiting the highest rate of precautionary behaviour. Results also revealed that anxiety and worry are prevalent in response to the pandemic across all generations, with the highest rate of clinically significant anxiety among Millennials (36.0%). Finally, COVID-related concerns are greatest for younger generations and appear to be decreasing with time. Conclusion: These early data are essential in understanding at-risk groups given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its potential long-term implications.","Omar Hasan Ali; David Bomze","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.21.20159236""","20200724","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5066,""

"Explainable-Machine-Learning to discover drivers and to predict mental illness during COVID-19","Importance: COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected the health, economic, and social fabric of nations. Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Objective: This work is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID pandemic. Data Sources and Study design: In this study, We have used a survey of 17764 adults in the USA at different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Methods: Through initial statistical analysis followed by Bayesian Network inference, we have identified key factors affecting Mental health during the COVID pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches lead to effective modeling of the level of mental health. Results: Overall, females are more stressed than males, and people of age-group 18-29 are more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian Network Model, we found that people with chronic medical condition of mental illness are more prone to mental disorders during the COVID age. The new realities of working from home, home-schooling, and lack of communication with family/friends/neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during COVID generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised ML models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy.","Marina Johnson; Helen Wagstaffe; Kimberly C Gilmour; Annabelle Lea Mai; Joanna Lewis","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.19.20157164""","20200721","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5068,""
"Bioaersols in orthopedic surgical procedures and implications for clinical practice in the times of COVID-19 pandemic: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Background Orthopedic surgical procedures involve a number of aerosol generating procedures; these include electrocautery, power instruments for bone cutting, burring and drilling, and tools for wound lavage. This assumes a great significance in the context of the current COVD-19 pandemic, as there are chances of aerosol-borne disease transmission in orthopedic surgical procedures. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis will be undertaken to assimilate and analyse the available evidence on bioaerosols in orthopedic surgical procedures and their significance with respect to SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. Objectives To determine the characteristics (amount and/or density, size, infectivity, and spread etc.) of bioaerosols found in orthopaedic operating rooms (ORs) and to determine the characteristics of aerosols generated by different orthopaedic power tools and devices. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted. The PRISMA guidelines will be strictly followed. The primary search will be conducted on the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxix and Lancet preprint databases, using a well-defined search strategy. Any original research study (including cohort, case-control, case series, cadaveric studies and studies, animal models, laboratory based experimental studies) looking at aerosol generation in orthopedic surgical procedures, or aerosol generation by orthopaedic power tools and devices will included. Outcome measures will include characteristics (amount and/or density, size, infectivity, and spread etc.) of bioaerosols found in orthopaedic operating rooms (ORs) and those generated by various orthopaedics power tools and devices. Metanalysis using the random-effects model will be conducted to determined pooled estimates of the outcome variables. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the I2 test. Risk of bias will be assessed by the Risk of Bias in Studies estimating Prevalence of Exposure to Occupational risk factors (RoB-SPEO) tool.

"Gender and trust in government modify the association between mental health and stringency of social distancing related public health measures to reduce COVID-19: a global online survey","Objectives: To investigate the associations between stringency of COVID-19 social distancing policies and mental health outcomes, and the moderating effect of trust in government and gender. Design and setting: Cross sectional study involving secondary analysis of publicly available data from a global online COVID-19 survey and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Participants: 106,497 participants from 58 countries. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were a worries index and a depression index. Predictors were stringency of policies, trust in government, and gender. Multivariable regression was conducted to determine the three-way interaction between the predictor variables for mental health outcomes, adjusting for age, income and education. Results: The median age of participants (56.4% women) was 37 years (interquartile range 29 to 48 years). Women had higher worries and depression scores than men. 45.4% distrusted the government and 43.8% trusted the government to take care of its citizens. Among those who strongly trusted the government, an increase in the stringency of policies was associated with a significant increase in the worries index. Among men who distrusted the government, an increase in policy stringency was associated with an increase in the depression index but not the worries index. In women that strongly distrusted the government, there was an inversed U-shaped association between policy stringency and both the worries and depression indices. Conclusion: As the stringency of public health measures increases, so too do depression and worries. The association is moderated by gender and trust in government. For safe and effective public health measures, governments should develop strategies to increase trust in their actions.","Aubin Moutal; Laurent F Martin; Lisa Boinon","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.16.20155200""","20200719","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5070,""
"DETERMINANTS OF BURNOUT AND OTHER ASPECTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING IN HEALTHCARE WORKERS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A MULTINATIONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY","Background The Covid-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems and workers around the world. Such pressures may impact on working conditions, psychological wellbeing and perception of safety. In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. Methods From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Results Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49-2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84), and other clinical staff (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45-2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98-2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92-6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04-5.42). Factors significantly protective for burnout included being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51-0.82) and top quartile SAQ score (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.40). Significant factors associated with anxiety and depression, included burnout, gender, safety attitudes and job role. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of burnout, anxiety, and depression amongst healthcare workers. A strong association was seen between SARS-CoV-2 testing, safety attitudes, gender, job role, redeployment and psychological state. These findings highlight the importance of targeted support services for at risk groups and proactive SARS-CoV-2 testing of healthcare workers.","Aubin Moutal; Laurent F Martin; Lisa Boinon; Kimberly Gomez; Dongzhi Ran; Yuan Zhou; Harrison J Stratton; Cai Song; Shizhen Luo; Kerry Beth Gonzalez; Samantha Perez-Miller; Amol Patwardhan; Mohab Ibrahim; Rajesh Khanna; Kang Sim; Lucas Lim; Lifeng Tan; Melanie Tan; Vijay Sharma; Shirley Ooi; Jasmine Winter Beatty; Kelsey Flott; Sam Mason; Swathikan Chidambaram; Seema Yalamanchili; Gabriela Zbikowska; Jaroslaw Fedorowski; Grazyna Dykowska; Mary Wells; Sanjay Purkayastha; James Kinross","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.16.20155622""","20200718","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5071,""
"An overview of current mental health in the general population of Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the COLLATE project","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses significant mental health challenges globally; however, to date, there is limited community level data. This study reports on the first wave of data from the COLLATE project (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy), an ongoing study aimed at understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of Australians. This paper addresses prevailing primary concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, current levels of negative emotions and risk factors predicting these negative emotions. On April 1st to 4th 2020, 5158 adult members of the Australian general public completed an online survey. Participants ranked their top ten current primary concerns about COVID-19, and completed standardized measures to ascertain levels of negative emotions (specifically, depression, anxiety and stress). Socio-demographic information was also collected and used in the assessment of risk factors. The top three primary concerns were all related to the health and well-being of family and loved ones. As expected, levels of negative emotion were exceptionally high. Modelling of predictors of negative emotions established several risk factors related to demographic variables, personal vulnerabilities, financial stresses, and social distancing experiences; particularly being young, being female, or having a mental illness diagnosis. The data provides important characterization of the current mental health of Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Critically, it appears that specific groups in the Australian community may need special attention to ensure their mental health is protected during these difficult times. The data further suggests the need for immediate action to combat high levels of psychological distress, along with the exacerbation of mental health conditions, in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. These results may provide some direction for international researchers hoping to characterize similar issues in other countries.","Aubin Moutal; Laurent F Martin; Lisa Boinon; Kimberly Gomez; Dongzhi Ran; Yuan Zhou; Harrison J Stratton","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.16.20155887""","20200718","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5072,""
"Emerging Mental Health Challenges, Strategies and Opportunities in the context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives from South American Decision-makers","Background Mental health awareness has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although international guidelines address the mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) response to emergencies, regional recommendations on COVID-19 are still insufficient. We identified emerging mental health problems, strategies to address them, and opportunities to reform mental health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic in South America. Methods An anonymous online questionnaire was sent to mental health decision-makers of Ministries of Health in 10 South American countries in mid-April 2020. The semi-structured questionnaire had 12 questions clustered into 3 main sections: emerging challenges in mental health, current and potential strategies to face the pandemic, and, key elements for mental health reform. We identified keywords and themes for each section through summative content analysis. Findings An increasing mental health burden and emerging needs are arising as direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic among health care providers and the general population. National lockdowns challenge the delivery and access to mental health treatment and care. Strategies to meet these health needs rely heavily on timely and adequate responses by strengthened mental health governance and systems, availability of services, virtual platforms, and appropriate capacity building for service providers. Short- and medium-term strategies focused on bolstering community-based mental health networks and telemedicine for high-risk populations. Opportunities for long-term mental health reform entail strengthening legal frameworks, redistribution of financial resources and collaboration with local and international partners. Interpretation Mental health and psychosocial support have been identified as a priority area by South American countries in the COVID-19 response. The pandemic has generated specific needs that require appropriate actions including: implementing virtual based interventions, orienting capacity building towards protection of users and health providers, strengthening evidence-driven decision making and integrating MHPSS in high-level mechanisms guiding the response to COVID-19.

"The psychological impact of 'mild lockdown' in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide survey under a declared state of emergency","This study examined the psychological distress caused by non-coercive lockdown (mild lockdown) in Japan. An online survey was conducted with 11,333 people (52.4% women; mean age = 46.3 {+/-} 14.6 years, range = 18-89 years) during the mild lockdown in the seven prefectures most affected by COVID-19 infection. Over one-third (36.6%) of participants experienced mild-to-moderate psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K6] score 5-12), while 11.5% reported serious psychological distress (K6 score [&ge;] 13). The estimated prevalence of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score [&ge;] 10) was 17.9%. Regarding the distribution of K6 scores, the proportion of individuals displaying psychological distress in this study was significantly higher compared to previous national survey data from 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019. Healthcare workers, those with a history of treatment for mental illness, and younger participants (aged 18-19 or 20-39 years) were particularly vulnerable. Psychological distress severity was influenced by specific interactional structures of risk factors: high loneliness, poor interpersonal relationships, COVID-19-related sleeplessness and anxiety, deterioration of household economy, and work and academic difficulties. Flexible approaches that are optimised for the difficulties specific to each individual through cross-disciplinary public-private initiatives are important to combat lockdown-induced mental health problems.","Andrei Khrennikov; Seema Patrikar; PS Sarma; Biju Soman; Donghai Wang","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.17.20156125""","20200717","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5075,""
"Direct-to-Consumer Chat-Based Remote Care Before and During the COVID-19 Outbreak","Objective. To compare the patient population, common complaints, and physician recommendations in direct-to-consumer chat-based consults, before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data sources. Data on patient characteristics, patient complaints, and physician recommendations from 36,864 chat-based telemedicine consults with physicians in an online-clinic by patients from across the United States between April 2019 and April 2020. Study Design. We perform a retrospective analysis comparing patient characteristics, visit characteristics, and physician recommendation before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. We examine patient age and gender, visit time, patient chief complains, and physician medical recommendation (including prescription drugs, reassurance, and referrals). Principal Findings. Before March 2020, most patients were female (75 percent) and 18-44 years old (89 percent). Common complaints such as abdominal pain, dysuria, or sore throat suggested minor acute conditions. Most cases (67 percent) were resolved remotely, mainly via prescriptions; a minority were referred. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 emergency has led to a sharp (fourfold) increase in case volume, including more males (from 25 to 29 percent), patients aged 45 and older (from 11 to 17 percent), and more cases involving mental health complaints and complaints related to COVID-19. Across all symptoms, significantly more cases (78 percent) have been resolved remotely. Conclusions. The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has been associated with a sharp increase in the use of chat-based telemedicine services, including by new patient demographics, an increase in both COVID-19 and mental health complains, and an increase in remote case resolutions.","Mohammad Hosny Hussein; Eman Ali Toraih; Abdallah S Attia; Mohanad Youssef","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.14.20153775""","20200716","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5076,""

Whilst women reported more positive changes in exercise behaviour, young people (18-29y) reported more negative changes (both p<0.001). Individuals who engaged in more physical activity reported better mental health and well-being (p<0.001). Although there were no differences in physical activity between countries, individuals in New Zealand reported better mental health and well-being (p<0.001). Conclusion: The COVID-19 restrictions have differentially impacted upon the physical activity habits of individuals based upon their age and sex, and therefore have important implications for international policy and guideline recommendations. Public health interventions that encourage physical activity should target specific groups (e.g., men, young adults) who are most vulnerable to the negative effects of physical distancing and/or self-isolation.","Mohammad Hosny Hussein; Eman Ali Toraih; Abdallah S Attia; Mohanad Youssef; Mahmoud Omar; Nicholas Burley; Allen D Zhang; Jackson Roos; August Houghton; Nedum Aniemeka; Mohamed Ahmed Shama; Juan Duchesne; Emad Kandil; John Jakeman; Kelly A Mackintosh; Melitta A McNarry; Andrew Mitchelmore; John Murphy; Helen Ryan-Stewart; Zoe Saynor; Mia Schaumberg; Keeron Stone; Lee Stoner; Beth Stuart; Danielle Lambrick","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.15.20153791""","20200716","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5077,""
"Excess mortality in mental health service users during the COVID-19 pandemic described by ethnic group: South London and Maudsley data","The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK was accompanied by excess all-cause mortality at a national level, only part of which was accounted for by known infections. Excess mortality has previously been described in people who had received care from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM), a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London. The SLaM Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource receives 24-hourly updates from its full electronic health record, including regularly sourced national mortality on all past and present SLaM service users. The SLaM urban catchment has high levels of deprivation and is ethnically diverse, so the objective of the descriptive analyses reported in this manuscript was to compare mortality in SLaM service users from 16th March to 15th May 2020 to that for the same period in 2019 within specific ethnic groups: i) White British, ii) Other White, iii) Black African/Caribbean, iv) South Asian, v) Other, and vi) missing/not stated. For Black African/Caribbean patients (the largest minority ethnic group) this ratio was 3.33, compared to 2.47 for White British patients. Considering premature mortality (restricting to deaths below age 70), these ratios were 2.74 and 1.96 respectively.

Design: Multicenter observational retrospective cohort study. Setting: Greater Paris University hospitals, France. Participants: 7,345 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 24 January and 1 April 2020, including 460 patients (6.3%) who received an antidepressant during the visit. Data source: Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse. Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received antidepressants and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, and comorbidities), disease severity and other psychotropic medications. The primary analyses were multivariable Cox models with inverse probability weighting. Results: Over a mean follow-up of 18.5 days (SD=27.1), 1,331 patients (18.1%) had a primary end-point event. Unadjusted hazard ratio estimates of the association between antidepressant use and the primary outcome stratified by age (i.e., 18-50, 51-70, 71-80, and 81+) were non-significant (all p>0.072), except in the group of patients aged 71-80 years (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.98; p=0.041). Following adjustments, the primary analyses showed a significant association between use of any antidepressant (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.80; p<0.001), SSRI (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.75; p<0.001), and SNRI (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.96; p=0.034), and reduced risk of intubation or death. Specifically, exposures to escitalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine were significantly associated with lower risk of intubation or death (all p<0.05). These associations remain significant in multiple sensitivity analyses, except for the association between SNRI use and the outcome. Conclusions: SSRI use could be associated with lower risk of death or intubation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Double-blind controlled randomized clinical trials of these medications for COVID-19 are needed.","Eva L.H. TSUI; Carrie Lui; Pauline P.S. Woo; Alan T.L. CHEUNG; Peggo K.W. Lam; T.W. Tang; C.F.

"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown Policy on Homicide, Suicide, and Motor Vehicle Deaths in Peru","Introduction: Although lockdown measures to stop COVID-19 have direct effects on disease transmission, their impact on violent and accidental deaths remains unknown. Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Methods: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. Results: All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and 3.64 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-5.25, -2.03). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was twice the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in suicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:0.06, 7.18). No other change in slope was detected. Conclusions: Violent and accidental deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in suicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.","Eva L.H.

"Stress, burnout and depression in women in health care during COVID-19 Pandemic: Rapid Scoping Review","ABSTRACT Objectives The overall objectives of this rapid scoping review are to (a) synthesize the common triggers of stress, burnout, and depression faced by women in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) identify individual-, organizational-, and systems-level interventions that can support the well-being of women HCWs during a pandemic. Design This scoping review is registered on Open Science Framework (OSF) and was guided by the JBI guide to scoping reviews and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension to scoping reviews. A systematic search of literature databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and ERIC) was conducted from 2003 until June 12, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Interventions We included review articles and primary studies that reported on stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs; that primarily focused on women; and that included the percentage or number of women included. All English language studies from any geographical setting where COVID-19 has affected the population were reviewed. Primary and secondary outcome measures Studies reporting on mental health outcomes (e.g., stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs), interventions to support mental health well-being were included. Results Of the 2,803 papers found, 31 were included. The triggers of stress, burnout and depression are grouped under individual-, organizational-, and systems-level factors. There is a limited amount of evidence on effective interventions that prevents anxiety, stress, burnout and depression during a pandemic. Conclusions Our preliminary findings show that women HCWs are at increased risk for stress, burnout, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are triggered by individual level factors such as lack of social support; family status; organizational factors such as access to personal protective equipment or high workload; and systems-level factors such as prevalence of COVID-19, rapidly changing public health guidelines, and a lack of recognition at work.

"PT150 is a modulator of glucocorticoid and androgen receptors with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2","PT150 is a clinical stage molecule, taken orally, with a strong safety profile having completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for its original use as an anti-depressant. It has an active IND for COVID-19. Antiviral activities have been found for PT150 and other members of its class in a variety of virus families; thus, it was now tested against SARS-CoV-2 in human bronchial epithelial lining cells and showed effective 90% inhibitory antiviral concentration (EC90) of 5.55 M. PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) binding molecules. In vivo, their predominant net effect is one of systemic glucocorticoid antagonism, but they also show direct downregulation of AR and minor GR agonism at the cellular level. We hypothesize that anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity depends in part on this AR downregulation through diminished TMPRSS2 expression and modulation of ACE2 activity. Given that hypercortisolemia is now suggested to be a significant co-factor for COVID-19 progression, we also postulate an additive role for its potent immunomodulatory effects through systemic antagonism of cortisol.","Santiago Justo Arevalo; Daniela Zapata Sifuentes; Cesar Huallpa Robles; Gianfranco Landa Bianchi; Adriana Castillo Chavez; Romina Garavito-Salini Casas; Guillermo Uceda-Campos; Roberto Pineda Chavarria; Christian Stevens; Benhur Lee; Shuibing Chen","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.12.199505""","20200713","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5082,""
"Psychological state and family functioning of University of Ibadan students during the COVID-19 lockdown","Background: The curtailment of social gatherings as well as lack of online academic engagement, due to the COVID-19 lockdown, could have potentially damaging effects on the psychological state of university students in Nigeria. This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression, including associated factors and coping methods among undergraduate students in a Nigerian university. It also examined the association between psychological state and family functioning. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional and involved 386 undergraduate students across the main faculties. The university's ethical review board approved the study with approval number UI/EC/20/0242. An online questionnaire, using Google form, was circulated among the students through their faculty representatives. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs) was used in assessing anxiety and depression, while family functioning was assessed using the McMaster Family Assessment Device, (FAD). Data was entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), and analysis carried out using descriptive statistics, chi-square, independent t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Post-Hoc analysis and linear logistics regression, at  0.05. Results: The mean age was 21 {+/-} 2.9 years, with a female population of 60.1%. Prevalence of anxiety and depression were 41.5% and 31.9% respectively. Students in health-related faculties were significantly less anxious than those in other faculties. Inability to afford three square meals, negative family functioning, having a chronic illness and living in a State/Region with a high incidence of COVID-19, was significantly associated with depression. These factors jointly accounted for 14% of depression seen in undergraduate students. Most of the students coped by engaging themselves in social media, watching television/movies and participating in other online skill development programmes. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of anxiety and depression among university students with poor family functioning, inability to afford three meals/day, living in a state with a high incidence of COVID-19 and having a chronic illness, contributing to depression. Measures need to be taken to support undergraduate students and their families to prevent the negative consequences of poor mental health.

"Negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quantitative parameters, quality, and circadian alignment: Implications for psychological well-being and emotional regulation","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, affecting millions of people and exposing them to home quarantine, isolation, and social distancing. While recent reports showed increased distress and depressive/anxiety state related to COVID-19 crisis, we investigated how home quarantine affected sleep parameters in healthy individuals. Methods 160 healthy individuals who were in home quarantine in April 2020 for at least one month participated in this study. Participants rated and compared their quantitative sleep parameters (time to go to bed, sleep duration, getting-up time) and sleep quality factors, pre-and during home quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, participants chronotype was determined to see if sleep parameters are differentially affected in different chronotypes. Results The time to fall asleep and get-up in the morning were significantly delayed in all participants, indicating a significant circadian misalignment. Sleep quality was reported to be significantly poorer in all participants and chronotypes, and included more daily disturbances (more sleep disturbances, higher daily dysfunctions due to low quality of sleep) and less perceived sleep quality (lower subjective sleep quality, longer time taken to fall asleep at night, more use of sleep medication for improving sleep quality) during home quarantine. Conclusions Home quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic has a detrimental impact on sleep quality. Online interventions including self-help sleep programs, stress management, relaxation practices, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, and mindfulness training are available interventions in the current situation.","Steffen Klein; Thorsten G.

"ALeRT-COVID: Attentive Lockdown-awaRe Transfer Learning for Predicting COVID-19 Pandemics in Different Countries","Countries across the world are in different stages of COVID-19 trajectory, among which many have implemented the lockdown measures to prevent its spread. Although the lockdown is effective in such prevention, it may put the economy into a depression. Predicting the epidemic progression with government switching the lockdown on or off is critical. We propose a transfer learning approach called ALeRT-COVID using attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to predict the epidemic trends for different countries. A source model was trained on the pre-defined source countries and then transferred to each target country. The lockdown measure was introduced to our model as a predictor and the attention mechanism was utilized to learn the different contributions of the confirmed cases in the past days to the future trend. Results demonstrated that the transfer learning strategy is helpful especially for early-stage countries. By introducing the lockdown predictor and the attention mechanism, ALeRT-COVID showed a significant improvement on the prediction performance. We predicted the confirmed cases in one week when extending and easing lockdown separately. Results showed the lockdown measures is still necessary for a number of countries. We expect our research can help different countries to make better decisions on the lockdown measures.","Benjamin Schwarz; Lokesh Sharma; Lydia Roberts; Xiaohua Peng; Santos Bermejo; Ian Leighton; Arnau Casanovas Massana; Shelli Farhadian","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.09.20149831""","20200710","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5085,""
"Predictors of Anxiety Regarding The COVID-19 Pandemic Among Health-care Workers in a Hospital Not Assigned to Manage COVID-19 Patients in Nepal","Introduction: We studied the levels and severity of anxiety caused by COVID-19 amongst frontline health-care workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care neurological hospital in Nepal, not assigned to manage COVID-19 cases. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 frontline Health Care Workers (HCWs) using a 10-point subjective assessment tool, the Anxiety Level Index (ALI), and the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Score (SAS), to assess the level of anxiety regarding COVID-19. Results: On ALI 55% of HCWs were found to have marked severe anxiety (6-9), however, on SAS 44% of HCWs reported anxiety. The majority HCWs were female (n=78) with nurses forming 62% of the sample size. The mean age was 26.8 years (SD 8.17). Factors associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety regarding COVID-19 on ALI were age (p=0.002), sex (p=0.001), receiving regular COVID-19 updates via social media (p=0.011) and a high frequency of checking for COVID-19 information authenticity (p=0.039). Work experience (p=0.026) and frequency of checking for information authenticity (p=0.029) were factors found to increase SAS measured anxiety and were found to be associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that respondents with work experience of less than or equal to 2 years were 0.380 (95% CI 0.158 to 0.910) times less likely to have anxiety than those with work experience of more than 2 years. Similarly, the odds of having anxiety among those who checked information authenticity less frequently was 0.377 (95% CI 0.153 to 0.931) times less than those who often did. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a substantial impact on the mental health of frontline HCWs in a hospital not assigned to manage COVID-19 patients. Length of time of worked in healthcare and the frequency of checking for COVID-19-related information were significant predictors of anxiety.","Benjamin Schwarz; Lokesh Sharma; Lydia Roberts; Xiaohua Peng; Santos Bermejo; Ian Leighton; Arnau Casanovas Massana; Shelli Farhadian; Albert Ko; - IMPACT Yale IMPACT team; Charles DelaCruz","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.08.20148866""","20200710","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5086,""
"Sleep quality, mental health and circadian rhythms during COVID lockdown: Results from the SleepQuest Study","Behavioural responses to COVID19 lockdown will define the long-term impact of psychological stressors on sleep and brain health. Here we tease apart factors that help protect against sleep disturbance. We capitalise on the unique restrictions during COVID19 to understand how time of day of daylight exposure and outside exercise interact with chronotype and sleep quality. 3474 people from the UK (median age 62, range 18 to 91) completed our online 'SleepQuest' Study between 29th April and 13th May 2020 - a set of validated questionnaires probing sleep quality, depression, anxiety and attitudes to sleep alongside bespoke questions on the effect of COVID19 lockdown on sleep, time spent outside and exercising and self-help sleep measures. Significantly more people (n=1252) reported worsened than improved sleep (n=562) during lockdown (p<0.0001). Factors significantly associated with worsened sleep included low mood (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) and suspected, proven or at risk of COVID19 symptoms (all p<0.03). Sleep improvement was related to the increased length of time spent outside (P<0.01). Older people's sleep quality was less affected than younger people by COVID19 lockdown (p<0.001). Better sleep quality was associated with going outside and exercising earlier, rather than later, in the day. However, the benefit of being outside early is driven by improved sleep in 'owl' (p=0.0002) and not 'lark' (p=0.27) chronotype, whereas, the benefit of early exercise (inside or outside) did not depend on chronotype. Defining the interaction between chronotype, mental health and behaviour will be critical for targeted lifestyle adaptations to protect brain health through current and future crises.","Benjamin Schwarz; Lokesh Sharma; Lydia Roberts; Xiaohua Peng; Santos Bermejo; Ian Leighton; Arnau Casanovas Massana; Shelli Farhadian","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.08.20148171""","20200710","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5087,""
"The mental health impact of COVID-19 and pandemic related stressors among adults in the UK","Background: The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a wide range of social and economic changes that could, in turn, have affected the mental health of the UK adult population. Previous research has not been able to measure the broad range of potential stressors, nor examine whether recent changes in those stressors have positively or negatively impacted on common mental disorders. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the stressful impact of the lockdown on mental health has accumulated over time or whether people have adapted to the new conditions of lockdown. This study examines whether there was an increase in the prevalence and incidence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD) in the UK adult population during the first few months of lockdown related to the coronavirus pandemic and whether changes in CMD were associated with an increase in stressors related to lockdown and the pandemic. Methods: Longitudinal data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (wave 9: 2017-2019 and waves 1 and 2 of the Coronavirus survey in April and May 2020 respectively), a representative sample of UK population, were analysed. Common mental disorders (CMD) were measured using the GHQ-12 (cut off >2) at all waves. The difference in the GHQ-12 (using Likert scores) between waves measured changes in psychological well-being. The incidence of CMD and changes in psychological well-being were analysed in relation to pandemic specific stressors and changes in economic, financial, household and psychosocial stressors. Findings: Around 30% of UKHLS adults without CMD in 2017/9 had a CMD in April 2020. However from April to May 2020, the incidence reduced considerably to below 13%. Much of the increase in incident CMD between April and May was associated with an increase in feelings of loneliness, but some of this increase was also associated with increasing domestic work demands (arising out of childcare and home-schooling), working from home, and the receipt of care from outside the home. The reduction in the incidence of many of these stressors in May (compared to April) coincided with a reduction in the incidence of CMD in May. Conclusion: The pandemic and resultant lockdown were associated with an increase in the incidence of CMD in the UK adult population initially in April 2020. These changes were associated with increases in feelings of loneliness and stressors related to work and domestic life and receipt of care. There was some evidence of adaptation to many of these stressors over the lockdown period by May 2020. However, if levels of unemployment and redundancy increase in the near future, the implications for the mental health of the population need careful thought and monitoring.","Ouail Ouchetto; Asmaa Drissi Bourhanbour; Joseph Wilson; Nicholas Clements","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.05.20146738""","20200707","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5088,""

"Are Our COVID Warriors Cared-for Enough?A Nationwide Survey on Stress Among Doctors During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Limited and uneven accessibility to healthcare is a major impediment in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic which continues on inexorably, across various parts of the globe. We conducted a nationwide survey of a large sample of Indian doctors to measure levels of perceived stress, identify risk factors for severe stress and assess their response to current issues related to safety and well-being of the HCP community. The survey found severely stressed doctors to be younger (<45years), of female gender working in the ICU setting and insecure regarding their finances. Concern regarding PPE shortages and ethical dilemmas of rationing care are factors inducing severe stress amongst doctors working in ICU settings. This is the first such survey done in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic from the Indian sub-continent. The findings have important implications on the International healthcare community, especially across Africa, Asia & South America where the contagion continues to wreak havoc. The survey has identified factors which adversely impact the mental health of doctors during this Pandemic. This can act as a valuable guide for governmental authorities, professional organisations and hospital managements to establish support systems at multiple levels for these COVID Warriors.","W.

"The mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic onhealthcare workers, and interventions to help them: a rapid systematic review","Background: The covid-19 pandemic has heavily burdened, and in some cases overwhelmed, healthcare systems throughout the world. Healthcare workers are not only at heightened risk of infection, but also of adverse mental health outcomes. Identification of organizational, collegial and individual risk and resilience factors impacting the mental health of healthcare workers are needed to inform preparedness planning and sustainable response. Methods: We performed a rapid systematic review to identify, assess and summarize available research on the mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers. On 11 May 2020, we utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence, the visualization of a database of 20,738 screened studies, to identify studies for inclusion. We included studies reporting on any type of mental health outcome in any type of healthcare workers during the pandemic. We described interventions reported by the studies, and narratively summarized mental health-related outcomes, as study heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. We assessed study quality using design-specific instruments. Results: We included 59 studies, reporting on a total of 54,707 healthcare workers. The prevalence of general psychological distress across the studies ranged from 7-97% (median 37%), anxiety 9-90% (median 24%), depression 5-51% (median 21%), and sleeping problems 34-65% (median 37%). Seven studies reported on implementing mental health interventions, and most focused on individual symptom reduction, but none reported on effects of the interventions. In most studies, healthcare workers reported low interest in and use of professional help, and greater reliance on social support and contact with family and friends. Exposure to covid-19 was the most commonly reported correlate of mental health problems, followed by female gender, and worry about infection or about infecting others. Social support correlated with less mental health problems. Discussion: Healthcare workers in a variety of fields, positions, and exposure risks are reporting anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic, but most studies do not report comparative data on mental health symptoms. before the pandemic. There seems to be a mismatch between risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers in the current pandemic and their needs and preferences, and the individual psychopathology focus of current interventions. Efforts to help healthcare workers sustain healthy relationships to colleagues, family and friends over time may be paramount to safeguard what is already an important source of support during the prolonged crisis. Expanding interventions' focus to incorporate organizational, collegial and family factors to support healthcare workers responding to the pandemic could improve acceptability and efficacy of interventions. Other: The protocol for this review is available online.

"Psychiatric symptoms, risk, and protective factors among university students in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","This study investigated psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress) during state-enforced quarantine among university students in China. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 1,912 university students during March and April 2020. Psychiatric symptoms in the mild or higher range based on clinical cut-offs were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress symptoms, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed some degree of suicidal ideation. We explored factors that may contribute to poor psychological health as well as those that may function as protective factors. Risk and protective factors examined included demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across psychiatric symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity. Average screen media device usage was 6 hours and usage was positively associated with depression. Female gender and COVID-19 prosocial behavior were associated with higher anxiety, while COVID-19 self-efficacy associated with lower anxiety symptoms. Study limitations and implications for treatment and prevention of affective disorders during crisis are discussed.","Nazanin Kermani; Woo-jung Song; Alan Lunt; Yusef Badi; Ali Versi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.03.20144931""","20200704","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5093,""

Method: In April 2020, n = 4271 German adults completed an online survey including mental health questionnaires regarding depression (PHQ-D), anxiety (PHQ-D) and sleep (PSQI), as well as questionnaires related to protective factors such as exercise (BSA-F), physical activity-related health competence (PAHCO) and social support (F-SozU). Results: Complete case analysis (n = 3700; mean age 33.13 {+/-} 11.73 years, 78.6 % females) resulted in elevated prevalence of depressive disorder (31.4%), panic disorder (5.7%) and other anxiety disorders (7.4%). 58.3% reported symptoms of insomnia. Three separate models of multiple regression were conducted. Perceived social support was associated with lower values of anxiety (beta = -0.10; t(19) = -6.46; p >0.001), lower values of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.22; t(19) = -15.71; p < .001) and lower values of sleeping disorder symptoms (beta = -0.15; t(19) = -9.55; p < .001). Change towards less exercise compared to the time before Covid-19 was associated with and higher values of anxiety (beta = -0.05; t(19) = -2.85; p= .004), higher values of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.08; t(19) = -5.69; p < .001), and higher values of sleeping disorder symptoms (beta = -0.07; t(19) = -4.54; p < .000). Post-hoc analysis (ANOVAs) revealed that a change towards less exercise was significantly associated with more depressive, anxiety and sleeping disorder symptoms whereas a positive change was not. No significant association was found for exercise in minutes per week for all outcomes. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a negative impact on mental health in the German population. Social Support and a stable amount of exercise might attenuate these negative mental health consequences. Ongoing monitoring of the impact of the pandemic on mental health and possible protective factors is needed in order to create a basis for the development of appropriate prevention and intervention measures.","B Shayak; Mohit Manoj Sharma; Anoop Misra; Lucas Alexandre Pedebos; Ana Cristina Vidor; Roberto Zaina; Graziela de Luca Canto; Gustavo Medeiros de Araujo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.01.20144105""","20200702","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5094,""
"Using past and current data to estimate potential crisis service use in mental healthcare after the COVID-19 lockdown: South London and Maudsley data","The lockdown policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has a potentially important impact on provision of mental healthcare with uncertain consequences over the 12 months ahead. Past activity may provide a means to predict future demand. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London), we carried out a range of descriptive analyses to inform the Trust on patient groups who might be most likely to require inpatient and home treatment team (HTT) crisis care. We considered the 12 months following UK COVID-19 lockdown policy on 16th March, drawing on comparable findings from previous years, and quantified levels of change in service delivery to those most likely to receive crisis care. For 12-month crisis days from 16th March in 2015-19, we found that most (over 80%) were accounted for by inpatient care (rather than HTT), most (around 75%) were used by patients who were current or recent Trust patients at the commencement of follow-up, and highest numbers were used by patients with a previously recorded schizophreniform disorder diagnosis. For current/recent patients on 16th March there had been substantial reductions in use of inpatient care in the following 31 days in 2020, more than previous years; changes in total non-inpatient contact numbers did not differ in 2020 compared to previous years, although there had been a marked switch from face-to-face to virtual contacts.","David W Eyre; Sheila F Lumley","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.29.20142448""","20200630","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5095,""
"SARS-CoV-2 & Pediatric Mental Health: A Review of Recent Evidence","SARS-CoV-2 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and was met with lockdown policies to curb the spread of the disease. This meant that 890 million students in 114 countries would be affected by the closure of their educational institutes, affecting their mental health. Mental health disorders are suggested to have a well-correlated link to suicide which is the third most leading cause of death worldwide amongst children aged 15-19 years. According to WHO, 'health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease'. Hence the isolation brought about by SARS-CoV-2 is postulated to cause anxiety, fear, and depression amongst the pediatric population, due to the loss of socialization and separation from friends. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we highlight the major mental health issues in children aged 2-18 years, along with their causes, effects, and potential solutions to tackle these problems.","Torstein Tengs; Charles F Delwiche; Christine M Jonassen; Changfu Yao; Stephen Beil; Chandani Sen","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.28.20136168""","20200629","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5096,""
"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission fear and COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders, severe asthma, and other high-risk groups","Background: The adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of high-risk group patients for morbidity and mortality and its impact on public health in the long term have not been clearly determined. Objective: To determine the level of COVID-19 related transmission fear and anxiety in healthcare workers and patients with primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID), severe asthma, and the ones with other comorbidities. Methods: The healthcare workers and patients with PID, severe asthma (all patients receiving biological agent treatment), malignancy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension (90% of patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy), diabetes mellitus (42 % of patients receiving DPP-4 inhibitor therapy) were included in the study. A total of 560 participants, 80 individuals in each group, were provided. The hospital anxiety and depression scale ( HADS ) and Fear of illness and virus evaluation (FIVE ) scales were applied to the groups with face to face interview methods. Results: The mean age was 49.30 years and 306 (55 %) were female. The FIVE Scale and HADS-A scale scores of health care workers were significantly higher than other groups' scores (p = 0.001 and 0.006). The second-highest scores belonged to patients with PID. There was no significant difference between the groups for the HADS-D score (p=0.07). The lowest score in all scales was observed in patients with hypertension. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that in the pandemic process, patients with primary immunodeficiency, asthma patients, and other comorbid patients, especially healthcare workers, should be referred to the centers for the detection and treatment of mental health conditions.","Michael Daly; Eric Robinson; Joana Pereira Dias; Martin D Curran; Surendra Parmar; Fahad Khokhar; Delphine Cuchet-LourenÃ§o; Janine Lux; Sapna Sharma-Hajela; Benjamin Ravenhill; Razeen Mahroof","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.26.20140616""","20200628","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5097,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life, physical and psychosocial wellbeing in breast cancer patients and survivors - A prospective, multicenter cohort study","Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting social distancing and lockdown measures are having a substantial impact on daily life and medical management of people with breast cancer. We evaluated to what extent these changes have affected quality of life and physical, and psychosocial wellbeing of people (being) treated for breast cancer. Methods: This study was conducted within the prospective Utrecht cohort for Multiple BREast cancer intervention studies and Long-term evaluation (UMBRELLA). Shortly after the implementation of COVID-19 measures, extra questionnaires were sent to 1595 cohort participants, including standard UMBRELLA quality of life (EORTC) questionnaires. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared to the most recent PROs collected within UMBRELLA before COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on PROs was evaluated using mixed models analysis. Results: In total, 1051 patients (66%) completed the questionnaires. One third (n = 327, 31%) reported a higher threshold to contact their general practitioner due to COVID-19. A significant deterioration in emotional functioning was observed (82.6 to 77.9, p < 0.001) and 505 (48%, 95% CI 45-51) patients reported moderate to severe loneliness. Small significant improvements were observed in QoL, physical-, social- and role functioning scores. In the subgroup of 51 patients under active treatment, there was a strong deterioration in social functioning (69.8 to 5.0, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Due to COVID-19, patients (being) treated for breast cancer are less likely to contact physicians, and experience a deterioration in emotional functioning. Patients undergoing active treatment report a strong drop in social functioning. One in two patients reports (severe) loneliness. Online applications facilitating peer contact and e-mental health interventions could support mental health and social interaction times of total lockdown or social distancing.","Michael Daly; Eric Robinson; Joana Pereira Dias; Martin D Curran; Surendra Parmar; Fahad Khokhar; Delphine Cuchet-LourenÃ§o; Janine Lux; Sapna Sharma-Hajela; Benjamin Ravenhill; Razeen Mahroof; Amelia Solderholm; Sally Forrest; Sushmita Sridhar; Nicholas M Brown; Stephen Baker","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.26.20140657""","20200628","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5098,""
"Health Condition and Test Availability as Predictors of Adults' Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Research identifying adults' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic relies solely on demographic predictors without examining adults' health status during the COVID-19 pandemic as a potential predictor. Methods: An online survey of 669 adults in Malaysia was conducted during May 2-8, 2020, six weeks after a Movement Control Order (MCO) was issued. Findings: Adults' health condition had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with insomnia, anxiety, depression and distress. Reported test availability for COVID-19 (from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree"" ) also had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with anxiety and depression. Younger adults reported worse mental health, but people from various religions and ethnic groups did not differ significantly in reported mental health. Interpretation: Adults with worse health conditions had more mental health problems, especially adults at the lower end of the health spectrum. Test availability negatively predicted anxiety and depression, especially for adults experiencing poor COVID-19 test availability. The significant predictions of health condition and COVID-19 test availability suggest a new direction for the literature to identify psychiatric risk factors directly from health related variables during a pandemic.","Erhan Bayraktar; Asaf Cohen; April Nellis; Sara Terreri; Francesco Corrente","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.21.20137000""","20200623","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5099,""
"Mental health and health behaviours before and during the COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal analyses of the UK Household Longitudinal Study","Background: There are concerns that COVID-19 mitigation measures, including the lockdown, may have unintended health consequences. We examined trends in mental health and health behaviours in the UK before and during the initial phase of the COVID-19 lockdown and differences across population subgroups. Methods: Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the UK Household Longitudinal Study, including representative samples of adults (aged 18+) interviewed in four survey waves between 2015 and 2020 (n=48,426). 9,748 adults had complete data for longitudinal analyses. Outcomes included psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ)), loneliness, current cigarette smoking, use of e-cigarettes and alcohol consumption. Cross-sectional prevalence estimates were calculated and multilevel Poisson regression assessed associations between time period and the outcomes of interest, as well as differential associations by age, gender, education level and ethnicity. Results: Psychological distress increased one month into lockdown with the prevalence rising from 19.4% (95% CI 18.7%-20.0%) in 2017-19 to 30.3% (95% CI 29.1%-31.6%) in April 2020 (RR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.1,1.4). Groups most adversely affected included women, young adults, people from an Asian background and those who were degree educated. Loneliness remained stable overall (RR=0.9, 95% CI: 0.6,1.5). Smoking declined (RR=0.9, 95% CI=0.8,1.0) and the proportion of people drinking four or more times per week increased (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.3,1.5), as did binge drinking (RR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.3,1.7). Conclusions: Psychological distress increased one month into lockdown, particularly among women and young adults. Smoking declined, but adverse alcohol use generally increased. Effective measures are required to mitigate adverse impacts on health.","Erhan Bayraktar; Asaf Cohen; April Nellis; Sara Terreri; Francesco Corrente; Claudia Capponi; Patrizia Palomba; Mattia Mirabella; Simona Cascioli; Paolo Palange; Ilaria Cuccaro","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.21.20136820""","20200623","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5100,""
"Factors Associated with Mental Health Outcomes in Oman during COVID19: Frontline vs Non-frontline Healthcare Workers","OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess and compare demographic and psychological factors and sleep status of frontline HCWs in relation to non-frontline HCWs DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from the 8th to the 17th of April 2020 across varied health care settings in Oman accruing 1139 HCWS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mental health status was assessed using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21), and insomnia was evaluated by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Samples were categorized into the frontline and non-frontline groups. Chi-square, odds ratio, and independent t-tests were used to compare groups by demographic and mental health outcomes. Results This study included 1139 HCWs working in Oman. There was a total of 368 (32.3%), 388 (34.1%), 271 (23.8%), and 211 (18.5%) respondents reported to have depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia, respectively while working during the pandemic period. HCWs in the frontline group were 1.4 times more likely to have anxiety (OR=1.401, p=0.007) and stress (OR=1.404, p=0.015) as compared to those working in the non-frontline group. On indices of sleep-wake cycles, HCWs in the frontline group were 1.37 times more likely to report insomnia (OR=1.377, p=0.037) when compared to those working in the non-frontline group. No significant differences in depression status between workers in the frontline and non-frontline groups were found (p=0.181). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different grades of HCWs. This study suggests that frontline HCWs are disproportionally affected compared to non-frontline HCWs. The problem with managing sleep-wake cycles and anxiety symptoms were highly endorsed among frontline HCWs. As psychosocial interventions are likely to be constrained owing to the pandemic, mental health care must first be directed to frontline HCWs.","Carlos J. Camacho; Kristina A.

"Factors associated with self-reported anxiety, depression, and general health during the UK lockdown; a cross-sectional survey","Background: To investigate factors associated with anxiety, depression, and self-reported general health during ""lockdown"" due to COVID-19 in the UK. Methods: Online cross-sectional survey of a nationally-representative sample of 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over (data collected 6-7 May 2020). Participants were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. Outcomes: In this sample, 21.9% (n=458, 95% CI [20.1% to 23.7%]) reported probable anxiety (scored three or over on the GAD-2); while 23.5% (n=494, 95% CI [21.7% to 25.3]) reported probable depression (scored three or over on the PHQ-2). Poorer mental health was associated with greater financial hardship during the lockdown, thinking that you would lose contact with friends or family if you followed Government measures, more conflict with household members during the lockdown, less sense of community with people in your neighbourhood, and lower perceived effectiveness of Government measures. Females and those who were younger were likely to report higher levels of anxiety and depression. The majority of participants reported their general health as ""good"" (as measured by the first item of the SF-36). Poorer self-reported general health was associated with psychological distress, greater worry about COVID-19 and markers of inequality. Interpretation: Rates of self-reported anxiety and depression in the UK during the lockdown were greater than population norms. Reducing financial hardship, promoting social connectedness, and increasing solidarity with neighbours and household members may help ease rifts within the community which are associated with distress, thereby improving mental health. Reducing inequality may also improve general health.","Carlos J. Camacho; Kristina A.

"Assessment of impact of COVID-19 outbreak & lockdown on mental health status & its associated risk and protective factors in adult Indian population","Background: The novel Corona virus has derailed the entire world and various steps have been taken by the health authorities to tackle this pandemic. Nationwide lockdown has been imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 outbreak in India, which could have psychological impact on the population. Aim: Our study aims to study the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak & subsequent lockdown on mental health status of adult Indian population along with identifying the high-risk groups. Methodology: An online survey was conducted during 3rd phase of lockdown gathering details about sociodemographic variables, practice of precautionary measures, awareness and concerns regarding COVID-19 and mental health status of the participants through DASS21 questionnaire from 873 adults. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress were 18.56%, 25.66%, and 21.99% respectively including higher number of participants with mild depression (15.1%) and stress (14.5%) and moderate anxiety (16.3%). Female gender, age <25 years, unemployment, self-business, employed in private sector, lack of formal education, larger household size, parenthood (>2 kids) were associated with increased likelihood of negative mental health. Confidence in physician's ability to diagnose COVID-19 infection, decreased self-perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19, lesser frequency of checking for information on COVID-19 and satisfaction of information received were protective against negative mental health. Conclusion: This landmark study identified the protective and risk factors of mental health during COVID-19 pandemic, to help authorities and mental health workers to strategize and deliver interventional methods to maintain psychosocial wellbeing of the population.","Andrew Wooyoung Kim; Tawanda Nyengerai; Emily Mendenhall","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.13.20130153""","20200616","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5103,""
"Is the psychological well-being of a population associated with COVID-19 related survival?","OBJECTIVE Immunological mind-body research suggests mental health may also be important in the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of mental health as a protective factor for COVID-19 related mortality in the general population. The second goal was to examine this among populations of countries most affected by COVID-19 related mortality. METHODS Data sources were the Global Burden of Disease report 2017 and publicly reported situational reports of COVID-19. We described variables; calculated the spearman's correlation coefficient, calculated the percentage of the variability of the data that is explained by the association. We explored inter-relationships among other variables: aged 70 or older, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. A correlation matrix with plotted scatter matrix diagrams was produced. RESULTS Across 181 countries, the mean total COVID-19 related survivors per million was 999,949 (sd=125), median=999,993. The variable had a lognormal distribution; the mean mentally healthy per 100,000 was 85,411 (sd=1,871), median=85,634. The test of normality resulted in p-value < 0.001. Correlation of mentally healthy per 100,0000 and totals of COVID-19 related survivors was s=0.29 (n=181, 95% CI 0.16-0.43). The variance explained by the relation between mental healthy and totals of COVID-19 related survivors was 8.4% (2.6-18.5%). Across countries most affected by COVID-19 related mortality s=0.49 (n=45, 0.28-0.70), explaining 24.2% (7.7-49.3%). CONCLUSION A weak association was found between the psychological well-being of a population and COVID-19 related survival. This relationship explained between 2.6 and 18.5% of COVID-19 related survival. For countries most affected by COVID-19 related death, this association was moderate and explained between 7.7 and 49.3%. Confirmation of these important observational findings is needed with future individual patient data research.","Shane Miersch","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.05.20123018""","20200607","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5104,""
"Trajectories of depression and anxiety during enforced isolation due to COVID-19: longitudinal analyses of 59,318 adults in the UK with and without diagnosed mental illness","Background: There is currently major concern about the impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak on mental health. A number of studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries prior to and during enforced isolation (lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed week by week over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aims: This study explored trajectories of anxiety and depression over the 20 weeks after lockdown was announced using data from England, and compared the growth trajectories by individual characteristics. Methods: Data from 36,520 adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a well-stratified panel study weighted to population proportions collecting data weekly during the COVID-19 pandemic) were analysed from 23/03/2020-09/08/2020. Latent growth models were fitted accounting for socio-demographic and health covariates. Results: 22.6% of the sample had scores indicating moderate-severe anxiety, and 25.1% indicating moderate-severe depressive symptoms. Anxiety and depression levels both declined across the first 20 weeks following the introduction of lockdown in the England. The fastest decreases were seen across the strict lockdown period, with symptoms plateauing as further lockdown easing measures were introduced. Being female or younger, having lower educational attainment, lower income or pre-existing mental health conditions, and living alone or with children were all risk factors for higher levels of anxiety and depression at the start of lockdown. Many of these inequalities in experiences were reduced as lockdown continued, but differences were still evident 20 weeks after the start of lockdown. Conclusions: As countries face potential future lockdowns, these data suggest that the highest levels of depression and anxiety are in the early stages of lockdown but decline fairly rapidly as individuals adapt to circumstances. They also suggest the importance of supporting individuals in the lead-up to lockdown measures being brought in to try and reduce distress and highlight that emotionally vulnerable groups have remained at risk throughout lockdown and its aftermath.","Marissa LoPresti; David B Beck; Priya Duggal","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.03.20120923""","20200604","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5105,""
"Are adversities and worries during the COVID-19 pandemic related to sleep quality? Longitudinal analyses of 45,000 UK adults","There are concerns that both the experience of adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic and worries about experiencing adversities will have substantial and lasting effects on mental health. One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact health is through effects on sleep. We used data from 48,723 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01/04/2020-12/05/2020 to study the association between adversities and sleep quality. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models to account for all time-invariant confounders. Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to employment and finances. Having a larger social network offered some buffering effects on associations but there was limited further evidence of moderation by social or psychiatric factors. Poor sleep may be a mechanism by which COVID-19 adversities are affecting mental health. This highlights the importance of interventions that support adaptive coping strategies during the pandemic.","Marissa LoPresti; David B Beck; Priya Duggal","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.02.20120311""","20200604","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5106,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Pakistani University Students and How They Are Coping","Background: COVID-19 is spreading quickly, causing great deal of fear and unrest in the public. We aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on university students and their coping strategies. Methods: This web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among students of four Pakistani higher education institutions. Google forms were used to disseminate the online questionnaire to assess anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), sources of distress (14-items) and the coping strategies (Brief-COPE). Results: A total of 1134 responses (age 21.7 {+/-} 3.5 years) were included. The frequency of students having moderate-severe anxiety and depression (score [&ge;] 10) were {approx} 34% and 45%, respectively. The respondents' aged [&ge;] 31 years had significantly lower depression score than those below 30 years. Males had significantly less anxiety and depression scores than females. Additionally, those having a family member, friend or acquaintance infected with the disease had significantly higher anxiety score. The main sources of distress were the changes in daily life due to the ongoing pandemic. Regarding coping strategies, majority of respondents were found to have adopted religious/spiritual coping (6.45 {+/-} 1.68) followed by acceptance (5.58 {+/-} 1.65). Conclusions: COVID-19 have significant adverse impact on students' mental health. The most frequent coping strategy adopted by them are religious/spiritual coping, acceptance, self-distraction and active coping. It is suggested that mental health of students should not be neglected during epidemics.","Elizabeth A Samuels; Rebecca Karb; Rahul Vanjani; M.

"Dreaming during the Covid-19 pandemic: Computational assessment of dream reports reveals mental suffering associated with negative feelings and contagion fear","Neuroscience and psychology agree that dreaming helps to cope with negative emotions and learn from experience. The current global threat related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread social isolation. Does dreaming change and/or reflect mental suffering? To address these questions, we applied natural language processing tools to study 239 dream reports from 67 individuals either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during March-April, 2020, when quarantine was imposed in Brazil following the pandemic announcement by the WHO. Pandemic dreams showed a higher proportion of anger and sadness words and higher average semantic similarities to the terms contamination and cleanness. These features were associated with mental suffering related to social isolation, as they explained 39% of the variance in PANSS negative subscale (p=0.0092). These results corroborate the hypothesis that pandemic dreams reflect mental suffering, fear of contagion, and important changes in daily habits.","Ajit Kumar Pasayat; Satya Narayan Pati; Aashirbad Maharana; Gerard Krause; Annika Moehl; Sarah Wiegel; Berit Lange; Heiko Becher; Michelle Hayes; Alice Sisson; Richard Keays; Muriel Lalande; Alain Martinot","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.19.20107078""","20200521","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5108,""

Objective: To explore the time-varying longitudinal relationship between (i) worries about adversity, and (ii) experience of adversity, and both anxiety and depression and test the moderating role of socio-economic position. Design: Longitudinal cohort study Setting: Community study Participants: A well-stratified sample of UK adults recruited into the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a panel study collecting data weekly during the Covid-19 pandemic) via a combination of convenience and targeted recruitment. The sample was weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and geographical location. Exposures: Worries or experiences of adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic Outcomes: Anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) Results: Data were analysed from 41,909 UK adults (weighted data: 51% female, aged 18-99) followed up across 6 weeks (178,430 observations). Using fixed effects regression was used to explore within-person variation over time, cumulative number of worries and experience of adversities were both related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. Number of worries were associated more with anxiety than depression, but number of experiences were equally related to anxiety and depression. Individuals of lower socio-economic position were more negatively affected psychologically by adverse experiences. Conclusions & relevance: Measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK appear to have been insufficient at reassuring people given we are still seeing clear associations with poor mental health both for cumulative worries and also for a range of specific worries relating to finance, access to essentials, personal safety and COVID-19. Interventions are required that both seek to prevent adverse events (e.g. redundancies) and that reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies.","Douglas Ferreira; Paula Ferreira; Paulo Oliveira Jr.","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20101717""","20200519","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5109,""
"The Social and Economic Factors Underlying the Impact of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in US Counties","This paper uncovers the socioeconomic and health/lifestyle factors that can explain the differential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on different parts of the United States. Using a dynamic panel representation of an epidemiological model of disease spread, the paper develops a Vulnerability Index for US counties from daily reported number of cases over a 20-day period of rapid disease growth. County-level economic, demographic, and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country. These factors are also used to examine the number of reported deaths. The paper finds that counties with high median income have a high incidence of cases but reported lower deaths. Income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, is found to be associated with more deaths and more cases. The remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports is evidence of the spread of the virus by way of international travel. The distributions of age, race, and health risk factors such as obesity and diabetes are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties. Counties with better access to health care as measured by the number of primary care physicians per capita have lower deaths, and so do places with more health awareness as measured by flu vaccination prevalence. Environmental health conditions such as the amount of air pollution is found to be associated with counties with higher deaths from the virus. It is hoped that research such as these will help policymakers to develop risk factors for each region of the country to better contain the spread of infectious diseases in the future.","Rauf Rauf Ibrahim","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20091041""","20200508","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5110,""
"Quantitative Estimation of Covid-19 Related Unemployment On Suicide and Excess Mortality in the United States","Importance: The Covid-19 pandemic has driven behavioral and governmental responses with large impacts on economic activity. Estimates of indirect health effects of economic impacts may inform societal action. Objective: To estimate the size of the impact of Covid-19 unemployment on suicides and deaths from all causes. Design: Risk assessment applying of pooled effects hazard ratios from published meta-analyses of observational epidemiological studies, post-Covid-19 unemployment, current labor force composition data, and current age-adjusted mortality rates. Results: This risk assessment estimates approximately 9,700 excess annual deaths from suicide and 66,000 annual deaths from all causes among those recently unemployed due to Covid-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Indirect health impacts of societal responses to Covid-19 are identifiable, multiple and quantifiable. Adverse health impacts, such as those from unemployment, may endure longer than those of the Covid-19 pandemic itself. Decision-makers can include indirect health impacts in policy-making calculi for Covid-19 mitigation and suppression strategies.","Rajiv Bhatia","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.20089086""","20200508","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5111,""

"Physicians' Attitudes Towards Treating Patients in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic in Pakistan","Background and objectives Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the cause of a worldwide outbreak of respiratory illness, which has been declared as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO)  The outbreak has posed a huge challenge to countries around the world and has resulted in a global lockdown  The pandemic has especially overburdened the healthcare sector, resulting in a shortage of personnel and equipment  Along with many other manifestations, it has resulted in stress and anxiety for the physicians as well  Furthermore, many healthcare workers have been reluctant in treating COVID-19 patients  This study aimed to explore the concerns of physicians in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the reasons for their reluctance to treat the patients  Methodology This descriptive cross-sectional study included 235 physicians from seven hospitals of Pakistan who were actively working amid the COVID-19 pandemic  Data were collected from March 1, 2020, to May 30, 2020, using a structured online questionnaire  Participants were approached via non-probability convenient sampling  Two hundred and eight respondents were included in the data analysis  SPSS Statistics version 23 0 (IBM Corp , Armonk, NY) was used for data entry and analysis  Results A striking 83 7% (n=174) of the respondents expressed their reluctance to treat patients with COVID-19  Concerns they raised included one or more of the following four reasons;lack of proper personal protective equipment (PPE), fear of self-infection, excessive workload, and fear of transmitting the infection to their family members  Of note, 92% (n=161) of the respondents reported a lack of PPE while 74 1% (n=129) reported fear of transmitting the infection to their family members as reasons for their reluctance  The vast majority of the participants reported the need for psychological training to treat the patients' anxiety (95 2%, n=198)  Many participants were afraid that their own anxiety might be affecting the quality of care patients were receiving (67 3%, n=140)  Hence, most of the participants reported that psychological counseling should be provided (93 3%, n=194)  Participants with family members older than 60 years were found to be reluctant to treat patients due to the risk of transmitting the infection to them (69 7%, n=145, p=0 001)  Therefore, a major proportion of the participants (96 2%, n=200) felt that the hospitals should provide a place for them to rest and temporarily isolate themselves to avoid coming into contact with their family members  Conclusions We conclude that a major proportion of physicians is reluctant to treat their patients due to multiple factors  The grave situation of the pandemic has taken a toll on their mental health, which could be affecting the quality of care that the patients receive  Their concerns should be addressed to not only provide them with support and improve their working environment but also to ensure that they are fully equipped to provide state-of-the-art care to the patients in these grave times","Ayub, Maheen; Arshad, Daneyal; Maqbool, Naheed; Zahid, Mahnoor; Malik, Rabia S.; Rizvi, Zuhair Ali; Arshad, Usman; Khan, Saleem Ullah","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10331","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Cureus;12(9), 2020.; Publication details: Cureus;12(9), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5117,""

"Human plague: An old scourge that needs new answers","Author summary The historical aspect of plague makes for fascinating reading, due to its capacity to disrupt human society and its socioeconomic and cultural impacts throughout human history  We argue that the Madagascar outbreak in 2017 is a tipping point in human plague epidemiology and a call to elevate research priorities on plague as a matter of some urgency  In contrast with what occurred with the Ebola virus disease crisis in West Africa between 2013 and 2015 and the new coronaviruses (the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] as early warnings of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] pandemic), we have an opportunity to act preventively and enable evidence-based measures to avoid major health crises due to plague outbreaks in the near future  Yersinia pestis, the bacterial causative agent of plague, remains an important threat to human health  Plague is a rodent-borne disease that has historically shown an outstanding ability to colonize and persist across different species, habitats, and environments while provoking sporadic cases, outbreaks, and deadly global epidemics among humans  Between September and November 2017, an outbreak of urban pneumonic plague was declared in Madagascar, which refocused the attention of the scientific community on this ancient human scourge  Given recent trends and plague's resilience to control in the wild, its high fatality rate in humans without early treatment, and its capacity to disrupt social and healthcare systems, human plague should be considered as a neglected threat  A workshop was held in Paris in July 2018 to review current knowledge about plague and to identify the scientific research priorities to eradicate plague as a human threat  It was concluded that an urgent commitment is needed to develop and fund a strong research agenda aiming to fill the current knowledge gaps structured around 4 main axes: (i) an improved understanding of the ecological interactions among the reservoir, vector, pathogen, and environment;(ii) human and societal responses;(iii) improved diagnostic tools and case management;and (iv) vaccine development  These axes should be cross-cutting, translational, and focused on delivering context-specific strategies  Results of this research should feed a global control and prevention strategy within a ""One Health"" approach","Valles, Xavier; Stenseth, Nils Chr; Demeure, Christian; Horby, Peter; Mead, Paul S.; Cabanillas, Oswaldo; Ratsitorahina, Mahery; Rajerison, Minoarisoa; Andrianaivoarimanana, Voahangy; Ramasindrazana, Beza; Pizarro-Cerda, Javier; Scholz, Holger C.; Girod, Romain; Hinnebusch, B.

"The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child growth and development: a systematic review","Objective This was a systematic review of studies that examined the impact of epidemics or social restriction on mental and developmental health in parents and children/adolescents  Source of data The PubMed, WHO COVID-19, and SciELO databases were searched on March 15, 2020, and on April 25, 2020, filtering for children (0â€“18 years) and humans  Synthesis of data The tools used to mitigate the threat of a pandemic such as COVID-19 may very well threaten child growth and development  These tools â€” such as social restrictions, shutdowns, and school closures â€” contribute to stress in parents and children and can become risk factors that threaten child growth and development and may compromise the Sustainable Development Goals  The studies reviewed suggest that epidemics can lead to high levels of stress in parents and children, which begin with concerns about children becoming infected  These studies describe several potential mental and emotional consequences of epidemics such as COVID-19, H1N1, AIDS, and Ebola: severe anxiety or depression among parents and acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, and depression among children  These data can be related to adverse childhood experiences and elevated risk of toxic stress  The more adverse experiences, the greater the risk of developmental delays and health problems in adulthood, such as cognitive impairment, substance abuse, depression, and non-communicable diseases  Conclusion Information about the impact of epidemics on parents and children is relevant to policy makers to aid them in developing strategies to help families cope with epidemic/pandemic-driven adversity and ensure their childrenâ€™s healthy development","AraÃºjo, Liubiana Arantes de; Veloso, CÃ¡ssio Frederico, Souza; Matheus de Campos, Azevedo; JoÃ£o Marcos Coelho de, Tarro; Giulio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2020.08.008","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Jornal de Pediatria;2020.; Publication details: Jornal de Pediatria;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5140,""
"Dying alone and lonely dying: Media discourse and pandemic conditions","Background and objectives This paper explores current concerns and practice related to older people dying alone in Intensive Care Units, care homes, and at home through media discussions during the Covid-19 pandemic and before  It addresses the historically-situated concept of a good death and a bad death and suggests why dying alone, whether completely alone or without significant others physically present, may be considered a bad death  Methods As evidence for collective fears about dying alone, we explored the treatment of these deaths in media using headline examples from the US New York Times and the English Guardian newspaper from the 19th century through Sept  2020  Results A search of the New York Times located 39 articles with either lonely dying or lonely death in the headline  The Guardian had 25 articles with use of the term, but unlike the New York Times, no obituaries were included  Although the deaths profiled were deemed unusual, deaths by suicide were only minimally classed as dying alone  The condition of dying alone is represented as a stigmatised death  Themes addressed: 1) dying alone is a nonnormative event;2) this death matters;and 3) where people die alone, societies should honour the death and learn from it  Discussion and implications Contemporary dying involves conditions for which we are unprepared as a society  We seldom address our civic obligations to each other  Few people have discussed their wishes about their preferences in dying and whether and how they want to be accompanied at their death, if possible  This is an invisible constraint of modern healthcare  Because of limited discussions and preparation, these deaths may lead to disenfranchised grief for the mourners  Cultural and societal responses to lonely dying are important in easing the emotional burden of dying alone, helping individuals prepare for this possibility and better integrating death with the life course  Recommendations include inclusion of accompaniment/nonaccompaniment at death as part of advance care planning and mitigation if this condition occurs  It is essential for individuals to find their own still point of acceptance within competing societal narratives of privileging the self in dying alone and the value of social connection","Nelson-Becker, Holly; Victor, Christina","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaging.2020.100878","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Aging Studies;55:100878, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Aging Studies;55:100878, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5141,""

"Promotion of Maternal-Infant Mental Health and Trauma-Informed Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions in health care in the perinatal period and women's childbirth experiences. Organizations that represent health care professionals have responded with general practice guidelines for pregnant women, but limited attention has been devoted to mental health in the perinatal period during a pandemic. Evidence suggests that in this context, significant psychological distress may have the potential for long-term psychological harm for mothers and infants. For infants, this risk may extend into early childhood. In this commentary, we present recommendations for practice, research, and policy related to mental health in the perinatal period. These recommendations include the use of a trauma-informed framework to promote social support and infant attachment, use of technology and telehealth, and assessment for mental health needs and experiences of violence.","Choi, Kristen R; Records, Kathryn; Low, Lisa Kane; Alhusen, Jeanne L; Kenner, Carole; Bloch, Joan Rosen; Premji, Shahirose Sadrudin; Hannan, Jean; Anderson, Cindy M; Yeo, Seonae; Cynthia Logsdon, M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jogn.2020.07.004","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs;49(5): 409-415, 2020 09.; Publication details: J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs;49(5): 409-415, 2020 09.; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Health Promotion; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Psychological Trauma/nursing; Female; Humans; Infant; Pregnancy; United States/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5183,""
"Mental health crisis under COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, China","OBJECTIVES: To compare the mental health burden before and during the COVID-19 outbreak and identified vulnerable groups by sociodemographic factors. METHODS: We analyzed repeated cross-sectional data from Hong Kong Family and Health Information Trend Survey (FHInTS) in 2016 (N = 4036) and 2017 (N = 4051) and COVID-19 Health Information Survey (CoVHInS) in April 9 to 23, 2020 (N = 1501) using population-based random samples of general adults by landline telephone and online panel. Stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4), anxiety symptoms (General Anxiety Disorders 2), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), subjective happiness (4-point Likert item), and sociodemographic were collected. RESULTS: Compared with 2016 and 2017, the stress level increased by 28.3%, prevalence of anxiety increased by 42.3% and the depression symptoms and unhappiness have doubled (all p for trends <0.001) during the COVID-19 outbreak. The increases in stress level were significantly larger among older and less educated respondents (P for interactions <0.001). CONCLUSION: Hong Kong had a mental health emergency even with no lockdown and well-managed outbreaks. Older and under-privileged people will suffer most. Public mental health interventions are urgently needed particularly for the older adults and individuals with primary or lower education attainment.","Zhao, Sheng Zhi; Wong, Janet Yuen Ha; Luk, Tzu Tsun; Wai, Abraham Ka Chung; Lam, Tai Hing; Wang, Man Ping","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.030","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Infect Dis;2020 Sep 15.; Publication details: Int J Infect Dis;2020 Sep 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5184,""
"L'optimisme et COVID-19Â : une ressource pour soutenir les personnes en situation de confinementÂ ?; [Optimism and COVID-19: A resource to support people in confinement?]","This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.","Martin-Krumm, Charles; Tarquinio, Cyril; Tarquinio, Camille","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2020 Jun 05.; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2020 Jun 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5185,""

"Gig Workers during the COVID-19 Crisis in France: Financial Precarity and Mental Well-Being","We set out to explore how precarious workers, particularly those employed in the gig economy, balance financial uncertainty, health risks, and mental well-being. We surveyed and interviewed precarious workers in France during the COVID-19 crisis, in March and April 2020. We oversampled gig economy workers, in particular in driving and food delivery occupations (hereafter drivers and bikers), residing in metropolitan areas. These workers cannot rely on stable incomes and are excluded from the labor protections offered to employees, features which have been exacerbated by the crisis. We analyzed outcomes for precarious workers during the mandatory lockdown in France as an extreme case to better understand how financial precarity relates to health risks and mental well-being. Our analysis revealed that 3Ã‚Â weeks into the lockdown, 56% of our overall sample had stopped working and respondents had experienced a 28% income drop on average. Gig economy drivers reported a significant 20 percentage point larger income decrease than other workers in our sample. Bikers were significantly more likely to have continued working outside the home during the lockdown. Yet our quantitative analysis also revealed that stress and anxiety levels were not higher for these groups and that bikers in fact reported significantly lower stress levels during the lockdown. While this positive association between being a biker and mental health may be interpreted in different ways, our qualitative data led to a nuanced understanding of the effect of gig work on mental well-being in this population group.","Apouey, Roulet, Solal, Stabile","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-020-00480-4","20200923","COVID-19; Financial precarity; Gig economy; Health and well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5187,""

"Effectiveness of digital psychological interventions for mental health problems in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background The effectiveness of digital psychological interventions in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unclear. We aimed to systematically investigate the available evidence for digital psychological interventions in reducing mental health problems in LMICs. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published in English from database inception to March 9, 2020. We included randomised controlled trials investigating digital psychological interventions in individuals with mental health problems in LMICs. We extracted data on demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of the intervention, including the setting, digital delivery method, control group conditions, number of sessions, therapeutic orientation (eg, cognitive therapy or behaviour therapy), presence or absence of guidance, and length of follow-up, and statistical information to calculate effect sizes. If a study reported insufficient data to calculate effect sizes, the corresponding authors were contacted to provide data that could be aggregated. We did random-effects meta-analyses, and calculated the standardised mean difference in scores of digital psychological interventions versus control conditions (Hedges' g). Quality of evidence was assessed by use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The primary outcome was post-intervention mental health problems, as measured by self-reporting instruments or clinical interviews. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019137755. Findings We identified 22 eligible studies that were included in the meta-analysis. The included studies involved a total of 4104 participants (2351 who received a digital psychological intervention and 1753 who were in the control group), and mainly focused on young adults (mean age of the study population was 20â€“35 years) with depression or substance misuse. The results showed that digital psychological interventions are moderately effective when compared with control interventions (Hedges' g 0Â·60 [95% CI 0Â·45â€“0Â·75]; Hedges' g with treatment as usual subgroup for comparison 0Â·54 [0Â·35â€“0Â·73]). Heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I 2=74% [95% CI 60â€“83]). There was no evidence of publication bias, and the quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria was generally high. Interpretation Digital psychological interventions, which have been mostly studied in individuals with depression and substance misuse, are superior to control conditions, including usual care, and are moderately effective in LMICs. However, the considerable heterogeneity observed in our analysis highlights the need for more studies to be done, with standardised implementation of digital psychological intervention programmes to improve their reproducibility and efficiency. Digital psychological interventions should be considered for regions where usual care for mental health problems is minimal or absent. Funding None.

"Psychosocial effects of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences between seven European countries and between children with and without mental health conditions","The aim of the present study was to examine parental experiences of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic in families with or without a child with a mental health condition across Europe. The study included 6720 parents (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the United Kingdom (n=508), Sweden (n=1436), Spain (n=1491), Belgium (n=508), the Netherlands (n=324), Germany (n=1662) and Italy (n=794). Many parents found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools and general negative effects on both children and parents. In most countries, online teaching was uncommon, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing their childâ€™s schooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some effects were more pronounced in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, group differences were generally small, indicating that negative effects were present in many families across countries. It should also be noted that some parents reported positive effects of homeschooling for their child or themselves. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures have been argued to be less effective than other social distancing interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during a possible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.","Lisa Thorell et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602D-DEA-E25","20200924","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; psychosocial effects; mental health problems; homeschooling; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-25","",5192,""
