"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the medical follow-up and psychosocial well-being of people living with HIV: A cross-sectional survey","Empirical data on the consequences of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on HIV care is lacking. We surveyed persons living with HIV (PLWH) in different countries to investigate whether their medical follow-up and psychosocial well-being had been compromised due to COVID-19 and associated restrictions. In April 2020, a cross-sectional survey among PLWH was conducted using a web-based multilingual questionnaire. The research tool assessed HIV follow-up, psychosocial well-being, COVID-19 (flu-like) symptoms and prevention measures. Consenting respondents provided answers anonymously. 317 PLWH were included (mean age 43.4Ã‚Â±11.7; 71.6% male); 60.3% of participants resided in Belgium and Brazil. 140 (44.2%) reported experiencing a cold with at least one flu-like symptom since January 2020. Of the 18 who reported COVID-19 test results, 4 (22.2%) were positive. Seventy-four (23.3%) respondents screened positive for major depressive disorders, while 72 (22.7%) had generalized anxiety disorders. Fifty-six (17.7%) respondents reported difficulties in obtaining antiretroviral medications because of COVID-19-related measures. Adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 outbreak included greater quantities of antiretroviral refill in 67 (21.1%), phone consultations in 25 (7.9%), and new refill sites in 12 (3.9%). Factors associated with reduced risk of experiencing flu-like symptoms included flu vaccination during the last 12 months (p=0.005) and adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.010). COVID-19 and associated restrictive measures seem detrimental to the well-being and follow-up of PLWH. We recommend that health systems devise innovative approaches for antiretroviral provision and psychosocial support to PLWH during such outbreaks.","Siewe Fodjo, Faria de Moura Villela, Van Hees, TibÃƒÂ©rio Dos Santos, Vanholder, Vanholder, Reyntiens, Van den Bergh, Colebunders","https://doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002468","20200822","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-23","",4051,""
"COVID-19: a probable role of the anticoagulant Protein S in managing COVID-19-associated coagulopathy","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused monumental mortality, and there are still no adequate therapies. Most severely ill COVID-19 patients manifest a hyperactivated immune response, instigated by interleukin 6 (IL6) that triggers a so called &quot;cytokine storm&quot; and coagulopathy. Hypoxia is also associated with COVID-19. So far overlooked is the fact that both IL6 and hypoxia depress the abundance of a key anticoagulant, Protein S. We speculate that the IL6-driven cytokine explosion plus hypoxemia causes a severe drop in Protein S level that exacerbates the thrombotic risk in COVID-19 patients. Here we highlight a mechanism by which the IL6-hypoxia curse causes a deadly hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients, and we suggest a path to therapy.","Chatterjee, Sengupta, Majumder, Majumder","https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103869","20200822","ACE2; IL6; Protein S; coagulopathy; cytokine storm; hypoxia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-23","",4052,""
"Quality improvement report: setting up a staff well-being hub through continuous engagement","The coronavirus pandemic has presented a new set of challenges for the frontline National Health Service staff. It is not only the long working hours but also the uncertainty and increase in patient mortality that has affected mental health and staff well-being. Hospitals all around the country have rightly responded with various well-being initiatives to help their staff such as wobble rooms and developing online resources. Our vision was to set up a safe space for staff away from clinical noise to enable and encourage mindfulness and psychological resilience through a calm and serene environment. We used the continuous quality improvement methodology and administered an initial needs assessment survey to see if our trust staff will be interested in having such a space. Within our team, we managed to secure a place, and used donations to hospital charity and set up a space within a week. Since opening the hub, we have had excellent feedback from various staff groups. Immediate feedback was obtained using emoji stickers asking for feelings before and after visit. A mood board was put up allowing anonymous expression of feelings. Delayed feedback was requested using a repeat survey. We believe that while there is a lot of talk about well-being and an increasing number of resources being offered electronically, the need for a neat and quiet space cannot be overlooked. We collect feedback on a weekly basis and adapt the space to meet the needs of staff. Long-term impact of such spaces will be reassessed at a later stage.","Saqib, Rampal","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2020-001008","20200822","burnout; compassion fatigue; mental health; organisational culture; professional; self care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-23","",4053,""
"Predicting Psychological Distress Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic by Machine Learning: Discrimination and Coping Mechanisms of Korean Immigrants in the US","The current study examined the predictive ability of discrimination-related variables, coping mechanisms, and sociodemographic factors on the psychological distress level of Korean immigrants in the U.S. amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Korean immigrants (both foreign-born and U.S.-born) in the U.S. above the age of 18 were invited to participate in an online survey through purposive sampling. In order to verify the variables predicting the level of psychological distress on the final sample from 42 states (<i>n</i> = 790), the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analysis, which is able to examine complex non-linear interactions among variables, was conducted. The most critical predicting variables in the neural network were a person's resilience, experiences of everyday discrimination, and perception that racial discrimination toward Asians has increased in the U.S. since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Choi, Hong, Kim, Park","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176057","20200822","Artificial Neural Network; COVID-19; Korean immigrants; United States; mental health; racism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-23","",4054,""
