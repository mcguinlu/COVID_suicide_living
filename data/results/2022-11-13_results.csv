"Online group interventions for mental health promotion of college students: Integrative review","This study aims to describe which group interventions have been performed on the online platform for the promotion of mental health and prevention of mental health difficulties in college students. An integrative review was performed in the databases/libraries of Lilacs, PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science, identifying 13 articles published between the years 2019 and 2021. Of these, 12 studies are quantitative and one presented a mixed method. As for the level of evidence, eight are randomised clinical trials (level of evidence II), three quasi-experimental studies (level of evidence III), and two are cohort or caseâ€“control studies (level of evidence IV). The results suggest that online interventions are effective in helping the mental health of college students during social isolation, as experienced due to the pandemic, and in reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. All the identified group intervention methods showed satisfactory and promising results for this population.","da Silva, Grasiele Cristina Lucietto, Rossato, Lucas, Correia-Zanini, MartaÂ ReginaÂ GonÃ§alves, Scorsolini-Comin, Fabio","https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12561","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Counselling & Psychotherapy Research; JOUR(4):844-852, 22.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-13","",40931,""
"Bringing humanity into healthcare: Treating moral injury in a physician population","Despite facing various challenges relating to mental health and often dealing with a highly stressful work environment, physicians often feel as though they cannot readily access mental healthcare services. This is due to an array of elements, such as personality factors, systemic barriers, and cultural issues. While the prevalence of mental health difficulties within a physician population is relatively well researched, very little has been done to address the obstacles to treatment. Physicians are regularly exposed to potentially traumatic experiences and often make morally ambiguous decisions. While highly trained and undeniably competent, no physician is perfect, and medical errors with severe consequences do happen. Further, healthcare systems face unprecedented challenges worldwide due to circumstances following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. This manuscript discusses the risk of what is known as Moral Injury in a physician population due to everyday difficulties and the extraordinary circumstances resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. Subsequently, the discussion is then broadened to propose implementing a form of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as a means of treatment for said Moral Injury.

"Using individual characteristics and habit measures to predict meditation app use behavior","Meditation app usage is associated with decreases in stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Many meditation app subscribers, however, quickly abandon or reduce their app usage. This dissertation presents three manuscripts which 1) determined the behavioral, demographic, and socioeconomic factors associated with the abandonment of a meditation app, Calm, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) determined which participant characteristics predicted meditation app usage in the first eight weeks after subscribing, and 3) determined if changes in stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms from baseline to Week 8 predicted meditation app usage from Weeks 8-16. In Manuscript 1, a survey was distributed to Calm subscribers in March 2020 that assessed meditation app behavior and meditation habit strength, and demographic information. Cox proportional hazards regression models were estimated to assess time to app abandonment. In Manuscript 2, new Calm subscribers completed a baseline survey on participants' demographic and baseline mental health information and app usage data were collected over 8 weeks. In Manuscript 3, new Calm subscribers completed a baseline and Week 8 survey on demographic and mental health information. App usage data were collected over 16 weeks. Regression models were used to assess app usage for Manuscripts 2 and 3. Findings from Manuscript 1 suggest meditating after an existing routine decreased risk of app abandonment for pre-pandemic subscribers and for pandemic subscribers. Additionally, meditating ""whenever I can"" decreased risk of abandonment among pandemic subscribers. No behavioral factors were significant predictors of app abandonment among the long-term subscribers. Findings from Manuscript 2 suggest men had more days of meditation than women. Mental health diagnosis increased average daily meditation minutes. Intrinsic motivation for meditation increased the likelihood of completing any meditation session, more days with meditation sessions, and more average daily meditation minutes. Findings from Manuscript 3 suggest improvements in stress increased average daily meditation minutes. Improvements in depressive symptoms decreased daily meditation minutes. Evidence from this three-manuscript dissertation suggests meditation cue, time of day, motivation, symptom changes, and demographic and socioeconomic variables may be used to predict meditation app usage.

"Workplace violence, trauma, and the lived experience of corrections officers: A phenomenological study","Corrections officers are required to ensure compliance from inmates, and sometimes they have to use force, resulting in violent encounters. Such incidents can be traumatic for those directly and indirectly involved. Previous studies examined the working conditions of jail staff, but their focus was not primarily directed toward corrections officers. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore how everyday occurrences of violence associated with working in jails influence corrections officers' physiological well-being. The theory of constructed emotions framed this study. Recruiting was conducted using a demographic and interest survey distributed through Facebook. Using purposive sampling, semi structured interviews were conducted using the Zoom platform (due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and face-to-face with 11 active-duty corrections officers working in a complex jail system in a northeastern metropolitan region. The study addressed the lived experiences of corrections officers who experienced or witnessed workplace violence by inmates and how inmates cope with trauma. Interview responses were coded and analyzed to identify common themes. The corrections officers' most common concerns were lack of follow-up after a use-of-force encounter and workplace policies about the use of force that are ineffective and detrimental. Other findings indicated fear, helplessness, stress, anxiety, and anger. Policymakers, key stakeholders, and others may lead to positive social change by using these findings in developing effective and competent strategic planning, management, and policy implementation to support corrections officers and offer them better ways to process the trauma that they experience throughout their careers.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Perceived Stress and Eating Behaviors of Undergraduate and Postgraduate Students of UWI, Cave Hill Campus, Barbados","Objective: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and eating behaviors of university students in Barbados was investigated. Design and Methods: Students completed an online survey between June and July 2021 including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), SCOFF Questionnaire, and Salzburg Stress Eating Scale. We used bivariate and multivariable logistic regression to assess factors associated with eating behaviour and eating disorders. Result(s): Of 506 respondents (mean age 26 years, 81.4% female, 85.2% undergraduates), 7.23% were underweight, 52.34% normal weight, 20.85% overweight, and 19.57% obese. PHQ-4 screening suggested anxiety prevalence of 46% (95% CI 42% to 51%) with 22% (95% CI 17% to 25%) severe anxiety, and 43% (95% CI 39% to 47%) depression prevalence. 22.5 % of students screened positive for eating disorders on the SCOFF;positive screen for eating disorder was more likely positive in obese (36%) vs underweight (15%) students (p Conclusion(s): The screening instruments indicated concerning levels of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among university students in Barbados.

"The effect of mental health on human capital accumulation during COVID-19: Estimating retention and persistence of college students following return to campus life across Massachusetts public higher education institutions","Human capital theory suggests that lifetime income and socioeconomic status is a function of investments in human capital (Becker, 1962 & 1994;Becker & Tomes, 1986;Tomes, 1981). More recent developments show that human capital accumulation depends on mental health (Fletcher, 2008), in addition to ability, and access to resources to finance education and training (Becker, 1962 & 1994;Becker and Chiswick, 1966;Becker & Tomes, 1986;Tomes, 1981;Rosen, 1977). The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact human capital accumulation decisions as research has shown the pandemic impacted the mental health of college students, with women (Alon et al., 2020;Browning et al., 2021;Hoyt et al., 2020;Kecojevic et al., 2020) and sexual minorities (Hoyt et al., 2020;Lederer et al., 2020;Sanchez-Teruel et al., 2021) experiencing the worst well-being. In addition, research indicated differences in mental health among college students during the pandemic across race and ethnicity (Browing et al., 2021;Hoyt et al., 2020;Lederer et al., 2020). In this study, I investigated the impact of mental health of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic on a human capital accumulation decision, the likelihood of enrollment in Spring 2022 for college students enrolled in Fall 2021. I surveyed students to measure four dimensions of mental health at three higher education institutions in Massachusetts. The analysis provided a better understanding of the impact of mental health among college students on retention and persistence, and how they vary by demographic, academic, and socioeconomic characteristics. In addition, I investigated whether resilience and learning disabilities mediate and or moderate the impact of mental health on likelihood of reenrollment among college students. More than a third of students in the sample rated their mental health worse than before the pandemic. Controlling for mental health, demographic, academic, and socioeconomic characteristics, estimates for retention were not statistically significantly different at the three institutions that participated in this study. Furthermore, while loneliness and resilience scores did not play a role in the decision to enroll in Spring 2022, the results suggest that the higher the probability of an underlying anxiety or depressive disorder, the lower the probability of reenrollment for the cohort that participated in the study. Furthermore, this effect was larger and statistically significantly different for those who graduated from high school or earned a GED during the pandemic compared to those that did not. The understanding gained from this study may be used to improve the educational experience of students at colleges and universities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The COVID-19 pandemic: Psychological wellbeing, resilience and post-traumatic growth in adolescent Jewish day school students","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented global challenge in the disruption, uncertainty, and psychological distress it has unleashed on society, with mounting concern regarding mental health and wellbeing. Children and adolescents represent a particularly vulnerable group, as they were forced to navigate the sudden disruption of school and transition to virtual learning, facing months of quarantine, and increases in financial hardships. Given the strong associations between stress and the onset of adolescent emotional difficulties, research examining adolescents' perceptions of the psychological effects of the pandemic is of critical importance and is a focus of the current study. The present study utilized data from a sample of 277 middle-school adolescents in a Modern Orthodox Jewish day school who had resumed in-person schooling after having been schooled remotely during the first surge of the pandemic. This study aimed to explore the relationship between the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and adolescent psychological wellbeing and life satisfaction. Additionally, the study examined the roles of hope and spirituality as potential protective factors for psychological wellbeing, life satisfaction, resilience, and post-traumatic growth. Bivariate correlations revealed that those who were more impacted by COVID-19 showed significantly higher levels of post-traumatic growth, but lower life satisfaction and psychological wellbeing. Higher levels of hope and spirituality were associated with enhanced life satisfaction, psychological wellbeing, resilience, and post-traumatic growth. The interaction of psychological impact with both hope and spirituality on resilience was also significant, but post-hoc analyses did not follow predicted patterns. Psychological impact tended to be more negatively related to resilience when students had higher levels of hope and spirituality. The current study presented a unique research opportunity to gain insight into the perceived impact of the pandemic on adolescents in Jewish day schools and examine the role of hope and spirituality in relation to adolescent adjustment. The study's findings suggest a need to monitor adolescent mental health closely in the wake of the pandemic and introduce and integrate appropriate interventions within education to support and strengthen adolescent wellbeing and promote thriving.

"Psychological effect of COVID-19 on health care workers in primary care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Trinidad for the period March 2020 to March 2021","Objective: To assess the psychological effect of COVID- 19 on HCWs in primary care institutions (Health Centres) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Trinidad for the period March 2020-March 2021. Method(s): All staff at two sites were asked to complete a Google form questionnaire by convenience sampling. Demographics, DASS-21 and IES-R tools were collected. The scores were then calculated to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD among health care workers. Result(s): A total of 40 respondents completed the questionnaire in two health centres. From the total 40 HCWs, 32/40 (80%) were female whereas 8/40 (20%) were males, 16/40 (40%) were medical officers, 10/40 (25%) nurses, 9/40 (22.5%) auxiliary staff and 5/40 (12.5%) clerical staff. The DASS-21 tool revealed that anxiety presented with the highest prevalence, 47% (19 of 40 HCWs) followed by depression, 30% (12 of 40 HCWs) and stress, 22%, (9 of 40 HCWs). The IER-S tool revealed 15% (6 of 40 HCWS) had PTSD of clinical concern while 37.5% (15 0F 40 HCWs) had a score high enough to suppress the immune system.

"The cost of good mothering: Associations between intensive mothering, maternal well-being, and parenting experience","This three-paper dissertation aims to contribute to the growing literature of intensive mothering by providing empirical evidence on the links between endorsement of intensive mothering ideology on parenting-specific psychological well-being and parenting experiences. The first paper focuses on understanding the associations between the endorsement of intensive mothering, involvement in childcare, mental health symptoms, and parenting-specific psychological well-being, and whether mothers' demographic characteristics moderate these associations. Findings of this study illuminate how the message that mothers should engage in parenting behaviors that align with intensive mothering beliefs in order to achieve the status of ""good mother"" is linked with parenting experiences of mothers of young children. The second paper aims to extend previous studies on intensive mothering and maternal well-being by investigating the existence of different patterns of endorsement of intensive mothering beliefs and whether those different patterns are associated with maternal demographic characteristics, parenting guilt and parental burnout. This study employs Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify intensive mothering profiles based on mothers' endorsement of the five sub-beliefs of the Intensive Parenting Attitudes Questionnaire (IPAQ;Liss et al., 2013). Findings of this study highlight the heterogeneity of endorsement of intensive mothering beliefs and help understand who may be at greater risk of experiencing poor psychological outcomes linked with intensive mothering. The third paper investigates longitudinal associations between intensive mothering and self-reported changes in mothers' parenting behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, including examining parental burnout as a potential mediator of these associations. Findings of this study provide insight into how feelings of burnout may serve as a risk pathway that explains the impact of subscribing to intensive mothering on parenting behaviors during stressful times, such as the global pandemic.

"Fast-track for timely treatment of depression in college students","Background: Depression is a prevalent and leading issue among college students, which became worsened by the global pandemic of COVID-19. The Student Health Clinic in one of the tertiary public universities in Southern California also proved to be impacted with mental health complaints, depression being one of the most common diagnoses. The early treatment of depression is critical to avoid possible complications including suicidal ideation from untreated depression. Objectives: The primary objective was to implement a new workflow (Fast-Track) to treat students with uncomplicated depression as early as possible. Method: This project used a pre- and post-intervention design. The Fast-Track has three components: 1) reserving appointment slots from primary care providers' clinic schedules for the Fast-Track patients, 2) sending an education material about depression treatment options to the patients to read before an initial visit, 3) providing two follow-up visits at weeks 2, and 5 or 6. A descriptive analysis was performed for demographic data and secondary outcome (PHQ-9 score), Paired two sample t-Test was used for the primary outcome (time to treatment in days). Data from the participants who completed the two follow-up visits were included in the analysis. Results: A total of 24 patients met the criteria for uncomplicated depression. 16 patients completed the two follow-up visits. Time to treatment in days reduced from 19.2 days (SD 4.6) to 2.5 days (SD 1.8) (p &lt; 0.05). The mean PHQ-9 score at the baseline visit was 13.6 (SD 4.1) and 11.4 (SD 2.5) at the second follow-up visit with a mean change of -2. 2. 81.3% (n=13) of the 16 patients reported improvement at week 5 or 6 and 18.6 % (n=3) reported worsening of their depression symptoms. Conclusion: Opening up access to provider schedules greatly improved the patient's time to treatment. Utilizing primary care providers, including APRN's, in the management of simple, uncomplicated depression for college students was safe and successful. The outcomes seen in this project offer some insight into how the pharmacological treatment for simple, uncomplicated depression can be safely initiated sooner among college students.

"A cross-sectional observational study to assess the need for mental health check-up as a part of annual health check-up in health care workers","Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the frontline warriors in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and similar health crises. In developing countries, HCWs face high stress because they have to deal with the increased patient load and limited infrastructure. Long-term exposure to stress, anxiety, and depression may lead to impaired mental health in HCWs. It is, therefore, essential to assess the mental health of HCWs as a part of their annual health check-up. Objective(s): The present cross-sectional observational study was aimed to assess the mental health of HCWs by analysing the stress, anxiety and depression during their annual health check-up at a tertiary care hospital in North India. Method(s): Total 200 participants, including the consultants, and junior and senior resident doctors, were included in the study. The stress level was analyzed using PSS-10, and anxiety and depression were analyzed using GAD-7 and PHQ-9 respectively. Result(s): The mean PSS-10 score was 9.39 +/- 8.53, indicating low stress among HCWs;the mean GAD-7 score was 5.20 +/- 4.19, indicating mild anxiety in HCWs and the mean PHQ-9 score was 3.41 +/- 3.59, indicating minimal depression among HCWs. Conclusion(s): The present study revealed that the HCWs faced minimal to mild stress, anxiety, and depression. It is therefore recommended that the mental health check-up should be made a regular part of the annual health check-up in HCWs so that adequate, timely steps are taken to address the same.

"The Role of Media Use and Political Attitude on Mental Health during Covid-19 Lockdown in the Czech Republic","Introduction: media news exposure to traumatic events was previously correlated with the development of distress, PTSD, as well as other mental health issues. Considering our interest in mental health, we decided to study in more detail the impact of media news consumption as well as the role of political attitudes during the nationwide lockdown in the spring climax of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic. Method(s): In an online-survey (carried out 15-29 April 2020) we tested several factors of media news consumption (frequency of media exposure, use of media categories - public/mainstream/tabloid/disinformation, news reading habit, the usage of social media as a news source), as well as political attitude (political orientation and social activism). Subjective self-reported measures of anxiety, depression, general distress, health anxiety, and specific worries associated with COVID-19 were used. Result(s): We found some significant associations between the mental health measures and media/political variables. Discussion(s): Our findings show that higher frequency of media news exposure and the usage of social media predicted higher worries associated with COVID-19. It supports the claim that the overabundance of pandemic-related news in media increased the participant's perception of the situation as threatening. Also, our findings suggest that the exposure to tabloid and disinformation media can be considered a risk factor for mental health. Furthermore, our results indicate that quick browsing over the headlines as opposed to deep reading of news articles increased participants' distress. Finally, we discuss a negative effect of the distrust in the government on some of the mental health indicators.","Grygarova, D.; Fajmonova, V.; Jurickova, V.; Adamek, P.; Cerna, I.; Horacek, J.; Fajnerova, I.; Kesner, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Role+of+Media+Use+and+Political+Attitude+on+Mental+Health+during+Covid-19+Lockdown+in+the+Czech+Republic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatrie; JOUR:18, 25(Supplement 1).","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-13","",40946,""
"Association between news media use and mental health during covid-19 pandemics: A Czech representative study","Introduction: Negative effects of media news on mental health have been identified in previous research in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. The aim of our study was to relate mental health to more complex patterns of media news use and attitudes to the media. Secondly, we were interested in the effect of a long lockdown on mental health and its association with media news use. Method(s): Data were collected on a Czech representative sample during two waves of the nationwide pandemic lockdown in the Czech Republic (11/2020, 4/2021). Final study sample n = 1777. We asked for demographic data, measures of mental health (depression - PHQ-8;anxiety - GAD-7), and various measures of news media use. Statistical analysis: descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, multiple regression analysis. Result(s): 1. We found several significant media factors that predicted higher levels of both anxiety and depression, as well as factors that predicted lower anxiety and depression levels. 2. We found a significant increase in both anxiety and depression levels between the two waves of our survey. Discussion(s): 1. We interpret media factors that have played a negative role in mental health as indicators of the spread of negative mental states through traumatic content on four levels: behavioural level of consumption of negative information contained in COVID-19 media news reports;preoccupation with news content and its internalization;refusal of the negative information overload and the media itself manifesting in aversive reactions;social media environment that strengthens emotional biases. On the other hand, infotainment and contextual style of reading news eased the burden of the crisis. 2. The aggravation of mental health between the two observed periods suggests ongoing traumatization rather than habituation.","Grygarova, D.; Adamek, P.; Bakstein, E.; Fajnerova, I.; Horacek, J.; Jurickova, V.; Kesner, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Association+between+news+media+use+and+mental+health+during+covid-19+pandemics:+A+Czech+representative+study","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatrie; JOUR:26, 26(Supplement 1).","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-13","",40947,""
"The medicine of mercy: Preaching on addiction in the field hospital Parish","In the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, statistics related to the ongoing crisis of addiction in the United States hit record levels. Those statistics include drug overdose deaths, rates of substance use and misuse, and alcohol-related fatalities. Some Christian denominations and individual congregations, including a handful of Roman Catholic parishes, have sought to respond to the suffering experienced by those in active addiction through intentional ministries of care, support, and community. Yet preaching on the topic of addiction-and the hope found in recovery-remains rare in churches on Sunday morning. This thesis explores the complex and confounding realities of addiction, its causes, and multiple pathways to recovery, while articulating an urgent and salient call for Roman Catholic priests and deacons to address the crisis of addiction in their midst. The primary ministerial intervention for the thesis consisted of a one-day workshop for Roman Catholic priests and permanent deacons in Minnesota. Pre-workshop interviews were conducted with two cohorts: ten priests and permanent deacons in active ministry (Cohort One), and ten practicing Catholics in recovery from addiction (Cohort Two). The interviews considered whether preaching on the topic of addiction and recovery was taking place in Roman Catholic parishes around the country and what might be most helpful or harmful for people in recovery or in active addiction to hear from preaching in their parishes. Chapter 1 introduces the thesis project overall.Chapter 2 considers addiction theologically, focusing on three areas of study: sacramentality;sin, grace, and the unconditional love of God;and trauma-informed or trauma-sensitive theology. Chapter 3 explores the importance of story, specifically in the salvific and life-giving tradition of twelve-step storytelling and in the inductive practice of narrative preaching in the style of the New Homiletic. Chapter 4 provides a detailed exploration of addiction, considering clinical diagnostic criteria, neurological and sociological research, and current trends regarding the prevalence of stigma and challenges to achieving recovery for many. The chapter also considers multiple pathways to recovery, including twelve-step programs focused on abstinence, harm reduction strategies, and natural recovery methods. Chapter 5 reports on the ministerial intervention and provides key findings from the research conducted. Chapter 6 considers next steps and offers final conclusions.

"Sociocultural factors associated with persistent prescription opioid use among Puerto Rican adults in Massachusetts","Background: Understanding ecological-level factors associated with persistent prescription opioid use (PPOU) may inform research and efforts to reduce prescription opioid-related complications. Puerto Rican Adults (PRAs) have disparities in health outcomes and depression and may be at greater risk of PPOU. Determinants of allostatic loads, including acculturation, migration history, social support, perceived discrimination, have not been explored as correlates of PPOU among PRAs. Further, no study has explored whether depressive symptoms affect PRA's PPOU. Opioid overdose fatality rates among Hispanics have further increased amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, amplifying the need for exploration of socio-ecological level factors associated with PPOU. Aim: The primary aim of this study was to estimate the incidence and prevalence of prescription opioid use (POU) among PRAs and to evaluate whether sociocultural factors of acculturation and migration history (intrapersonal), social support and network size (interpersonal), and perceived discrimination (community level) predicted PPOU. Furthermore, this study examined the relationship between depression and PPOU and whether depression mediated the effects of perceived discrimination on PPOU. Method: The Socio-Ecological Model (SEM) was adapted to guide this longitudinal secondary analysis study of the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (BPRHS) cohort. The BPRHS is an ongoing cohort study of PRAs in the Greater Boston area. Baseline (0-year), 2-year, and 5-year datasets were used to estimate incidence and prevalence of POU among the PRA's cohort. The measures were acculturation and migration history, social support and network size, perceived discrimination, depression symptoms, and PPOU. Association between incidence and prevalence of POU by demographic factors were examined. The relationship between SEM-level factors and depression were examined with binary logistic regression. Using Baron and Kenny's method (1986), multivariable binary logistic and linear regression models examined whether depression mediated the effects of perceived discrimination on PPOU. Results: Participants were 45-75 years old (N = 798) of Puerto Rican descent (72.9% women) with 6.5% persistent opioid users compared to non-users (93.5%). Increasing incidence and prevalence of POU were observed at each follow-up. Lower income households were more likely to have higher incidence and prevalence of POU. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed an association between perceived discrimination and PPOU (OR = 2.85, 95% CI 1.46-5.58). No significant association was observed between acculturation, migratory history, social support and PPOU. Depressive symptoms were associated with PPOU (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.05, p &lt;= 0.03) and partially mediated the effects of perceived discrimination on PPOU by 10.3%, after adjustment of covariates. Conclusion: Reports of associations between perceived discrimination, depression and PPOU broadens current knowledge on factors linked to PPOU in the PRAs subpopulation. This research has important implications for policy, nursing research and clinical practice. Nurses and healthcare professionals may design tailored interventions to reduce PPOU by targeting these risk factors. Addressing perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms may impact PRA's exposure to PPOU and reduce their risk of prescription opioid-related complications. Future research should explore other multi-level factors that may influence PPOU and other potential mechanisms that may explain the effects of perceived discrimination on PPOU.

"Heart rate variability (HRV) training leads to improvements in measures of employee mental and physical health during COVID-19 pandemic, with implications for theory building and HRD","Data indicated that work-related stress could cost organizations financially, with losses associated with decreased productivity, healthcare costs and organizational dysfunction. Excessive stress in the workplace can cause significant costs to the employee as measured by declines in psychological and physiological health. Stress induced health symptoms and corresponding costs to the organization may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 Pandemic. These disruptions can affect organizational functioning as well the system's ability to dynamically respond to opportunities, challenges and organizational goals all of which can further increase employee stress and associated health outcomes. Human resource development professionals are in a position to offer interventions to help employees and organizational systems adjust to these new demands. Heart rate variability (HRV) training as a workplace wellness intervention to reduce stress for impacted employees has emerged as a promising line of research and applied work, with data supporting improved physical/mental health, learning and development and organizational outcomes.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a HRV training intervention on measures of employee health and organizational outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Empirical data collection for this inquiry was operationalized with a quantitative, between-groups, experimental research design to test the effects of a HRV self-regulation training on participants who were randomly assigned to active treatment groups and non-participant groups (wait-list control). Participants were assessed on psychological and physiological health and organizational outcomes by analyzing results of the POQA-R4 survey. The study population (N = 147) consisted of employees at a large, multi-national, independent public company in the multi-utilities industry. Data analyses concluded that three of this study's five hypotheses were upheld. Hypotheses related to emotional stress (moderate effect size), physical stress (moderate effect size) and emotional vitality (borderline moderate effect size) were upheld. The findings associated with mental and physical stress were consistent with previous literature, while organizational results were more ambiguous. Based on these findings, recommendations for future research, application, theory building and implications for HRD were offered. Specific recommendations included further refinement of conceptual/theoretical frames, measurement variables and assessment tools. Recommendations for practice focused on providing evidenced based wellness interventions (such as HRV self-regulation training), and reinforcing the organizational culture to support a range of wellness needs and to strengthen social systems, which serve as protective and mediating factors in times of stress. These recommendations may position HRD professionals as agile and dynamic leaders who implement organizational wellness to both support business objectives while reinforcing a culture of care.
