"Impact of COVID-19 on education, health and lifestyle behaviour of Brazilian urology residents","Objectives: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical and surgical practice, educational activities, health and lifestyle behavior of Brazilian urology residents. Materials and Methods: A web-based survey was sent to 468 Brazilian urology residents from postgraduate years (PGY) 3 to 5 to collect data on clinical practice and training after 4 months of COVID-19. We also assessed health-related and behavior changes, rate of infection by SARS-CoV-2, deployment to the front line of COVID-19, residents concerns, and access to personal protective equipment (PPE). Results: Massive reductions in elective and emergency patient consultations, diagnostic procedures and surgeries were reported across the country, affecting PGY 3 to 5 alike. Most in-person educational activities were abolished. The median damage to the urological training expected for 2020 was 6.0 [3.4 -7.7], on a scale from 0 to 10, with senior residents estimating a greater damage (P< 0.001). Educational interventions developed included online case-based discussions, subspeciality conferences and lectures, and grand rounds. Most senior residents favored extending residency to compensate for training loss and most younger residents favored no additional training (p< 0.001). Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (43.8%), reduced physical activity (68.6%), increased alcoholic intake (44.9%) and cigarette consumption (53.6%), worsening of sexual life (25.2%) and feelings of sadness or depression (48,2%). Almost half were summoned to work on the COVID-19 front-line and 24.4% had COVID-19. Most residents had inadequate training to deal with COVID-19 patients and most reported a shortage of PPE. Residents concerns included the risk of contaminating family members, being away from residency program, developing severe COVID-19 and overloading colleagues. Conclusions: COVID-19 had a massive impact in Brazilian urology residents training, health and lifestyle behavior, which may reflect what happened in other medical specialties. Studies should confirm these findings to help developing strategies to mitigate residents losses.","Jose A Prezotti Sr.; Joao Victor T Henriques Sr.; Luciano Favorito; Alfredo F Canalini Sr.; Marcos G Machado Sr.; Thulio Bosi Sr.; Akemi M Barbosa; Julyana Moromizato; Karin Anzolch; Roni Fernandes; Fransber Rodrigues; Carlos Henrique Bellucci; Caroline Santos Silva; Antonio Carlos Lima Pompeo; Jose de Bessa Jr.; Cristiano M Gomes","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250518","20210127","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9900,""
"A cross-sectional survey of the workplace factors contributing to symptoms of anxiety and depression among nurses and physicians during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in two US healthcare systems","Background: Anxiety and depression among physicians and nurses during COVID-19 pandemic in the USA is not well described and its modifiable causes poorly understood. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) among physicians and nurses in two US healthcare systems June-Sept 2020. We ascertained features of work as well as its perceptions and associated concerns in relation to risk of anxiety and depression, while controlling for health history via regression and path analyses. Results: About a third of 684 nurses and 185 physicians surveyed showed symptoms of anxiety or depression, the excess was particularly prominent in nurses. Belief in having been infected was a dominant cause of anxiety and depression, more related to history of symptoms of pneumonia, then the contact with infected patients. Having confidence in competent use and access to personal protective equipment, maintaining usual working hours and being surrounded by colleagues who were both sufficient in numbers and not stressed, was protective. Having support of immediate family and religious communities lessened anxiety and depression after accounting for other factors. Involvement in aerosol-generating procedures with infected patients was linked with lower depression in nurses but higher among physicians. Likewise, the setting of recent patient encounters affected risk differently for physicians and nurses. Conclusions: Our findings may help develop mitigation measures and underscore the need to help nurses and physicians bear the psychological burden of COVID-19 pandemic and similar events in the future.","Igor Burstyn; Karyn Holt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250315","20210126","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9901,""
"Psychobehavioral Responses, Post-Traumatic Stress and Depression in Pregnancy During the Early Phase of COVID-19 Outbreak","Objective: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has aroused a range of negative effects  Such considerable influence can be greater in vulnerable populations including pregnant women  This study aimed to assess the presence of prenatal depression (PND, as an important risk factor of postpartum depression) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to characterize infection-induced preventive behaviors and psychological responses in the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak  Methods: Based on a population-based sample of pregnant women from all regions in China, presence of probable PND and suspected PTSD were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (=13) and the PTSD Checklist (=14), respectively  A web-based questionnaire was used to assess psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19  Results: Among a total of 1908 questionnaires returned, 1901 women provided valid data (mean [SD] age, 28 9 [4 7] years)  High prevalence of probable PND (34%) and suspected PTSD (40%) among pregnant women was observed  Those with suspected PTSD presented six times higher risk of probable PND than the non-suspected (OR=7 83, 95% CI: 6 29â€“9 75;p75%)  Conclusions: High prevalence of PND and PTSD and high levels of anxiety suggest profound impacts of the present outbreak on mental health  This calls for special attention and support for vulnerable populations  Mental health care should become part of public health measures during the present outbreak and should continue to be intensified to empower the health system for post-outbreak periods","Zhang, C.

"Mental health care of medical workers during COVID-19 pandemic","During the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, healthcare workers are at the forefront of the battle undergoing not only significant physical but also emotional stress  At the same time medical workers are considered to be at high risk for the incidence of COVID-19  Staying in a state of constant emotional stress over time leads to the emergence of both mental and somatic disorders  The purpose of this article is to conduct a literature review on the principles of consistency regarding the mental health of staff members of medical institutions providing care to patients with COVID-19  A systematic literature search has been carried out, as a result of which 32 articles with reports of mental and behavioral disorders during the pandemic have been selected for analysis  The main group of disorders are disorders of the anxious-depressive spectrum  According to various sources, from a quarter to a third of medical workers have clinically significant anxiety, about a third - depression  Significant prevalence of sleep disorders in individuals providing medical care to patients with COVID-19 has also been indicated  In the long term, the expectation of an increase in the level ofpost-traumatic stress disorder has been indicated  The article also provides modern views on the socio-psychological effects of epidemics and pandemics  Excessive attention, especially on social media devoted to the problem of COVID-19 significantly complicates the fight against the real problem of overcoming the pandemic  It has been proven that over concentration of attention on problems associated with COVID-19 is a factor of the increased risk of developing generalized anxiety disorder  Thus, the protection of mental health and the socio-psychological support of medical workers are some of the important directions in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic  The management of psychological crises during pandemics should be based on psycho-hygienic and psycho-preventive measures both at the level of the individual and society as a whole","Yuryeva, L.

"Mental resilience to stressor prevalence and severity during the Corona lockdown in Europe","Background: The rising prevalence of stress-related mental and physical disorders over the past decades, and more recently in connection to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights the need for a better understanding of stress-protective factors (resilience factors)  Resilience has been conceptualised as the maintenance or quick recovery of mental health following exposure to adversity  By studying psycho-social factors that influence resilience in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was possible to examine population-wide responses to stressors of unusually similar nature  Methods: In a first interim analysis of an international resilience study we examined data from 5000 European adults collected during the first phases of pandemic-related movement and contact restrictions (â€˜lockdownâ€™)  Linear regression, regularised regression, and mediation analyses were employed to compare the influence of nine potential resilience factors according to preregistered hypotheses (osf io/r6btn)  Results: All hypothesized resilience factors were significantly associated with resilience as an outcome  Compared to other resilience factors, positive appraisal of the COVID-19 pandemic showed the strongest effect  Results confirmed our primary hypothesis that general positive appraisal style (PAS) is positively associated with resilience, and further revealed that PAS mediates the positive influence of perceived social support on resilience  Discussion: The investigated resilience factors provide promising targets for health interventions that aim to improve stress resilience in general or in the face of prolonged pandemic-related adversity  To improve intervention planning, future research should also investigate the influence of socio-demographic factors on resilience factor use and efficacy, as well as the dynamics of time-variant resilience development in response to stressors exposure","Veer, I.; Riepenhausen, A.; Zerban, M.; Wackerhagen, C.; Engen, H.; Puhlmann, L.

"Empirical analysis of COVID-19 induced socio cognitive factors and its impact on residents of Penang Island","Purpose: Pandemic like coronavirus (COVID-19) poses a major challenge to countries like Malaysia where tourism is one of the major contributors to the national gross domestic product  Pandemics observed through the years have not only presented a medical challenge but also had a large impact on the psychological well-being of society  Overcoming these challenges required a strategically structured response on the medical and social front  To achieve the said goal on the social front, it is necessary to understand the cognitive appraisal and response of the public during this stressful environment  The restricted movement control used to curb the further spread of the disease drastically hampered tourism in Malaysia  This study aims to follow a statistical analysis based on the cognitive appraisal theory to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the public residing in Penang Island which is one of the most famous tourist destinations in the world  Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional, observational study design was carried out for this research  Snowball sampling technique was used and the data was collected via a semi-structured online questionnaire measuring the psychological health of people present in Penang Island  Findings: The study reports a positive response in terms of disease awareness and proper observation of preventive measures, yet a high level of pandemic induced anxiety was statistically estimated  The study proposes mental health care initiative to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic  Originality/value: This study reports a possible link between the mental wellness of the residents and domestic tourism in Penang Island during the COVID-19 pandemic  Â© 2020, International Tourism Studies Association","Salman, A.; Kamerkar, U.; Jaafar, M.; Mohamad, D.","https://doi.org/10.1108/IJTC-05-2020-0091","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Journal of Tourism Cities;2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Tourism Cities;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9915,""

"P239 The impact of COVID-19 shielding on levels of physical activity and health-related quality of life in COPD patients following pulmonary rehabilitation","IntroductionTo prevent infection during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, COPD patients were instructed to â€˜shieldâ€™, resulting in restrictions to usual daily activities, potentially negating health benefits attained during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR)  The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a shielding period on physical activity levels and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in COPD patients who completed a course of supervised PR before shielding in March 2020 MethodsCOPD patients who completed an 8-week PR course between January and March 2020 were enrolled into this single centre, observational cohort study  Physical activity was measured using accelerometry (Actigraph wGT3X) and the Clinical Visit of Proactive Physical Activity in COPD (C-PPAC) instrument (that captures the domains of amount and difficulty of physical activity;Gimeno-Santos et al  ERJ 2015) in the week preceding PR, the week following completion of PR and for a week 3 months following completion of PR during the shielding period (April to July 2020)  Additionally, assessment of HRQoL (COPD Assessment Test [CAT] and Clinical COPD Questionnaire [CCQ]) and psychological wellbeing (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]) was undertaken ResultsIn ten COPD patients (FEV1: 55Â±23% predicted), a significant and clinically meaningful decrease in daily steps was shown from post-PR to shielding (4129Â±2245 versus 2508Â±1186 steps/day;p=0 030), as well as pre-PR to shielding (3681Â±2025 versus 2508Â±1186 steps/day;p=0 015)  Likewise, there was a significant and clinically meaningful worsening in the C-PPAC score from post-PR to shielding (68Â±13 versus 59Â±13 points;p=0 060), but not pre-PR to shielding (61Â±11 versus 59Â±13 points;p=1 000)  There were no statistically or clinically meaningful changes in HADS and CAT scores  However, the worsening in CCQ scores from post-PR to shielding did exceed clinically meaningful margins (Â±0 4 points) for both functional (+0 5 points) and mental domains (+0 7 points) ConclusionsIn COPD, the shielding period had a negative impact on physical activity levels, evidenced by reduced daily steps compared to not only post-PR, but also pre-PR  This decline below baseline values could have led to further physical deconditioning, potentially reversing some of the benefits gained during PR and worsening long term disease-related outcomes","Hume, E.; Armstrong, M.; Manifield, J.; Vogiatzis, I.","https://doi.org/10.1136/thorax-2020-BTSabstracts.383","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Thorax;76(Suppl 1):A218, 2021.; Publication details: Thorax;76(Suppl 1):A218, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9926,""

"Do Animals Play a Role in the Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)? A Commentary","Simple Summary: This commentary addresses the zoonotic and epidemiological aspects of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic that is affecting the whole world with a contagion curve that continues to grow  This work aims to highlight the role that animals might play in the epidemiology of the disease  As knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 has progressed, most of the scientific information confirms that animals cannot transmit the virus to humans  There is evidence that people who have tested positive for COVID-19 can infect pets, farm animals, and wild animals  However, very recently, a SARS-Cov-2 variant related to minks has been found in mink workers in Denmark with a disease severity that is similar to those infected with non-mink-related variants  Further studies are therefore necessary  The concept of ""One Health"" recognizes the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health, and aims to improve public health outcomes through the understanding and prevention of risks that originate at the interfaces between humans, animals, and their environments  It is therefore important that veterinarians share information with public health officers to assess the risks of transmission from people infected with COVID-19 to animals, or to determine when animals could spread pandemic viruses  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the Beta-coronavirus genus  It is 96 2% homologous to bat CoV RaTG13 and 88% homologous to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses  SARS-CoV-2 is the infectious agent responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in the Hubei province of Wuhan, China, at the beginning of December 2019  Human transmission from COVID-19 patients or incubation carriers occurs via coughing, sneezing, speaking, discharge from the nose, or fecal contamination  Various strains of the virus have been reported around the world, with different virulence and behavior  In addition, SARS-CoV-2 shares certain epitopes with some taxonomically related viruses, with tropism for the most common synanthropic animals  By elucidating the immunological properties of the circulating SARS-CoV-2, a partial protection due to humanâ€“animal interactions could be supposed in some situations  In addition, differential epitopes could be used for the differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection  There have been cases of transmission from people with COVID-19 to pets such as cats and dogs  In addition, wild felines were infected  All These animals were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and recovered spontaneously  Experimental studies showed cats and ferrets to be more susceptible to COVID-19  COVID-19 positive dogs and felines do not transmit the infection to humans  In contrast, minks at farms were severely infected from people with COVID-19  A SARS-Cov-2 variant in the Danish farmed mink that had been previously infected by COVID-19 positive workers, spread to mink workers causing the first case of animal-to-human infection transmission that causes a moderate decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies  Thus, more investigations are necessary  It remains important to understand the risk that people with COVID-19 pose to their pets, as well as wild or farm animals so effective recommendations and risk management measures against COVID-19 can be made  A One Health unit that facilitates collaboration between public health and veterinary services is recommended  [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Animals (2076-2615) is the property of MDPI Publishing and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission  However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use  This abstract may be abridged  No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy  Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract  (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","Costagliola, Anna, Liguori, Giovanna, d'Angelo, Danila, Costa, Caterina, Ciani, Francesca, Giordano, Antonio","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11010016","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Animals (2076-2615);11(1):16-16, 2021.; Publication details: Animals (2076-2615);11(1):16-16, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9933,""

"COVID-19 and intimate partner violence: Prevalence of resilience and perceived stress during a pandemic","COVID-19 is a pandemic event not seen in a century  This research aims to identify the group differences regarding resilience and perceived stress for those who identified as single, in a relationship not experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV), and those in a relationship experiencing IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic  This study uses a cross-sectional design, with purposive snowball sampling, for primary survey data collected over 10 weeks starting the first week in April 2020 (n = 374)  Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire on demographics and behavioral factors  Resilience was assessed using the 10-item Connor Davidson Resilience Scale, and perceived stress was assessed using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale  Two one-way analysis of variance procedures were performed to identify statistically significant differences across 3 groups, those not in a relationship, those in a relationship not experiencing IPV, and those in a relationship and experiencing IPV  Analyses indicate that those experiencing IPV reported lower resilience and greater perceived stress  Analyses also show those in the experiencing IPV group were statistically significantly different from those in a relationship without IPV and those in the single group with respect to resilience  Those in the IPV experiences group were also statistically significantly different from the group of participants in relationships without reported IPV experiences with respect to perceived stress  These findings provide empirical support for the contention that public health measures put in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 might have negative, unintentional consequences for people experiencing IPV and mental health issues  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Buttell, Frederick, Cannon, Clare E.; Rose, Katherine, Ferreira, Regardt J.","https://doi.org/10.1037/trm0000296","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Traumatology;: No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication details: Traumatology;: No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9935,""
"Perceived stress, depression, and anxiety during the Covid-19 pandemic","Background: Experiencing severe or prolonged stressors in early life is associated with increased risk for mental and physical disorders in adulthood  Individuals with a history of early life adversity (ELA) may use dysfunctional coping strategies like stress-related eating, in contrast to more beneficial stress coping mechanisms like mindfulness  Whether these associations contribute to increased levels of perceived stress and symptoms of mental disorders in individuals with ELA in times of crisis is yet unclear  The current Covid-19 pandemic allows researchers to investigate stress-coping as mediators in the association between ELA and subjective stress experience in response to crisis  Methods As part of a larger project, we assessed changes in perceived stress, psychopathological symptoms, and eating behavior in a sample of N = 102 participants (81% female;meanage = 23 45, range 18â€“62) from October/December 2019 (prior to the pandemic) to April/June 2020 (after the German government introduced Covid-19 related restrictions)  Further, we assessed ELA and dispositional mindfulness  The study protocol and preregistration of our hypotheses can be obtained online (https://osf io/h5tjx/)  Results Preliminary results show significant increases in perceived stress levels and depression, significant decrease in anxiety symptoms, and no significant change in somatization symptoms  Additional results from multiple regression and bootstrapping mediation models will be presented and discussed  Conclusion The increase in perceived stress during the Covid-19 pandemic in a majority of participants emphasizes the severity of the current pandemic and implicates important considerations stress researchers should take into account when collecting data during the ongoing pandemic, e g  by statistically controlling for stress levels","Benz, A.; Meier, M.; Bentele, U.

"Access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid dependence in the United States - identifying implications for policy and practice","Americans make and use the most opioids in the world  Although comprising somewhat less than 5% of the world's population, the United States (US) produces approximately 90% of the global supply of Hydrocodone and consumes an estimated 80% of the total international supply  It is not surprising, therefore, that the American opioid epidemic, particularly as it involves adults (those 18 years and older), is worsening-Indeed, President Trump declared it a national public health emergency  Many therefore anticipate that the US Congress will enact evidence-informed policies to address the opioid crisis  Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a pattern of opioid use that leads to such adverse consequences as hormonal dysfunction, immune-system suppression, overdose, and death  The gold standard for OUD therapy is medication-assisted treatment (MAT), best described as managing OUD using methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone in addition to counseling and behavioral therapy  MAT access is low in the US This study investigates access to MAT by age group in the US  Its primary aim is to investigate barriers faced by adults diagnosed with OUD in accessing MAT by examining the constructs in a conceptual framework that includes the influence of policy, environment, population features, health behavior, and health outcomes on access to MAT  Given the huge burden of OUD, findings from this project have important implications for policy and practice  Results suggest that barriers for adults diagnosed with OUD in accessing MAT include being male, being a young adult, and having some post-high school education but not at a four-year school  Other barriers are being an Alaskan Native/ American Indian, Asian/ Pacific Islander/ Native Hawaiian, or having another single or multiple racial background  In light of the implications drawn from these findings, it is recommended that policymakers develop better policies aimed at addressing the identified MAT access issues  It is also recommended that US public health organizations and practitioners implement effective age-friendly and culturally competent MAT programs to lower these barriers  Findings from this study also provide guidance for future opioid research and OUD-management initiatives at a time when the opioid crisis will compete with the current COVID-19 pandemic for already- scarce resources  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Adeniyi, Mofoluwake Adijolola","https://www.google.com/search?q=Access+to+medication-assisted+treatment+for+opioid+dependence+in+the+United+States+-+identifying+implications+for+policy+and+practice","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering;82(4-B):No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication details: Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering;82(4-B):No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9942,""

"""We have become prisoners of our own age"": From a continuing care retirement community to a total institution in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, people residing in continuing care retirement communities (CCRC) found themselves under strict instructions to self-isolate, imposed by the CCRC managements before, during, and after the nationwide lockdown. The present study explored the personal experiences of CCRC residents during the lockdown. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 CCRC residents from 13 different CCRCs. Authors performed a thematic analysis of interview transcripts, using constant comparisons and contrasts. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: a). US VS. THEM: OTHERS ARE WORSE OFF: Older residents engaged in constant attempts to compare their situation to that of others. The overall message behind these downward comparisons was that the situation is not so bad, as others are in a worse predicament; b). US VS. THEM: POWER IMBALANCE: This comparison emphasized the unbalanced power-relations between older adults and the staff and management in the setting; and c). ""WE HAVE BECOME PRISONERS OF OUR OWN AGE."": Interviewees described strong emotions of despair, depression and anger, which were intensified when the rest of society returned back to a new routine, while they were still under lockdown. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The measures imposed on residents by managements of CCRCs during the lockdown, and the emotional responses of distress among some of the residents, revealed that CCRCs have components of total institutions, not normally evident. This underscores the hidden emotional costs of the lockdown among those whose autonomy was compromised.","Ayalon, Liat; Avidor, Sharon","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab013","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Age Ageing;2021 Jan 22.; Publication details: Age Ageing;2021 Jan 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9945,""
"Perspectives on the Impact of Digital Interventions on Loneliness: Qualitative Focus Group with Lonely Happify Health Users During COVID-19","Loneliness is a growing area of concern, attracting attention as a public health concern due to its association with a variety of psychological and physical health problems. However, interventions targeting loneliness are less common than interventions for other mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and existing interventions focus primarily on building social skills and increasing opportunities for social interaction despite research suggesting these techniques are not the most effective. Furthermore, although there is an increasing need for scalable and convenient interventions, digital interventions for loneliness are even less common. Using a qualitative approach, we explored how adults (18-64 years of age) who express wanting to be more connected to others experience loneliness and react to a digital mental health intervention targeting loneliness. 11 participants were recruited from a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) exploring the impact of a digital mental health intervention, Happify Health, on loneliness among adults aged 18 to 64 who indicated wanting to feel more connected to others when signing up for the platform. Participants were invited to participate in a 3-day asynchronous focus group about their experiences with loneliness, with Happify Health, and with social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic; 11 participants completed the focus group in May 2020. Participants' responses were coded using thematic analysis, which led to identifying 5 themes, each with separate subthemes, that could be applied across the 3-day focus group: loneliness, relationships, social distancing, skill acquisition, and coping. Overall, we observed variability across participants in terms of the source of their loneliness, their perceptions of their social connections, and their motivation to reduce feelings of loneliness; however, participants commonly referred to negative self-perceptions as a cause or consequence of loneliness. Participants also varied in the extent to which they felt social distancing increased or decreased feelings of loneliness. In regards to the intervention, participants showed evidence of adopting skills they used to address their loneliness, particularly mindfulness and gratitude, and then using these skills to shift towards more active coping strategies following the intervention, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. The heterogeneity in participants' experiences with loneliness described during this focus group emphasizes the subjective and complex nature of loneliness. This highlights the importance of developing loneliness interventions that employ a variety of strategies, including both direct and indirect strategies for reducing loneliness. However, based on our data, a key component to loneliness interventions is incorporating strategies for addressing underlying negative self-perceptions that stem from, but also contribute to, loneliness. The current data also provide preliminary evidence that digital platforms may be an effective tool for disseminating loneliness interventions while providing the added benefit of offering a productive distraction when feeling lonely.","Boucher, McNaughton, Harake, Stafford, Parks","https://doi.org/10.2196/26617","20210126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9946,""
"Management of Chronic Pain in Nursing Homes: Navigating Challenges to Improve Person-Centered Care","Despite the dynamic demands in the nursing home (NH), a definitive approach to managing chronic pain in older adults has yet to be established. Due to concerns for potential adverse pharmacologic effects, balancing appropriate pain management is a challenge among NH residents. The challenges encompass but are not limited to medical complexities, functional disabilities, and physical frailty. Barriers to the successful implementation of a comprehensive chronic pain management at the NH may include ambiguous directions on specific therapeutic interventions, insufficient guidance on treatment duration, and limited available treatment options. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' reporting requirement of adequate pain control among NH residents coupled with widely variable clinician-prescribing habits highlights the difficulties in overcoming the preceding challenges and barriers. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further complicated pain management due to its negative consequences on well-being of residents of NHs. Associated symptoms of psychosocial stress, anxiety and depression, and chronic pain symptoms can exacerbate during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased requirement for pain medications including but not limited to opioids. Pain is a multidimensional symptom and requires a strategic multimodal approach for its management. Nonpharmacologic modalities are underutilized in the NH setting and are the preferred first steps for mild pain, and nonopioid pharmacological agents can be added as a second step for a synergistic effect for moderate to severe pain. Opioids should be used as a last resort. Short-acting opioids are preferred over extended-release/long-acting opioids for chronic pain. Clinicians are encouraged to engage residents in proactive strategies in managing their pain, and to set realistic expectations toward improving their quality of life, as complete elimination of pain is not feasible in most cases. This review article provides the interdisciplinary team with a contemporary perspective of the multitude of changes and challenges influencing the prescribing as well as deprescribing of various pain medications.","Sheikh, Brandt, Vinh, Elon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.12.029","20210126","Chronic pain; analgesic/opioids; frail elderly; medication management; nursing homes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9947,""
"Anxiety and its association with perceived stress and insomnia among nurses fighting against COVID-19 in Wuhan: a cross-sectional survey","To investigate the present status of anxiety among nurses fighting the spread of COVID-19 and its association with perceived stress and insomnia. With the outbreak of COVID-19, nurses have been caring for infected patients for a considerable length of time in Wuhan, China. Previous COVID-19 studies generally focused on patients' medical treatment, but few considered healthcare workers' psychological needs while working with a pandemic involving an unfamiliar infectious disease. Numerous nurses have experienced mental health problems, such as anxiety. The STROBE guidelines for a cross-sectional questionnaire were implemented. An online survey of 643 frontline nurses working with COVID-19 patients was conducted from March 3 to 10, 2020. Sociodemographic data were collected, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, and the Athens Insomnia Scale were administered. One-third (33.4%) of participants reported anxiety, which was associated with perceived stress and insomnia among Chinese frontline nurses in Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant associations were found between anxiety, perceived stress, insomnia, working four-night shifts per week, experience working during more than two epidemics, and fear of COVID-19. This study found that a substantial proportion of frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients experienced anxiety. We recommend that nurse managers focus on working conditions and cultivate safe and satisfactory work environments. Meanwhile, frontline nurses should foster awareness of mental health and rely on online resources for psychological training to alleviate anxiety. The findings of this study could facilitate better understanding of anxiety among frontline nurses; more importantly, health care authorities and nursing managers need to pay more attention to ensuring intervention training to reduce anxiety for frontline nurses worldwide.","Shen, Zhan, Zheng, Liu, Wan, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15678","20210126","COVID-19; anxiety; cross-sectional survey; insomnia; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9948,""
"Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated With Self-reported Psychological Distress Among Children and Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China","Schools have been suspended nationwide in 188 countries, and classes have shifted to home-based distance learning models to control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Additional information is needed to determine mental health status among school-aged children and adolescents during this public health crisis and the risk factors associated with psychological distress during the pandemic. To assess self-reported psychological distress among school-aged children and adolescents associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study using data from a survey on the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents in Guangdong province, China, conducted by using a stratified cluster random sampling method between March 8 to 30, 2020. To estimate outcomes associated with location of districts, only data from students with internet protocol addresses and current addresses in Guangdong were included. Data were analyzed from April 5 to July 20, 2020. Home-based distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main outcome was self-reported psychological distress, measured using the total score on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire of 3 or greater. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors associated with mental health status. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to analyze the associations of factors with psychological distress. Among 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯310Ã¢â‚¬Â¯600 students who completed the survey, 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯199Ã¢â‚¬Â¯320 students (mean [SD] age, 12.04 [3.01] years; 619Ã¢â‚¬Â¯144 [51.6%] boys) were included in the final analysis. A total of 126Ã¢â‚¬Â¯355 students (10.5%) self-reported psychological distress. Compared with students in primary school, high school students had increased risk of psychological distress (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.15-1.23]). Compared with students who wore a face mask frequently, students who never wore a face mask had increased risk of psychological distress (OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 2.41-2.79]). Additionally, students who spent less than 0.5 hours exercising had increased odds of self-reported psychological distress compared with students who spent more than 1 hour exercising (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.61-1.67]). These findings suggest that the prevalence of self-reported psychological distress among students during the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively high. Frequency of wearing a face mask and time spent exercising were factors associated with mental health. Therefore, it may be necessary for governments, schools, and families to pay attention to the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and take corresponding countermeasures to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' mental health.","Qin, Shi, Xue, Lin, Zhang, Liang, Lu, Wu, Chen, Zheng, Qian, Ouyang, Zhang, Yi, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35487","20210126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9949,""
"Association Between Care Utilization and Anxiety Outcomes in an On-Demand Mental Health System: Retrospective Observational Study","Anxiety is an extremely prevalent condition, and yet, it has received notably less attention than depression and other mental health conditions from a research, clinical, and public health perspective. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated growing concerns about the burden of anxiety due to the confluence of physical health risks, economic stressors, social isolation, and general disruption of daily activities. This study examines differences in anxiety outcomes by care modality (coaching, teletherapy and telepsychiatry, and combined care) within an on-demand mental health system. We also explore the association between levels of engagement within each care modality and odds of improvement in symptoms of anxiety. We conducted a retrospective observational study of individuals who accessed Ginger, an on-demand mental health system. Data were collected from 1611 Ginger members between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. We used logistic regression to assess the association between care modality and improvement in anxiety symptoms. Within each modality, we assessed the association between level of engagement and improvement. Of 1611 Ginger members, 761 (47.0%) experienced a decrease in anxiety symptoms, as measured by a change from a positive to a negative 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) screen. Among members who still screened positive at follow-up (865/1611, 53%), a total of 192 members (11.9%) experienced a clinically significant score reduction in the full GAD-7 (ie, a score reduction of &gt;5 points), even though their GAD-2 scores were still positive. All modalities showed increased odds of improvement compared to those who were not engaged with coaching or clinical services (&quot;app-only&quot;). Higher GAD-7 intake scores were also associated with decreased odds of improvement. This study found increased odds of anxiety improvement for all care modalities compared to those who did not engage in care, with larger effect sizes for higher utilization within all care modalities. Additionally, there is a promising observation that those engaged in combined care (teletherapy and text-based coaching) had the greatest odds of anxiety improvement. Future directions include more detailed classifications of utilization patterns and an exploration of explanations and solutions for lower-utilization members.","Kunkle, Yip, Hunt, ÃŽÅ¾, Udall, Arean, Nierenberg, Naslund","https://doi.org/10.2196/24662","20210126","anxiety; digital health; mental health; observational; outcome; retrospective; telehealth; utilization; virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9950,""
"Compassionate leadership: how to support your team when fixing the problem seems impossible","Stress, suboptimal mental health and an inadequate work-life balance are underlying and serious issues in the nursing profession, affecting staff recruitment and retention and potentially having a detrimental effect on patient care. While compassion towards patients is central to the nursing role, often 'compassion towards the compassionate' is lacking. The need for compassion is even more important now, and in the months ahead, due to the additional stressors experienced by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, whether they are on the front line, furloughed or shielding. This article includes reflections from nursing staff and uses their stories to encourage reflection on ethical and moral dilemmas experienced during the pandemic. The Compassion in the Workplace model is suggested as a tool that can be used by nurse managers to examine their compassion levels and to support the development of a compassionate workplace. In addition, this article offers some practical ideas on what compassionate leadership might look like in day-to-day practice.","Vogel, Flint","https://doi.org/10.7748/nm.2021.e1967","20210126","mental health; occupational health; occupational stress; stress; workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9951,""
"Perspectives of Ketamine Use in COVID-19 Patients","Hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected patients suffer from both physical impairments and mental stress. Respiratory insufficiency and cardiovascular disturbances require most of the intensive care interventions, but they are also accompanied by depressive conditions, sadness and fear of dying. Sedatives are mostly respiratory and cardiovascular depressants and do not provide resistance to the pro-inflammatory burst induced by the virus. Ketamine is a unique and safe drug that enables well-controlled sedation and anesthesia, attenuates depression and mitigates suicidal thoughts, without depressing respiratory or cardiovascular mechanics.

"Transactional Associations Between Parent and Late Adolescent Internalizing Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Moderating Role of Avoidant Coping","Extensive research has demonstrated the transactional nature of parent-child psychopathology, with limited studies examining these effects during late adolescence and none, to our knowledge, longitudinally during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examined the cross-lagged effects of parent and adolescent internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and the moderating role of avoidant coping. A sample of 291 adolescents (Age <sub>mean</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18.27; 53% female; 61% White) and their parents rated their own anxiety and depressive symptoms and coping during the first two months following stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parent internalizing symptoms at the first assessment predicted adolescent internalizing symptoms at the second assessment. Adolescent avoidant coping style moderated this effect of parent internalizing symptoms on adolescent internalizing symptoms in the subsequent month, such that parent internalizing symptoms predicted child internalizing symptoms only among adolescents with moderate to high rates of avoidant coping. Follow-up analyses indicated different patterns when examining depressive and anxiety symptoms separately. The results highlight complex family dynamics between adolescents and their parents and begin to differentiate how individual characteristics impact the response to a significant life event such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lorenzo, Zeytinoglu, Morales, Listokin, Almas, Degnan, Henderson, Chronis-Tuscano, Fox","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-020-01374-z","20210126","Adolescents; COVID-19; Coping; Internalizing symptoms; Parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9953,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Among People from the Banking Sector in Bangladesh: a Cross-Sectional Study","Despite the pandemic, the Government of Bangladesh decided to keep the banks open to a limited extent to keep the country's economy afloat. The aim of this study is to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 among the bankers who are usually more exposed to random people that put them at great risk to be affected. A total of 248 bankers willingly answered our questionnaire consisting of DASS-21 and relevant questions. Cronbach's reliability coefficient for the DASS-21 scale ranges from 0.84 to 0.90 which advocates that DASS-21 scales are highly reliable measures for this study. Results show that among participants, 11.1% were severe to extremely stressed, 10.6% of bankers were severe to extremely anxious, and 12.1% of them were severe to extremely depressed.

"Psychological distress and internet-related behaviors between schoolchildren with and without overweight during the COVID-19 outbreak","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and its resulting social policy changes may result in psychological distress among schoolchildren with overweight. This study thus aimed to (1) compare psychological distress (including fear of COVID-19 infection, stress, anxiety, and depression), perceived weight stigma, and problematic internet-related behaviors between schoolchildren with and without overweight; (2) assess whether perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors explained psychological distress. Schoolchildren (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1357; mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.7 years) with overweight (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°236) and without overweight (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1121) completed an online survey assessing their fear of COVID-19 infection, stress, anxiety, depression, perceived weight stigma, problematic smartphone application use, problematic social media use, and problematic gaming. Schoolchildren with overweight had significantly higher levels of COVID-19 infection fear, stress, depression, perceived weight stigma, and problematic social media use than those without overweight. Regression models showed that perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors were significant predictors of psychological distress among schoolchildren with overweight. Strategies to manage perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors may have a positive influence on mental health among schoolchildren with overweight under health-threatening circumstances, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Chen, O'Brien, Latner, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-021-00741-5","20210126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9955,""
"COVID-19 welbeing study: a protocol examining perceived coercion and psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic by means of an online survey, asynchronous virtual focus groups and individual interviews","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many countries applying restrictive measures, such as lockdown, to contain and prevent further spread. The psychological impact of lockdown and working as a healthcare worker on the frontline has been chronicled in studies pertaining to previous infectious disease pandemics that have reported the presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Potentially linked to psychological well-being and not yet studied is the possibility that lockdown and working on the frontline of the pandemic are associated with perceptions of coercion. The present study aimed to examine perceived coercion in those who have experienced COVID-19-related lockdown and/or worked as a frontline healthcare worker across three European countries. It aimed to describe how such perceptions may impact on psychological well-being, coping and post-traumatic growth. It will employ an explanatory mixed-methods research methodology consisting of an online survey and online asynchronous virtual focus groups (AVFGs) and individual interviews. Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> tests and analyses of variance will be used to examine whether participants from different countries differ according to demographic factors, whether there are differences between cohorts on perceived coercion, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic growth scores. The relationship between coercion and symptoms of distress will be assessed using multiple regression. Both the AVFGs and the narrative interviews will be analysed using thematic narrative analysis. The study has been approved by University College London's Research Ethics Committee under Project ID Number 7335/004. Results will be disseminated by means of peer-reviewed publications and at national and/or international conferences.","Ranieri, Sem Stoltenberg, Pizzo, Montaldo, Bizzi, Edwards, Kamboj","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043418","20210126","COVID-19; mental health; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9956,""

"Psychiatric symptoms, risk, and protective factors among university students in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","The COVID-19 pandemic has made unprecedented impact on the psychological health of university students, a population vulnerable to distress and mental health disorders. This study investigated psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress) during state-enforced quarantine among university students in China (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1912) through a cross-sectional survey during March and April 2020. Psychiatric symptoms were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed suicidal ideation. We explored risk and protective factors of psychological health, including demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity. Screen media device usage was positively associated with depression. Female gender and COVID-19 prosocial behavior were associated with higher anxiety, while COVID-19 self-efficacy associated with lower anxiety symptoms. Findings suggest high need for psychological health promotion among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and inform an ecological perspective on the detrimental role of stigma during an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Interventions targeting multi-level factors, such as promoting mindfulness and social support at individual and interpersonal levels while reducing public stigma about COVID-19, may be particularly promising.

"Factors Associated with Symptoms of Depression and Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The objective of this study was to examine factors associated with symptoms of depression and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Convenience sampling and snowball sampling were used to recruit a sample of adults in China (<i>n</i> = 2130) from 14 February 2020 to 3 March 2020 to complete an online survey. Linear regression was used to examine the predictors of symptoms of depression and psychological distress. Living in a non-urban area and the number of confirmed cases in their city of residence were positively associated with symptoms of depression. Female gender, not being married, practicing social distancing, the amount of time spent daily on social media searching for and reading information on COVID-19, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in their city of residence, and having confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 in personal networks were positively associated with psychological distress. Social distancing is a widely used public health approach for population-wide virus-containment of COVID-19. However, reductions in population-wide psychological well-being are inadvertent consequences of social distancing. There is an emerging need to negate factors that increase adverse mental health vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Sims, Qin, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs11020013","20210126","COVID-19; China; depression; psychological distress; social distancing; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9959,""
"Prevalence and Factors Associated with Mental and Emotional Health Outcomes among Africans during the COVID-19 Lockdown Period-A Web-based Cross-Sectional Study","Mental health and emotional responses to the effects of COVID-19 lockdown in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are of serious public health concern and may negatively affect the mental health status of people. Hence, this study assessed the prevalence of mental health symptoms as well as emotional reactions among sub-Saharan Africans (SSAs) and associated factors among SSAs during the COVID-19 lockdown period. This was a web-based cross-sectional study on mental health and emotional features from 2005 respondents in seven SSA countries. This study was conducted between 17 April and 17 May 2020 corresponding to the lockdown period in most SSA countries. Respondents aged 18 years and above and the self-reported symptoms were feeling anxious, being worried, angry, bored and frustrated. These were the main outcomes and were treated as dichotomous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with these symptoms. We found that over half (52.2%) of the participants reported any of the mental health symptoms and the prevalence of feeling bored was 70.5% followed by feeling anxious (59.1%), being worried (57.5%), frustrated (51.5%) and angry (22.3%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariate analysis revealed that males, those aged &gt;28 years, those who lived in Central and Southern Africa, those who were not married, the unemployed, those living with more than six persons in a household, had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Similarly, people who perceived low risk of contracting the infection, and those who thought the pandemic would not continue after the lockdown had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Health care workers had lower odds for feeling angry than non-healthcare workers. During the COVID-19 lockdown periods in SSA, about one in two participants reported mental health and emotional symptoms. Public health measures can be effectively used to identify target groups for prevention and treatment of mental health and emotional symptoms. Such interventions should be an integral component of SSA governments' response and recovery strategies of any future pandemic.","Langsi, Osuagwu, Goson, Abu, Mashige, Ekpenyong, Ovenseri-Ogbomo, Chikasirimobi G, Miner, Ishaya, Oloruntoba, Nwaeze, Charwe, Agho","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18030899","20210126","COVID-19; bored and angry; feeling anxious; frustrated; mental health; psychological problem; sub-Saharan Africa; worried","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-27","",9960,""

In this study, participants completed online questionnaires assessing objective social isolation, loneliness, mental health, and virtual social interactions. There was clear evidence for lower well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in emerging adults characterized by large increases in depressive symptoms, and large decrements in happiness and social satisfaction post-pandemic onset. In line with expectations, a robust positive association was seen between household size (an index of objective social contact) and well-being. However, contrary to expectations, there was no association between the frequency of virtual social interactions and well-being.
