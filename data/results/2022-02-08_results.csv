"Examining the effects of online sports betting on the perceived economic wellbeing of student-athletes","The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of online sports betting on the perceived economic wellbeing of student-athletes using the regression analysis with an interaction effect used to test the effect of demographic variables on the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between independent variables. The findings reveal that there was a positive and significant association3 between gambling severity and economic wellbeing. The study revealed that students' sports bet online with large amounts of money to get the feeling of excitement. Sports betting leads to overspending which can disrupt home life to such an extent that it has some social effects such as the break-up of families. Sometimes due to sports betting the only deceptive course of action that seems to remain too often may lead the bettor to commit suicide.","Benson, Gathoni Ndung'u, Munayi, Simon P.; Wanjira, Janet, Inyega, Justus","https://doi.org/10.20525/ijrbs.v10i7.1435","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Research in Business and Social Science; 10(7):242-248, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26624,""
"EnseÃ±ando medicina en tiempos de pandemia: una experiencia desde el curso Salud Mental","IntroducciÃ³n: la pandemia por la COVID-19 llevÃ³ a la implementaciÃ³n de medidas de protecciÃ³n en diversos Ã¡mbitos de la sociedad.

Con la apertura parcial se implementaron actividades semipresenciales y con pacientes reales. Se realizaron actividades sincrÃ³nicas y asincrÃ³nicas que incluyeron el aprendizaje de recursos tecnolÃ³gicos, elesimulaciÃ³n, seminarios, talleres, desarrollo de casos y clubes de revistas, entre otros.Resultados: la virtualidad permitiÃ³, ademÃ¡s de brindar un aprendizaje de calidad, generar espacios de acompaÃ±amiento personalizado a los estudiantes por la situaciÃ³n relacionada con la pandemia, asÃ­ como el diseÃ±o de estrategias de enseÃ±anza y ecanismos de evaluaciÃ³n novedosos.Conclusiones: la experiencia del cambio de la educaciÃ³n presencial a la virtual permitiÃ³ mÃºltiples aprendizajes personales y tÃ©cnicos, y la implementaciÃ³n de nuevas metodologÃ­as y erramientas tecnolÃ³gicas, obteniendo resultados favorables en la ejecuciÃ³n del curso y la evaluaciÃ³n de Ã©l mismo con una adecuada satisfacciÃ³n, tanto en losdocentes de psiquiatrÃ­a como en los estudiantes.Alternate : Introduction: the COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of diverse safety measures in various aspects of society. Traditional in-person classes were canceled under this premise at all levels of education in Colombia, causing medical students to stop ssisting to hospitals for their clinical practices. Objectives: Describe educational strategies applied to continue clinical rotations, securing the development of the necessary competences in the mental health program. Methods: The Medicine Schoolâ€™s clinical rotation on mental health started being instructed virtually and remotely using diverse technological tools after the Colombian government decreed a preventive lockdown. Mixed modality activities with real patients restarted once lockdown was partially lifted. We performed synchronous and asynchronous activities that included learning using technological resources, telesimulation, seminaries, workshops, case developments, and journal clubs, among others. Results: Virtual instruction generated personalized tutorship spaces, the design of adapted teaching strategies and novel evaluation mechanisms while maintaining the quality of learning. Conclusion: The change from traditional in-person education to a virtual learning produced multiple personal and technical lessons with the implementation of new methodologies and technological tools, obtaining favorable results in execution, evaluation, and psychiatry teacherâ€™s and studentâ€™s satisfaction.","Acero-GonzÃ¡lez, Ãngela, Toro-Herrera, Sandra Milena, RuÃ­z-Moreno, Lina MarÃ­a, Yaver-SuÃ¡rez, Nazly","https://doi.org/10.17533/udea.iatreia.129","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Iatreia; 35(1):65-73, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26625,""
"DfIDâ€™s Last Stand: A Belated but Welcome Theory of Change on Mental Health and Development","This article critiques the new Theory of Change (ToC) on mental health published by the UKâ€™s Department for International Development (DfID) in the last fortnight of its existence. The ToC offers development actors a framework for better support of beneficiaries with mental health conditions and psychosocial disabilities â€“ given disappointingly scant attention by the sector to date. Yet, 70 per cent of mental disorders occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with a 22 per cent prevalence in fragile and conflict-affected states. Globally, mental ill-health is estimated to affect almost one billion people. Its intersectionality with poverty and physical health has been brought into sharp focus by the current COVID-19 pandemic which has magnified the underlying social and environmental stressors of mental health. DfIDâ€™s ToC provides a conceptual framework for improving mental health globally, with an overarching vision of the full and equal exercise of all human rights by those affected by mental health conditions and psychosocial disability. The framework incorporates a rights-based approach with user-participation embedded in five critical change pathways to outcomes. The article analyses the ToC, provides an overview, highlights gaps and comments upon how DfID might have improved clarity for development actors seeking to realise its vision.","Davidson, Laura","https://doi.org/10.7227/JHA.057","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Humanitarian Affairs; 3(1):40-45, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26626,""

"Anxiety, depression, worry, and stress-related perceptions among antenatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic: Single group repeated measures design","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe, which has affected the health of all populations including antenatal women. Aims: The aim of the study was to evaluate the levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and worry in antenatal women during COVID-19 compared with the pre-COVID-19 levels and to evaluate the associations between the sociodemographic factors of antenatal women and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)-D, HADS-A, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Brief Measure of Worry Severity (BMWS) scores. Materials and Methods: This single group repeated measures design was conducted on 101 antenatal women who were referred to outpatient antenatal clinics from January 2020 (pre-COVID-19) to April 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Data were collected using four questionnaires including the HADS, GAD-7 scale, PSS, and BMWS. Results: Antenatal women (n = 101, Mage = 32.73 years, standard deviation = 5.67) during COVID-19 demonstrated significantly increased (P &lt; 0.001) levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and worry compared with pre-COVID-19 levels. Multiple regression analysis indicated that panic disorder was significantly associated with HADS, PSS, and BMWS scores;pregnancy complications were significantly associated with HADS scores;associated health problems were significantly associated with PSS and BMWS scores;and current anxiety, depression, stress, and worry were significantly associated with HADS, GAD-7, and BMWS scores in antenatal women during COVID-19. Conclusion: Increased attention should be paid to the psychological health of antenatal women during this COVID-19 pandemic.

"A multicentric survey among patients with substance use disorders during the COVID-19 lockdown in India","Background: The unprecedented first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted mental health services globally. However, the negative impact of such disruptions on people with substance use disorders (SUD) seeking treatment remains unclear. We aim to explore the behaviors adopted by these individuals to overcome the service disruptions. Materials and Methods: We explored the changes related to substance use behavior (quit attempts, withdrawal experienced, treatment-seeking, and risky behaviors), and behavioral changes in response to COVID-19 lockdown. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 404 people with SUD seeking treatment from seven centers across India. They were assessed by a specially designed structured questionnaire during the first wave (Juneâ€“September) of the pandemic. Results: An overwhelming majority experienced withdrawal symptoms, with close to half making quit attempts and seeking treatment during the lockdown. Three-fourth of the sample reported difficulty in accessing treatment services and medications. Patients with opioid use were significantly more likely to think about quitting (<U+03C7>2 = 20.408, P = 0.000), make attempts (<U+03C7>2 = 12.436, P = 0.000), seek treatment (<U+03C7>2 = 7.536, P = 0.006), and self-medicate for withdrawal symptoms (<U+03C7>2 = 5.885, P = 0.015). In turn, those with alcohol use were more likely to use telepsychiatry services (<U+03C7>2 = 35.143, P = 0.000) and experience stigma by family members (<U+03C7>2 = 29.951, P = 0.000) and neighbors (<U+03C7>2 = 17.725, P = 0.000). Among COVID-19 safety precautions, majority practised wearing masks and social distancing but not others. Conclusion: COVID-19 lockdown led a significant proportion of substance users, especially opioid users, to make quit attempts and seek help. However, these could not be sustained due to difficulty in accessing treatment services. Further, significant proportion failed to adhere to COVID-19 safety precautions.","Arya, Sidharth, Ghosh, Abhishek, Mishra, Shree, Swami, Mukesh, Prasad, Sambhu, Somani, Aditya, Basu, Aniruddha, Sharma, Kshitiz, Padhy, Susanta, Nebhinani, Naresh, Sing, Lokesh, Choudhury, Shinjini, Basu, Debasish, Gupta, Rajiv","https://doi.org/10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_557_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychiatry; 64(1):48-55, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26629,""

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional single point observational study was conducted among clinically stable 72 COVID-19 infected patients. Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed with the help of DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 CCSMâ€”Adult scale. Results: The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity was 76.4% (n = 55). Depression was the most common diagnosis in 44.44% (n = 32) followed by anxiety (34.72%, n = 25), somatic symptoms (26.39%, n = 19), sleep problems (23.61%, n = 17). Around 45 .83 % (n = 33) patients considered COVID-19 infection as potentially life-threatening and 23.62% (n=17) patients experienced discrimination and stigma after being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection.

"The impact of COVID-19 on social work mental health services in the United States: lessons from the early days of a global pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a multitude of changes to service delivery systems, heavily impacting the experiences of both clients and practitioners. Most research documenting these impacts is quantitative in nature. This qualitative exploratory cross-sectional study provides a richer understanding of the experiences of social work practitioners, clients receiving mental health services, and organizations in the early months of the pandemic. For clients, findings reflect a range of mental health issues, stressors, and sources of resilience. For practitioners, findings reflect professional and personal effects of the pandemic.

"Satir Family Therapy and Adolescent Mental Health Implications of COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2, commonly known as COVID-19, continues to have a profound affect ON adolescents and their families. Mental health professionals have seen an alarming increase in anxiety, depression, and suicidality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents face the challenge of differentiating from their families, and often place increased focus and importance on their peer group. Given the increased isolation, this paper illustrates how Satirâ€™s therapy model can be used by therapists who treat adolescents and their families related to COVID-19 specific stressors. Specifically, this paper will examine how Satirâ€™s focus on how self-worth, communication, and holistic approaches, are uniquely beneficial to treatment.

"Vaccination policy and trust","A corrupt government may not only fail in provision of public goods but also generate mistrust that depresses demand for essential public goods. The effect of corruption on supply of public goods is well studied, but much less is known about the demand side. Using UNICEF panel data on vaccination, we find that countries perceived as less corrupt and more liberal experience higher vaccination rates. Furthermore, they are less likely to adopt a mandatory vaccination policy. We show theoretically that the mechanism that generates this result is the lower probability of a transparent and accountable government to promote an unsafe vaccine.","Jelnov, Artyom, Jelnov, Pavel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2022.105773","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Economic Modelling;: 105773, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26634,""

"Cancer Treatment During COVID-19: Resilience of Individuals With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Versus Community Controls","Among all patients with cancer, those with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) experience the most distress. Although new therapies are improving survival, it is unknown whether receiving immunotherapy or targeted therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic increases patients' psychological vulnerability. To meet clinical needs, knowledge of patients' COVID-19 perceptions and safety behaviors is essential. Thus, this study compared patients' psychological responses at diagnosis and during COVID-19 and compared patients with similar individuals without cancer during the same period. Patients with advanced NSCLC enrolled at diagnosis for cohort study participated (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03199651). Those with follow-ups from April 28, 2020, through July 14, 2020 (n=76), were assessed again including COVID-19 measures. Simultaneously, community controls with similar sociodemographics and smoking histories were solicited (n=67). Measures were COVID-19 perceptions (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire), social distancing, and depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) symptoms. First, analyses evaluated differences in the psychological responses of patients with NSCLC at diagnosis and during COVID-19. Second, patients and controls were contrasted on COVID-19 perceptions, social distancing, and psychological symptoms. The depressive and anxious symptoms of patients with NSCLC were greater at diagnosis (P&lt;.02) than during COVID-19, approximately 1 year later. Patients with NSCLC and controls did not differ in terms of sociodemographics, except those with NSCLC were more racially diverse and older, and had greater smoking history (P&lt;.03). Groups did not differ regarding concern, understanding, or perceived control over COVID-19 (P&gt;.406). Notably, controls anticipated the COVID threat would last longer, practiced more social distancing, were more concerned about family (P&lt;.04), and reported worse psychological symptoms (P&lt;.023). With less depression and anxiety, patients with NSCLC viewed COVID-19 as a shorter-term threat and had fewer COVID-19-related worries than did controls. For controls, COVID-19 was more salient, heightening worries and psychological symptoms. Despite multiple health stressors, patients with NSCLC demonstrated resilience when receiving cancer treatment during COVID-19. Nonetheless, this population remains psychologically vulnerable, requiring support at diagnosis and thereafter.","Arrato, Lo, Coker, Covarrubias, Blevins, Reisinger, Presley, Shields, Andersen","https://doi.org/10.6004/jnccn.2021.7076","20220207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26636,""

"The experience of European hospital-based health care workers on following infection prevention and control procedures and their wellbeing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","Working under pandemic conditions exposes health care workers (HCWs) to infection risk and psychological strain. A better understanding of HCWs' experiences of following local infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures during COVID-19 is urgently needed to inform strategies for protecting the psychical and psychological health of HCWs. The objective of this study was therefore to capture the perceptions of hospital HCWs on local IPC procedures and the impact on their emotional wellbeing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Participants were recruited in two sampling rounds of an international cross-sectional survey. Sampling took place between 31 March and 17 April 2020 via existing research networks and between 14 May and 31 August 2020 via online convenience sampling. Main outcome measures were behavioural determinants of HCWs' adherence to IPC guidelines and the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, a validated scale of 0-100 reflecting emotional wellbeing. The WHO-5 was interpreted as a score below or above 50 points, a cut-off score used in previous literature to screen for depression. 2289 HCWs from 40 countries in Europe participated. Mean age was 42 (Ã‚Â±11) years, 66% were female, 47% and 39% were medical doctors and nurses, respectively. 74% (n = 1699) of HCWs were directly treating patients with COVID-19, of which 32% (n = 527) reported they were fearful of caring for these patients. HCWs reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 infection risk to themselves (71%) and their family (82%) as a result of their job. 40% of HCWs considered that getting infected with COVID-19 was not within their control. This feeling was more common among junior than senior HCWs (46% versus 38%, P value &lt; .01). Sufficient COVID-19-specific IPC training, confidence in PPE use and institutional trust were positively associated with the feeling that becoming infected with COVID-19 was within their control. Female HCWs were more likely than males to report a WHO-5 score below 50 points (aOR 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.8). In Europe, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a differential impact on those providing direct COVID-19 patient care, junior staff and women.

Previous pandemics have been associated with an increased risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, the experience of a pandemic for those with preexisting diagnoses of PTSD has not previously been researched. We aimed to understand the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic for people with a diagnosis of PTSD before the pandemic. Ten people, who were under the care of a specialist outpatient clinic for adults with PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic, took part in semistructured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview transcripts. Themes were identified relating to changes in how a sense of threat was experienced during the pandemic, with both factors increasing and decreasing threat recognized; challenges related to trying to cope with the pandemic; and resources that helped with coping. Recommendations for clinicians working with people with PTSD during a pandemic are made. These include assessing for changes in the person's sense of threat and changes in triggers; supporting adaptation of prepandemic ways of coping and engagement with personal and professional support networks; and being alert to a possible increase or change in safety-seeking behaviors and addressing in the treatment.

"Utilization of Physician-Based Mental Health Care Services Among Children and Adolescents Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ontario, Canada","Public health measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have heightened distress among children and adolescents and contributed to a shift in delivery of mental health care services. To measure and compare physician-based outpatient mental health care utilization before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and quantify the extent of uptake of virtual care delivery. Population-based repeated cross-sectional study using linked health and administrative databases in Ontario, Canada. All individuals aged 3 to 17 years residing in Ontario from January 1, 2017, to February 28, 2021. Pre-COVID-19 period from January 1, 2017, to February 29, 2020, and post-COVID-19 onset from March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. Physician-based outpatient weekly visit rates per 1000 population for mental health diagnoses overall and stratified by age group, sex, and mental health diagnostic grouping and proportion of virtual visits. Poisson generalized estimating equations were used to model 3-year pre-COVID-19 trends and forecast expected trends post-COVID-19 onset and estimate the change in visit rates before and after the onset of COVID-19. The weekly proportions of virtual visits were calculated. In a population of almost 2.5 million children and adolescents (48.7% female; mean [SD] age, 10.1 [4.3] years), the weekly rate of mental health outpatient visits was 6.9 per 1000 population. Following the pandemic onset, visit rates declined rapidly to below expected (adjusted relative rate [aRR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79-0.82) in April 2020 followed by a growth to above expected (aRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09) by July 2020 and sustained at 10% to 15% above expected as of February 2021. Adolescent female individuals had the greatest increase in visit rates relative to expected by the end of the study (aRR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.25-1.28). Virtual care accounted for 5.0 visits per 1000 population (72.5%) of mental health visits over the study period, with a peak of 5.3 visits per 1000 population (90.1%) (April 2020) and leveling off to approximately 70% in the latter months. Physician-based outpatient mental health care in Ontario increased during the pandemic, accompanied by a large, rapid shift to virtual care. There was a disproportionate increase in use of mental health care services among adolescent female individuals. System-level planning to address the increasing capacity needs and to monitor quality of care with such large shifts is warranted.","Saunders, Kurdyak, Stukel, Strauss, Fu, Guan, Fiksenbaum, Cohen, Guttmann, Vigod, Chiu, Hepburn, Moran, Gardner, Cappelli, Sundar, Toulany","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.6298","20220207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26640,""

"Plasmonic LAMP: Improving the Detection Specificity and Sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 by Plasmonic Sensing of Isothermally Amplified Nucleic Acids","The ability to detect pathogens specifically and sensitively is critical to combat infectious diseases outbreaks and pandemics. Colorimetric assays involving loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) provide simple readouts yet suffer from the intrinsic non-template amplification. Herein, a highly specific and sensitive assay relying on plasmonic sensing of LAMP amplicons via DNA hybridization, termed as plasmonic LAMP, is developed for the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection. This work has two important advances. First, gold and silver (Au-Ag) alloy nanoshells are developed as plasmonic sensors that have 4-times stronger extinction in the visible wavelengths and give a 20-times lower detection limit for oligonucleotides over Au counterparts. Second, the integrated method allows cutting the complex LAMP amplicons into short repeats that are amendable for hybridization with oligonucleotide-functionalized Au-Ag nanoshells. In the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, plasmonic LAMP takes Ã¢â€°Ë†75 min assay time, achieves a detection limit of 10 copies per reaction, and eliminates the contamination from non-template amplification. It also shows better detection specificity and sensitivity over commercially available LAMP kits due to the additional sequence identification. This work opens a new route for LAMP amplicon detection and provides a method for virus testing at its early representation.","Ye, Nowak, Liu, Li, Zhang, Bleris, Qin","https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202107832","20220207","SARS-CoV-2; hollow nanostructures; homogeneous assays; loop-mediated isothermal amplification; plasmonics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26642,""
"COVID-19 and mental health: Impact on symptom burden in older people living with mental illness in residential aged care","COVID-19-related restrictions for residential aged care (RAC) have been significant. However, the mental health impacts for residents already living with mental illness remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined change in mental health symptom burden for this group and potential associations with clinical and contextual factors. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients of a specialist aged mental health clinical service for RAC. Change in symptoms (measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home version [NPI-NH]) between pre-pandemic and two pandemic timepoints were analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Potential associations with baseline diagnosis or severity of 'lockdown' restrictions in RAC were assessed using linear regression. Data from 91 patient files were included. The median NPI-NH score slightly increased during wave one (baseline median NPI-NH scoreÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 17.0 [interquartile range, IQR: 10.0-27.0]; wave one medianÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 19.0, IQR: 8.0-30.0) and fell during wave two (Median: 15.5, IQR: 7.0-28.0), but changes were not statistically significant (all p-values &gt;0.05). Adjusting for age and gender, an association between neurocognitive disorder diagnosis and NPI-NH score during wave one was statistically but not clinically significant (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.046). No other significant associations were identified. Accounting for pre-pandemic symptoms, we found no clinically relevant evidence of worsening mental health during COVID-19 for a group of older people living with mental illness in RAC. This adds to evidence of relatively stable mental health in older people during the pandemic. Research and policy should consider underpinning mechanisms and emphasise patient- and carer-centred interventions.","Curran, Nalder, Koye, Hocking, Coulson, Khalid, Loi, Lautenschlager","https://doi.org/10.1111/ajag.13042","20220207","COVID-19; aged; mental health; residential facilities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26643,""
"Drug Overdoses During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Recently Homeless Individuals","To examine how weekly rates of emergency department (ED) visits for drug overdoses changed among individuals with a recent history of homelessness (IRHH) and their housed counterparts during the pre-pandemic, peak, and re-opening periods of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, using corresponding weeks in 2019 as a historical control. Population-based retrospective cohort study conducted between September 30, 2018 and September 26, 2020. Ontario, Canada PARTICIPANTS: 38,617 IRHH, 15,022,369 housed individuals, and 186,858 low-income housed individuals matched on age, sex, rurality, and comorbidity burden. ED visits for drug overdoses of accidental and undetermined intent. Average rates of ED visits for drug overdoses between January and September 2020 were higher among IRHH compared with housed individuals (rate ratio [RR]: 148.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 142.7-153.5) and matched housed individuals (RR: 22.3, 95% CI: 20.7-24.0). ED visits for drug overdoses decreased across all groups by approximately 20% during the peak period (March 17 to June 16, 2020) compared with corresponding weeks in 2019. During the re-opening period (June 17 to September 26, 2020), rates of ED visits for drug overdoses were significantly higher among IRHH (RR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.44-1.69), matched housed individuals (RR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46), and housed individuals relative to equivalent weeks in 2019 (RR: 1.07: 95% CI: 1.02-1.11). The relative increase in drug overdose ED visits among IRHH was larger compared with both matched housed individuals (p=0.01 for interaction between group and year) and housed individuals (p&lt;0.001) during this period.

"The COVID-19 pandemic and the ""Plague of Athens"": comparable features 25 centuries apart","Motivated by the up to now disastrous outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, we attempted a flashback to the so-called ""Plague of Athens,"" which indicated a serious contagious disease, having taken place between 430 and 426 BC. The ancient pandemic was meticulously described by the Athenian historian and general Thucydides. We compared, as much as possible, the following parameters: background conditions, spreading of the pandemics, preceded and concurrent adverse events, duration and waves of the pandemics, symptoms, implicated infectious agents/diseases and mental/psychosocial consequences. The current pandemic was preceded by a global economic crisis, which particularly affected deprived population groups, while the ancient one started on the second year of a catastrophic civil war. Rivalry and different political systems between now (US/China) and then (Athens/Sparta) superpowers were the basis for conspiracy scenarios, concerning origins of the pandemics, which resulted to huge numbers of deaths, particularly in overcrowded and poor areas/cities. Both pandemics not sparing any age, sex, nationality, social group, may have had a zoonotic component, besides being air-born. However, their spreading is/was remarkably rapid, presenting 3-4 waves and lasting for several years. Some somatic signs and symptoms of the diseases coincide. Although for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as causing agent, the antique pandemic has most probably been attributed to typhoid fever, although this is still a matter of debate. Additionally, both pandemics affected mental health and psychosocial behavior in close similarity. It is noteworthy, that in both eras physicians and healthcare workers, despite physical and psychological exhaustion, in the majority, presented admirable resilience and willingness to help suffering fellow people, often at the expense of their own lives. The considerable number of comparable features between COVID-19 and the ""Plague of Athens"" confirms that pandemics may present over time important similarities in their origin, evolution and outcomes.","Malamitsi-Puchner, Briana","https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.2025357","20220207","COVID-19 pandemic; Peloponnesian war; SARS-CoV-2; Thucydides; symptoms; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Athens PlagueÃ¢â‚¬Â","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26646,""
"Thoughts of suicide or self-harm among Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","To identify the prevalence and predictors of (a) thoughts of suicide or self-harm among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) help-seeking among those healthcare workers with thoughts of suicide or self-harm. Analysis of data from the Australian COVID-19 Frontline Healthcare Workers Study, an online survey of healthcare workers conducted during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Outcomes of interest were thoughts of suicide or self-harm as measured through the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression and help-seeking behaviours. Overall, 819 (10.5%) of 7795 healthcare workers reported thoughts of suicide or self-harm over a 2-week period. Healthcare workers with these thoughts experienced higher rates of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and burnout than their peers. In multivariable models, the odds of suicide or self-harm thoughts were higher among workers who had friends or family infected with COVID-19 (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.24, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.06, 1.47]), were living alone (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.32, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.06, 1.64]), younger (Ã¢Â©Â½30Ã¢â‚¬â€°years cf. &gt;50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.70, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.36-2.13), male (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.81, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.49, 2.20]), had increased alcohol use (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.58, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.35, 1.86]), poor physical health (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.62, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.36, 1.92]), increased income worries (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.81, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.54, 2.12]) or prior mental illness (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.27, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[2.80, 3.82]). Having dependent children was protective (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.75, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[0.61, 0.92]). Fewer than half (388/819) of the healthcare workers who reported thoughts of suicide or self-harm sought professional support. Healthcare workers with thoughts of suicide or self-harm were more likely to seek support if they were younger (Ã¢Â©Â½30Ã¢â‚¬â€°years cf. &gt;50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.78, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.13, 2.82]) or had prior mental health concerns (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.47, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[3.25, 6.14]). One in 10 Australian healthcare workers reported thoughts of suicide or self-harm during the pandemic, with certain groups being more vulnerable. Most healthcare workers with thoughts of suicide or self-harm did not seek professional help. Strong and sustained action to protect the safety of healthcare workers, and provide meaningful support, is urgently needed.","Bismark, Scurrah, Pascoe, Willis, Jain, Smallwood","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221075540","20220207","COVID-19; Suicide; health practitioners; patient safety; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26647,""
"Did the COVID-19 pandemic affect mental health, training progression, and fertility planning of obstetrics and gynecology trainees?

One hundred and seventy-seven trainees completed the questionnaire, of whom 54% were aged 25-34Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 43% were senior trainees (ST6-7), and 51% classified themselves as Black, Asian, and Minority Asian (BAME). Although the percentage of respondents with ""moderate""/""severe"" GAD 7 and PHQ-9 scores was two to three times that of UK population estimates, median GAD 7 and PHQ-9 scores were 7 and 6 (""mild""). Sixteen percent deferred their fertility plans and 26% of ST6-7 trainees changed their Advanced Training Skills Modules. Other issues raised ranged from lack of assistance with electronic portfolio, postponement of examinations, poor senior input for mental health, lack of debriefing for redeployed trainees and requests for deferment of annual reviews. The pandemic has incurred an impact on mental health, training progression, and fertility planning of London trainees. With recommencement of nonemergency consultations and elective gynecology theater, alongside Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Recovery Blueprint to optimize learning opportunities, there is optimism that these challenges can be overcome.

"The Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic may have a disproportionate impact on people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to isolation and loss of services. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people living with dementia/MCI. Two authors searched major electronic databases from inception to June 2021 for observational studies investigating COVID-19 and NPS in people with dementia/MCI. Summary estimates of mean differences in NPS scores pre- versus post-COVID-19 were calculated using a random-effects model, weighting cases using inverse variance. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. From 2730 citations, 21 studies including 7139 patients (60.0% female, mean age 75.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 4.0% MCI) with dementia were evaluated in the review. Five studies found no changes in NPS, but in all other studies, an increase in at least one NPS or the pre-pandemic Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score was found. The most common aggravated NPS were depression, anxiety, agitation, irritability, and apathy during lockdown, but 66.7% of the studies had a high bias. Seven studies including 420 patients (22.1% MCI) yielded enough data to be included in the meta-analysis. The mean follow-up time was 5.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks.

These results were characterized by high heterogeneity, but there was no presence of publication bias. There is an increase in the worsening of NPS in people living with dementia/MCI during lockdown in the COVID pandemic.

During the first lockdown, forty-four inpatients and day care patients (inpatient group) and 74 outpatients (outpatient group) were recruited after an informed consent procedure. Fear from the infection was assed using the Fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S), severity of mental health symptomatology was evaluated with the outcome questionnaire-45 (OQ-45)., wellbeing was assessed with the Psychological well-being scale (PWB).

Follow-up studies should assess modifications in their behaviors that occurred after the reopening of gambling venues.","Cataldo, Casonato, Levari, Negri, Simonatoc, Tomasi, Branz, Coppola, Gianfranceschi, Leoni, Mistretta, Stefani, Vanzetta, Franceschini, Esposito, Corazza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etdah.2022.100032","20220207","AMA, Auto Mutuo Aiuto; APSS, Aziwnda Provinciale per i Servizi Sanitari; Covid-19; HAM-D, Hamilton Depressions Rating Scale; SERD, Servizio Dipendenze; VLT, Video Lottery Terminal; behavioral addiction; depression; gambling; internet addiction; mental health; online gambling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26651,""
"How to join and stay in the Olympic COVID-free ""bubble""?","The Beijing, 2022 Olympics will be the second Games held amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the unique circumstances the 2022 Games face-the Omicron spread, high virus transmissibility in winters, and uncertainties about vaccine efficacy and future variants of concern, safety measures amid the Beijing, 2022 Games will be one of the most intricate among large international events held during the pandemic. To ensure athletes' health, safety, and ability to participate in the Games, the organizers have introduced the Olympic COVID-free ""bubble"" protection ecosystem, in which COVID-free athletes could stay and be protected from potential infections that could upend their Games plans, if not their career as well. However, while staying in the ""bubble"" is key for athletes' health and success, there is a lack of insights on factors that might prevent athletes from continuing their scheduled Olympic journey as scheduled. To shed light on the issue, based on Beijing, 2022 Olympic Playbooks and most up-to-date guidance issued, this article and its accompanying infographic were developed to illustrate factors that could influence athletes' ability to join and stay in the ""bubble"", participate in the Games, and further build their career. Furthermore, we also adapted and integrated easy-to-adopt mental health de-stress techniques recommended by the World Health Organization to help athletes better thrive amid the Beijing, 2022 Winter Olympics, in or outside of the ""bubble"".","Su, McDonnell, Cheshmehzangi, Ahmad, Ã…Â egalo, Pereira da Veiga, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100424","20220207","COVID-19; Health policy; Mental health; Olympics; Prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26652,""

"Does Mindfulness Moderate the Link of Worry About COVID-19 With Adjustment? An Actor-Partner Interdependence Model Approach","COVID-19 constitutes an unprecedented mental health challenge to the world. At this critical time, it is important to identify factors that may boost individuals' well-being or render individuals more resistant to the negative impact of COVID-19-related stressors. The goals of this study were to examine whether individuals' and their partners' worry about COVID-19 were linked to individuals' psychological, social, and cognitive adjustment and test individuals' and their partners' mindfulness as possible moderators. Cross-sectional, dyadic data were collected from 211 Chinese couples with kindergarten-aged children living in Hong Kong, China, during its fourth major outbreak of COVID-19 (between December 2020 and January 2021). Using paper-and-pencil questionnaires, fathers and mothers independently reported their worry about COVID-19, mindfulness, depressive symptoms, social difficulties, and cognitive problems. Actor-Partner-Interdependence Models revealed that, controlling for individuals' gender and education levels, individuals' worry about COVID-19 and mindfulness were positively and negatively associated with their own depressive symptoms, social difficulties, and cognitive problems, respectively. The worry of individuals' partners was also positively associated with individuals' depressive symptoms and social difficulties. These associations, however, were only significant when the partners had low but not high levels of mindfulness. Our study highlighted the importance of studying the potential benefits of mindfulness at not only the individual but also the dyadic level.","Lam, Lam, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-021-01818-y","20220207","Adjustment; Dyadic data; Mindfulness; Resilience; Worry about COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26654,""
"Keeping the Faith: Religion, Positive Coping, and Mental Health of Caregivers During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major stressors such as unemployment, financial insecurity, sickness, separation from family members, and isolation for much of the world population. These stressors have been linked to mental health difficulties for parents and caregivers. Religion and spirituality (R/S), on the other hand, is often viewed as promotive of mental health. However, the mechanisms by which R/S might promote mental health for parents during the pandemic remain unclear. Thus, this longitudinal study explores how R/S is associated with better caregiver mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic through higher levels of positive coping skills. A sample of <i>N</i> = 549 caregivers (parents and other adults in childrearing roles) across Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia were recruited through the Prolific<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> research panel [67.8% female; age <i>M</i> = 41.33 years (<i>SD</i> = 6.33), 72.3% White/European]. Participants were assessed on measures of psychological distress, coping, R/S, and COVID-19 disruption at three time points between May and November 2020. Cross-lagged panel analysis revealed that caregiver coping mediated the relationship between caregiver R/S and caregiver mental health. Findings highlight a mechanism through which R/S naturally conveys a mental health benefit during periods of social disruption, which may provide an important target for public health promotion and clinical intervention.","Sen, Colucci, Browne","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.805019","20220207","COVID-19; coping; disaster; mental health; religion and spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26655,""
"The Impact of COVID-19-Related Work Stress on the Mental Health of Primary Healthcare Workers: The Mediating Effects of Social Support and Resilience","The psychological condition of healthcare workers since the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted the attention of many studies. However, few have reported on psychosocial problems of primary healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine the mediating roles of social support and resilience in COVID-19-related work stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression. A total of 840 primary healthcare workers in 17 community health centers in Guangzhou, China, were recruited from May to July 2021. Data on demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related work stress, social support, resilience, anxiety and depression were collected. A structural equation model was used for mediation analysis. More than half of participants reported mild or more severe (at least borderline abnormal) symptoms of anxiety (68.1%) and depression (55.6%). Social support and resilience mediate the association between COVID-19-related work stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Furthermore, the association between work stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression was also mediated by an accumulation of social support and resilience. The indirect effect of COVID-19-related work stress on anxiety and depression through resilience was much greater than other indirect effects. Anxiety and depression were prevalent among primary healthcare workers. This study highlights the psychological impact of the COVID-19-related psychosocial work environment on primary healthcare workers. There is an urgent need to improve working conditions for primary healthcare workers in the COVID-19 and to implement intervention strategies aimed at increasing individual resilience alongside the establishment of external supportive work environments.","Shi, Xu, Xia, Chen, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.800183","20220207","COVID-19; mental health; primary healthcare workers; resilience; social support; work stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26656,""
"Implementing Introductory Training in Trauma-Informed Care Into Mental Health Rehabilitation Services: A Mixed Methods Evaluation","This paper describes the implementation of training in trauma-informed care (TIC) across a mental health rehabilitation service. A mixed-methods approach was applied incorporating baseline measures of staff attitudes toward TIC, quantitative description of staff training participation, and semi-structured interviews of Team Leaders' views on the implementation of TIC. Fifty-five of 123 staff responded to the Organizational Change Readiness Assessment (OCRA) survey (44.7%). Training completion varied considerably between the eight rehabilitation teams (4.8-78%). Analysis of the Team Leader interviews identified four broad themes: The need to respect the person's life journey including the risk of re-traumatization; the importance of considering the context of implementing TIC training; TIC being an essential part of mental health care; and staff may also have trauma histories. Staff working in mental health rehabilitation are supportive of the need for TIC. The variable training uptake did not reflect the staff comments about the importance of TIC. The burden of adjusting mental health care delivery to COVID-19 restrictions was reported as a major influence on the uptake of training. Systematically implementing training in TIC is required but needs to be complemented by a structured organizational approach to aid embedding this approach into daily mental healthcare delivery.","Nation, Spence, Parker, Wheeler, Powe, Siew, Nevin, McKay, White, Dark","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.810814","20220207","competency framework; implementation; recovery orientated mental health rehabilitation; training; trauma-informed care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26657,""
"Exploring Access to Mental Health and Primary Care Services for People With Severe Mental Illness During the COVID-19 Restrictions","To explore: how satisfied people with severe mental illness (SMI) are with the support received during the pandemic; understand any difficulties encountered when accessing both mental health and primary care services; consider ways to mitigate these difficulties; and assess the perceived need for future support from mental health services. A representative sample was drawn from a large transdiagnostic clinical cohort of people with SMI, which was recruited between April 2016 and March 2020. The sample was re-surveyed a few months after the beginning of the restrictions. Descriptive frequency statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data. The free text responses were analyzed thematically. 367 participants responded to the survey. Two thirds were receiving support from mental health services with the rest supported in primary care or self-managing. A quarter thought they would need more mental health support in the coming year. Half had needed to used community mental health services during the pandemic and the majority had been able to get support. A minority reported that their mental health had deteriorated but they had either not got the supported they wanted or had not sought help. The biggest service change was the reduction in face-to-face appointments and increasing use of phone and video call support. Nearly half of those using mental health services found this change acceptable or even preferred it. However, acceptability was influenced by several factors, and participants were more likely to report that they had received all the support they needed, when seen in person. Although most participants were satisfied with the mental health support they had received, a minority were not. This, couple with findings on future need for mental health support has implications for post pandemic demand on services. Remote care has brought benefits but also risks that it could increase inequalities in access to services.","Newbronner, Spanakis, Wadman, Crosland, Heron, Johnston, Walker, Gilbody, Peckham","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.799885","20220207","COVID-19; bipolar disorder; health services; mental health services; schizoaffecfive disorder; schizophrenia; severe mental ill health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26658,""

"Anxiety, Depression, and Satisfaction With Life Among College Students in China: Nine Months After Initiation of the Outbreak of COVID-19","Mental health problems are common among college students. This study sought to assess the prevalence and risk factors of depressive and anxiety symptoms and well-being among Chinese college students 9 months after initiation of the outbreak of COVID-19. A cross-sectional study (<i>N</i> = 3,951, mean age = 19.58) was conducted from October to December 2020. An online survey was used to collect socio-demographic data, and the symptoms of depression and anxiety and satisfaction with life using Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), and the 5-items Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 59.35 and 54.34%, respectively, and the score of satisfaction with life was 20.51 Ã‚Â± 6.42 among Chinese college students during the pandemic. After controlling for covariates, students in urban areas (AOR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.61-0.87), with good family economic levels (AOR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.66-0.91), and having psychological counseling (AOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.42-0.73) were positively associated with depression symptoms; meanwhile, higher anxiety symptoms were observed among medical students (AOR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.69-0.95). Besides, healthy lifestyle such as regular physical activity and diet was associated with depression and anxiety symptoms. Multiple linear models revealed that medical students (ÃŽÂ² = 0.479, <i>P</i> = 0.031), those with good family economic level by self-evaluation (ÃŽÂ² = 1.283, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 for good; ÃŽÂ² = 3.013, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 for general), good academic performance by self-evaluation (ÃŽÂ² = 1.786, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 for good; ÃŽÂ² = 3.386, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 for general), learning burden (ÃŽÂ² = 1.607, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 for general; ÃŽÂ² = 2.117, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 for light), regular physical activity (ÃŽÂ² = 0.859, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), daily routine (ÃŽÂ² = 1.289, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), diet (ÃŽÂ² = 1.714, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and sufficient sleep (ÃŽÂ² = 1.408, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) had more score of SWLS (all ÃŽÂ² &gt; 0, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), while senior students (ÃŽÂ² = -1.053, <i>P</i>=0.009), students having psychological counseling (ÃŽÂ² = -1.753, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and drinking (ÃŽÂ² = -0.743, <i>P</i> = 0.012) had lower satisfaction with life. These findings suggest that more attention should be paid to psychological health among college students, especially during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.

"Burnout in the Pharmaceutical Activity: The Impact of COVID-19","Pharmacists are among the healthcare professionals involved in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining essential services. In the context of restrictions and reorganization of human resources, as a result of policies recently applied to the health sector, following international guidelines, and given the scarcity of data on burnout in pharmaceutical activity, it was considered highly relevant to promote a nationwide survey aiming to collect more complete evidence on the burnout syndrome and to understand how pharmacists have viewed their work and the people they worked closely with. The study aimed to assess the occurrence of pharmacist burnout and determine outcomes for each of its dimensions; identify potentially associated characteristics; and determine profiles and critical limits. A cross-sectional observational study conducted by a multidisciplinary panel from the Portuguese Pharmaceutical Society (PPS). Professionals from community and hospital pharmacies who were at the forefront of the COVID-19 response were involved in (i) confirming the need and pertinence for conducting this research, (ii) identifying the main factors leading to pharmaceutical emotional distress (""burnout""), and (iii) disseminating the survey. The questionnaire was designed for digital voluntary, confidential, and anonymous participation and divided into four segments of data collection: (i) demographics, (ii) employment and workplace characterization, (iii) pandemic impact on labor activity, and (iv) burnout assessment (as described ahead). An electronic survey was addressed to all PPS members, and an account was created solely to manage the questionnaire data for the research team. The web-based and user-friendly platform Google Forms supported the data capture and provided an intuitive interface for validated data entry. In a population of 15,565 pharmacists (members of the PPS), the minimum recommended sample size (Epi Info software), with a 5% margin of error and a 99.9% confidence interval, should be 1,012 individuals. A total of 1,362 pharmacists participated in the study.

"How to Reduce Mental Health Burden in Health Care Workers During COVID-19?-A Scoping Review of Guideline Recommendations","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented demand and a huge burden for healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide, with alarming reports of heightened mental health problems. To counteract these mental health challenges, guidelines and recommendations for the support of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic have been published. With this scoping review and guideline evaluation, we aim to provide a critical overview of these guidelines and recommendations and to guide policy makers in establishing respective surveillance and care programs. In summary, 41 articles were included in this review which were published between April 2020 and May 2021. Across all articles, the guidelines and recommendations could be clustered into four main categories: ""Social/structural support,"" ""Work environment,"" ""Communication/Information,"" ""Mental health support."" Although there was substantial agreement across articles about the recommendations given, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of these recommendations is still lacking. Moreover, most recommendations were developed without involving different members of the target group (HCWs) or other involved stakeholders.

"Prospective two-arm study of testicular function in patients with COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has led the international community to conduct extensive research into potential negative effects of the disease on multiple organs and systems in the human body. One of the most discussed areas is potential of the virus to compromise testicular function. However, lack of prospective studies on this topic makes it impossible to draw reliable conclusions on whether the disease affects the male reproductive system and, if so, to what extent. The current trial is aimed at investigating the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on testicular function, hormone levels and determining the extent of impact on spermatogenesis and damage to testicular tissue. This prospective study included healthy controls and cases of patients suffering from viral pneumonia based on chest CT and a positive SARS-CoV-2 throat swab exhibited moderate symptoms (WHO classification). Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and ultrasound data were collected. A semen analysis was performed in cases during their hospital stay and 3 months after the discharge home. We also assessed the testicles obtained during autopsies of patients who died of COVID-19 (n = 20). A total of 88 participants were included (44 controls and 44 cases). Blood testosterone levels were significantly decreased in 27.3% of the cases (12/44). The mean level (7.3Ã‚Â±2.7 nmol/l) was lower than that in the healthy controls (13.5Ã‚Â±5.2 nmol/l, p&lt;0.001). An increase in LH and FSH was also detected compared to the healthy controls (p = 0.04 and p = 0.002). The semen analysis revealed decreased motility in COVID-19 patients (p = 0.001), and a higher number of immobile sperm (during COVID-19 - 58.8% and at 3 months 47.4%, p = 0.005). All parameters returned to normal at 3 months after discharge. Direct MAR test at 3 months showed an increase of Ig A (p = 0.03). In the majority of autopsies (18/20) structural disorders of the testicular tissue, with signs of damage to germ cells were observed. COVID-19 and its management strategies significantly affect male hormone levels and sperm quality at the onset of the disease. Postmortem examination of testicular tissue confirmed inflammation and viral infiltration of the testicles. However, in patients with moderate to severe disease, the studied parameters of testicular function returned to normal values within 3 months. This article is protected by copyright.

"Postintensive care syndrome in COVID-19 Unicentric pilot study Calm does not come after the storm","Postintensive care syndrome (PICS) is the physical, cognitive or psychiatric deterioration that appears after a critical illness and persists beyond hospital admission. The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of PICS in the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit of the Consorcio Hospital General Universitario de Valencia. They benefited from a standardized assessment, addressing health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5D-3L), a physical status (6 MWT, Ã‚Â«test up and goÃ‚Â» and hand dynamometer), a nutritional assessment (MUST and the Global Subjective Assessment), cognitive impairment (MoCA), mental health disorders (HADS and Davidson Trauma Scale) and pain (visual analogue scale and DN4). From March to June 2020, 59 patients with SARS-CoV-2 were admitted to our ICU. 29 of these were recruited for the study. The stay in the ICU and the mechanical ventilation time were long (24 days [IQR 12-36], and 18 days [IQR 7-31] respectively). The SOFA upon admission to the ICU was high (3 [IQR 3-5]). Tracheostomy was performed in 52% and pronation in 93%. 90% had some abnormal test. 20% had post-traumatic stress syndrome. We found that 9 out of 10 survivors of SARS-CoV-2 admitted had at least one PICS alteration at 4-6 weeks from discharge from the Hospital. Six out of 19 patients presented with two or more affected evaluated areas.","Mateo RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Puchades Gimeno, Ezzeddine Angulo, Asensio Samper, Saiz Ruiz, LÃƒÂ³pez AlarcÃƒÂ³n","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2021.11.014","20220206","COVID-19; Chronic pain; Critical care; Cuidados intensivos; Dolor crÃƒÂ³nico; Post-intensive care sÃƒÂ­ndrome; RehabilitaciÃƒÂ³n; Rehabilitation; Secuelas; Sequelae; SÃƒÂ­ndrome post cuidados intensivos","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26667,""

"Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of paediatric patients admitted to a neuropsychiatric care hospital in the COVID-19 era","Since the first months of 2020, Italy and the world have been facing the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the dangerous and potentially deadly effects on physical health, it has caused a radical change in the lifestyle of the population and a potential danger for mental health too. These events were inserted into the context of a growing epidemiological trend regarding children's psychiatric disorders in the past decade. To study the population of patients admitted to a Neuropsychiatric Hospital Unit of North Italy in the first COVID-19Ã‚Â year, comparing them with the population of patients hospitalised during the year immediately before, according to sociodemographic and clinical variables. The study is an observational retrospective cohort. In total, 198 patients hospitalised due to neuropsychiatric problems from February 2019 to March 2021 were recruited. Data were analysed through mean and standard deviation, t-test, percentages, chi square test, and the Fischer exact test. Risk factors associated with mental health disorders were similar between the two years. The hospitalisation modality showed a decrease in scheduled hospitalisations compared to urgent ones, and among the reasons that led patients to hospitalisation there was a conspicuous increase in eating disorders. More suicidal and self-harming behaviours occurred in the COVID-19 group too, compared to the previous year. The methods used to attempt suicide were changed considerably, with a prevalence of that attempted within the home. Changes in pharmacological therapies also occurred, necessary for more than 80% of inpatients during the COVID year, with a greater use of neuroleptics. There were alarming data about hospitalisation relapses, which increased from 12.2% in the pre-COVID year to 35.0% in the COVID year. Data shed light on clinical and policy issues in mental health care during the developmental age. Since the COVID-19 health emergency is not yet over, and its effects, especially on mental health, will be long-term, it is necessary to implement services and activities dedicated to both primary and secondary prevention of neuropsychiatric diseases especially during adolescent ages.","Gatta, Raffagnato, Mason, Fasolato, Traverso, Zanato, Miscioscia","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-022-01213-w","20220206","Adolescents; COVID-19; Children; Hospitalisation; Mental health; Neuropsychiatry; Paediatric age","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26669,""
"Post-traumatic stress disorder and mental health assessment of seafarers working on ocean-going vessels during the COVID-19 pandemic","There are increasing concerns about mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among seafarers. This study aims to assess the effects of the current global health pandemic on life satisfaction and adverse psychological outcomes among seafarers. In this cross-sectional study, 470 multinational seafarers working on board ships of two international shipping companies were assessed. Mental health outcomes were assessed by the general anxiety disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD-8) questionnaire, and patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) depressive severity score. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of demographic and work-related variables with mental health outcomes. Overall, 439 out of 470 invited seafarers with a mean age of 34.5 (SD: 8.05) years participated in this study (participation rate: 93.4%). The prevalence of anxiety, depressive, and post-traumatic stress symptoms was 12.4, 14.1, and 37.3%, respectively. In the multivariate model, the current vessel's signing duration was directly associated with the odds of depressive and intrusion symptoms. Moreover, the duration of work per week was inversely associated with hyper-vigilance and avoidance. Also, non-officers, compared to officers, experienced significantly lower anxiety and depressive symptoms, hyper-vigilance, and avoidance. The present study revealed a high prevalence of mental health problems among seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend that more evidence is generated regarding psychosocial health issues for this vulnerable occupation.","Baygi, Blome, Smith, Khonsari, Agoushi, Maghoul, Esmaeili-Abdar, Gorabi, Qorbani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12673-4","20220206","COVID-19; Psychological impact; Seafarers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-08","",26670,""
