"The effects of COVID-19 on European healthcare provision for people with major depressive disorder: a scoping review protocol","Even before the pandemic, the treatment gaps in depression care were substantial, with issues ranging from rates of depression detection and intervention to a lack of follow-up after treatment initiation and access to secondary care services. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has had major effects on global healthcare systems, is almost certain to have impacted the MDD care pathway, though it is unclear what changes have manifested and what opportunities have arisen in response to COVID-19. The extent to which patients receive best-practice care is likely closely linked to clinical outcomes (and therefore disability burden) and as such, it is important to examine treatment gaps on the MDD care pathway during the pandemic. Here, we outline a protocol for a scoping review that investigates this broad topic, focusing on continuity of care and novel methods (e.g. digital approaches) used to mitigate care disruption. This scoping review protocol was designed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) standards and will culminate in a narrative synthesis of evidence.","Dilveer Sually; Win Lee Edwin Wong; Diego Hidalgo-Mazzei; Vinciane Quoidbach; Judit Simon; Patrice Boyer; Rebecca Strawbridge; Allan H.

"Small Moments, Big Impact: Pilot Trial of a Relational Health App for Primary Care","To conduct a pilot trial of Small Moments, Big Impact: a relational health app. Low-income mothers with one or no prior children, a full-term birth, above 18 years old, and without substance abuse were recruited. The control group was recruited prior to the intervention group to avoid contamination. Of the 117 mothers enrolled, 29 intervention and 29 control mothers completed the study. Five questionnaires were administered at baseline and six-months to measure maternal depression, empathy, beliefs about children's emotions, intelligence mindsets, and app use. At 6 months, questionnaires assessing parenting stress, reflective functioning, and perceived value of app were also administered. Mothers in the final sample were similar to those who did not complete the study, except more mothers who dropped out were recruited during COVID-19 and had a lower empathetic subscale score. No differences were found between groups at pre- or post-test. However, because of skewed outcome variables which violated normality principles and the small sample size, quantile regression analyses were performed comparing the 25<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles for each outcome. Controlling for pre-test and potential confounders, subsets of SMBI mothers reported lower parental stress, more growth mindset and increased effort to understand their child's feelings. 90% of mothers reported using SMBI at least once per week. 82% of mothers would recommend the SMBI app to new mothers. Most mothers used SMBI weekly, rated it highly and reported less stress, more growth mindset, and more positive child rearing beliefs.","Zuckerman, Edson, Mesite, Hatcher, Rowe","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2022.02.010","20220219","Relational health; maternal health; mother-infant relationship; postpartum care; primary care intervention; smartphone app","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-20","",27245,""
"Global, regional, and national prevalence estimates of physical or sexual, or both, intimate partner violence against women in 2018","Intimate partner violence against women is a global public health problem with many short-term and long-term effects on the physical and mental health of women and their children. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for its elimination in target 5.2. To monitor governments' progress towards SDG target 5.2, this study aimed to provide global, regional, and country baseline estimates of physical or sexual, or both, violence against women by male intimate partners. This study developed global, regional, and country estimates, based on data from the WHO Global Database on Prevalence of Violence Against Women. These data were identified through a systematic literature review searching MEDLINE, Global Health, Embase, Social Policy, and Web of Science, and comprehensive searches of national statistics and other websites. A country consultation process identified additional studies. Included studies were conducted between 2000 and 2018, representative at the national or sub-national level, included women aged 15 years or older, and used act-based measures of physical or sexual, or both, intimate partner violence. Non-population-based data, including administrative data, studies not generalisable to the whole population, studies with outcomes that only provided the combined prevalence of physical or sexual, or both, intimate partner violence with other forms of violence, and studies with insufficient data to allow extrapolation or imputation were excluded. We developed a Bayesian multilevel model to jointly estimate lifetime and past year intimate partner violence by age, year, and country. This framework adjusted for heterogeneous age groups and differences in outcome definition, and weighted surveys depending on whether they were nationally or sub-nationally representative. This study is registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42017054100). The database comprises 366 eligible studies, capturing the responses of 2 million women. Data were obtained from 161 countries and areas, covering 90% of the global population of women and girls (15 years or older). Globally, 27% (uncertainty interval [UI] 23-31%) of ever-partnered women aged 15-49 years are estimated to have experienced physical or sexual, or both, intimate partner violence in their lifetime, with 13% (10-16%) experiencing it in the past year before they were surveyed. This violence starts early, affecting adolescent girls and young women, with 24% (UI 21-28%) of women aged 15-19 years and 26% (23-30%) of women aged 19-24 years having already experienced this violence at least once since the age of 15 years. Regional variations exist, with low-income countries reporting higher lifetime and, even more pronouncedly, higher past year prevalence compared with high-income countries. These findings show that intimate partner violence against women was already highly prevalent across the globe before the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are not on track to meet the SDG targets on the elimination of violence against women and girls, despite robust evidence that intimate partner violence can be prevented. There is an urgent need to invest in effective multisectoral interventions, strengthen the public health response to intimate partner violence, and ensure it is addressed in post-COVID-19 reconstruction efforts.

"FEATURES OF COPING STRATEGIES IN THE POPULATION DURING QUARANTINE IN CONDITIONS OF EPIDEMIC DANGER","The aim: The purpose of this study was to examine the most common coping strategies in the population in quarantine settings. Materials and methods: The study used the following set of methods: a general questionnaire aimed at studying socio-demographic data, living conditions during quarantine, lifestyle during quarantine, the presence of chronic diseases and psychodiagnostic methods: assessment of distress R.Kessler, assessment of the presence of manifestations of anxiety-depressive response GAD-7, depression self-assessment scale PHQ-9, stress-overcoming behavior strategies (E. Heim), as well as mathematical methods for processing the obtained data. Results: Social and psychological characteristics of the examined were investigated, where coping strategies during the quarantine period play a role in the adaptation process and the state of the psychoemotional sphere. Non-adaptive cognitive coping was characterized by the presence of direct strong correlations with high levels of distress and high rates of anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Quarantine restrictions are risk factors for mental health deterioration. In these settings, the interaction of stress factors with anti-stress protection components is important, among which coping strategies play a leading role.","Tabachnikov, Bilobryvka, Venger, Rakhman, Rokutov, Tkachenko, Chuhunov","https://www.google.com/search?q=FEATURES+OF+COPING+STRATEGIES+IN+THE+POPULATION+DURING+QUARANTINE+IN+CONDITIONS+OF+EPIDEMIC+DANGER.","20220219"," COVID-19;  anxiety ;  coping strategies ;  depression ;  stress ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-20","",27247,""

"Effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in mitigating adverse mental health outcomes among disaster-exposed health care workers: A systematic review","Health care workers worldwide are at an increased risk of a range of adverse mental health outcomes, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following the unprecedented demand placed upon them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychosocial interventions offered to mitigate these risks should be based on the best available evidence; however, limited information regarding the comparative effectiveness of interventions is available. We undertook a systematic review of psychosocial interventions delivered to health care workers before, during, and after disasters. Eight databases were searched, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Our primary outcomes were changes in symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and sleep. We calculated effect sizes, where unreported, and reliable change indices to appraise intervention effectiveness. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020182774). In total, 12,198 papers were screened, 14 of which were included in the present review. Interventions based on evidence-based protocols, including individual and group-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD, anxiety, and depression were found to lead to reliable changes in PTSD and anxiety symptoms. Single-session debriefing and psychological first aid workshops showed limited efficacy. There is limited evidence on psychosocial interventions for health care workers faced with disasters, with the strongest evidence base for CBT-based approaches. Future research should include controlled evaluations of interventions and aim to target identified risk factors.","Ottisova, Gillard, Wood, Langford, John-Baptiste Bastien, Madinah Haris, Wild, Bloomfield, Robertson","https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22780","20220219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-20","",27249,""
"Posttraumatic growth during the COVID-19 lockdown: A large-scale population-based study among Norwegian adolescents","The negative consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown during the spring of 2020 have been documented. However, adolescents may also have experienced positive personal and interrelational changes. This was the first study to examine the prevalence of posttraumatic growth (PTG) during the lockdown. We additionally explored how potential risk and protective factors, as well as experiences with the pandemic, were related to PTG and whether these associations were moderated by mental health resources and social support. We used data from a representative survey of 12,686 junior and senior high school students from Oslo, Norway, conducted during the lockdown (37% response rate, 56.4% girls). A short version of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory was used to assess growth relative to personal strength, relationships with others, and appreciation of life. Several potential predictors in the domains of mental health, social relationships, experiences during the pandemic, and sociodemographic background factors were examined. Results from multiple regression analyses showed that satisfaction with life, parental care, worries about the pandemic, and immigrant status were the most prominent predictors of PTG, ÃŽÂ²s = .14-.22, p &lt; .001. Moderation analyses indicated a complex interplay between predictors of PTG by showing that good mental health was associated with higher degrees of PTG only in groups typically considered to be at higher risk of adverse outcomes. The findings provide information regarding who would profit from additional help to reinterpret the dramatic events during the lockdown to facilitate growth.","Ulset, von Soest","https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22801","20220219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-20","",27250,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Opioid Overdose Deaths: a Spatiotemporal Analysis","The effects of the opioid crisis have varied across diverse and socioeconomically defined urban communities, due in part to widening health disparities. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has coincided with a spike in drug overdose deaths in the USA. However, the extent to which the impact of the pandemic on overdose deaths has varied across different demographics inÃ‚Â urban neighborhoods is unclear. We examine the influenceÃ‚Â of COVID-19 pandemic on opioid overdose deaths through spatiotemporal analysis techniques. Using Milwaukee County, Wisconsin as a study site, we usedÃ‚Â georeferenced opioid overdose data to examine the locational and demographic differences in overdose deaths over time (2017-2020). We find that the pandemic significantly increased the monthly overdose deaths. The worst effects were seen in the poor, urban neighborhoods, affecting Black and Hispanic communities. However, more affluent, suburban White communities also experienced a rise in overdose deaths. A better understanding of contributing factors is needed to guide interventions at the local, regional, and national scales.","Ghose, Forati, Mantsch","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-022-00610-0","20220219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-20","",27251,""

"The Pandemic Brain: neuroinflammation in non-infected individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic","While COVID-19 research has seen an explosion in the literature, the impact of pandemic-related societal and lifestyle disruptions on brain health among the uninfected remains underexplored. However, a global increase in the prevalence of fatigue, brain fog, depression and other ""sickness behavior""-like symptoms implicates a possible dysregulation in neuroimmune mechanisms even among those never infected by the virus. We compared fifty-seven 'Pre-Pandemic' and fifteen 'Pandemic' datasets from individuals originally enrolled as control subjects for various completed, or ongoing, research studies available in our records, with a confirmed negative test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We used a combination of multimodal molecular brain imaging (simultaneous positron emission tomography / magnetic resonance spectroscopy), behavioral measurements, imaging transcriptomics and serologic testing to uncover links between pandemic-related stressors and neuroinflammation. Healthy individuals examined after the enforcement of 2020 lockdown/stay-at-home measures demonstrated elevated brain levels of two independent neuroinflammatory markers (the 18 kDa translocator protein, TSPO, and myoinositol) compared to pre-lockdown subjects. The serum levels of two inflammatory markers (interleukin-16 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) were also elevated, although these effects did not reach statistical significance after correcting for multiple comparisons. Subjects endorsing higher symptom burden showed higher TSPO signal in the hippocampus (mood alteration, mental fatigue), intraparietal sulcus and precuneus (physical fatigue), compared to those reporting little/no symptoms. Post-lockdown TSPO signal changes were spatially aligned with the constitutive expression of several genes involved in immune/neuroimmune functions. This work implicates neuroimmune activation as a possible mechanism underlying the non-virally-mediated symptoms experienced by many during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies will be needed to corroborate and further interpret these preliminary findings.","Brusaferri, Alshelh, Martins, Kim, Weerasekera, Housman, Morrissey, Knight, Castro-Blanco, Albrecht, Tseng, ZÃƒÂ¼rcher, Ratai, Akeju, Makary, Catana, Mercaldo, Hadjikhani, Veronese, Turkheimer, Rosen, Hooker, Loggia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2022.02.018","20220219","MRS; Neuroimaging; PET; Pandemic; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-20","",27253,""
