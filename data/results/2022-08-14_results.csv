"Geotemporal analysis of perinatal care changes and maternal mental health: an example from the COVID-19 pandemic","Our primary objective was to document COVID-19 induced changes to perinatal care across the USA and examine the implication of these changes for maternal mental health. We performed an observational cross-sectional study with convenience sampling using direct patient reports from 1918 postpartum and 3868 pregnant individuals collected between April 2020 and December 2020 from 10 states across the USA. We leverage a subgroup of these participants who gave birth prior to March 2020 to estimate the pre-pandemic prevalence of specific birthing practices as a comparison. Our primary analyses describe the prevalence and timing of perinatal care changes, compare perinatal care changes depending on when and where individuals gave birth, and assess the linkage between perinatal care alterations and maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms. Seventy-eight percent of pregnant participants and 63% of postpartum participants reported at least one change to their perinatal care between March and August 2020. However, the prevalence and nature of specific perinatal care changes occurred unevenly over time and across geographic locations. The separation of infants and mothers immediately after birth and the cancelation of prenatal visits were associated with worsened depression and anxiety symptoms in mothers after controlling for sociodemographic factors, mental health history, number of pregnancy complications, and general stress about the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analyses reveal widespread changes to perinatal care across the US that fluctuated depending on where and when individuals gave birth. Disruptions to perinatal care may also exacerbate mental health concerns, so focused treatments that can mitigate the negative psychiatric sequelae of interrupted care are warranted.","Hendrix, Werchan, Lenniger, Ablow, Amstadter, Austin, Babineau, Bogat, Cioffredi, Conradt, Crowell, Dumitriu, Elliott, Fifer, Firestein, Gao, Gotlib, Graham, Gregory, Gustafsson, Havens, Hockett, Howell, Humphreys, Jallo, King, Kinser, Levendosky, Lonstein, Lucchini, Marcus, Monk, Moyer, Muzik, Nuttall, Potter, Rogers, Salisbury, Shuffrey, Smith, Smyser, Smith, Sullivan, Zhou, Brito, Thomason","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-022-01252-6","20220813","Coronavirus; Depression; Mental health; Postpartum; Pregnancy; Prenatal care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-14","",36091,""
"LEGAL AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES OF COVID-19 VACCINATION BEFORE AND AFTER THE 2022 RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE","The aim: The study aims to develop ways of solving the social and legal problems of vaccination against COVID-19, showing them the example of Ukraine before and after the beginning of the active phase of Russian aggression. Materials and methods: The study is based on international documents and legal acts adopted to combat the COVID-19 epidemic, the survey results of 165 ordinary Ukrainians on vaccination, interviewing health care organizers; statistical information, and content analysis of the media on vaccination, as well as ways of avoiding it. Dialectical, analytical-synthetic, system-structural methods, as well as methods of content analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and included observation, were used. <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Conclusions: Ways of overcoming the adverse socio-legal problems of vaccination and related background phenomena are to conduct quality information campaigns to inform the public about the benefits and safety of vaccination, counter misinformation, increase the availability of vaccines with a choice of vaccines from different manufacturers, and increase the effectiveness of criminal legal counteraction to forgery of documents confirming vaccination. After the imposition of martial law in Ukraine, there has been a change in the focus of public attention to solving vital problems, which, along with the transfer of anti-coronavirus restrictions to the status of recommendatory, creates danger of significant reduction in vaccination.","Gutorova, Lapkin, Yevtieieva","https://doi.org/10.36740/WLek202207117","20220813"," COVID-19 vaccination;  forgery of vaccination certificate ;  legal regulation;  the social impact of vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-14","",36092,""
"The implications of COVID-19 on health and social care personnel in long-term care facilities for older people: An international scoping review","This scoping review mapped out the existing literature pertaining to health and social care personnel experiences during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and their work in a long-term care setting for older people. This review identified the gaps in the implications of health and social care personnel's own health and well-being during the pandemic as well as the ethical dilemmas inherent in providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors utilised the PRISMA checklist for undertaking scoping reviews. The Databases Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant articles in English that were published between March 28, 2020 and June 1, 2022. This time period was selected to focus specifically on the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of this review, long-term care facilities were defined to include institutions such as nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, retirement homes and residential care homes. The gaps identified were a paucity of research on the experiences of health and social care personnel in long-term care facilities, the impact on their mental health, and the wider challenges experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed. The findings of this scoping review indicate a need for adequate preparedness during a pandemic within the health and social care sector to protect health and social care personnel and the individuals they care for.","Jones, Schnitzler, Borgstrom","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13969","20220813","COVID-19; ethical challenges; health and social care personnel; mental health; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-14","",36093,""
"Challenges and opportunities for perinatal health services in the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study with perinatal healthcare professionals","Perinatal healthcare professionals (PHCPs) provide essential support to all parents in the perinatal period, including young parents aged 16-24, who are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the provision of perinatal services, and on perinatal healthcare professionals, caring for young parents in the UK. A UK based qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with perinatal healthcare professionals (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17). Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Two themes were identified describing perinatal healthcare professionals' perceptions of providing care to young parents during the pandemic. Perinatal healthcare professionals perceived that young parents' needs were amplified by the pandemic and that pandemic-related changes to the service, such as the use of telemedicine to replace face-to-face interactions, did not manage to successfully mitigate the increased feelings of anxiety and isolation experienced by young parents. Concerns were raised by perinatal healthcare professionals that these changes reduced young parent's access to vital support for themselves and their child and may contribute to exacerbating pre-existing inequalities. This study provides insight into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of perinatal care to young parents. Perinatal mental health professionals felt these negative impacts could be overcome by using a blended approach of technology and face-to-face interactions allowing regular contact with young parents and facilitating the exchange of vital information, while maintaining access to opportunities for social interactions with other parents. Findings from this study could be used to future-proof services against further COVID-19 restrictions.","Moltrecht, de Cassan, Rapa, Hanna, Law, Dalton","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08427-y","20220812","COVID-19; Healthcare professionals; Perinatal; Young parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-14","",36094,""
"Adolescent mobile phone addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic predicts subsequent suicide risk: a two-wave longitudinal study","Both the rate of mobile phone addiction and suicidality among adolescents have increased during the pandemic lockdown. However, the relationship between mobile phone addiction and suicide risk and the underlying psychological mechanisms remains unknown. This study examined the associations between mobile phone addiction in adolescents during the first month of lockdown and the suicide risk in the subsequent five months. A two-wave short-term longitudinal web-based survey was conducted on 1609 senior high school students (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.53Ã‚Â years, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.97Ã‚Â years; 63.5% female). At Time 1 (T1), the severity of mobile phone addiction and basic demographic information was collected from Feb 24 to 28, 2020 in Sichuan Province, China (at the pandemic's peak). Five months later, between July 11 and July 23 (Time 2, T2), mobile phone addiction, daytime sleepiness, depression, and suicidality were measured within the past five months. The regression analysis revealed that mobile phone addiction during quarantine directly predicted suicidality within the next five months, even after controlling for the effect of depression and daytime sleepiness. Meanwhile, mobile phone addiction at T1 also indirectly predicted suicidality at T2, with depression and daytime sleepiness mediating this association. Programs targeting improvement of daytime sleepiness and depressive symptoms may be particularly effective in reducing suicide risk among adolescents with mobile phone addiction.","Li, Conti, Qiu, Tang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13931-1","20220812","COVID-19; Daytime sleepiness; Depression; Mobile phone addiction; Suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-14","",36095,""
"Adversity coping capability and its associations with mental health and family wellbeing amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong","Adversity coping capability (ACC) is important amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the associations of ACC as measured by our one-item ACC scale (ACC-1) with mental health, family well-being and validity of ACC-1 in Hong Kong. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on Hong Kong Chinese adults agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years by landline, mobile phone, and online survey from February to March 2021, when the fourth wave of COVID-19 was under control. ACC-1 consisted of the question: ""How do you rate your capability to cope with adversities?"" with higher scores (0-10) indicating stronger ACC. The associations of ACC with socioeconomic characteristics, resilience, mental health, and family wellbeing were examined by linear regression coefficients (ÃŽÂ²s). Data were weighted by sex, age, and education of the general population. Of 7441 respondents, after weighing, 52.2% were female and 79.1% were aged 18 to 64Ã‚Â years. ACC-1 showed good construct validity, with higher ACC being associated with higher levels of resilience (adjusted ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.29), personal happiness (0.55), family happiness (0.42), family wellbeing (0.41), and family communication quality (0.41), and lower levels of depressive symptoms (-0.30), anxiety (-0.30), loneliness (-0.15); incremental validity with additional contributions of ACC to mental health and family wellbeing; and known-group validity with older age and favorable socioeconomic characteristics showing higher ACC (all PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02).

"Prevalence and correlates of anxiety and depression in caregivers to assisted living residents during COVID-19: a cross-sectional study","Family and friend caregivers play significant roles in advocating for and ensuring quality health and social care of residents in Assisted Living (AL) homes. However, little is known about how the COVID-19 pandemic and related visitor restrictions affected their health and mental well-being. We examined the prevalence and correlates of anxiety and depressive symptoms among caregivers of AL residents during the initial wave of COVID-19 in two Canadian provinces. A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among family/friend caregivers of AL residents in Alberta and British Columbia (Oct 28, 2020-Mar 31, 2021) to collect data on their sociodemographic, health and caregiving characteristics, as well as concerns about residents' health and social care before and during the first wave of the pandemic. A clinically significant anxiety disorder and depressive symptoms were assessed with the GAD-7 and CES-D10 instruments, respectively. Separate multivariable (modified) Poisson regression models identified caregiver correlates of each mental health condition. Among the 673 caregivers completing the survey (81% for Alberta residents), most were women (77%), white (90%) and agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°55Ã‚Â years (81%). Clinically significant anxiety and depression were present in 28.6% and 38.8% of caregivers respectively. Both personal stressors (comorbidity level, income reduction, low social support) and caregiving stressors exacerbated by the pandemic were independently associated with caregiver anxiety and depression. The latter included increased concern about the care recipients' depression (adjusted risk ratio [adjRR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-2.85 for caregiver anxiety and adjRRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.75, 95% CI 1.26-2.44 for caregiver depressive symptoms) and reported intention to withdraw the resident from AL because of COVID-19 (adjRRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.24, 95%CI 0.95-1.63 for caregiver anxiety and adjRRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.37, 95%CI 1.13-1.67 for caregiver depressive symptoms). Caregivers of residents in AL homes reported significant personal and caregiving-related stressors during the initial wave of COVID-19 that were independently associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing clinically significant anxiety and depressive symptoms. Healthcare providers and AL staff should be aware of the prevalence and varied correlates of caregivers' mental health during public health crises so that appropriate screening and support may identified and implemented.","Lane, Hoben, Amuah, Hogan, Baumbusch, Gruneir, Chamberlain, Griffith, McGrail, Corbett, Maxwell","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-03294-y","20220812","Assisted living; COVID-19; Caregivers; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-14","",36097,""
"Post-COVID-19 neuropsychiatric manifestations among COVID-19 survivors suffering from migraine: a case-control study","The burden of post-coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 symptoms has been increasing and is of great concern in patients with pre-existing chronic medical conditions.This study aimed to delineate the post-COVID-19 neuropsychiatric symptoms among migraine patients compared to the non-migraine control group. Two groups, each of 204 COVID-19 survivors, were enrolled in the study after 3Ã‚Â months of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, one group fulfilling the episodic migraine criteria and the other serving as a matching control group. Subjects were evaluated through an in-person interview for post-COVID-19 neuropsychiatric symptoms, including detailed headache patterns and severity, using the visual analogue scale. The Frequency of headache during the acute phase of COVID-19 was more frequent in migraine patients (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.60, 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.04-2.45, P-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.031).

"A systematic review of the mental health changes of children and young people before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","There is increasing knowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on mental health of children and young people. However, the global evidence of mental health changes before compared to during the COVID-19 pandemic focusing on children and young people has not been systematically reviewed. This systematic review examined longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional studies comparing before and during COVID-19 pandemic data to determine whether the mental health of children and young people had changed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies that had been published in English and focused on children and young people between 0 and 24Ã‚Â years of age. This identified 21 studies from 11 countries, covering more than 96,000 subjects from 3 to 24Ã‚Â years of age. Pre-pandemic and pandemic data were compared. Most studies reported longitudinal deterioration in the mental health of adolescents and young people, with increased depression, anxiety and psychological distress after the pandemic started. Other findings included deteriorated negative affect, mental well-being and increased loneliness. Comparing data for pandemic and pre-pandemic periods showed that the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the mental health of children and young people. There is an urgent need for high-quality research to address the impact, risks and protective factors of the pandemic on their mental health, as this will provide a good foundation for dealing with future health emergencies and other crises.","Kauhanen, Wan Mohd Yunus, Lempinen, Peltonen, Gyllenberg, Mishina, Gilbert, Bastola, Brown, Sourander","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-02060-0","20220812","Adolescent; COVID-19 pandemic; Children; Mental health; Young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-14","",36099,""

"Annoyance toward transportation and construction noise in rural suburban and urban regions across Canada","The Canadian Perspectives on Environmental Noise Survey investigated expectations and attitudes toward environmental noise in rural/remote, suburban and urban regions across Canada. A 26-item online questionnaire was completed by 6647 randomly selected Canadians 18 years of age and older between April 12, 2021 and May 25, 2021. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression modelled the odds of reporting very or extreme (i.e., high) noise annoyance toward road traffic, aircraft/helicopter, trains and construction noise. Five variables were common to all noise sources; 1) reporting the living area as very quiet, calm and relaxing; 2) sleep disturbance in general; 3) sleep disturbance attributed to road traffic noise; 4) noise sensitivity; and 5) reporting worsened annoyance toward environmental noise due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Duration of residency, perceived changes in nighttime and daytime noise over time, expectations of quiet, other specific causes of sleep disturbance, hearing impairment, road traffic audibility, and the impact of the pandemic on physical health, mental health, stress and indoor noise annoyance, each impacted the odds of reporting high annoyance to some, but not all modelled sources. Gender, rated physical and mental health (in general), anxiety or depression, overall well-being, and Indigenous status did not enter any of the multivariate models. Results are discussed in relation to the provision of advice on noise under Canada's Impact Assessment Act.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106881","20221101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-14","",36101,""
