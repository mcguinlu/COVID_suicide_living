"Monitoring of COVID-19 Pandemic-related Psychopathology using Machine Learning","The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to have a major negative impact on global mental health and patients with mental illness may be particularly vulnerable. We show that developments in COVID-19 pandemic-related psychopathology among patients with mental illness can be meaningfully monitored using machine learning methods. The COVID-19 pandemic-related psychopathology was found to covary with the pandemic pressure. This correlation was, however, less pronounced during the second wave compared to the first wave of the pandemic - possibly due to habituation.","Kenneth C.

"The Specchio-COVID19 cohort study: a longitudinal follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey participants in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland (Study protocol)","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected billions of people around the world both directly through the infection itself and indirectly through its economic, social and sanitary impact. Collecting data over time is essential for the understanding of the disease spread, the incidence of COVID19-like symptoms, the level and dynamics of immunity, as well as the long-term impact of the pandemic. Objective The objective was to set up a longitudinal follow-up of adult participants of serosurveys carried out in the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Serosurvey participants were invited to create an account on the dedicated digital platform Specchio-COVID19 (https://www.specchio-covid19.ch/). Upon registration, an initial questionnaire assessed socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics (including housing conditions, physical activity, diet, alcohol and tobacco consumption), general health, and experience related to COVID-19 (symptoms, COVID-19 test results, quarantines, hospitalizations). Weekly, participants were invited to fill in a short questionnaire with updates on self-reported COVID-19-compatible symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection testing and vaccination. A more detailed questionnaire about mental health, well-being, risk perception, and changes in working conditions was proposed monthly. Supplementary questionnaires were proposed at regular intervals to assess more in depth the impact of the pandemic on physical and mental health, vaccination adherence, health care consumption and changes in health behaviors. At baseline, serology testing allowed to assess the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the general population and subgroups of workers. Additionally, seropositive participants and a sample of randomly selected participants were invited for serologic testing at regular intervals in order to monitor both the seropersistance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of the Canton of Geneva. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Cantonal Research Ethics Commission of Geneva (CCER Project ID 2020-00881). Results will be disseminated via the Specchio-COVID19 platform and scientific articles.","Helene Baysson; Francesco Pennachio; Ania Wisniak; Maria Eugenia Zabella; Prune Collombet; Elsa Lorthe; Stephane Joost; Jean-Francois Balavoine; Delphine Bachmann; Andrew Azman; Didier Pittet; Francois Chappuis; Omar Kherad; Laurent Kaiser; Idris Guessous; Silvia Stringhini; - Specchio COVID19 study group","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.14.21260489","20210716","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16009,""

"Facing the ""new normal"": How adjusting to the easing of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions exposes mental health inequalities","Re-establishing societal norms in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic will be important for restoring public mental health and psychosocial wellbeing as well as economic recovery. We investigated the impact on post-pandemic adjustment of a history of mental disorder, with particular reference to obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms or traits. The study was pre-registered (Open Science Framework; https://osf.io/gs8j2/). Adult members of the public (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 514) were surveyed between July and November 2020, to identify the extent to which they reported difficulties re-adjusting as lockdown conditions eased. All were assessed using validated scales to determine which demographic and mental health-related factors impacted adjustment. An exploratory analysis of a subgroup on an objective online test of cognitive inflexibility was also performed. Adjustment was related to a history of mental disorder and the presence of OC symptoms and traits, all acting indirectly and statistically-mediated via depression, anxiety and stress; and in the case of OC symptoms, also via COVID-related anxiety (all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). One hundred and twenty-eight (25%) participants reported significant adjustment difficulties and were compared with those self-identifying as ""good adjusters"" (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 231). This comparison revealed over-representation of those with a history or family history of mental disorder in the poor adjustment category (all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). 'Poor-adjusters' additionally reported higher COVID-related anxiety, depression, anxiety and stress and OC symptoms and traits (all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Furthermore, history of mental disorder directly statistically mediated adjustment status (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01), whereas OC symptoms (not OC traits) acted indirectly via COVID-related anxiety (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Poor-adjusters also showed evidence of greater cognitive inflexibility on the intra-extra-dimensional set-shift task. Individuals with a history of mental disorder, OC symptoms and OC traits experienced greater difficulties adjusting after lockdown-release, largely statistically mediated by increased depression, anxiety, including COVID-related anxiety, and stress. The implications for clinical and public health policies and interventions are discussed.","Fineberg, Pellegrini, Wellsted, Hall, Corazza, Giorgetti, Cicconcelli, Theofanous, Sireau, Adam, Chamberlain, Laws","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.07.001","20210716","COVID-19; Cognitive inflexibility; Lockdown release; Mental-health; Obsessive-compulsive; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16011,""
"Longitudinal changes in the mental health of UK young male and female adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","An increasing body of research indicates that, whilst young adults are at the lowest risk of becoming severely physically ill as a result of COVID-19, they are at the greatest risk of adverse mental health outcomes. Using data from the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey, the current study examined the mental health of 18-25-year-olds during the pandemic. Current mental health was measured at six time points using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), a validated measure for mental distress. The analytic sample included 880 young adults (292Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â males; 588Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â females). The trajectory of mental health was modeled from April to November 2020, using demographic information and health behaviors (physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking cigarettes) as covariates. Growth curve modeling indicated that alcohol consumption, smoking, being female, having a lower income, and having a pre-existing mental health condition were risk factors for worse mental health during the pandemic. For females, their mental health was lowest in April but gradually improved until September, when it began to decline again. Males, in contrast, had a relatively stable trajectory of mental health across the pandemic. These findings can help inform targeted interventions for at risk groups to minimize the adverse impact of the pandemic on young adults' mental health.","Stroud, Gutman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114074","20210716","Alcohol consumption; COVID-19; Gender; Mental health; Smoking; Trajectories; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16012,""

To date, few studies focused on people living in detention, who have a high burden of mental health problems and are exposed to severe control measures. Our study investigated whether there was an increase in suicide attempts in prison. Data were collected in the largest Swiss pre-trial prison (Champ-Dollon) for the pre-pandemic and the pandemic periods. We identified a statistically significant 57%-increase of suicide attempts.

"Psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS) and its correlation with anxiety and depression","In the beginning of 2020, Italy was the first European country to face the COVID-19 outbreak. Restrictions imposed during the pandemic, social isolation, and the cancellation of medical appointments likely resulted in stress that may have affected pregnant women adversely. To determine the psychometric validity of the Italian version of the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS) in assessing COVID-19-related stress in pregnant women and to examine correlations between PREPS scales and symptoms of anxiety and depression. 232 pregnant women attending the Obstetric-Gynecologic Clinic of an Academic Hospital were assessed with the PREPS, the Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). We analyzed the internal consistency and factor structure of the PREPS. Convergent validity was examined by comparison with the NuPDQ. PHQ-2 and GAD-7 were used to measure the association with depression and anxiety. Acceptable-to-good internal consistency was found for the three PREPS scales: Preparedness Stress (PS, ÃŽÂ±=0.760), Prenatal Infection Stress (PIS, ÃŽÂ±=0.857), and Positive Appraisal (PA, ÃŽÂ±=0.747). Correlations of the NuPDQ with both PREPS stress scale scores (PS and PIS) were statistically significant, but on multiple regression analysis only the PS scale was correlated with the NuPDQ. Prenatal infection stress predicted GAD-7 score, while Preparedness stress predicted PHQ-2 score. The main limitations were the small sample size and the cross-sectional design of the study. The Italian PREPS exhibited good psychometric properties and associations with clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression.","Penengo, Colli, Garzitto, Driul, Sala, Degano, Preis, Lobel, Balestrieri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.076","20210716","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; PREPS; Pregnancy; Prenatal stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16014,""
"Neural Responses to Social Reward Predict Depressive Symptoms in Adolescent Girls During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Adolescent depression is increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly related to dramatic social changes. Individual-level factors that contribute to social functioning, such as temperament and neural reactivity to social feedback, may confer risk for or resilience against depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Ninety-three girls (12-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) oversampled for high shy/fearful temperament were recruited from a longitudinal study for a follow-up COVID-19 study. During the parent study (2016-2018), participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging task eliciting neural activity to performance-related social feedback. Depressive symptoms were assessed during the parent study and COVID-19 follow-up (April-May 2020). In 65 participants with complete data, we examined how interactions between temperament and neural activation to social reward or punishment in a socio-affective brain network predict depressive symptoms during COVID-19. Depressive symptoms increased during COVID-19. Significant interactions between temperament and caudate, putamen, and insula activation to social reward were found. Girls high in shy/fearful temperament showed negative associations between neural activation to social reward and COVID-19 depressive symptoms, whereas girls lower in shy/fearful temperament showed positive associations. Girls high in shy/fearful temperament with reduced neural activation to social reward may be less likely to engage socially, which could be detrimental during the pandemic when social interactions are limited. In contrast, girls lower in shy/fearful temperament with heightened neural reactivity to social reward may be highly motivated to engage socially, which could also be detrimental with limited social opportunities. In both cases, improving social connection during the pandemic may attenuate or prevent depressive symptoms.","Sequeira, Silk, Hutchinson, Jones, Ladouceur","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab037","20210716","COVID-19; adolescents; depression; neural processes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16015,""
"CoCo20 protocol: a pilot longitudinal follow-up study about the psychiatric outcomes in a paediatric population and their families during and after the stay-at-home related to coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)","In the context of a viral outbreak and the stay-at-home measures, a significant increase in psychological distress, such as stress or fear behaviours, has previously been reported in adult and paediatric population. Children and adolescents seem to be particularly at risk of developing psychiatric disorders during and after the stay-at-home but evidences are lacking. The main objective of this article is to present the methodology of Coronavirus Confinement 2020 (CoCo20) Study, which aims to assess the impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and stay-at-home on the development of psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in children and adolescents. We describe a longitudinal and multicentre study in the paediatric population during and after stay-at-home related to COVID-19 pandemic. Inclusions started on 30 March 2020 for 6 months. This study is proposed to all consecutive paediatric outpatients consulting during and after stay-at-home related to COVID-19 pandemic in medical-psychological centres and in a paediatric psychotrauma centre and/or calling the emergency COVID-19 hotline. We perform standardised and internationally validated psychiatric assessments (Diagnosis Infant and Preschool Assessment, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version) together with anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, PTSD, parenting stress and somatic symptoms scales during five visits (baseline, 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°week after baseline, 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month after baseline, 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°week after the end of the containment and 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month after the end of the containment) in patients and their families enrolled during the containment and during three visits in case of enrolment after the containment. The inclusion period will end in 30 November 2020. The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Cote d'Azur University Ã‚Â« CERNI Ã‚Â» (number 2020-59). All patients and their legal caregivers provide a written informed consent on enrolment in the study. We will submit the results of the study to relevant journals and offer national and international presentations.

"COVID-19 Pandemic and Mental Health: Digital Trainings to Support Psychosomatic Rehabilitation Patients","The COVID-19 pandemic has largely affected people's mental health and psychological well-being. Specifically, individuals with a pre-existing mental health disorder seem more impaired by lockdown measures posing as major stress factors. Medical rehabilitation treatment can help to cope with these stressors. The internet and digital applications provide a platform to contribute to regular treatment and to conduct research on this topic. Making use of internet-based assessments, this study investigated individuals from the general population and patients from medical, psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics. Levels of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, common COVID-19 related worries, and the intention to use digital applications were compared. Furthermore, we investigated whether partaking in internet-delivered digital trainings prior to and during the rehabilitation stay, as well as the perceived usefulness of digital trainings are associated with improved mental health after rehabilitation. A large-scale online cross-section study was conducted among a study sample taken from the general population (n=1812) in Germany from May 2020 to April 2021. Further, a longitudinal study was conducted making use of the internet among a second study sample of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients at two measurement timepoints, before (n=1719) and after (n=738) rehabilitation, between July 2020 and April 2021. Validated questionnaires and adapted items were used to assess mental health and corona-related worries. Digital trainings were evaluated. Propensity score matching, multivariate analyses of covariances, exploratory factor analysis, and hierarchical regression analyses were performed. Patients from the psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics reported increased symptoms with regard to depression, anxiety, loneliness, and stress (F(4,2028)=183.74, P&lt;.001, ÃŽÂ·p2=.27) compared to the general population. Patients perceived greater satisfaction in communication with healthcare professionals (F(1,837)=31.67, P&lt;.001, ÃŽÂ·p2=.04), had lower financial worries (F(1,837)=38.96, P&lt;.001, ÃŽÂ·p2=.04), but higher household-related worries (F(1,837)=5.34, P=.02, ÃŽÂ·p2=.01) compared to the general population. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived stress were lower post rehabilitation (F(1,712)=23.21, P&lt;.001, ÃŽÂ·p2=.04) than prior to the rehabilitation. Psychosomatic patients reported a higher intention to use common apps and digital trainings (F(3,2021)=51.41, P&lt;.001, ÃŽÂ·p2=.07) than the general population. With regard to digital trainings offered prior and during the rehabilitation stay, the perceived usefulness of digital rehabilitation goal trainings was associated with decreased symptoms of depression (ÃƒÅ¸=-.14, P&lt;.001), anxiety (ÃƒÅ¸=-.12, P&lt;.001), loneliness (ÃƒÅ¸=-.18, P&lt;.001) and stress post rehabilitation (ÃƒÅ¸=-.19, P&lt;.001). Participation in digital group therapy for depression was associated with an overall change in depression (F(1,725)=4.82, P=.03, ÃŽÂ·p2=.01) and anxiety (F(1,725)=6.22, P=.01, ÃŽÂ·p2=.01) from pre to post-rehabilitation. This study validated the increased mental health constraints of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients in comparison to the general population and the potentials of rehabilitation treatment. Digital rehabilitation components are promising tools that can prepare patients for their rehabilitation stay, integrated well with face-to-face therapy during rehabilitation treatment and support aftercare.","Keller, Dahmen, Derksen, KÃƒÂ¶tting, Lippke","https://doi.org/10.2196/30610","20210716","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16017,""
"Elevated risk for obsessive-compulsive symptoms in women pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a public mental health crisis with many people experiencing new or worsening anxiety. Fear of contagion and the lack of predictability/control in daily life increased the risk for problems such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in the general population. Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable to such pandemic-related stressors yet the prevalence of OC symptoms in this population during the pandemic remains unknown. We examined the prevalence of OC symptoms in a sample of 4451Ã‚Â pregnantÃ‚Â women in the USA, recruited via targeted online methods at the start of the pandemic. Participants completed self-report measures including the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised and the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale. Clinically significant OC symptoms were present in 7.12% of participants, more than twice as high as rates of peripartum OCD reported prior to the pandemic. Younger maternal age, income loss, and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were all associated with higher OC symptoms. Two types of pregnancy-specific stress, pandemic-related and pandemic-unrelated, were both associated with higher levels of OC symptoms. Pandemic-related pregnancy stress predicted OC symptoms even after controlling for non-pandemic-related, pregnancy-specific stress. Elevated rates of OC symptoms were observed in women pregnant during the pandemic, particularly those experiencing elevated pandemic-related pregnancy stress. This type of stress confers a distinct risk for OC symptoms above and beyond pregnancy-specific stress and demographic factors. Healthcare providers should be prepared to see and treat more peripartum women with OC symptoms during this and future public health crises.","Mahaffey, Levinson, Preis, Lobel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-021-01157-w","20210716","COVID-19; ObsessiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œcompulsive symptoms; Pandemic-related pregnancy stress; Perinatal anxiety; Pregnancy-specific stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16018,""
"Disparities in Technology and Broadband Internet Access Across Rurality: Implications for Health and Education","Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in using telehealth to increase access to health and mental health care has grown, and school transitions to remote learning have heightened awareness of broadband inequities. The purpose of this study was to examine access and barriers to technology and broadband Internet service (""broadband"") among rural and urban youth. Washington State public school districts were surveyed about youth's access to technology (ie, a device adequate for online learning) and broadband availability in spring 2020. Availability of and barriers to broadband (ie, geography, affordability, and smartphone-only connectivity) were assessed across rurality. Among responding districts, 64.2% (n = 172) were rural and 35.8% (n = 96) were urban. Rural districts reported significantly fewer students with access to an Internet-enabled device adequate for online learning (80.0% vs 90.1%, P &lt; .01). Access to reliable broadband varied significantly across geography (P &lt; .01). Compared with their urban peers, rural youth face more challenges in accessing the technology and connectivity needed for remote learning and telehealth. Given that inadequate broadband infrastructure is a critical barrier to the provision of telehealth services and remote learning in rural areas, efforts to improve policies and advance technology must consider geographical disparities to ensure health and education equity.","Graves, Abshire, Amiri, Mackelprang","https://doi.org/10.1097/FCH.0000000000000306","20210716","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16019,""
"Understanding and Responding to the Impact of COVID-19 on Paediatric Gastroenterology Training &amp; Practice of Young ESPGHAN Members","Limited data exist about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the training and clinical practice of young doctors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on paediatric gastroenterologists in training posts during the first wave of European COVID pandemic. All Young ESPGHAN (YE) members received a multiple-choice questionnaire concerning the impact (if any) on their clinical practice, mental health, quality of care provided and fellowship/training experience. The survey was conducted between May 22nd, 2020 and June 10th, 2020. Of the 144 responders (40% of YE members), 85% (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 123) reported an impact of COVID-19. 96% reported an impact on their clinical practice, including more virtual patient consultation (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 91), underutilization of ambulatory care (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 113) and reduced or lack of planned admissions (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 75). Endoscopy restrictions to semi-urgent or emergency cases were reported in 82 and lack of medical equipment/drugs (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 47) were also reported.Reported adverse mental health issues included poor concentration, increased stress levels, an impact on family life in 62% and a reduced quality of care in 45%; this was more often reported in doctors from Southern Europe (54%) than in those from other geographical areas.77% reported an impact on the content of their fellowship, including lack of participation in national/international meetings, withdrawn research time and limited mentoring. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been shown to affect the clinical practice, training and mental health of YE members. Adaptations of training programmes and targeted strategies to improve the clinical practice of young practitioners are needed and proposed in this manuscript.","Ni Latin Small Letter T With Comma Below Ã„â€š, Tsita, Grima, Cameron, Rock, Tapsas","https://doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000003239","20210716","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16020,""
"Psychological well-being in cancer outpatients during COVID-19","The psychological status of cancer outpatients receiving anti-neoplastic treatment during the lockdown in a Italian non-COVID Cancer Center, was been investigated with the following aims: to measure the levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression and anxiety; to compare patients with different cancer sites; to compare the anxiety and depression levels measured in this emergency period between cancer and non-cancer patients and between cancer patients before and after the emergency. The following questionnaires were used: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADs) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R).Worries regarding the COVID-19 on patients' lives, socio-demographic and clinical details were collected using a brief structured questionnaire. One-hundred seventy-eight outpatients were enrolled. We found that 55% of patients were above the cut-off for HADS general scale and 23.7% had severe level of PTSD. The 68% of patients declared that their worries have increased during the pandemic especially for women. Patients with lung cancer have higher general distress compared with patients with breast cancer and lymphoma. The non cancer sample had values significantly higher both for the IES-R scales and for HADS Depression subscale. Finally, cancer patients who experienced the health emergency showed higher levels of anxiety than those measured 2 years ago.

"Differential psychological response to the COVID-19 pandemic in psychiatric inpatients compared to a non-clinical population from Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic is an inherently stressful situation, which may lead to adverse psychosocial outcomes in various populations. Yet, individuals may not be affected equally by stressors posed by the pandemic and those with pre-existing mental disorders could be particularly vulnerable. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the psychological response to the pandemic in a case-control design. We used an age-, sex- and employment status-matched case-control sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°216) of psychiatric inpatients, recruited from the LMU Psychiatry Biobank Munich study and non-clinical individuals from the general population. Participants completed validated self-report measures on stress, anxiety, depression, paranoia, rumination, loneliness, well-being, resilience, and a newly developed index of stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the effects of group, COVID-19-specific stressors, and their interaction on the different psychosocial outcomes. While psychiatric inpatients reported larger mental health difficulties overall, the impact of COVID-19-specific stressors was lower in patients and not associated with worse psychological functioning compared to non-clinical individuals. In contrast, depressive symptoms, rumination, loneliness, and well-being were more strongly associated with COVID-19-specific stressors in non-clinical individuals and similar to the severity of inpatients for those who experienced the greatest COVID-19-specific stressor impact Contrary to expectations, the psychological response to the pandemic may not be worse in psychiatric inpatients compared to non-clinical individuals. Yet, individuals from the general population, who were hit hardest by the pandemic, should be monitored and may be in need of mental health prevention and treatment efforts.","Rek, Freeman, Reinhard, BÃƒÂ¼hner, Grosen, Falkai, Adorjan, Padberg","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-021-01291-7","20210716","COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19-specific stressors; Mental health; Psychiatric inpatients; Psychological response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16022,""
"Social Class and Changes in Australian Women's Affect and Alcohol Consumption During COVID-19","<b>Introduction:</b> Before the pandemic, mid-life women in Australia were among the ""heaviest"" female alcohol consumers, giving rise to myriad preventable health risks. This paper uses an innovative model of social class within a sample of Australian women to describe changes in affective states and alcohol consumption patterns across two time points during COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> Survey data were collected from Australian mid-life women (45-64 years) at two time points during COVID-19-May 2020 (<i>N</i> = 1,218) and July 2020 (<i>N</i> = 799). We used a multi-dimensional model for measuring social class across three domains-economic capital (income, property and assets), social capital (social contacts and occupational prestige of those known socially), and cultural capital (level of participation in various cultural activities). Latent class analysis allowed comparisons across social classes to changes in affective states and alcohol consumption patterns reported at the two time points using alcohol consumption patterns as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) and its component items. <b>Results:</b> Seven social classes were constructed, characterized by variations in access to capital. Affective states during COVID-19 differed according to social class. Comparing between the survey time points, feeling fearful/anxious was higher in those with high economic and cultural capital and moderate social capital (""emerging affluent""). Increased depression was most prominent in the class characterized by the highest volumes of all forms of capital (""established affluent""). The social class characterized by the least capital (""working class"") reported increased prevalence of uncertainty, but less so for feeling fearful or anxious, or depressed. Women's alcohol consumption patterns changed across time during the pandemic. The ""new middle"" class-a group characterized by high social capital (but contacts with low prestige) and minimal economic capital-had increased AUDIT-C scores. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our data shows the pandemic impacted women's negative affective states, but not in uniform ways according to class. It may explain increases in alcohol consumption among women in the emerging affluent group who experienced increased feelings or fear and anxiety during the pandemic. This nuanced understanding of the vulnerabilities of sub-groups of women, in respect to negative affect and alcohol consumption can inform future pandemic policy responses designed to improve mental health and reduce the problematic use of alcohol. Designing pandemic responses segmented for specific audiences is also aided by our multi-dimensional analysis of social class, which uncovers intricate differences in affective states amongst sub-groups of mid-life women.","Lunnay, Toson, Wilson, Miller, Meyer, Olver, Foley, Thomas, Ward","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.645376","20210716","alcohol; anxiety; depression; pandemic (COVID-19); social class; survey; uncertainty; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16023,""
"Obstetrics and Neonatal Outcomes in Pregnant Women with COVID-19: A Systematic Review","Considering that the obstetricians and pediatricians need to comprehensive information about the obstetric and neonatal effect of COVID-19, this review study was conducted to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on obstetrics and neonatal outcomes. In this systematic review the international search databases following PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest and Embase and Google scholar were searched. All articles were reviewed by two independent researchers until 10 April 2020. After quality assessment of included studies the finding reported in 2 sections obstetrics and neonatal outcomes. The sixteen studies with a sample size of 123 pregnant women with a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 and their neonates were evaluated. The range of gestational age was 25-40 weeks. There was no death associated with COVID-19 in pregnant women. The obstetric outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 include decreased fetal movement, intrauterine fetal distress, anemia, PROM, preterm labor, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) and etc. The most common delivery mode in women affect with COVID-19 was cesarean section. Expect for one case with MODS, in the majority of the studies reviewed, no severe morbidity or mortality occurred. The neonatal outcomes were stillbirth, prematurity, asphyxia, fetal distress, low birth weight, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation and neonatal death. In addition, five neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, the studies report these outcomes but the exact causes of theme are not known. In this systematic review, we summarize the diverse results of studies about the obstetrics and neonatal outcomes following COVID-19. This infection may cause negative outcomes in both mothers and neonates. However, there were evidence about neonate infected with COVID-19, but there is controversial information about the vertical transmission of COVID-19.","Banaei, Ghasemi, Saei Ghare Naz, Kiani, Rashidi-Fakari, Banaei, Mohammad Souri, Rokni","https://doi.org/10.18502/ijph.v49iS1.3668","20210716","COVID-19; Coronavirus infection; Neonate; Outcome; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16024,""

"A Game of Covid: Strategic Thoughts About a Ludified Pandemic","Many aspects of handling the COVID-19 pandemic bear a resemblance to patterns found in games. We observe point displays and leader boards, the visible assumption of roles, classic archetypes, the collection of resources, and spatial awareness. We argue that these patterns manifest spontaneously as a form of analogical reasoning, because people lack cultural and individual norms as well as cognitive scripts for a pandemic. Trying to find systematic similarities between a novel and a familiar situation is an essential cognitive strategy and a cultural tool, resulting in a spontaneous ludification of this crisis. Unfortunately, most institutions, the media and policymakers focus on attributes that are easy to communicate, not on relations and causal chains. This results in shallow analogies, where the mechanisms and dynamics of COVID-19 are not addressed. This can cause a sense of helplessness, where many people remain passive viewers. A pandemic, however, calls for cooperative action of people who understand the relations between different factors and stakeholders in order to mitigate several negative effects linked to such a crisis. We propose a psychologically founded ""Strategic gamification"" (here in the context of a pandemic), a form of sense-making that builds on spontaneously emerging ludic elements. By extending upon those elements through the lens of game design, we can shape the mechanics, dynamics and esthetics of a serious context in a more meaningful way. The resulting analogies have better predictive power and are suited to utilize positive aspects of gamification like engagement, elaboration and collaboration.","Raab, DÃƒÂ¶bler, Carbon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.607309","20210716","COVID-19; analogical reasoning; crisis; ludification; pandemic; strategic gamification","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16027,""
"The Prevalence and Correlative Factors of Depression Among Chinese Teachers During the COVID-19 Outbreak","<b>Background:</b> Epidemiological data on outbreak-associated depression of Chinese teachers are not available. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of depression among teachers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in mainland China. <b>Methods:</b> A large cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 25 (CD-RISC 25) and Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) were used to measure the mental resilience and stress of participants. The correlative factors of depression were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> In this study, 1,096 teachers were analyzed with a median (range) age of 41 (20-65) years. Of them, 624 (56.9%) suffered from depression (PHQ-9 total score of &gt;4). The multivariate analyses showed that participants with aged Ã¢â€°Â¥41 years (OR = 0.752, 95% CI:0.578-0.979, <i>p</i> = 0.034), participating in epidemic prevention and control (OR = 1.413, 95% CI:1.070-1.867, <i>p</i> = 0.015), thinking prolonged school closure have bad effect (OR = 1.385, 95% CI:1.017-1.885, <i>p</i> = 0.038), sleep duration/day of &lt;6 h (OR = 1.814, 95% CI:1.240-2.655, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), physical exercise duration/day of &lt;30 min (OR = 1.619, 95% CI:1.247-2.103, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), spending less time with family (OR = 1.729, 95% CI: 1.063-2.655, <i>p</i> = 0.002), being concerned about COVID-19 (OR = 0.609, 95% CI:0.434-0.856, <i>p</i> = 0.004), having poor mental resilience (OR = 6.570, 95% CI:3.533-12.22, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and higher PSS-10 scores (OR = 9.058, 95% CI:3.817-21.50, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with depression. <b>Conclusion:</b> During the COVID-19 outbreak, depression was common among teachers. Age, participating in epidemic prevention and control, opinions toward distant teaching and prolonged school closure, sleep duration/day, physical exercise duration, spending time with family, attitude toward COVID-19, mental resilience and stress represented the independent factors for suffering from depression.","Zhou, Yuan, Huang, Li, Yu, Chen, Luo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.644276","20210716","COVID-19; depression; factor; prevalence; teacher","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16028,""
"What Predicts the Mood of Athletes Involved in Preparations for Tokyo 2020/2021 Olympic Games During the Covid - 19 Pandemic? The Role of Sense of Coherence, Hope for Success and Coping Strategies","The aim of the study was to identify coherence, hope for success and coping strategies as predictors of mood among this year's Olympians in the context of coronavirus events. The relationships between the above variables and the mood of athletes were analysed. The study group consisted of 57 athletes - women (29) and men (28) between 18 and 39 years of age - representing various sports disciplines who were preparing for the Tokyo Olympics. The research was conducted in the period of April 7-28, 2020 during the first threat of COVID-19 pandemic, following the decision to move the Summer Olympics to the year 2021. It was time of the greatest national restrictions and information about the postponement of the games had been received. As a result of the step regression analysis, three predictors of vigour were established: sense of meaningfulness, coping with stress through positive reframing, and not using the self-blaming strategy. A positive predictor of anger was the use of substances. Confusion was predicted based on the frequency of behavioral disengagement. Behavioral disengagement predicted the severity of depression. Predictors of fatigue were the sense of meaningfulness, and the strategies of positive reframing and self-blaming. The results obtained emphasize the importance of positive reframing as a factor contributing to maintaining a positive mood state. In contrast, behavioral disengagement and self-blaming were strategies that lowered the mood of elite athletes. The results confirm the importance of factors included in the salutogenic model (sense of coherence, coping strategies) as predictors of athletes' mood during a pandemic.","SzczypiÃ…â€žska, SameÃ…â€ško, Guszkowska","https://doi.org/10.52082/jssm.2021.421","20210716","COVID-19; Salutogenesis; affective states; athletes; sense of coherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16029,""
"Psychological Distress Among Ethiopian Pregnant Women During COVID-19: Negative Correlation with Self-Efficacy","Since the onset of coronavirus disease 2019, the mental health of individuals has been negatively affected, especially among vulnerable groups. The aim of this study was to explore the association of psychological distress with self-efficacy and other correlates among Ethiopian pregnant women. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 384 pregnant women from August 1 to 15, 2020. Pandemic-related psychological distress was measured by the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R). Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), generalized self-efficacy scale (GSES), and fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S) were employed to examine independent variables. A consecutive sampling technique was employed and the data were analyzed by SPSS version 23.0. Categorical variables were presented in terms of frequencies and percentages; and mean with SD was employed to express continuous variables. Multiple regressions were performed; and for statistical significance, p &lt; 0.05 and 95% CI were considered. The participants had 31.3 (SDÃ‚Â±7.7) mean age and those participants between the ages of 25-34 were dominant. The mean score of IES-R scale was 45.1 (Ã‚Â±17.4) indicating severe psychological distress. The IES-R mean score for primiparous women was significantly higher than the mean score of multiparous women. Psychological distress has a strong positive correlation with symptoms of anxiety, depression and fear of COVID-19. In contrast, a negative relationship was found between psychological distress and participants' self-efficacy. The results indicate that the current pandemic has imposed severe psychological distress among pregnant women. The presence of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and pandemic-related fears were identified as positive predictors. In contrast, better self-efficacy of the pregnant women was linked to lower psychological distress. For health-care professionals, broadening the focus and collaboration among service-delivering units are important in halting undesirable outcomes of the pandemic.","Dule","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S317961","20210716","COVID-19 fear; Ethiopia; anxiety; depression; mental well-beings","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16030,""

The objective of this study was to evaluate the responsiveness and validity of depression, anxiety and stress in a representative cohort of Hellenic military personnel using the short version of the Greek military version of the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) questionnaire. A total of 158 participants were voluntarily surveyed using an electronically developed structured questionnaire. The anonymous e-questionnaire included a social demographic section and the DASS-21 scale section. It was distributed in September 2020 to the military personnel of the Hellenic Tactical Air Force Units using an intranet network during government restrictive measures due to the COVID-19 crisis. Our DASS-21 survey indicated a positive outcome at the psychometric level of our military sample population. Age, sex and systemic medications were statistically correlated with anxiety. Inter-correlations between the DASS-21 statements showed that individuals with low-level depression also experienced some degree of stress. Factor analysis indicated the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. The low levels of depression and stress among our military sample population demonstrate the importance of periodic monitoring of the psychometric items of the DASS-21 subscales to design and implement psychological prevention strategies, especially during the ongoing and future healthcare crises.","Kotoulas, Karamanavis, Lambrou, Karanikas","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2021-001874","20210716","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16034,""
"Acute mental health presentations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","A number of community based surveys have identified an increase in psychological symptoms and distress but there has been no examination of symptoms at the more severe end of the mental health spectrum. We aimed to analyse numbers and types of psychiatric presentations to inform planning for future demand on mental health services in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed electronic data between January and April 2020 for 2534 patients referred to acute psychiatric services, and tested for differences in patient demographics, symptom severity and use of the Mental Health Act 1983 (MHA), before and after lockdown. We used interrupted time-series analyses to compare trends in emergency department and psychiatric presentations until December 2020. There were 22% fewer psychiatric presentations the first week and 48% fewer emergency department presentations in the first month after lockdown initiated. A higher proportion of patients were detained under the MHA (22.2 v. 16.1%) and Mental Capacity Act 2005 (2.2 v. 1.1%) (Ãâ€¡2(2) = 16.3, P &lt; 0.0001), and they experienced a longer duration of symptoms before seeking help from mental health services (Ãâ€¡2(3) = 18.6, P &lt; 0.0001).

"Fear and depression during the COVID-19 outbreak in Cameroon: a nation-wide observational study","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant psychological and social distress worldwide. We investigated fear and depression among adults in Cameroon during different phases of the COVID-19 outbreak. An online survey was conducted in Cameroon from June-December 2020 using a structured questionnaire. Socio-demographic data and information regarding COVID-19 history were obtained. Fear and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Fear of COVID-19 score (FCV-19S) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Responses were clustered in weeks to better appreciate their evolution over time. Overall, 7381 responses from all ten regions of Cameroon were analysed (median age: 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 73.3% male). The prevalence of depression (PHQ-9 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) was 8.4%, and that of high fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S scores Ã¢â€°Â¥19) was 57.4%. These rates were similar across genders, age-groups, and region of residence. While mean weekly PHQ-9 scores remained fairly stable throughout the study period (range: 2.53-3.21; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.101), mean FCV-19S scores were highest during the early weeks but decreased significantly thereafter (from 20.31 to 18.34; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that having a postgraduate degree, a history of quarantine, flu-like symptoms during the past 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days, and higher FCV-19S scores were associated with more severe depressive symptoms, while obtaining COVID-19 information from various sources reduced the odds for depression. Depression amidst the COVID-19 crisis is less prevalent in Cameroon than in other countries. Prompt and widespread dissemination of adequate COVID-19 information may reduce the risks for depression by dispelling fear and anxiety among Cameroonians.","Siewe Fodjo, Ngarka, Njamnshi, Nfor, Mengnjo, Mendo, Angwafor, Atchou Basseguin, Nkouonlack, Njit, Ahidjo, Chokote, Dema, Fonsah, Tatah, Palmer, Seke Etet, Palmer, Nsagha, Etya'ale, Perrig, Sztajzel, Annoni, Zoung-Kanyi Bissek, Leke, Abena Ondoa Obama, Nkengasong, Colebunders, Njamnshi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03323-x","20210716","COVID-19; Cameroon; Depression; FCV-19S; Fear; PHQ-9","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16036,""
"Perceived stress in different countries at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic","The coronavirus has spread around the world, causing an ongoing pandemic. After the lockdown and quarantine protocols, an evaluation of the population's current emotional state was made through a web-based survey available in both English and Spanish. The objective was to observe how respondents perceived stress and worry as a result of COVID-19. The survey gathered data across three sections: socio-demographic data, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) by Cohen, and additional queries on current worries and behaviors due to this pandemic. The survey received 1523 respondents from 48 countries. The mean of the PSS-10 score was 17.4 (SD 6.5). Significantly higher scores were observed among women, young adults, students, and those who expressed concern about getting infected and considered themselves high-risk. No significant differences were observed between health professionals and other professions. We describe an increase in stress levels due to the COVID-19 and point out groups at high risk. These findings could help to address the mental health care that is needed.","Gamonal-Limcaoco, Montero-Mateos, Lozano-LÃƒÂ³pez, MaciÃƒÂ¡-Casas, MatÃƒÂ­as-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Roncero","https://doi.org/10.1177/00912174211033710","20210716","COVID-19; PSS-10; coronavirus; pandemic; stress; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16037,""
"A closer look to the high burden of the psychiatric disorders among health care workers (HCWs) in Egypt during COVID-19 outbreak: A meta-analysis of 3137 HCWs","To study the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Egyptian health care workers (HCWs) during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. We searched six databases for relevant papers. The quality of the included articles was measured by The National Institute of Health quality assessment tool. We used the fixed-effect model if there is no heterogeneity and the random model if heterogeneity exists. After the screening of 197 records, we included 10 studies. Among all psychiatric disorders, anxiety was the most commonly reported psychiatric disorder among HCWs with a prevalence of 71.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 49.4-86.9), followed by stress, depression, and insomnia, 66.6% (95%CI: 47.6-81.3), 65.5% (95%CI: 46.9-80.3) and 57.9% (95%CI: 45.9-69.0), in order. Regarding severity according to the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items, the moderate form was the most common type of severity in depression 22.5% (95%CI: 19.8-25.5) and stress 14.5% (95%CI: 8.8-22.5), while very severe form was the most common type of severity reported in anxiety comorbidity 28.2% (95%CI: 3.8-79.6). The COVID-19 pandemic has an unfavorable effect on the Egyptian HCWs' psychological wellbeing. More psychological support and preventive measures should be.","El-Qushayri, Dahy, Reda, Mahmoud, Abdel Mageed, Kamel, Ghozy","https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2021045","20210715","COVID-19; Egypt; Health care workers; Mental health; Psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16038,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on postpartum contraception planning","The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid adjustment of obstetrical delivery models including fewer antenatal appointments and increased use of telehealth. We hypothesized that an increase in telemedicine and a decrease in antepartum visits owing to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decreased proportion of people with a postpartum contraception plan at the time of the birth-hospitalization admission and a reduced uptake of top-tier forms of contraception at birth-hospitalization admission and discharge, and the routine postpartum visit, which has otherwise been increasing in recent years.<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>2</sup> STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study comparing a randomly selected sample of people giving birth at a large, tertiary referral center during a regional ""shelter in place"" order, March 16, 2020, to July 31, 2020, with a previously abstracted random sample of people delivering between November 1, 2017, and April 30, 2018, was conducted. This study was reviewed and approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board before its initiation. The study was powered to detect a 10% difference in the proportion of those arriving at birth-hospitalization with a contraceptive plan (power 80%, alpha 0.05). The final sample size included 586 people (318 in the pre-COVID cohort and 268 in the COVID cohort). Multivariable modified Poisson regression model was used to estimate the relative risk of arriving at birth-hospitalization with a contraceptive plan in pre-COVID vs COVID cohorts, adjusting for age, parity, insurance status, and delivery mode. Secondary outcomes included tier of contraception plan at admission, discharge, and 6 weeks postpartum (classified by World Health Organization Tiered-Effectiveness<sup>3</sup>), attendance at postpartum visit, and whether the postpartum visit was conducted via telehealth. Tiered effectiveness was used for this study's purposes because it was hypothesized that telehealth would mostly affect the provision of top-tier forms of contraception that require in-person initiation. Fisher exact test was used to compare the secondary outcomes. For the 2 cohorts, the median age was 32 years (range, 17-48 years) and median parity was 1 (range, 0-6). The majority (78%) had private insurance and most commonly identified as non-Hispanic White (38%) and Asian (36%). Baseline demographics did not differ between the cohorts. At birth-hospitalization admission, a smaller proportion of people had a postpartum contraceptive plan in the COVID cohort than in the pre-COVID cohort (73.9% vs 99.4%, adjusted risk ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.91, P&lt;.001). A smaller proportion of people had a plan for top-tier contraception among the COVID cohort compared with the pre-COVID cohort at both admission and discharge (46.0% vs 71.0%, P&lt;.01 and 31.0% vs 37.9%, P=.05) (Figure). More than 80% of the people attended a routine postpartum visit in both cohorts (P=.30) with 17.7% being telehealth visits in the COVID cohort compared with telehealth not being offered pre-COVID. Among those who attended their postpartum visit, the proportion discharged with a plan for interval top-tier contraception that was fulfilled was high in both groups (76.3% pre-COVID vs 71.2% post-COVID, P=.56). The study found a significant decrease in people arriving at birth-hospitalization with a contraception plan in the months following a COVID-19 ""shelter in place"" order when compared with the pre-COVID cohort. It is suspected that changes in the obstetrical service models indirectly deprioritized the most effective forms of postpartum contraception because sterilization requires a signed consent before birth-hospitalization and postplacental intrauterine devices require consent before delivery.<sup>4</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>5</sup> Current state legislation requiring in-person signature to consent for federally funded sterilization remains a barrier. We found that fewer individuals left with top-tier contraception than with plan on admission, especially within the COVID cohort. In addition to clinical contraindications that arise during labor, which preclude placement of an intrauterine device in the postpartum setting, many patients requested an expedited discharge during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the prenatal care model continues, this transition to adopt virtual visits, reduce visit schedules, and expedite postpartum discharge, actualizing patients' contraceptive plans is increasingly more dependent on early inpatient provision. Maternity care providers should consider initiating postpartum contraception counseling and completing mandatory consents earlier in the antenatal period. This study is inherently limited by its retrospective nature of review and additional qualitative studies may better characterize this trend in contraceptive uptake. In the meantime, obstetrical care providers should carefully evaluate institutional barriers to postpartum contraception during this movement to telehealth.","Miller, Henkel, Leonard, Miller, Tran, Bianco, Shaw","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100412","20210716","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16039,""
"The impact of physical activity on psychological well-being and perceived health status during coronavirus pandemic in university students","Objectives To investigate changes in moderate and vigorous physical activity (PA), and find correlation with psychological well-being and perceived health status in university students prior to versus 4â€“6 weeks following the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic Methods Registered students to the 2020/2021 academic year participated in an online survey representing four Hungarian universities in the framework of â€œCOVID-19 International Student Well-being Studyâ€ project. Moderate and vigorous PA were measured with a single question, psychological well-being was evaluated using the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D) short form and perceived health status on the 11-point Cantril ladder respectively. Statistical analyses were calculated using SPSS 26.0 software Results A total of 2779 Hungarian citizen students completed the questionnaire and 2162 (27.7% males) provided full information on PA. Mean age was 24.52 (SD = 7.15) years. A significant decrease was observed in moderate PA prior to and during social isolation (Z = -14.956; p < .001). Students mean well-being was 10.23, SD = 5.28)/32. After analyzing changes (decreased, unchanged, increased) of PA in the context of well-being, it was found students with reduced PA had significantly less favorable scores on well-being scale than students who unchanged or increased their PA level, both in moderate (F = 32.35; p < .001) and vigorous (F = 21.44; p < .001) PA. Regarding the perceived health status there was significant reduction during the pandemic (M = 7.58, SD = 2.19) compared to the preceding period (M = 7.94, SD = 1.85; p < .001). This reduction was most notable in the group that reduced PA Conclusions The closure of universities and sport facilities unfavorably influenced the studentsâ€™ previous PA level. Based on the result, there is a negative relationship between PA and psychological wellbeing also between PA and perceived health status. Universities may pay more attention to keep their students physically active even during a pandemic as it may be far from being over yet.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101531","20210901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-17","",16040,""
