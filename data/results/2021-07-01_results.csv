"Temporal trends in primary care-recorded self-harm during and beyond the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: time series analysis of electronic healthcare records for 28 million patients in the Greater Manchester Care Record","BackgroundSurveillance of clinically treated self-harm episode frequency is an important component of suicide prevention in the dynamic context of COVID-19. Studies published to date have investigated the initial months following the onset of the pandemic, despite national and regional restrictions persisting to Summer 2021.

MethodsWe conducted a descriptive time series analysis utilising data from the Greater Manchester Care Record, which contains de-identified, primary care health records of 2.8 million patients. Counts of incident and all episodes of self-harm recorded between 1st January 2019 and 31st May 2021 were made for all patients, with stratification by sex, age group, ethnicity, and index of multiple deprivation (IMD) quintile and examination of overall differences by national and regional restriction phases.

FindingsBetween 1st January 2019 and 31st May 2021, 33,444 episodes of self-harm by 13,148 individuals were recorded. Frequency ratios of incident and all episodes of self-harm were 0.59 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.69) and 0.69 (CI 0.63 to 0.75) respectively in April 2020 compared to February 2020. Between August 2020 and May 2021 frequency ratios were 0.92 (CI 0.88 to 0.96) for incident episodes and 0.86 (CI 0.84 to 0.88) for all episodes compared to the same months in 2019. Reductions were largest among men and people living in the most deprived neighbourhoods. An increase in all-episode self-harm (frequency ratio 1.09, CI 1.03 to 1.16) was observed for adolescents aged 10-17 between August 2020 and May 2021.

InterpretationThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a sustained impact on help seeking for self-harm. Reductions in primary care recorded self-harm have implications for clinicians ability to assess the needs and risks of individuals. Some patients may be experiencing prolonged untreated deterioration in their mental health while other groups are presenting in higher numbers. Our findings have important implications for primary care and mental health services in manging ongoing demand.

"A systematic review of persistent symptoms and residual abnormal functioning following acute COVID-19: Ongoing symptomatic phase vs post-COVID-19 syndrome","Objective | To compare the two phases of long COVID, namely ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 (OSC; signs and symptoms from 4 to 12 weeks from initial infection) and post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS; signs and symptoms beyond 12 weeks) with respect to symptomatology, abnormal functioning, psychological burden, and quality of life. Design | Systematic review. Data Sources | Electronic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, ProQuest Coronavirus Research Database, LitCOVID, and Google Scholar between January and April 2021, and manual search for relevant citations from review articles. Eligibility Criteria | Cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, randomised control trials, and case-control studies with participant data concerning long COVID symptomatology or abnormal functioning. Data Extraction | Studies were screened and assessed for risk of bias by two independent reviewers, with conflicts resolved with a third reviewer. The AXIS tool was utilised to appraise the quality of the evidence. Data were extracted and collated using a data extraction tool in Microsoft Excel. Results | Of the 1,145 studies screened, 39 were included, all describing adult cohorts with long COVID and sample sizes ranging from 32 to 1,733. Studies included data pertaining to symptomatology, pulmonary functioning, chest imaging, cognitive functioning, psychological disorder, and/or quality of life. Fatigue presented as the most prevalent symptom during both OSC and PCS at 43% and 44%, respectively. Sleep disorder (36%; 33%), dyspnoea (31%; 40%), and cough (26%; 22%) followed in prevalence. Abnormal spirometry (FEV1 <80% predicted) was observed in 15% and 11%, and abnormal chest imaging observed in 34% and 28%, respectively. Cognitive impairments were also evident (20%; 15%), as well as anxiety (28%; 34%) and depression (25%; 32%). Decreased quality of life was reported by 40% of patients with OSC and 57% by those with PCS. Conclusions | The prevalences of OSC and PCS were highly variable. Reported symptoms covered a wide range of body systems, with general overlap in frequencies between the two phases. However, abnormalities in lung function and imaging seemed to be more common in OSC, whilst anxiety, depression, and poor quality of life seemed more frequent in PCS. In general, the quality of the evidence was moderate and further research is needed to better understand the complex interplay of somatic versus psychosocial drivers in long COVID.

"Psychosocial and lifestyle predictors of distress and well-being in people with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic","People with mental illness may be vulnerable to psychological distress and reduced well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess psychosocial and lifestyle predictors of distress and well-being in people with mental illness during the pandemic. People with mental illness who participated in an exercise programme prior to the pandemic were invited to complete surveys about mental health and lifestyle corresponding to before and during the pandemic. Social support reduced, alcohol intake increased, and sleep quality and diet worsened during the pandemic, contributing to distress. Psychological distress was associated with the two or more mental illnesses, and negatively associated with having a physical disease. Better diet appeared to protect against increases in distress; loneliness hindered improvements in well-being. Healthy lifestyle programmes designed to improve social connection may improve health for people with mental illnesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chapman, Malacova, Patterson, Reavley, Wyder, Brown, Hielscher, Childs, Scott","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211025040","20210630","Social determinants; lifestyle behaviours; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15515,""
"What can neuroimmunology teach us about the symptoms of long-COVID?","Long-Coronavirus Disease (Long-COVID) is becoming increasingly recognized due to the persistence of symptoms such as profound fatigue, neurocognitive difficulties, muscle pains and weaknesses and depression, which would last beyond 3-12 weeks following infection with SARS-CoV-2. These particular symptoms have been extensively observed and studied in the context of previous psychoneuroimmunology research. In this short commentary, we discuss how previous neuroimmunology studies could help us to better understand pathways behind the development of these prolonged symptoms. Various mechanisms, including viral neuroinvasion, glial cells activation, neurogenesis, oxidative stress have been shown to explain these symptoms in the context of other disorders. Previous neuroimmunology findings could represent helpful pointers for future research on long-COVID symptoms and suggest potential management strategies for patients suffering with long-COVID.","Mondelli, Pariante","https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfimm/iqab004","20210630","COVID-19; depression; fatigue; long-COVID; microglia; neuroimmunology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15516,""
"Prevalence and dynamic features of psychological issues among Chinese healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed tremendous pressure on healthcare workers who are at the frontline in the battle against it, causing various forms of psychological distress. To outline the prevalence and dynamic changing features of medical workers' psychological issues and to review the related national policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. We systematically searched for studies on the psychological states of Chinese medical staff from 1 January 2020 to 8 May 2020. The aggregate prevalence of each psychological issue was calculated and plotted to observe the changes over time. Policies on psychological support for medical staff during the pandemic were reviewed to explore their link to the prevalence of psychological problems. In total, 26 studies were included in this study. A total of 22Ã¢â‚¬â€°062 medical workers were surveyed from 31 January to 27 February 2020. Medical staff exhibited a substantial prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, stress-related symptoms and sleep problems during the survey period, with aggregate prevalence rates of 27.0%, 26.2%, 42.1% and 34.5%, respectively. Cumulative meta-analyses revealed that the prevalence of psychological distress peaked at the beginning of the pandemic and subsequently exhibited a slow downward trend. Chinese medical staff displayed significant psychological disturbance during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was especially severe at the early stage. Implementing supportive policies may help alleviate ongoing psychological problems in healthcare workers.","Zhang, Li, Li, Zhang, Luo, Zhu, Wu, Zhu, Xu, Wang, Li","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100344","20210630","anxiety; mental health; prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15517,""

"How psychiatrists coordinate treatment for COVID-19: a retrospective study and experience from China","Patients with COVID-19 are at high risk of developing mental health problems; however, the prevalence and management of mental disorders and how psychiatrists coordinate the treatment are unclear. We aimed to investigate the mental health problems of patients infected with COVID-19 and to identify the role of psychiatrists in the clinical treatment team during the pandemic. We also share the experience of psychiatric consultations of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China. We analysed data from the psychiatric medical records of 329 patients with COVID-19 in the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from 20 January to 8 March 2020. We collected information including sociodemographic characteristics, whether patients received psychiatric consultation, mental health symptoms, psychiatric diagnoses, psychiatric treatments and severity level of COVID-19. Psychiatric consultations were received by 84 (25.5%) patients with COVID-19. The most common symptoms of mental health problems were sleep disorders (75%), anxiety (58.3%) and depressive symptoms (11.9%). The psychiatric consultation rate was highest in critically ill patients (69.2%), with affective symptoms or disturbed behaviour as their main mental health problems. Psychiatric diagnoses for patients who received consultation included acute stress reaction (39.3%), sleep disorders (33.3%), anxiety (15.5%), depression (7.1%) and delirium (4.8%). In terms of psychiatric treatments, 86.9% of patients who received psychiatric consultation were treated with psychotropic medications, including non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agents (54.8%), antidepressants (26.2%), benzodiazepines (22.6%) and antipsychotics (10.7%). Among the 76 patients who were discharged from the hospital, 79% had recovered from mental health problems and were not prescribed any psychotropic medications. The symptoms of the remaining 21% of patients had improved and they were prescribed medications to continue the treatment. This is the first study to report psychiatric consultations for patients with COVID-19. Our study indicated that a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19, especially critically ill cases, experienced mental health problems. Given the remarkable effect of psychiatric treatments, we recommend that psychiatrists be timely and actively involved in the treatment of COVID-19.","Yue, Wang, Ju, Zhu, Chen, Shi, Shi, Chen, Shen","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100272","20210630","crisis intervention; mental health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15519,""

"Closing schools for SARS-CoV-2: a pragmatic rapid recommendation","In Belgium, schools closed during the first lockdown in March 2020, with a partial reopening in May. They fully reopened in September. During the summer, infections started to increase in the general population, speeding up in September. Some measures were taken to limit social contacts but those were insufficient to mitigate the exponential rise of infections in October. Children were still receiving all lessons at school at that time and it was questioned whether this position was tenable. We systematically compared the benefits and harms of closing primary and secondary schools and developed a recommendation. A multidisciplinary panel, including school pupils and teachers, educational experts, clinicians and researchers, produced this recommendation in compliance with the standards for trustworthy rapid guidelines. The recommendation is based on data collected through national surveillance or studies from Belgium, and supported by a rapid literature review. Closing schools during the first lockdown probably resulted in a large learning delay and possibly led to more cases of child abuse. We are uncertain about the effect on the infection rate, hospitalisations, transmission rates, mental health of children, teachers and parents. The panel concluded that the balance of benefits and harms of closing schools clearly shifts against closing schools. Detrimental effects are even worse for vulnerable children. This recommendation is affected by the local virus circulation. The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against closing schools when the virus circulation is low to moderate, and a weak recommendation against closing schools when the virus circulation is high. It does not apply when the school system cannot function due to lack of teachers, too many children who are at home or a shortage of support services. As the results of international studies are consistent with Belgian study results, this recommendation may also be relevant internationally.","Bekkering, Delvaux, Vankrunkelsven, Toelen, Aertgeerts, Crommen, Bruyckere, Devisch, Lernout, Masschalck, Milissen, Molenberghs, Pascal, Plomteux, Raes, Rans, Seghers, Sweldens, Vandenbussche, Vanham, Wollants, Aertgeerts","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2020-000971","20210630","COVID-19; adolescent health; epidemiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15521,""
"Public health considerations regarding golf during the COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review","Golf is a sport played worldwide by &gt;60Ã¢â‚¬â€°million people from a variety of backgrounds and abilities. Golf's contribution to physical and mental health benefits are becoming increasingly recognised. Countries have adopted a range of restrictions to playing golf during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this narrative review was to (1) explore the literature related to the possible health benefits and risks of playing golf during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) provide recommendations on golf-related activity from the relevant available literature. Golf can provide health-enhancing physical activity. Regular physical activity is associated with physical/mental health, immune system and longevity benefits. Sense of belonging and life satisfaction significantly improved when golfing restrictions were relaxed after the first lockdown in the UK. Golf is an outdoor sport, where social distancing is possible, and if rules are followed, risk of COVID-19 transmission is likely to be low. Policy-makers and governing bodies should support the promotion of golf because participation brings wide ranging benefits for physical health and mental well-being. When effective risk reduction measures are used, the benefits of playing golf in most circumstances outweigh the risk of transmission.","Robinson, Foster, Murray","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsem-2021-001089","20210630","COVID-19; golf; health promotion; physical activity; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15522,""
"Teacher stress, anxiety and depression at the beginning of the academic year during the COVID-19 pandemic","Faced with the situation of COVID-19, teachers are dealing with new measures, insecurity and a lack of clear guidelines. The aim of this study is to analyse the levels of stress, anxiety and depression of teachers in the north of Spain. This study was conducted with 1633 teachers from the Department of Education of the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC) and Navarre, all of whom are professionals working in various educational centres, from nursery education to university studies, with an average age of 42 years (<i>M</i> = 42.02; s.d. = 10.40). The Spanish version of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 was used. The results show that a high percentage of teachers have symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. Women show significantly more symptoms of stress and anxiety than men, those who have children have more depressive symptoms than those who do not, and people with chronic pathology or those who live with others with chronic pathology have more stress, anxiety and depression. This study indicates the importance of attending to the mental health of teachers, particularly women, those who have children, and those who have a chronic pathology or a family member with a chronic pathology.","SantamarÃƒÂ­a, Mondragon, Santxo, Ozamiz-Etxebarria","https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2021.14","20210630","Age; COVID-19; anxiety; chronic disease; depression; education; gender; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15523,""
"Clinical Trial Drug Safety Assessment for Studies and Submissions Impacted by COVID-19","<b><i>Abstract-</i>In this article, we provide guidance on how safety analyses and reporting of clinical trial safety data may need to be modified, given potential impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact could include missed visits, alternative methods for assessments (such as virtual visits), alternative locations for assessments (such as local labs), and study drug interruptions. Starting from the safety analyses typically included in Clinical Study Reports for Phase 2-4 clinical trials and integrated submission documents, we assess what modifications might be needed. If the impact from COVID-19 affects treatment arms equally, analyses of adverse events from controlled data can, to a large extent, remain unchanged. However, interpretation of summaries from uncontrolled data (summaries that include open-label extension data) will require even more caution than usual. Special consideration will be needed for safety topics of interest, especially events expected to have a higher incidence due to a COVID-19 infection or due to quarantine or travel restrictions (e.g., depression). Analyses of laboratory measurements may need to be modified to account for the combination of measurements from local and central laboratories.</b>","Nilsson, Crowe, Anglin, Ball, Munsaka, Shahin, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1080/19466315.2020.1804444","20210630","COVID-19; Clinical trial; Coronavirus; Harms; Safety analysis; Safety review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15524,""
"Evaluating the association between COVID-19 and psychiatric presentations, suicidal ideation in an emergency department","To estimate the association between COVID-19 and Emergency Department (ED) psychiatric presentations, including suicidal ideation. Using an interrupted time series design, we analyzed psychiatric presentations using electronic health record data in an academic medical center ED between 2018 and 2020. We used regression models to assess the association between the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak and certain psychiatric presentations. The period February 26-March 6, 2020 was used to define patterns in psychiatric presentations before and after the coronavirus outbreak. We found a 36.2% decrease (unadjusted) in ED psychiatric consults following the coronavirus outbreak, as compared to the previous year. After accounting for underlying trends, our results estimate significant differential change associated with suicidal ideation and substance use disorder (SUD) presentations following the outbreak. Specifically, we noted a significant differential increase in presentations with suicidal ideation six weeks after the outbreak (36.4 percentage points change; 95% CI: 5.3, 67.6). For presentations with SUD, we found a differential increase in the COVID-19 time series relative to the comparison time series at all post-outbreak time points and this differential increase was significant three weeks (32.8 percentage points; 95% CI: 4.0, 61.6) following the outbreak. Our results estimate no differential changes significant at the P value &lt; 0.05 level associated with affective disorder or psychotic disorder presentations in the COVID-19 time series relative to the comparator time series.

"Mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: a study of medical residency training over the years","This study aims to assess the symptoms of burnout, depression, and anxiety in Brazilian medical residents during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare residents' beliefs and clinical practices related to COVID-19 patients among all six years of medical residency training in Brazil. A quantitative study was conducted in April 2020 with a convenience sample of medical resident volunteers from an anonymous online survey. This investigation collected sociodemographic information and used the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) to measure burnout, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to measure depression, and the General Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7) to measure generalized anxiety disorder. This study also developed a COVID-19 Impact Questionnaire (CIQ-19) to assess the residents' beliefs and clinical practices related to COVID-19 patients. Our sample comprised 3071 respondents. Depressive symptoms were the most common among second-year residents (70.5%), followed by anxiety symptoms (56.0%) and burnout (55.2%) among fourth-year residents. We also observed burnout symptoms (55.1%) among second-year residents. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the risk of mental illnesses in some years of residency.

"[The social factors increasing healthy life longevity (according sociological surveys materials)]","The article discusses the main social factors that can positively effect on increasing the longevity of healthy life in the elderly. The main principles are based on the results of applied studies carried out by the authors in Moscow, Kursk, Velikiy Novgorod and Simferopol in 2019-2020. The respondents were both the elderly themselves and the specialists providing them social services support. The emphasis is made on the factors of healthy lifestyle of the elderly and first of all on feasible physical activity and productive creative activity. The considerable attention was paid to internal resources of the elderly person (general condition of physical and mental health and ability to maintain it, capacity for self-care and physical activity, positive frame of mind, personal persuasion in the need to properly use the opportunities available to elderly people). The following external factors are distinguish - constructive relationship with closest relatives, development of infrastructure for leisure activities, physical exercises and sport activities, accessibility for the retired of health care institutions. Among the means of maintaining active and healthy longevity of the elderly are marked informing about possibilities of using their potentials, appropriate consultations, provision of technical means of rehabilitation, involvement into constructive activities, giving positive examples and persuasion. The importance of individual approach to each retired is emphasized, taking into account their physical capabilities, health status and chronic diseases.

"A Membrane-Targeting Photosensitizer with Aggregation-Induced Emission Characteristics for Highly Efficient Photodynamic Combat of Human Coronaviruses","COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has resulted in global social and economic disruption, putting the world economy to the largest global recession since the Great Depression. To control the spread of COVID-19, cutting off the transmission route is a critical step. In this work, the efficient inactivation of human coronavirus with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by employing photosensitizers with aggregation-induced emission characteristics (DTTPB) is reported. DTTPB is designed to bear a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails, mimicking the structure of phospholipids on biological membranes. DTTPB demonstrates a broad absorption band covering the whole visible light range and high molar absorptivity, as well as excellent reactive oxygen species sensitizing ability, making it an excellent candidate for PDT. Besides, DTTPB can target membrane structure, and bind to the envelope of human coronaviruses. Upon light irradiation, DTTPB demonstrates highly effective antiviral behavior: human coronavirus treated with DTTPB and white-light irradiation can be efficiently inactivated with complete loss of infectivity, as revealed by the significant decrease of virus RNA and proteins in host cells. Thus, DTTPB sensitized PDT can efficiently prevent the infection and the spread of human coronavirus, which provides a new avenue for photodynamic combating of COVID-19.","Wu, Gu, Leung, Li, Yuan, Shen, Wang, Zhao, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202101770","20210630","aggregation-induced emission; human coronaviruses; membrane targeting; photodynamic therapy; photosensitizers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15534,""

"Experiences of Persons With Serious Mental Illness During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to characterize the experiences of persons with serious mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adults with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, or no psychiatric disorder (N=195) were interviewed between July 2020 and January 2021. All were previously enrolled in a cohort study. The interviews focused on mental distress and suicidal thoughts, the impact of the pandemic and pandemic-related worries, tobacco and alcohol use, and access to care. Responses of persons with serious mental illness were compared with responses of those without a psychiatric disorder by using multivariate ordered logistic regression analyses. For a subset of participants, responses about suicidal ideation were compared with their responses prior to the pandemic. Compared with participants with no psychiatric disorder, individuals with schizophrenia were more likely to endorse that they felt overwhelmed or anxious, had difficulty concentrating, or were concerned about medical bills and having enough food; they also reported significantly increased tobacco smoking. Individuals with bipolar disorder also reported more COVID-19-related worries than did participants without a psychiatric disorder. Overall, those with a psychiatric disorder reported more frequent mental distress and more recent missed medical visits and medications than did those with no psychiatric disorder. However, participants with serious mental illness did not report a higher rate of suicidal thoughts compared with their prepandemic responses. The pandemic poses significant challenges to individuals with serious mental illness in terms of COVID-19-related distress. Psychiatric services should proactively address the emotional distress and worries associated with the pandemic.","Dickerson, Katsafanas, Newman, Origoni, Rowe, Squire, Ziemann, Khushalani, Yolken","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100130","20210630","Public health; Schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; depression; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15537,""

Therefore, temporal associations among loneliness, anxiety, and depression and gender differences in these associations were examined in a longitudinal study during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The loneliness, anxiety, and depression levels of 458 university students were evaluated at three timepoints (T1, T2, and T3) during the COVID-19 pandemic period in China. The timepoints were separated by 1 month. Cross-lagged panel designs were used to examine reciprocal associations among loneliness, anxiety, and depression as well as the stability and gender differences of these associations. Cross-lagged panel analysis revealed that T1 depression positively predicted T2 anxiety and loneliness, T1 loneliness positively predicted T2 depression, T2 anxiety positively predicted T3 depression, T2 depression positively predicted T3 anxiety and loneliness, T2 loneliness positively predicted T3 depression, and T1 loneliness positively predicted T3 anxiety through the mediating role of T2 depression. No gender differences were observed in the cross-lagged associations. During the COVID-19 pandemic period, loneliness and depression predicted each other across time, and loneliness predicted anxiety across time, mediated by depression. No gender differences were observed in the cross-lagged associations among loneliness, anxiety, and depression. This article is protected by copyright.

"Appraisal and coping predict health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: An international approach","COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on people worldwide. We conducted an international survey (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3646) examining the degree to which people's appraisals and coping activities around the pandemic predicted their health and well-being. We obtained subsamples from 12 countries-Bangladesh, Bulgaria, China, Colombia, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Turkey and the United States. For each, we assessed appraisals and coping strategies as well as indicators of physical and mental health and well-being. Results indicated that, despite mean-level societal differences in outcomes, the pattern of appraisals and coping strategies predicting health and well-being was consistent across countries. Use of disengagement coping (particularly behavioural disengagement and self-isolation) was associated with relatively negative outcomes. In contrast, optimistic appraisals (particularly of high accommodation-focused coping potential and the ability to meet one's physical needs), use of problem-focused coping strategies (especially problem-solving) and accommodative coping strategies (especially positive reappraisal and self-encouragement) were associated with relatively positive outcomes. Our study highlights the critical importance of considering accommodative coping in stress and coping research.

"Moderating Roles of Resilience and Social Support on Psychiatric and Practice Outcomes in Nurses Working During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Staff and equipment shortages and an easily transmissible virus make working in the COVID-19 pandemic demanding physically and psychologically. Nurses on the frontlines are particularly vulnerable to the adversity of working under these conditions, particularly with regard to mental health. Thus, understanding risk and protective factors for this vulnerable and essential group is critical for identifying potential targets of interventions. We had two aims for the current study: (a) to examine work functioning and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress (PTSD) among nurses who did and did not care for patients with COVID-19; and (b) to determine if resilience and social support moderate these relationships. For three weeks in July 2020, nurses across the United States were invited to participate in an online survey collecting data on demographics, resilience, social support, and screening measures of depression, PTSD, anxiety, and distracted practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression for each outcome measure. Our findings support a growing body of research reporting that nurses are experiencing mental health sequelae during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those providing direct care to patients with the virus. We found that compared to nurses who did not care for patients with COVID-19, those who did reported increased symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. A novel contribution is our finding that nurses providing direct COVID-19 care also experienced increased levels of distracted practice, a behavioral measure of distraction linking to a potential impact on patient care. We also found that resilience and social support acted as moderators of some of these relationships. Fostering resilience and social support may help buffer the effects of providing care to patients with COVID-19 and could potentially decrease nurse vulnerability to developing psychological symptoms and impairment on the job.","Schierberl Scherr, Ayotte, Kellogg","https://doi.org/10.1177/23779608211024213","20210630","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; nurses; pandemic; posttraumatic stress disorder; resilience; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15545,""

Responses revealed that 46% of children spent more time alone during the pandemic, 36.9% had changes in sleep, 25.6% had little pleasure in doing things, and 32.5% were unhappy or sad. 66.2% were able to make new visits during the pandemic, however, 20.1% missed their child's doctors' visits for reasons including clinic cancellations and fear of entering a healthcare setting. <i>Conclusions</i>. The results of this survey demonstrate significant mental health concerns among our pediatric population as approximately 1/3 of families reported changes in behavior or mental health. As school closures persist in response to the ongoing pandemic and social interactions remain limited, it is imperative that pediatricians screen for depression, behavioral problems and other mental health concerns and offer families help to identify appropriate community mental health resources.","Raheja, Pitman-Hunt, Haidar, Gjorgjevska, Leja","https://doi.org/10.1177/2333794X211026190","20210630","COVID-19; pandemic; pediatric mental health; school; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15546,""
"Bilateral phrenic nerve block as an effective means of controlling inspiratory efforts in a COVID-19 patient","Bilateral continuous phrenic nerve block effectively regulates refractory persistent, strong inspiratory effort in a patient with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A 73-year-old man with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) was stopped due to uncontrollable strong inspiratory efforts and worsened lung injury. We performed bilateral continuous phrenic nerve block, which suppressed inspiratory efforts, resulting in lung injury improvement.

"The first life skills intervention to enhance well-being amongst university students in the Arab world: 'Khotwa' pilot study","Although Life Skills programs showed to improve the psychological and physical wellbeing of individuals, little attention has been paid, worldwide and in the Arab countries in specific to implementing life skills intervention for university students. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of a life skills based health promotion intervention KHOTWA (STEP) in enhancing the wellbeing of university students in Lebanon, a country that faces economic and political instability. This is a quasi-experimental study, with pre and post-test, intervention-control design. Each group was formed of 78 participants studying in a private university in Lebanon. Mixed design was used to address the process and outcomes objectives of the intervention. The program was carried online due to COVID-19 pandemic. Significant differences were observed between the intervention and the control groups for life skills, dietary habits and mental health scores at the 3-month follow-up. For the intervention group, a significant increase was observed in the mean score of each of the following Life Skills subscales: self-care (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), work and study (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.013), career and education planning (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011) and looking forward/goal settings (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Students also achieved a healthier eating habit compared to those in the control group by decreasing their consumption of processed food. There was no significant effect in terms of body mass index (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.827). Also, there was a significant change in the mental health status (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.012) only in the intervention group as its mean score decreased after 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of the intervention implementation. This intervention enhances the mental health and promotes healthy habits leading consequently to a better quality of life and more productivity amongst university students. Therefore, such interventions should be replicated in other similar context to improve university students' well-being.","Maddah, Saab, Safadi, Abi Farraj, Hassan, Turner, Echeverri, Alami, Kababian-Khasholian, Salameh","https://doi.org/10.1177/20551029211016955","20210630","BMI; anxiety; eating behaviour; health behaviour; health promotion; mental illness; well-being; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15548,""

"Validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the insomnia catastrophizing scale","Insomnia catastrophizing has attracted attention in recent years. Individuals may have started to recognize the importance of evaluating the consequences of insomnia, which has worsened during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present study aimed to test the validity and reliability of the Insomnia Catastrophizing Scale (ICS) in the Turkish young adult population. The study group consisted of a total of 387 participants: 57 in the pilot study and 330 in the main study. The majority of the participants in the study were females. According to the results of the confirmatory factor analysis, the single-factor structures of the ICS nighttime and daytime forms were confirmed to be the same as in the original structure, and the fit indices were above the acceptable limits. The ICS forms had very high reliability. The findings of the present study showed that the Turkish daytime and nighttime forms of the ICS are valid and reliable instruments. The results provide a means of measuring insomnia catastrophizing for use in therapeutic and counseling settings for Turkish young adult population. We also propose that mental health practitioners should design interventions to reduce insomnia catastrophizing in Turkish culture.

A total of 385 individuals under quarantine for 14 days between the dates of April 20-May 21, 2020 were included in the study. The data were collected using a socio-demographic data form (age, gender, employment status, having sleep disorder, duration of television review and Internet use, etc.), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Guilt Scale (GS) after the participants were informed about the study objective and they signed the informed consent form. A total of 385 participants, 84 of whom were women, with a mean age of 35.32Ã‚Â±11.7 were included in the study. According to BAI and BDI, 14.5% of the participants had anxiety and 17.1% had depression symptoms. The regression analysis found that female gender, having sleep disorder, using Internet for 8 hours or more and having chronic illness were risk factors for anxiety; while female gender, being aged 18-30, having sleep disorder, having psychiatric illness, and using Internet for 8 hours or more were risk factors for depression. The state guilt did not show any significant correlation with any socio-demographic factor. Female gender, being young, having a history of psychiatric illness, having chronic illness, having sleep disorder, using Internet for 8 hours or more were found to be risk factors for more anxiety and depression symptoms. It is important to educate people about the methods of how to maintain healthy sleep during quarantine, to effectively fight against the excessive circulation of misinformation and to provide sufficient medical care to those with psychiatric and chronic diseases, being more vulnerable against infections.","KoÃƒÂ§, Tok, Uzun, Ensari","https://doi.org/10.29399/npa.27329","20210630","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; feeling of guilt; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15551,""
"The Psychological Impacts During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Outbreak, and its Associated Factors Among Pastoral Community in West Omo Zone, South-West Ethiopia, 2020: A Community-Based Study","COVID-19 is a global pandemic and a major health crisis affecting several nations. Such outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences to any group of the population. Despite its negative effects, no study has addressed the potential psychological impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak among the pastoral community. This study aims to assess psychological experiences during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak and the factors that contributed to it among pastoral community residents in West Omo, South-West Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out from May to June 2020. The study subjects were selected through a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews, and entered into EpiData 3.1, then exported to SPSS version 24 for statistical analysis. The psychological impact was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). P-value &lt; 0.20 during bi-variable analysis was considered as a candidate for multivariable logistic regression. Independent factors of depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence level s at P-value &lt; 0.05 cut-off point. A total of 845 eligible pastoral residents were interviewed, with a 94.4% response rate. The prevalence of a positive response for anxiety, depression and stress was 30.8%, 26.3% and 24.4%, respectively. Being female was highly associated with developing anxiety and depression. Anxiety was found to be three times more prevalent among the respondents with Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 family members. Furthermore, participants with a history of mental illness, poor social support, and a high perceived life threat were also at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety, depression, and stress. The prevalence of positive depression, anxiety and stress results were high. As a result, special attention should be paid, by governmental and non-governmental health organizations, to psychosocial and mental health programs for pastoral residentsduring the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shifera, Mesafint, Sayih, Yilak, Molla, Yosef, Matiyas","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S309194","20210630","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; outbreak; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15552,""
"Global Change in Interest toward Yoga for Mental Health Ailments during Coronavirus Disease-19 Pandemic: A Google Trend Analysis","With coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, society is gripped with uncertainty and fear, inclining them toward Yoga to prevent mental health issues. Google Trends (GT) depicts the public interest of the community which may vary due to evolving policy dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim was to study global public interest in Yoga for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Global time trends were obtained for Yoga, Anxiety, and Depression from November 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020 using GT. The time series analysis was done in three different time periods - pre-COVID-19 phase, transition period, and COVID-19 pandemic phase. Cross-correlation, Spearman rho, Friedman ANOVA test, and forecasting were used for analysis. GT found a global change in the search queries for Yoga, anxiety, and depression during the three time periods. High burden COVID-19 countries - Italy, Spain, Russia, and Brazil had an increasing search trend for Yoga. During the COVID-19 phase, there was a significant positive correlation between the search trends of Yoga with depression (<i>r</i> = 0.232; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and anxiety (<i>r</i> = 0.351; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), but higher anxiety and depression searches lead to lower Yoga searches at lag +6. Forecast projected a continuous increase in Yoga searches and anxiety queries. Google Trends captured a significant rise in interest of Yoga among the global community but diminished with time.

"Community service sector resilience and responsiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic: The Australian experience","The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health, economic and social crisis that is likely to have lasting consequences, including increased rates of financial hardship, housing insecurity, mental health problems, substance abuse and domestic violence. Workers in the community service sector have continued to support some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged Australians during the pandemic, while also delivering services to new groups experiencing the economic impacts of virus suppression strategies. We surveyed community service sector workers from across Australia in three snapshots during April-May 2020 and found that perceptions of acute needs and organisational pressure points shifted even through this short period. While the sector faced significant challenges, it responded to the initial phase of the pandemic with flexibility, a strongly client-centred approach and a re-emphasis on collaboration between services. The community service sector's demonstrated capacity for agility and rapid adaptation suggests it is well placed to provide critical supports to those affected by crisis situations and everyday disadvantage. However, the sector's capacity to perform this role effectively depends on strong, stable government supports for all Australians in need.","Coram, Louth, Tually, Goodwin-Smith","https://doi.org/10.1002/ajs4.167","20210630","Australia; COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; community care; disadvantaged groups; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15554,""
"Effects of Video-Guided Group vs Solitary Meditation on Mindfulness and Social Connectivity: A Pilot Study","Interest in mindfulness meditation continues to grow as accumulating evidence suggests mindfulness training encourages more positive functioning. However, basic questions about the conditions best suited for realizing mindful states remain unanswered. Prominent among these is whether a group mindfulness practice setting is more effective for novice meditators than a solitary practice setting. Answering this question has assumed new urgency due to the imposition of physical distancing measures designed to stop the spread of COVID-19. In a time of limited social contact, is a simulated group practice setting better than practicing alone? This preliminary study investigated whether environmental setting impacted mindfulness practice experience by examining the effects of three simulated meditation practice environments (1. group practice, 2. nature practice, and 3. solitary practice) on state mindfulness and perceived social connectivity in a sample of novice meditators. Significant differences emerged across the three simulated practice settings. Findings suggest watching others meditate while meditating appears to most effectively induce a state of mindfulness and strengthen feelings of social connectivity. This study supports traditional beliefs about the benefits of group mindfulness practice. These findings also have implications for social workers struggling to stretch limited resources to address growing mental health demands, especially during times of heightened social isolation due to COVID-19. If a simulated group practice confers the same cognitive benefits as solitary practice while also conferring social benefits, simulated group instruction may be preferable for therapeutic and economic reasons.","Hanley, Dehili, Krzanowski, Barou, Lecy, Garland","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10615-021-00812-0","20210630","Group practice; Meditation; Mental health; Mindfulness; Nature; Social connectivity; Social work; Solitary practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","",15555,""

"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with obesity undergoing bariatric care","Patients with obesity are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. The pandemic has caused delays in preoperative preparation, progression, and completion of bariatric surgeries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on bariatric surgery patients and assess their concern of COVID-19 as they continue the preoperative process. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to patients to assess the impact of COVID-19 on their weight loss goals, physical activity, and diet. Time points assessed were initial bariatric consultation (T1), as well as the beginning (T2), and the end (T3) of lockdown restrictions in the region. Seventy-four participants were invited and 50 completed the survey, for a response rate of 67.6%. The average age of participants was 44.1 years. Two-thirds of patients reported significant concern that COVID-19 would affect their weight loss goals. Patients reported significant improvements in their diet from T1 to T2 (P &lt; .01). However, at T3, some patients returned to behaviors held at T1, with snacking behaviors significantly increasing between T2 and T3 (P &lt; .01). Physical activity decreased in 60% of patients between T2 to T3. The vast majority (90%) wanted to have their surgery as soon as possible; 56% reported low levels of concern for COVID-19 infection.

"Psychological burden of COVID-19 on mild and moderate chronic spontaneous urticarial","<b>Background:</b> The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related mental health status on chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) has not been addressed before. <b>Objective:</b> The aim of this study was to evaluate the depression, anxiety and stress levels, and the fear of COVID-19 in patients with mild-to-moderate CSU and to determine their impact on urticaria activity during the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 509 patients with mild-to-moderate CSU were prospectively evaluated with validated scales, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) during the lockdown period (LP) and the return to normal period (RTNP). CSU activity was determined with the urticaria activity score summed over 7 days (UAS7) and medication scores (MS). UAS7 and MS before the pandemic were retrospectively collected from medical records. <b>Results:</b> The median UAS7 and MS were both significantly higher in the LP than in the median of related scores during the prepandemic period (p &lt; 0.0001) and the RTNP (p &lt; 0.0001). The mean FCV-19S and DASS-21 scores were both significantly higher in the LP than in the RTNP (p &lt; 0.0001). The FCV-19S and the DASS-21 anxiety and stress subscales were significantly higher in women. The UAS7s were positively correlated with the FCV-19S and depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores. <b>Conclusion:</b> Fear of COVID-19, anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when strict isolation measures are taken, have a significant impact on mental health and urticaria activity in patients with mild-to-moderate CSU, even though they are not infected.
