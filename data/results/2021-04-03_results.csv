"Testing a Developmental Model of Parental Warmth, Amygdalaâ€“Subgenual Anterior Cingulate Cortex Connectivity, and Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Neurobiological measures may serve as predictive markers of risk for and resilience to depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. We tested a developmental model linking variation in amygdalaâ€“subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) resting-state connectivity both to earlier experiences in the family environment and to subsequent vulnerability to depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Methods: We used data from a longitudinal study that included three waves (N=214 adolescents; ages 9-15 years at Time 1 (T1), 11-17 years at Time 2 (T2), and 12-19 years during the pandemic at Time 3 [T3]). We assessed parental warmth (T1), depressive symptoms (T1 to T3), and functional connectivity between the sgACC and basolateral (BLA) and centromedial amygdala (CMA) (T1 and T2). We modeled associations among early parental warmth, amygdalaâ€“sgACC connectivity, and depressive symptoms before and during the pandemic. Results: Less parental warmth was associated prospectively with stronger BLAâ€“sgACC connectivity approximately two years later (<U+F062>=-.23, p=.021) over and above the effect of BLAâ€“sgACC connectivity at T1. Stronger BLAâ€“sgACC connectivity, in turn, was associated with heightened depressive symptoms, both before (r=.21, p=.031) and during the pandemic (<U+F062>=.22, p=.031; independent of the effect of pre-pandemic symptoms). Conclusion: Adolescents who experience less parental warmth may develop a pattern of BLAâ€“sgACC connectivity that increases their risk for mental health problems during the pandemic. BLAâ€“sgACC connectivity in early to middle adolescence may be a predictive marker of risk for depressive symptoms in general and specifically during periods of heightened stress.","Jonas G.
