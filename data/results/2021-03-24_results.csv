"Antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs reduce viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 and fluoxetine show antiviral activity against the novel variants in vitro","Background and Purpose: Repurposing of currently available drugs is a valuable strategy to tackle the consequences of COVID-19. Recently, several studies have investigated the effect of psychoactive drugs on SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models as well as in clinical practice. Our aim was to expand these studies and test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants. Experimental Approach: Several antidepressant drugs and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested in human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-1, against the first wave (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Key Results: Several clinically used antidepressants, including fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, imipramine, as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide inhibited the infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore, fluoxetine remained effective against pseudo viruses with N501Y, K417N, and E484K spike mutations, and the VoC-1 (B.1.1.7) and VoC-2 (B.1.351) variants of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion and Implications: Our study confirms previous data and extends information on the repurposing of these drugs to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection including different variants of concern.","Merve Senem Fred; Suvi Kuivanen; Hasan Ugurlu; Plinio Cabrera Casarotto; Lev Levanov; Kalle Saksela; Olli Vapalahti; Eero Castren","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.22.436379","20210323","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12318,""
"Presumptive Neonatal Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The study aimed to alert the neonatal community to the possibility of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) like disease in critically ill neonates born to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Diagnosis of MIS-C like disease was pursued after echocardiography showed severely depressed ventricular function and pathological coronary artery dilation in the setting of medically refractory multisystem organ failure and maternal COVID-19 infection. The neonate did not respond to standard medical therapy, and there was no alternative disease that could explain the clinical course. High index of clinical suspicion coupled with low risk of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prompted us to pursue IVIG administration even though the neonate did not meet classic criteria for MIS-C. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Following treatment with IVIG, there was rapid clinical improvement. Ventricular function improved within 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours and coronary artery dilation resolved in 8 days. There was no recurrence of disease during follow-up. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’COVID-19 associated MIS-C like disease has not been well described in neonates. As typical features may be conspicuously absent, a high index of suspicion is warranted in critically ill neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Echocardiography may provide critical diagnostic information and narrow the differential diagnosis. Ã‚Â· COVID-19 associated MIS-C can present in neonates..

"Stroke Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic: International Expert Panel Review","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed a tremendous strain on healthcare services. This study, prepared by a large international panel of stroke experts, assesses the rapidly growing research and personal experience with COVID-19 stroke and offers recommendations for stroke management in this challenging new setting: modifications needed for prehospital emergency rescue and hyperacute care; inpatient intensive or stroke units; posthospitalization rehabilitation; follow-up including at-risk family and community; and multispecialty departmental developments in the allied professions. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 uses spike proteins binding to tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors, most often through the respiratory system by virus inhalation and thence to other susceptible organ systems, leading to COVID-19. Clinicians facing the many etiologies for stroke have been sobered by the unusual incidence of combined etiologies and presentations, prominent among them are vasculitis, cardiomyopathy, hypercoagulable state, and endothelial dysfunction. International standards of acute stroke management remain in force, but COVID-19 adds the burdens of personal protections for the patient, rescue, and hospital staff and for some even into the postdischarge phase. For pending COVID-19 determination and also for those shown to be COVID-19 affected, strict infection control is needed at all times to reduce spread of infection and to protect healthcare staff, using the wealth of well-described methods. For COVID-19 patients with stroke, thrombolysis and thrombectomy should be continued, and the usual early management of hypertension applies, save that recent work suggests continuing ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Prothrombotic states, some acute and severe, encourage prophylactic LMWH unless bleeding risk is high. COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy adds risk of cardioembolic stroke, where heparin or warfarin may be preferable, with experience accumulating with DOACs. As ever, arteritis can prove a difficult diagnosis, especially if not obvious on the acute angiogram done for clot extraction. This field is under rapid development and may generate management recommendations which are as yet unsettled, even undiscovered. Beyond the acute management phase, COVID-19-related stroke also forces rehabilitation services to use protective precautions. As with all stroke patients, health workers should be aware of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and/or distress developing in their patients and caregivers. Postdischarge outpatient care currently includes continued secondary prevention measures. Although hoping a COVID-19 stroke patient can be considered cured of the virus, those concerned for contact safety can take comfort in the increasing use of telemedicine, which is itself a growing source of patient-physician contacts. Many online resources are available to patients and physicians. Like prior challenges, stroke care teams will also overcome this one. Key Messages: Evidence-based stroke management should continue to be provided throughout the patient care journey, while strict infection control measures are enforced.","Venketasubramanian, Anderson, Ay, Aybek, Brinjikji, de Freitas, Del Brutto, Fassbender, Fujimura, Goldstein, Haberl, Hankey, Heiss, Lestro Henriques, Kase, Kim, Koga, Kokubo, Kuroda, Lee, Lee, Liebeskind, Lip, Meairs, Medvedev, Mehndiratta, Mohr, Nagayama, Pantoni, Papanagiotou, Parrilla, Pastori, Pendlebury, Pettigrew, Renjen, Rundek, Schminke, Shinohara, Tang, Toyoda, Wartenberg, Wasay, Hennerici","https://doi.org/10.1159/000514155","20210323","Coronavirus disease 2019; Management; Review; Stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12320,""
"Prevalence, risk and protective factors associated with suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic in US military veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of the general population. However, less is known about its impact on vulnerable populations, such as veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Data were analyzed from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative cohort of U.S. veterans. Pre-pandemic and 1-year peri-pandemic risk and protective factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) were examined in veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. 19.2% of veterans screened positive for SI peri-pandemic. Relative to veterans without SI, they had lower income, were more likely to have been infected with COVID-19, reported greater COVID-19-related financial and social restriction stress, and increases in psychiatric symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. A multivariable analysis revealed that older age, greater pre-pandemic psychiatric symptom severity, past-year SI, lifetime suicide attempt, psychosocial difficulties, COVID-19 infection, and past-year increase in psychiatric symptom severity were linked to peri-pandemic SI, while pre-pandemic higher income and purpose in life were protective. Among veterans who were infected with COVID-19, those aged 45 or older and who reported lower purpose in life were more likely to endorse SI. Monitoring for suicide risk and worsening psychiatric symptoms in older veterans who have been infected with COVID-19 may be important. Interventions that enhance purpose in life may help protect against SI in this population.","Na, Tsai, Hill, Nichter, Norman, Southwick, Pietrzak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.03.021","20210323","COVID-19; Depression; PTSD; Substance use disorder; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12321,""
"Anxiety reported by US adults in 2019 and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic: Population-based evidence from two nationally representative samples","The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the mental health of the US population is unclear. This study drew on two nationally representative samples to compare the prevalence rate of anxiety in the U.S. before and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) screening tool was used to detect the proportion of US adults screening positive for high levels of anxiety symptoms. Anxiety symptoms was assessed in 2019 using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 30,915) and during the pandemic using biweekly surveys collected as part of the Understanding America Study (UAS; N=8,022 Obs.=121,768) between March and December 2020. The proportion of participants with high levels of anxiety symptoms increased significantly from 8.1% (95% CI[7.7, 8.5]) in 2019 to 21.4% (95% CI[19.9, 22.9]) at the beginning of April, 2020. The prevalence then declined to 11.4% (95% CI[10.3, 12.5]) in May and remained 3% above 2019 levels until December 2020. This pattern of increasing anxiety between 2019 and April 2020 followed by a rapid decrease in anxiety was identified across all demographic characteristics examined. The NHIS and UAS samples differ in their sampling and mode of administration which may bias comparisons between samples. Anxiety symptoms increased markedly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced quickly as stay-at-home orders were lifted. These findings highlight the importance of providing mental health supports during future lockdowns and suggest that resilience in mental health may have been a key population-level response to the demands of the pandemic.","Daly, Robinson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.054","20210323","COVID-19; Coronavirus infection; Longitudinal research; Mental health; Nationally representative study; anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12322,""
"Influence of anxiety and resilience on depression among hospital nurses: A comparison of nurses working with confirmed and suspected patients in the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units","This study aimed to compare anxiety, resilience, and depression between COVID-19 unit (confirmed patients and suspected patients) and non-COVID-19 unit nurses and assess their effects on depression. Nurses working during the global pandemic are known to be physically and psychologically exhausted, and experience severe anxiety and depression. However, there is a lack of studies comparing anxiety and depression between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 unit nurses. Descriptive research study. This study was conducted on 64 nurses who directly worked for more than a month in a COVID-19 unit of a general hospital with nationally designated negative-pressure isolation beds and 64 nurses working in a non-COVID-19 unit. Data were collected through questionnaires and were analysed using SPSS 25.0. Reporting of this research adheres to the STROBE guidelines. Anxiety and depression were significantly higher in nurses working with patients suspected to have COVID-19 rather than nurses working with confirmed COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients. Resilience was significantly lower in suspected patient unit nurses than in COVID-19 unit nurses. Anxiety was the major factor predicting depression in both COVID-19 unit (confirmed patients and suspected patients) and non-COVID-19 unit nurses with 76.6%, 80.7%, and 63.6% explanatory power, respectively. Among nurses working in COVID-19 units, suspected patients unit nurses had higher depression than confirmed patients unit nurses due to an unsafe facility environment, insufficient personal protective equipment, and unknown conditions of the patients. Thus, interventions which have a high impact on depression need to be provided to relieve anxiety. The nursing organisation must provide comprehensive support including coordinated shifts, internal motivation, incentives, up-to-date information, and clear infection prevention guidelines to relieve anxiety caused by exhaustive workload, uncertainty of infectious diseases, and lack of human and material resources.","Doo, Kim, Lee, Lee, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15752","20210323","COVID-19 infection; anxiety; depression; nurses; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12323,""
"Another Brick in the Wall: Healthcare Access Difficulties and Their Implications for Undocumented Latino/a Immigrants","The mounting evidence highlighting the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in ethnic minority communities underscores the need to understand how distress and healthcare access impacts the well-being of undocumented Latino/a immigrants (ULIs), one of the most marginalized and vulnerable ethnic minority communities in the U.S. We used existing data from a cross sectional study (Proyecto Voces) of 252 ULIs to conduct path analyses that explored the relations among distress due to immigration legal status, healthcare access difficulties, and the health of ULIs. Results demonstrated that distress due to immigration legal status is related to the physical and mental health of ULIs, and that difficulties in accessing healthcare explained these relations. These data support the importance of immediate, targeted efforts for increasing access to healthcare among undocumented immigrants and highlight the long-term importance of a much-needed healthcare reform for improving access to marginalized populations.","Galvan, Lill, Garcini","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10903-021-01187-7","20210323","Health disparities; Healthcare reform; Latino/a; Undocumented","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12324,""

"Persistent neurologic symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in non-hospitalized Covid-19 &quot;long haulers&quot;","Most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals never require hospitalization. However, some develop prolonged symptoms. We sought to characterize the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in non-hospitalized Covid-19 &quot;long haulers&quot;. This is a prospective study of the first 100 consecutive patients (50 SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-positive and 50 laboratory-negative individuals) presenting to our Neuro-Covid-19 clinic between May and November 2020. Due to early pandemic testing limitations, patients were included if they met Infectious Diseases Society of America symptoms of Covid-19, were never hospitalized for pneumonia or hypoxemia and had neurologic symptoms lasting over 6 weeks. We recorded the frequency of neurologic symptoms and analyzed patient-reported quality of life measures and standardized cognitive assessments. Mean age was 43.2Ã‚Â±11.3 years, 70% were female and 48% were evaluated in televisits. The most frequent comorbidities were depression/anxiety (42%) and autoimmune disease (16%).

"Fear of COVID-19 and its associations with perceived personal and family benefits and harms in Hong Kong","Fear of COVID-19 is associated with public health compliance but also with negative well-being; however, no articles have reported associations of such fear with perceived benefits and harms. We assessed the level of fear of COVID-19 in Hong Kong adults and its associations with sociodemographic factors and perceived benefits and harms of COVID-19. In a 6-day population-based cross-sectional online survey in May 2020, 4,890 adults provided data on fear and perceived benefits and harms, personal happiness and family well-being, and sociodemographic characteristics. Linear regression was used to analyze associations. The level of fear was moderate (mean score 6.3/10). Fewer respondents reported perceived benefits (10.6%-21.7%) than harms (13.4%-43.5%). Females, younger age groups, and respondents with lower education or more cohabitants had greater fear. Fear was associated with perceived personal (increased knowledge of personal epidemic prevention) and family benefits (improved family hygiene), both with a very small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.03). Fear was also associated with lower personal happiness and perceived personal (increased negative emotions, feeling depressed and anxious, decreased income, and decreased work efficiency) and family harms (increased conflicts and negative emotions among family members), with small effect sizes (0.08-0.37). We have first shown sociodemographic differences in the fear of COVID-19 and such fear was associated with both perceived personal and family benefits and harms of COVID-19.

"COVID-19 Pandemic Prevalence and Risk Factors for Depression Among Health Care Workers in South Asia","Health care workers (HCW) are especially vulnerable to developing mental health problems in pandemic situations. The impact may be much devastating in developing countries due to fragmented health care system. Our study aims to explore the underlying burden of depression and its related factors among health care workers in South Asian countries. Data was collected through an online survey. A total of 476 health care workers including doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff participated from Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. A validated WHO Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to screen for Depression. A 25.7% prevalence of depression was reported among health care workers. Almost 70% of them were either not satisfied or partially satisfied with the provided personal protective equipment. On multivariable analysis, females gender (aOR=1.80, 95% CI: 1.11 - 2.90), fear of unprotection (aOR=1.80, 95% CI: 1.11 - 2.90), confirmed COVID-19 case in workplace (aOR=1.98, 95% CI= 1.18 - 3.33) and family (aOR=2.98, 95% CI: 1.02 - 8.70) were found to be independent predictors of depression among healthcare workers.

"Debate: Child and adolescent mental health services in Pakistan; Do we need in-patient mental health facilities for children and young people?","Depression and anxiety are leading causes of morbidity in children and adolescents worldwide. In Pakistan, young people are exposed to many chronic adversities including violence, social and economic inequalities, and are at greater risk of developing mental health problems. Yet there is a lack of trained human resources, in-patient child and adolescent mental healthcare facilities, and training opportunities in child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health in Pakistan. Given the poor economic condition of the country, which has been made even worse by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is very unlikely that dedicated resources will be made available in near future to develop specialist child and adolescent mental health services in Pakistan.

"Behavioural change in Prader-Willi syndrome during COVID-19 pandemic","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder that in many cases is associated with mental health disorders, in addition to characteristic symptoms such as hyperphagia. The current Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has led to massive restrictions in health care and social life worldwide. People with PWS represent a particularly vulnerable population group to these restrictions, with unknown impact on their mental health. We conducted an online questionnaire to assess the impact of the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people with PWS. One hundred and eight caregivers completed the survey about individuals with PWS. Individuals with PWSÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 6Ã‚Â years (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 89) were included for evaluation with regard to psychopathological change. Respondents frequently reported an increase in psychopathological symptoms associated with PWS during the lockdown, with 51.7% reporting increased temper outbursts, 43.8% showing signs of sadness, 38.2% being anxious, 55.0% more irritable, and 39.3% showing more food seeking behaviour. Adjusted for the type of accommodation food seeking behaviour and irritability is increased to a significantly lesser extent in people with PWS accommodated in specialised care facilities compared with those living in their family home. No significant difference could be found between the sexes. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the mental health of individuals with PWS, evidenced by an increase in behaviours associated with PWS, including temper outbursts, food-seeking, and irritability, which again underlines their need for specialised care.

"Negative impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown upon health-related behaviours and psychological wellbeing in people living with severe and complex obesity in the UK","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented changes in the way we live, particularly for people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. People with pre-existing health conditions have been markedly impacted and, in some instances, left unsupported due to reduced provision of routine healthcare services. People living with obesity (PLWO) are identified as at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence about the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on PLWO, including those accessing weight management and bariatric surgery services (WMS). 543 adults (16-80 years) with obesity (BMI Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 30Ã‚Â kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited between 14th May and 9th July 2020 through social media advertisements, professional and patient obesity organisations and WMS. Participants completed an online survey regarding the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown upon, mental health, well-being, health-related behaviours, risk mitigating behaviours, access to WMS and weight stigma. During the first COVID-19 lockdown, the majority of PLWO reported deterioration of their mental health and health-related behaviours such as diet, physical activity (PA) and sleep. With 55% reporting an unhealthier diet, 61% reduced PA and 80% worsening of their sleep. Higher depression and lower wellbeing scores were found to associate with the greatest adverse impact upon health-related behaviours. PLWO who were attending WMS prior to the first lockdown reported a greater deterioration of their diet, with nearly 50% reporting worsening of their diet and PA worsening compared to PLWO who were not attending WMS. Most participants took two or more risk mitigating actions (73%). PLWO attending WMS reported reduced access (44%) with insufficient information (49%) from their clinical service providers. The majority of participants reported no change in perceived weight stigma. This study shows the detrimental impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on PLWO in relation to health-related behaviours, mental health and access to WMS. Our findings show that PLWO with poor mental health and those attending WMS were most adversely impacted and highlights the need for greater mental health support and continued provision of support from WMS for PLWO during future lockdowns.

The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°152). The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), depression (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), anxiety (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), phobic anxiety (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.043), and psychoticism (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings show their vulnerability to a public health alert and indicate the need to carry out a psychological approach to these patients while the state of health emergency lasts as well as to possible outbreaks of the virus. Las pacientes con lupus eritematoso sistÃƒÂ©mico (LES) son mÃƒÂ¡s vulnerables a presentar mayores niveles de estrÃƒÂ©s y sÃƒÂ­ntomas psicopatolÃƒÂ³gicos que la poblaciÃƒÂ³n general sana, por lo que el brote de la COVID-19 podrÃƒÂ­a alterar su estado psicolÃƒÂ³gico. El objetivo fue analizar el impacto psicolÃƒÂ³gico de la pandemia y del confinamiento sobre los niveles de estrÃƒÂ©s y sintomatologÃƒÂ­a psicopatolÃƒÂ³gica en pacientes con LES. En este estudio transversal se compararon niveles de estrÃƒÂ©s mediante la Escala de EstrÃƒÂ©s Percibido y el Inventario de Vulnerabilidad al EstrÃƒÂ©s, y sÃƒÂ­ntomas psicopatolÃƒÂ³gicos mediante el Inventario de sÃƒÂ­ntomas SCL-90-R, en pacientes con LES durante el perÃƒÂ­odo de confinamiento (grupo 1; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°276) con respecto a pacientes con LES evaluadas en un perÃƒÂ­odo anterior a la pandemia (grupo 2; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°152). La comparaciÃƒÂ³n entre ambos grupos mostrÃƒÂ³ que existÃƒÂ­an diferencias estadÃƒÂ­sticamente significativas en vulnerabilidad al estrÃƒÂ©s (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,0001), depresiÃƒÂ³n (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,05), ansiedad (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,05), ansiedad fÃƒÂ³bica (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,0001), sensibilidad interpersonal (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,043), y psicoticismo (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,023). En estas variables el grupo de pacientes con lupus en confinamiento obtuvo puntuaciones superiores. El confinamiento y la amenaza del brote por COVID-19 ha tenido importantes repercusiones en el estado psicolÃƒÂ³gico de las pacientes con LES, mostrando altos niveles de estrÃƒÂ©s, ansiedad y depresiÃƒÂ³n. Estos hallazgos muestran su vulnerabilidad ante una alerta de salud pÃƒÂºblica, y seÃƒÂ±ala la necesidad de realizar un abordaje psicolÃƒÂ³gico de estas pacientes mientras dure el estado de emergencia sanitaria, asÃƒÂ­ como ante posibles rebrotes del virus.","Santos-Ruiz, Montero-LÃƒÂ³pez, Ortego-Centeno, Peralta-RamÃƒÂ­rez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcle.2020.12.009","20210323","COVID-19; Confinement; Perceived stress; Psychopathological symptoms; Systemic lupus erythematosus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12332,""
"Psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on nurses working in tertiary women's and children's hospitals from Sichuan, China: A cross-sectional study","The evolving COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented pressures on health systems. Accumulative studies suggest that nurses were more likely to develop negative psychiatric outcomes following a public health disaster than other medical staffs, due to their more frequent and closer contact with patients. We examined the psychological status of nurses working in the tertiary women's and children's hospitals in Sichuan, China, in order to explore the possible effect of the COVID-19. The cross-sectional survey was conducted at the peak period of COVID-19 among 1971 nurses. Their anxiety, depression and self-efficacy were assessed by the seven-item anxiety scale (GAD-7), the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES), respectively. 1934 valid questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 98.1%. We found that 29.3% and 22.7% of the nurses were identified with anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. The median score of GSES was 30, which was at the upper middle level among all populations. Nurses having longer working years and cold-like symptoms, those who were at work during breakout period and working in pediatric ward were significantly associated with the presence of anxiety and depression. Findings suggest that the epidemic of COVID-19 does not necessarily affect the psychological health of nurses working in women's and children's hospitals in Sichuan. The results of this study could serve as valuable suggestions to direct the promotion of psychological well-being among targeted nurses.","He, Ren, Wang, Zhang, Xiang, He","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102188","20210323","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12333,""
"Suicidal Risk in Older Patients with Depression During COVID-19 Pandemic: a Case-Control Study","To compare older adults with late-life depression (LLD) and healthy controls in terms of suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine predictors of suicidal ideation. Between March and April 2020, old adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (single or recurrent episode) as defined by the DSM-5 were recruited from psychiatric clinics or inpatient wards, whereas 31 healthy older adults without a history of depression or other psychiatric illnesses were recruited from voluntary organisations or elderly community centres. Their depressive symptoms, perceived severity of the pandemic, perceived time spent on receiving related information, perceived health, levels of loneliness, perceived coping efficacy, suicidal ideation, and the level of symptomatic responses to a specific traumatic stressor in the past week were assessed. In total, 21 men and 43 women aged 61 to 89 years were interviewed through telephone by trained research assistants. Of them, 33 were older adults with LLD (cases) and 31 were healthy older adults (controls). Older people with LLD had a higher level of suicidal ideation than healthy controls, after controlling for the level of depression and medical comorbidity (F (1, 59) = 5.72, p = 0.020). Regression analyses showed that coping efficacy and loneliness accounted for a significant portion of the variance in suicidal ideation, and loneliness significantly predicted the level of stress. Mediation analyses reveal an indirect effect between group and suicidal ideation through coping efficacy (Z = 2.43, p = 0.015). Older people with LLD are at increased suicidal risk and require timely mental health support. Coping efficacy and loneliness are important predictors for suicidal ideation and stress.","Louie, Chan, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.12809/eaap2055","20210323","Aged; COVID-19; Depression; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12334,""
"Beyond PPE: a mixed qualitative-quantitative study capturing the wider issues affecting doctors' well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the medical workforce. This has put them at increased risk of burnout at a time when levels are already worryingly high in the profession, with recent studies consistently showing that around half of doctors meet the validated criteria for burnout. To understand the wider factors influencing and impacting upon hospital doctors' well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Cross-sectional survey and mixed quantitative-qualitative analysis. Acute National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust in England. An online survey was circulated in early June 2020 to all 449 doctors employed by the Trust. 242 doctors completed the survey (54% response rate). Questions assessed occupational details, self-reported changes in physical and mental health, satisfaction with working hours and patterns, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), medication and facilities, communication and sought to identify areas seen as having a significant effect on doctors' well-being. 96% of respondents requiring PPE were able to access it. Nearly half of the respondents felt that their mental health had deteriorated since the start of the pandemic. Over a third stated that their physical health had also declined. Issues identified as having a negative impact on doctors included increased workload, redeployment, loss of autonomy, personal issues affecting family members, anxiety around recovery plans, inadequate access to changing and storage facilities and to rest areas that allow for social distancing. Doctors appreciated access to 'calm rooms' that were made available for staff, access to clinical psychology support, free drinks and free car parking on site. The emerging themes are suggestive of increased burnout risk among doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic and encompass factors well beyond shortage of PPE. Small organisational initiatives and the implementation of changes suggested by survey respondents can have a positive impact on doctors' well-being.","Cubitt, Im, Scott, Jeynes, Molyneux","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050223","20210323","COVID-19; mental health; occupational &amp; industrial medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12335,""
"Characterising the impact of COVID-19 environment on mental health, gender affirming services and socioeconomic loss in a global sample of transgender and non-binary people: a structural equation modelling","We characterised the impact of COVID-19 on the socioeconomic conditions, access to gender affirmation services and mental health outcomes in a sample of global transgender (trans) and non-binary populations. Between 16 April 2020 and 3 August 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with a global sample of trans and non-binary people (n=849) through an online social networking app. We conducted structural equational modelling procedures to determine direct, indirect and overall effects between poor mental health (ie, depression and anxiety) and latent variables across socioecological levels: social (ie, reduction in gender affirming services, socioeconomic loss impact) and environmental factors (ie, COVID-19 pandemic environment). Anxiety (45.82%) and depression (50.88%) in this sample were prevalent and directly linked to COVID-19 pandemic environment. Adjusted for gender identity, age, migrant status, region, education and level of socioeconomic status, our final model showed significant positive associations between relationships of (1) COVID-19 pandemic environment and socioeconomic loss impact (ÃŽÂ²=0.62, p&lt;0.001), (2) socioeconomic loss impact and reduction in gender affirming services (ÃŽÂ²=0.24, p&lt;0.05) and (3) reduction in gender affirming services and poor mental health (ÃŽÂ²=0.19, p&lt;0.05). Moreover, socioeconomic loss impact and reduction in gender affirming services were found to be partial mediators in this model. The study results supported the importance of bolstering access to gender affirming services and strengthening socioeconomic opportunities and programmatic support to buffer the impact of COVID-19 pandemic environment on poor mental health among trans and non-binary communities globally.","Restar, Jin, Jarrett, Adamson, Baral, Howell, Beckham","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004424","20210323","COVID-19; mental health &amp; psychiatry; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12336,""
"Experiences of mental health professionals supporting front-line health and social care workers during COVID-19: qualitative study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a well-documented impact on the mental health of front-line health and social care workers (HSCWs). However, little attention has been paid to the experiences of, and impact on, the mental health professionals who were rapidly tasked with supporting them. We set out to redress this gap by qualitatively exploring UK mental health professionals' experiences, views and needs while working to support the well-being of front-line HSCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health professionals working in roles supporting front-line HSCWs were recruited purposively and interviewed remotely. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed by the research team following the principles of reflexive thematic analysis. We completed interviews with 28 mental health professionals from varied professional backgrounds, career stages and settings across the UK. Mental health professionals were motivated and driven to develop new clinical pathways to support HSCWs they perceived as colleagues and many experienced professional growth. However, this also came at some costs, as they took on additional responsibilities and increased workloads, were anxious and uncertain about how best to support this workforce and tended to neglect their own health and well-being. Many were professionally isolated and were affected vicariously by the traumas and moral injuries that healthcare workers talked about in sessions. This research highlights the urgent need to consider the mental well-being, training and support of mental health professionals who are supporting front-line workers.","Billings, Biggs, Ching, Gkofa, Singleton, Bloomfield, Greene","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.29","20210323","COVID-19; front-line workers; mental health professionals; psychosocial interventions; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12337,""
"The effect of the lockdown executive order during the COVID-19 pandemic in recent trauma admissions in Puerto Rico","The COVID-19 pandemic led to world-wide restrictions on social activities to curb the spread of this disease. Very little is known about the impact of these restrictions on trauma centers. Our objective was to determine the effect of the pandemic-associated lockdown on trauma admissions, patient's demographics, mechanisms of injury, injury severity, and outcomes in the Puerto Rico Trauma Hospital. An IRB-approved quasi-experimental study was performed to assess the impact of the restrictions by comparing trauma admissions during the lockdown (March 15, 2020 - June 15, 2020) with a control period (same period in 2017-2019). Comparisons were done using the Pearson's chi-square test, Fisher exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. A negative binomial model was fitted to estimate the incidence rate ratio for overall admissions among pre-lockdown and during-lockdown periods. Statistical significance was set at pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05. A total of 308 subjects were admitted during the quarter of study for 2017; 323, for 2018; 347, for 2019; and 150, for 2020. The median (interquartile range) age of patients rose significantly from 40 (33) years to 49 (30) years (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) for the lockdown period compared to the historical period. Almost all mechanisms of injury (i.e., motor vehicle accident, assault, pedestrian, burn, suicide attempt, other) had a slight non-significant reduction in the percentage of patients presenting with an injury. Instead, falls experienced an increase during the lockdown period (18.9% vs. 26.7%; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.026). Moreover, the proportion of severe cases decreased, as measured by an injury severity score (ISS) &gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°15 (37.3% vs. 26.8%; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.014); while there were no differences in the median hospital length of stay and the mortality rate between the comparison groups. Finally, the decrease in overall admissions registered during the lockdown accounts for a 59% (IRR 0.41; 95% CI 0.31-0.54) change compared to the pre-lockdown period, when controlling for sex, age, mechanism of injury, and ISS. Following periods of social isolation and curfews, trauma centers can expect drastic reductions in their overall patient volume with associated changes in trauma patterns. Our findings will help inform new interventions and improve healthcare preparedness for future or similar circumstances.","Ruiz-Medina, Ramos-MelÃƒÂ©ndez, Cruz-De La Rosa, Arrieta-Alicea, Guerrios-Rivera, Nieves-Plaza, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Ortiz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40621-021-00324-y","20210323","COVID-19; Injury patterns; Lockdown; Pandemic; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12338,""
"A longitudinal study of mental health before and during COVID-19 lockdown in the French population","The impact of general population lockdown implemented in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic needs to be evaluated. We describe here a longitudinal study on the mental health of adults in France. We did a secondary analysis of a web-based cohort, initially set up to study home and leisure injuries, in order to measure the consequences of the national lockdown implemented in France from 17 March 2020 to 11 May 2020, and to assess potential vulnerability and resilience factors. Eligible participants were invited to answer an online questionnaire designed to assess their living conditions and health during lockdown. Comparisons were done with answers provided 4.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°years earlier on average. On 15th April 2020, we sent email invitations to 9598 participants recruited between November 2014 and December 2019 and 1237 volunteers took part in the study by completing the online questionnaire. The proportion of those with anxiety symptoms markedly increased from 17.3 to 20.1%. The average self-rated level of mental health decreased from 7.77 to 7.58. Women, the elderly and the youngest appeared to be more vulnerable. A small living space (less than 30 m<sup>2</sup>) was associated with an increase in depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score), and poorer self-rated physical health at recruitment was associated with an increase in anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score). On the contrary, the average self-rated level of physical health markedly increased from 7.44 to 7.94 between recruitment and lockdown, and the proportion of those who reported a level of 9 or 10 jumped from 25.7% at recruitment to 43.1% during lockdown. Mental health deteriorated during lockdown in France during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. Overall, self-rated physical health improved but those who experienced a worse physical health were more likely to report anxiety symptoms.","Ramiz, Contrand, Rojas Castro, Dupuy, Lu, Sztal-Kutas, Lagarde","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00682-8","20210323","Anxiety symptoms; COVID-19; Depression symptoms; Lockdown; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12339,""

"Pediatric Emergency Department Visits at US Children's Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on pediatric emergency department (ED) visits is not well characterized. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of pediatric ED visits and resource use during the pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional study using the Pediatric Health Information System for ED visits to 27 US children's hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic period (March 15, 2020, to August 31, 2020) and a 3-year comparator period (March 15 to August 31, 2017-2019). ED visit rates, patient and visit characteristics, resource use, and ED charges were compared between the time periods. We specifically evaluated changes in low-resource-intensity visits, defined as ED visits that did not result in hospitalization or medication administration and for which no laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging, or procedures were performed. ED visit rates decreased by 45.7% (average 911Ã¢â‚¬â€°026 ED visits over 2017-2019 vs 495Ã¢â‚¬â€°052 visits in 2020) during the pandemic.

"Beyond resilience: Promotive and protective traits that facilitate recovery during crisis","Resilience functions to promote psychological growth and buffer against the effects of negative events. Individual traits that promote optimal mental health beyond resilience, however, remain poorly understood. The current study addresses this gap through a positive psychology perspective. We examine how promotive traits â€“ courage, optimism, hope, and protective traits â€“ nostalgia, wisdom, and spirituality promote well-being and buffer against negative emotional states. We hypothesized that promotive traits will be positively related to well-being while protective traits will be negatively related to negative emotional states. Six-hundred and twenty-six (626) Malaysians responded to an online survey at the end of the countryâ€™s second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (June-September 2020). We conducted a series of regression analyses, controlling for resilience, socio-economic status, age, and perceptions towards government crisis management efforts. Results indicate that courage, optimism and hope positively predicted well-being. The strongest promotive trait contributing to well-being is hope. Results also showed that the only significant protective trait against negative emotional states is spirituality. Interestingly, nostalgia and wisdom positively predicted negative emotional states. Findings indicate that beyond resilience, courage, optimism, hope and spirituality are the strongest predictors of well-being and protect against negative emotional states amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings are of theoretical relevance for resilience and positive psychology research, and practically beneficial in informing mental health interventions.","Eugene Y Jin Tee et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-33C-C97","20210324","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; adversity; resilience; positive psychology; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12344,""
"GROUPS 4 HEALTH versus Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in young people with depression and loneliness: a randomized, phase 3, non-inferiority trial with 12 month follow-up","Background. Depression treatments are typically less effective for young people than for adults. However, extant treatments rarely target loneliness, which is a key risk factor in the onset, maintenance, and development of depression. Aims. This study evaluated the efficacy of a novel loneliness intervention, GROUPS 4 HEALTH (G4H), relative to best-practice treatment Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) in reducing loneliness and depression over a 12 month follow-up. Methods. The study was a phase 3, randomised non-inferiority trial comparing G4H to dose-controlled group CBT. Participants were 174 young people aged 15-25 years experiencing loneliness and clinically significant symptoms of depression, who were not in receipt of adjunct treatment. Participants were recruited from mental health services in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Randomisation was conducted using computer software. Follow-up assessments and statistical analyses were blind to allocation. Both interventions consisted of 5 x 75 min group-based psychotherapy sessions. The primary outcomes were depression and loneliness, with a non-inferiority margin of 2.20 for depression. The trial was prospectively registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12618000440224) on 27 March 2018 and is closed to new participants. Results. 174 participants were enrolled between 24 April 2018 and 25 May 2019, with 84 in the G4H condition and 90 in the CBT condition. All randomised participants were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (N=174). The pre-post effect sizes for loneliness were d=-1.07G4H and d=-0.89CBT. For depression, they were d=-.71G4H and d=-.91CBT. At 12 month follow-up, the absolute difference between groups in loneliness was -0.679 (95%CI: -.1.43, .07) and in depression was 1.176 (95%CI: -1.94, 4.29). No adverse effects were observed. Conclusions. G4H was non-inferior to CBT for depression and showed a slight advantage over CBT for loneliness that emerged after treatment completion.","Tegan Cruwys et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CE-339-739","20210324","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; mood disorders; social isolation; youth; group psychotherapy; social identity; adolescence; depression; loneliness; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","",12345,""
