"Comparing mental health trajectories of four different types of key workers with non-key workers: A 12-month follow-up observational study of 21,874 adults in England during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: There are concerns that key workers may be at a greater risk for psychological distress than non-key workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little research has included key workers outside of the healthcare sector or has disaggregated key workers into different subgroups. Aims: To examine longitudinal changes in mental health over 12 months during the COVID-19 pandemic comparing four different groups of key workers with non-key workers. Method: Longitudinal data were from 21,874 adults living in England (21 March 2020 to 22 February 2021). Latent growth modelling (LGM) was utilised to compare growth trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms in non-key workers and four types of key workers: i) health and social care workers, ii) teachers and childcare workers, iii) public service workers, and iv) essential services key workers (e.g., food chain or utility workers). Results: When accounting for both time-invariant and time-varying covariates, key workers in the essential services category had consistently higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than non-key workers across the whole of the study period. There was little difference in mental health trajectories between health/social care, teachers/childcare and public service worker categories and non-key workers. Conclusions: Our findings suggest risk for poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic varies within the broad category of key workers generally, and that those working in utility, food chain, and transport roles are especially at risk. Future research should focus on identifying which aspects of working conditions may be contributing to occupational stress in these groups.","Elise Paul; Hei Wan Mak; Daisy Fancourt; Feifei Bu","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.20.21255817","20210423","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13128,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the utilization of emergency department services for the treatment of injuries","The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the utilization of healthcare services; however, the impact on population-level emergency department (ED) utilization patterns for the treatment of acute injuries has not been fully characterized. This study examined the frequency of North Carolina (NC) EDs visits for selected injury mechanisms during the first eleven months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were obtained from the NC Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT), NC's legislatively mandated statewide syndromic surveillance system for the years 2019 and 2020. Frequencies of January - November 2020 NC ED visits were compared to frequencies of 2019 visits for selected injury mechanisms, classified according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) injury diagnosis and mechanism codes. In 2020, the total number of injury-related visits declined by 19.5% (N = 651,158) as compared to 2019 (N = 809,095). Visits related to motor vehicle traffic crashes declined by a greater percentage (29%) and falls (19%) declined by a comparable percentage to total injury-related visits. Visits related to assault (15%) and self-harm (10%) declined by smaller percentages. Medication/drug overdose visits increased (10%), the only injury mechanism studied to increase during this period. Both ED avoidance and decreased exposures may have contributed to these declines, creating implications for injury morbidity and mortality. Injury outcomes exacerbated by the pandemic should be addressed by timely public health responses.","Harmon, Fliss, Marshall, Peticolas, Proescholdbell, Waller","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.04.019","20210423","COVID-19; Emergency medicine; Injury; Sentinel surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13129,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global health of women aged 50 to 70Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years","The most recent pandemic caused by the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) urged dramatic changes in people's lives. Potentially, the COVID-19 pandemic affects physical and mental health as well as behavioral and social aspects. However, the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related parameters are not yet known. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of 16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related parameters of physically inactive women aged 50 to 70Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years. Thirty-four physically inactive women participated in the study. We performed tests to evaluate aerobic capacity and muscle strength, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP), blood parameters, diet, and physical activity levels. All evaluations were carried out before and 16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯weeks after the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil (i.e., from March to July 2020). Systolic BP (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.0001; effect size (ES)Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.62), diastolic BP (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.0001; ESÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.71), grip strength of the right (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.05; ESÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.43) and left hand (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.05; ESÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.49), performance in six-minute walk test (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.05; ESÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.46), free time physical activity levels (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.05; ESÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.40), domestic physical activity levels (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.05; ESÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.39), platelet count (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.0001; ESÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.48), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.0001; ESÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.14) reduced in comparison to the period before the pandemic.

"Clinician mental health, nursing shortages and the COVID-19 pandemic: Crises within crises","Around the world, nurses are working under enormous pressure providing care to sick and dying patients during the pandemic. Many are faced with increased stress, and other negative effects on their mental health. They are also faced with the possibility of infection and death from COVID-19. Before the pandemic there was a global shortage of nurses, but this is likely to be exacerbated by the increased demands of caring during COVID-19 as well as the usual care of non-COVID patients. One serious concern is that the pandemic and multitudinous effects on the nursing profession will exacerbate nursing attrition and their poor mental health into the future. Another serious concern is whether the profession will be able to attract sufficient numbers of nurses to care for populations into the future. Governments and health policymakers everywhere need to invest in nursing and health care and pay attention to the needs of health systems to ensure a healthy population. It is argued that without this, economies will not recover and prosper, and health systems will not be able to provide quality care.","Turale, Nantsupawat","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12674","20210423","COVID-19; Clinicians; Mental Health; Nursing; Nursing Attrition; Nursing Shortages; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13131,""
"Nurses' stories from Beirut: The 2020 explosive disaster on top of a pandemic and economic crises","The World Health Organization designated last year as the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. And as we know worldwide, 2020 became an unforgettable year as nurses and midwives everywhere confronted the COVID-19 pandemic. To be a nurse in 2020 was challenging and heroic, but being a nurse in 2020 in Beirut, Lebanon was so extraordinarily charged with adversity. The country witnessed in a one-year series of tragedies of epic dimensions - laying a heavy toll on front-line nurses. We present our stories as eight Lebanese nurses, giving voice to our incredible experiences and our ongoing resilience in the face of these adversities. We served in the emergency department of a Beirut city hospital after a catastrophic explosion occurred in the capital on the 4th of August 2020. We reported for duty during a disaster of immense magnitude and are now coping with the aftermath of trauma. As nurses, we have faced many traumas in our country that has experienced through war and terrorism for decades. Arising from this disaster and challenges of the pandemic, we give policy recommendations that deserve urgent attention in Lebanon and underscore the need for disaster preparation, funding, education and importantly mental health care for nurses and other health professionals with help and support of the international community.","Jabbour, Harakeh, Dakessian Sailan, Nassar, Tashjian, Massouh, Massouh, Puzantian, Darwish","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12675","20210423","COVID-19; Disaster Management; Disaster Nursing; Lebanon; Mental Health; NursesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Stories; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13132,""
"COVID-19, social isolation, and the mental health of older adults: A digital catch-22","One of the most at-risk groups during the COVID-19 crisis are older adults, especially those who live in congregate living, seniors' care facilities, are immune-compromised, and/or have other underlying illnesses. Measures used to contain the spread of the virus are far-reaching and older adults were amongst the first groups to have restrictions on face-to-face contact. Whilst reducing viral transmission is critical, there are significant negative psychosocial implications of social distancing, particularly for older adults, such as increased rates of depression and anxiety . With non-mental health populations ,promising evidence suggests that participatory digital co-design, defined as the combination of user-centered design and community engagement models, shows high levels of engagement in mobile technologies among persons with mental health conditions. The pandemic has certainly highlighted the shortcomings of existing technologies and issues in their uptake and usage; however, strategies such as co-design may be leveraged to address these challenges both in the adaptation of existing technologies and the development of new technologies. By incorporating these strategies, it is hoped that we can offset some of the negative mental health implications for older adults both in the context of physical distancing both during and beyond the pandemic.","Cosco, Fortuna, Wister, Riadi, Wagner, Sixsmith","https://doi.org/10.2196/21864","20210423","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13133,""
"Telemental health policies for college students during COVID-19","Federal and institutional policy changes have accelerated the use of telemental health to care for college students distant from their mental health providers during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. Temporary measures have made telemental health more readily available, including relaxing of regulations related to interstate licensure, controlled substance prescribing, patient privacy, and reimbursement. Though early efforts are underway to sustain these changes during and in the wake of the pandemic, there are important areas in which federal and institutional policy are still lacking. Additional steps are needed to successfully implement and sustain telemental health for college students include ensuring student access to technology and Internet; proactive outreach to optimize the student's home environment, addressing concerns about safety and confidentiality; developing the means to track rapidly shifting telemental health policy changes; and developing centralized resources that enable remote providers to become familiar with involuntary commitment laws and emergency protocols.","Huilgol, Torous, Gold, Goldman","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2021.1909040","20210423","COVID-19; Counseling; health policy; mental health; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13134,""
"Decision-to-delivery interval and neonatal outcomes for category-1 caesarean sections during the COVID-19 pandemic","General anaesthesia is known to achieve the shortest decision-to-delivery interval for category-1 caesarean section. We investigated whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected the decision-to delivery interval and influenced neonatal outcomes in patients who underwent category-1 caesarean section. Records of 562 patients who underwent emergency caesarean section between 1 April 2019 and 1 July 2019 in seven UK hospitals (pre-COVID-19 group) were compared with 577 emergency caesarean sections performed during the same period during the COVID-19 pandemic (1 April 2020-1 July 2020) (post-COVID-19 group). Primary outcome measures were: decision-to-delivery interval; number of caesarean sections achieving decision-to-delivery interval &lt;Ã‚Â 30Ã‚Â min; and a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes (Apgar 5-min score &lt;Ã‚Â 7, umbilical arterial pH &lt;Ã‚Â 7.10, neonatal intensive care unit admission and stillbirth). The use of general anaesthesia decreased significantly between the pre- and post-COVID-19 groups (risk ratio 0.48 (95%CI 0.37-0.62); p &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001). Compared with the pre-COVID-19 group, the post-COVID-19 group had an increase in median (IQR [range]) decision-to-delivery interval (26 (18-32 [4-124]) min vs. 27 (20-33 [3-102]) min; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.043) and a decrease in the number of caesarean sections meeting the decision-to-delivery interval target of &lt;Ã‚Â 30Ã‚Â min (374/562 (66.5%) vs. 349/577 (60.5%); pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02).

The small increase in decision-to-delivery interval observed during the COVID-19 pandemic did not adversely affect neonatal outcomes.","Bhatia, Columb, Bewlay, Tageldin, Knapp, Qamar, Dooley, Kamath, Hulgur","https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15489","20210423","COVID-19; emergency caesarean section; neonatal outcome; obstetrics anaesthesia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13135,""
"Early life stress and neural development: Implications for understanding the developmental effects of COVID-19","Chronic and/or extreme stress in childhood, often referred to as early life stress, is associated with a wide range of long-term effects on development. Given this, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concern about how stress due to the pandemic will affect children's development and mental health. Although early life stress has been linked to altered functioning of a number of neural and biological systems, there is a wide range of variability in children's outcomes. The mechanisms that influence these individual differences are still not well understood. In the past, studies of stress in childhood focused on the type of events that children encountered in their lives. We conducted a review of the literature to formulate a new perspective on the effects of early life stress on development. This new, topological model, may increase understanding of the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's development. This model is oriented on children's perceptions of their environment and their social relationships, rather than specific events. These factors influence central and peripheral nervous system development, changing how children interpret, adapt, and respond to potentially stressful events, with implications for children's mental and physical health outcomes.","Smith, Pollak","https://doi.org/10.3758/s13415-021-00901-0","20210423","Adversity; COVID-19; Development; Predictability; Safety; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13136,""
"Maternal insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic: associations with depression and anxiety","The COVID-19 outbreak has made people more prone to depression, anxiety and insomnia, and females are at a high risk of developing these conditions. As a special group, pregnant and lying-in women must pay close attention to their physical and mental health, as both have consequences for the mother and the fetus. However, knowledge regarding the status of depression, anxiety and insomnia among these women is limited. This study aimed to examine insomnia and psychological factors among pregnant and lying-in women during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide theoretical support for intervention research. In total, 2235 pregnant and lying-in women from 12 provinces in China were surveyed; their average age was 30.25Ã‚Â years (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.99, rangeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19-47Ã‚Â years). The participants completed electronic questionnaires designed to collect demographic information and assess levels of depression, anxiety and insomnia. The prevalence of insomnia in the sample was 18.9%. Depression and anxiety were significant predictors of insomnia. Participants in high-risk areas, those with a disease history, those with economic losses due to the outbreak, and those in the postpartum period had significantly higher insomnia scores. The incidence of insomnia among pregnant and lying-in women is not serious in the context of the epidemic, which may be related to the sociocultural background and current epidemic situation in China. Depression and anxiety are more indicative of insomnia than demographic variables.","Wang, Zhou, Qian, Zhou, Han, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02072-2","20210423","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Maternal insomnia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13137,""

They completed the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S) and the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS). Findings showed that being a girl is an increased risk factor for anxiety, depression, and COVID-19 phobia. In addition, following the official daily COVID-19 data and having a healthcare professional in the building of residence are significant risk factors for COVID-19 phobia. Having a psychiatric disorder, having a chronic disease, losing anyone due to COVID-19 infection, undergoing a COVID-19 diagnostic test, and meeting friends in person are increased risk factors for anxiety or depression during the pandemic.

In this narrative review, we examine the impact of the pandemic on significant global health disparities affecting vulnerable populations of psychiatric patients: People of diverse ethnic background and color, children with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, pregnant women, mature adults, and those patients living in urban and rural communities. The identified disparities cause worsened mental health outcomes placing psychiatric patients at higher risk for depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Those psychiatric patients who are ethnic minorities display barriers to care, including collective trauma and structural racism. Sexual and gender minorities with mental illness face discrimination and limited access to treatment. Pregnant women with psychiatric diagnoses show higher exposure to domestic violence. Children with disabilities face a higher risk of worsening behavior. Mature adults with psychiatric problems show depression due to social isolation. Psychiatric patients who live in urban communities face pollutants and overcrowding compared to those living in rural communities, which face limited access to telehealth services. We suggest that social programs that decrease discrimination, enhance communal resilience, and help overcome systemic barriers of care should be developed to decrease global health disparities in vulnerable population.","Diaz, Baweja, Bonatakis, Baweja","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i4.94","20210423","Access to care; COVID-19; Global disparities; Health disparities; Mental health disparities; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13139,""

Physicians, nurses and medical staff have been profoundly negatively affected due to the inability of institutions to prepare for this pandemic. Institutional fixed point standards such as Eudaemonics, Inherent Value, and Amplifying Assumptions are essential to make it possible to steer an organizational course during a crisis. Fixed point standards must be embedded in hospitals and systems so they are positioned to do the most good. Employees must feel safe, valued and cared for always, so they can be resilient when crises strike. The best way to do that is by viewing the healthcare professionals through the lens of empathy.

"The occurrence of long COVID: a rapid review","The long-term effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not well understood. This rapid review was aimed at synthesizing evidence on the long-term effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection among survivors. We considered both randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies eligible for inclusion in this review. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database. The reference lists of all the included studies were also searched. Two authors independently screened the search outputs and reviewed full texts of potentially eligible articles. Data extraction was done by one author and checked by a second author. A meta-analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity among the included studies. Results are presented narratively. Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria. All these studies were conducted in high-income countries. Study findings demonstrate that COVID-19 survivors can experience persistent symptoms after recovering from their initial illness, especially among previously hospitalized persons. The majority of symptoms reported were fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and sleep disorders. Mental conditions, such as depression and anxiety disorders, were also reported. In conclusion, this study showed that COVID-19 survivors can experience persistent symptoms after recovering from their initial illness. Therefore, there is a need for a long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients and rehabilitation services for survivors.

Nearly all Universities around the globe were affected. Further, young people and University students in particular, are known to be vulnerable for developing mental disorders. This study aims to examine the mental health social and emotional well-being and perceived burdens of University students during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Germany. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> This cross-sectional and anonymous online survey among University students assessed mental health status with standardized measures (depressive symptoms, alcohol and drug consumption, and eating disorder symptoms), attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and perceived burdens, and social and emotional aspects of the pandemic (social support, perceived stress, loneliness, and self-efficacy). <b>Results:</b> In total, <i>N</i> = 3,382 German University students participated. Nearly half of the students (49%) reported that they are worried or very much worried about the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority supports the governmental lockdown measures (85%). A Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) sum score of 10 or above, indicating clinically relevant depressive symptoms, was reported by 37% (<i>n</i> = 1,249). The PHQ-9 sum score was on average 8.66 (<i>SD</i> = 5.46). Suicidal thoughts were indicated by 14.5% of the participants. Levels of depressive symptoms differed significantly for the different self-rated income changes during the pandemic (increase, decrease, no change in income). Further, levels of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation differed significantly for students from different faculties. Multiple regression analyses revealed that not being a parent, having no indirect social contact one or two times a week, higher perceived stress, higher experienced loneliness, lower social support, and lower self-efficacy significantly predicted higher scores of depressive symptoms, also higher hazardous alcohol use, and higher levels of eating disorder symptoms. Other aspects of lifestyle such as social and cultural activities, dating, and hobbies were reported to be negatively affected during the pandemic. <b>Conclusion:</b> The present study implies that University students are vulnerable and due to elevated depressive symptoms at risk, being hit hard by the pandemic, but are in general coping adaptively. Low-threshold online interventions promoting help-seeking and also targeting various mental health conditions might bridge the gap the COVID-19 pandemic opened up recently.","Kohls, Baldofski, Moeller, Klemm, Rummel-Kluge","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.643957","20210423","COVID-19; COVID-19 lockdown; University students; burden; depressive symptoms; mental health; pandemic (COVID-19); perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13143,""
"History of Respiratory Stimulants","The interest in substances that stimulate respiration has waxed and waned throughout the years, intensifying following the introduction of a new class of drugs that causes respiratory depression, and diminishing when antidotes or better drug alternatives are found. Examples include the opioids--deaths increasing during overprescribing, diminishing with wider availability of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, increasing again during COVID-19; the barbiturates--until largely supplanted by the benzodiazepines; propofol; and other central nervous system depressants. Unfortunately, two new troubling phenomena force a reconsideration of the status-quo: (1) overdoses due to highly potent opioids such as fentanyl, and even more-potent licit and illicit fentanyl analogs, and (2) overdose due to polysubstance use (the combination of an opioid plus one or more non-opioid drug, such as a benzodiazepine, sedating antidepressant, skeletal muscle relaxant, or various other agents). Since these now represent the majority of cases, new solutions are again needed. An interest in respiratory stimulants has been revived. This interest can be informed by a short review of the history of this interesting class of medications. We present a short history of the trajectory of advances toward more selective and safer respiratory stimulants.","Peppin, Pergolizzi, Fudin, Meyer, Raffa","https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S298607","20210423","carotid body; overdose; potassium channels; respiratory depression; respiratory stimulant","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13144,""
"Remote care for mental health: qualitative study with service users, carers and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic","To explore the experiences of service users, carers and staff seeking or providing secondary mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative interview study, codesigned with mental health service users and carers. We conducted semistructured, telephone or online interviews with a purposively constructed sample; a lived experience researcher conducted and analysed interviews with service users. Analysis was based on the constant comparison method. National Health Service (NHS) secondary mental health services in England between June and August 2020. Of 65 participants, 20 had either accessed or needed to access English secondary mental healthcare during the pandemic; 10 were carers of people with mental health difficulties; 35 were members of staff working in NHS secondary mental health services during the pandemic. Experiences of remote care were mixed. Some service users valued the convenience of remote methods in the context of maintaining contact with familiar clinicians. Most participants commented that a lack of non-verbal cues and the loss of a therapeutic 'safe space' challenged therapeutic relationship building, assessments and identification of deteriorating mental well-being. Some carers felt excluded from remote meetings and concerned that assessments were incomplete without their input. Like service users, remote methods posed challenges for clinicians who reported uncertainty about technical options and a lack of training. All groups expressed concern about intersectionality exacerbating inequalities and the exclusion of some service user groups if alternatives to remote care are lost. Though remote mental healthcare is likely to become increasingly widespread in secondary mental health services, our findings highlight the continued importance of a tailored, personal approach to decision making in this area. Further research should focus on which types of consultations best suit face-to-face interaction, and for whom and why, and which can be provided remotely and by which medium.","Liberati, Richards, Parker, Willars, Scott, Boydell, Pinfold, Martin, Dixon-Woods, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049210","20210423","COVID-19; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13145,""
"Religion and the World Health Organization: an evolving relationship","Much has been written about WHO. Relatively little is known, however, about the organisation's evolving relationship with health-related personal beliefs, 'faith-based organisations' (FBOs), religious leaders and religious communities ('religious actors'). This article presents findings from a 4-year research project on the 'spiritual dimension' of health and WHO conducted at the University of ZÃƒÂ¼rich. Drawing on archival research in Geneva and interviews with current and former WHO staff, consultants and programme partners, we identify three stages in this relationship. Although since its founding individuals within WHO occasionally engaged with religious actors, it was not until the 1970s, when the primary healthcare strategy was developed in consultation with the Christian Medical Commission, that their concerns began to influence WHO policies. By the early 1990s, the failure to roll out primary healthcare globally was accompanied by a loss of interest in religion within WHO. With the spread of HIV/AIDS however, health-related religious beliefs were increasingly recognised in the development of a major quality of life instrument by the Division of Mental Health, and the work of a WHO expert committee on cancer pain relief and the subsequent establishment of palliative care. While the 1990s saw a cooling off of activities, in the years since, the HIV/AIDS, Ebola and COVID-19 crises have periodically brought religious actors to the attention of the organisation. This study focusses on what we suggest may be understood as a trend towards a closer association between the activities of WHO and religious actors, which has occurred in fits and starts and is marked by attempts at institutional translation and periods of forgetting and remembering.","Winiger, Peng-Keller","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004073","20210423","health education and promotion; health systems; public health; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13146,""
"Investigating smoking and nicotine dependence among people with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic: analysis of linked data from a UK Closing the Gap cohort","Smoking rates are higher for people who use mental health services, which contributes substantially to health inequalities. Smoking can lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes, yet it remains unclear whether smoking has changed for people who use mental health services. We examined smoking patterns in a large clinical cohort of people with severe mental illness, before and during the pandemic. We found high levels of nicotine dependence and heavier patterns of smoking. Although some people had reported quitting, it is likely that smoking inequalities have become further entrenched. Mental health services should seek to mitigate this modifiable risk and source of poor health.","Peckham, Allgar, Crosland, Heron, Johnston, Newbronner, Ratschen, Spanakis, Wadman, Walker, Gilbody","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.45","20210423","COVID-19; Severe mental illness; schizophrenia; smoking; smoking cessation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-24","",13147,""
