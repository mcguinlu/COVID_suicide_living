"The effect of structured virtual patient visits (sVPVs) on COVID-19 patients and relatives' anxiety levels in intensive care unit","To determine the effect of structured Virtual Patient Visits (sVPVs) on the anxiety, satisfaction, hospital anxiety and depression levels of intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients and their relatives. There is no evidence regarding the direct effect of virtual patient visits in the ICU. The STROBE statement guided this study. This investigator-initiated, prospective and single-centre study included COVID-19 patients and their relatives in an adult ICU between July and December 2020. We implemented daily sVPVs between all patients and their relatives. The study's primary outcome was the daily anxiety levels of patients and relatives immediately before and after sVPVs. The secondary outcomes were as follows: 1) hospital anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) levels during admission to and after discharge from the ICU and 2) satisfaction levels regarding the ICU and sVPVs of patients' relatives. A total number of 301 daily sVPVs were conducted between 50 patients and their relatives. There was a significant difference between daily anxiety levels before and after sVPVs in both patients (2.97 vs. 1.49) and their relatives (5.70 vs. 3.53; pÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â .05). Whereas the anxiety levels of patients with basic face or high flow nasal cannula and non-invasive mechanical ventilation decreased statistically significantly more than those with IMV after a sVPV (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), there was not a significant difference in decreased anxiety levels of patients' relatives according to the type of respiratory support provided to the patient (pÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â .05). HADS-A levels of relatives decreased statistically significantly after discharge/death. There was no statistically significant difference in HADS-A and HADS-D levels after discharge/death between the relatives of patients who died or did not die (pÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â .05). Furthermore, the overall ICU satisfaction rates were statistically significantly lower in relatives of patients who died than those who did not die (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). Regardless of whether the patients were intubated, sVPVs reduced the anxiety levels of all patients and relatives. The sVPV programme offered emotional support to patients and family members, with high levels of satisfaction, as well as provided regular informative updates and the opportunity for daily visits or final goodbyes. The sVPV programme is essential for all ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","KebapcÃ„Â±, TÃƒÂ¼rkmen","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16117","20211127","coronavirus; critical care; intensive care units; nursing; relatives; virtual patient visit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","",22847,""
"Anxiety, resilience and local conditions: A cross-cultural investigation in the time of Covid-19","The spread of Covid-19 is a worldwide phenomenon, unprecedented in modern times. Differences among countries in such matters are of interest as they provide a unique window to understand human behaviour and culture. The aim of this study is to examine cross-cultural differences in state anxiety, and any moderating role of resilience and social contact. Participants from three countries were recruited: Ireland (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 449), Italy (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 324) and Spain (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 471). While these countries share many characteristics, it was anticipated that their experiences might differ because of pronounced differences in governmental measures and the local severity and history of the pandemic at the time of data collection. Results indicated that: (a) Resilience was negatively related to state anxiety both bivariately and multivariately; (b) number of hours outside per week did not predict state anxiety but was negatively correlated with fear of contagious diseases in the essential workers from the Irish sample; (c) national measures had a moderating role in the relationship between resilience and state anxiety; and (d) social contact, in terms of numbers of written, audio or visual interactions, was not a statistically significant predictor of state anxiety. These results may help to understand the adverse impact on mental health.","Moret-Tatay, Murphy","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12822","20211127","Covid-19; Cross-cultural; Local conditions; Resilience; Social contact; State anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","",22848,""
"Stress, Psychological Distress and Organisational Support in a Health and Social Care Organisation during Covid-19: A Research Study","The main aim of this study was to understand what health and wellbeing initiatives are helpful for healthcare workers' stress and psychological distress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Healthcare workers are at increased risk of poor mental health during health emergencies; understanding support required for healthcare workers' is of paramount importance. Participants were healthcare workers at a health and social care organisation (N = 159). The study included an online questionnaire including an evaluation of health and wellbeing initiatives and measures of perceived stress and psychological distress. The highest rated resources were counselling, personal protective equipment (PPE), and Covid-19 testing. Those who accessed yoga reported significantly less stress and psychological distress than those who did not access yoga. Healthcare workers with higher stress and psychological distress felt less supported by their organisation, less listened to and less involved in organisational decisions. Practical implications are discussed such as forward planning for health emergencies (e.g., PPE supply), accessible Covid-19 testing as well as budgeting for counselling services and exercise classes. In addition, targeted support for those diagnosed with Covid-19 is recommended, alongside involvement of staff members in organisational decisions.","Ollis, Shanahan","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13526","20211127","Covid-19; distress; health; organisation; stress; support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","",22849,""
"Change in Japanese children's 24-hour movement guidelines and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Specialized guidelines are required for the health behaviors of vulnerable populations such as children. This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, wherein major lifestyle changes have occurred, especially among young children. The present study aims to use longitudinal data to understand changes in the physical activity, screen time, sleep, and mental health of preschoolers in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to pre-pandemic period. Subjective and objective measures were used to assess the variables of interest longitudinally. It was found that physical activity, adherence to WHO-recommended screen time, and prosocial behaviors decreased significantly. On the other hand, sedentary time and hyperactivity increased. Our results are consistent with findings from other countries. The implications with respect to outdoor playtime, screen-time in the context of online learning during the pandemic, and the effects of parents' mental health on preschool-aged children are discussed.","Hyunshik, Jiameng, Sunkyoung, Ying","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-01803-4","20211127","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","",22850,""
"Identification of the most vulnerable populations in the psychosocial sphere: a cross-sectional study conducted in Catalonia during the strict lockdown imposed against the COVID-19 pandemic","A cross-sectional study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the psychosocial sphere in both the general population and healthcare workers (HCWs). The study was conducted in Catalonia (Spain) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when strict lockdown was in force. The study population included all people aged over 16 years who consented to participate in the study and completed the survey, in this case a 74-question questionnaire shared via social media using snowball sampling. A total of 56Ã¢â‚¬â€°656 completed survey questionnaires were obtained between 3 and 19 April 2020.The primary and secondary outcome measures included descriptive statistics for the non-psychological questions and the psychological impact of the pandemic, such as depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder question scores. A n early and markedly negative impact on family finances, fear of working with COVID-19 patients and ethical issues related to COVID-19 care among HCWs was observed. A total of seven target groups at higher risk of impaired mental health and which may therefore benefit from an intervention were identified, namely women, subjects aged less than 42 years, people with a care burden, socioeconomically deprived groups, people with unskilled or unqualified jobs, patients with COVID-19 and HCWs working with patients with COVID-19. Active implementation of specific strategies to increase resilience and to prepare an adequate organisational response should be encouraged for the seven groups identified as high risk and susceptible to benefit from an intervention.

"Effect of universal varicella vaccination and behavioral changes against coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the incidence of herpes zoster","Since 2014, universal varicella vaccination has reduced the varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) incidence in vaccine recipients and increased the incidence in the child-rearing generation until 2017. This study aimed to understand the future epidemiologic trends of HZ after the disappearance of varicella epidemics and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The Miyazaki Dermatologist Society has been monitoring and analyzing the incidence of HZ patients after universal vaccination since 1997. The HZ incidence in Oka varicella vaccine recipients aged 0-4 years decreased with the reduction in chickenpox incidence. The HZ incidence among those aged 5-9 years increased between 2015 and 2017 and decreased thereafter. From 2014-2020, the HZ incidence continued to increase to 36.6%, 51.3%, 70.2%, 56.7%, and 27.3% among those aged 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-59 years, respectively. The HZ incidence in patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 60 years increased by 2.3% annually from 2014 to 2020, corresponding to an annual 2% increase since 1997, and was unaffected by varicella epidemics. COVID-19 infection control measures, lifestyle changes and the resulting stress did not affect the HZ incidence in 2020. Universal varicella vaccination eliminated varicella epidemics, and HZ was reduced in vaccine recipients. The HZ incidence for those aged 10-59 years increased from 2014 to 2020, in contrast to those aged Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 60 years, which is attributable to booster immunity expiration due to varicella contact in this age group.","Shiraki, Toyama, Tanaka, Ito, Yamamoto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2021.10.007","20211127","COVID-19; Epidemiology; Herpes zoster; Herpes zoster vaccine; Universal varicella vaccination; Varicella","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","",22852,""
"Impacts of COVID-19 and partial lockdown on family functioning, intergenerational communication and associated psychosocial factors among young adults in Singapore","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our daily lives. Most of the working adults adopted the work-from-home arrangement while students shifted to home-based learning. Being confined together allows families to foster stronger bonds. On the other hand, the on-going pandemic could have negative impacts on family relationships. The COVID-19 outbreak is still on-going worldwide, understanding more about the changes in family functioning and its associated psychological impacts in a pandemic would allow the authorities to provide more targeted support to families. This study aimed to examine the factors associated with family functioning among young adults in Singapore duringÃ‚Â the COVID-19 pandemic. Family functioning refers to theÃ‚Â quality of interactions among family members, and consists of cohesion, flexibility and communication. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted (NÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°390). The Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale Short Form (FACES-IV-SF) and Global Perceptions of Intergenerational Communication Scale (GPIC) were used to examine family functioning and intergeneration communication during the partial lockdown. Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), Social Support Questionnaire-Brief (SSQ-B), Perceived Stress Scale 4 (PSS), UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) examined the psychosocial impact. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and regression model were employed in the analysis. The FACES-IV-SF score for total circumplex ratio has a mean of 1.57(SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.58), suggesting that participants generally perceived their families as functioning relatively well. The mean scores for CESD, PSS, Loneliness and BRCS were 12.4(6.2), 8.0(2.6), 5.7(1.9) and 12.6(3.1) respectively. The mean scores of the 4 domains of GPIC were 21.5(4.0) for Accommodation, 25.0(6.7) for Non-Accommodation, 17.2(3.3) for Respect-Obligation, and 18.9(4.8) for Avoidant. The results suggested that family functioning is significantly associated with intergenerational communication and satisfaction with social support in a pandemic. Participants with balanced levels of cohesion and flexibility in their families are more likely to be able to cope with the psychological impacts of the pandemic. The findings serve to inform intervention and preventive efforts to improve family functioning and reduce the risk of psychological distress in a pandemic.","Tam, Poon, Mahendran, Kua, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03599-z","20211127","COVID-19; Family functioning; Intergenerational communication; Psychological well-being; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","",22853,""

"The Role of School Connectedness in Supporting the Health and Well-Being of Youth: Recommendations for School Nurses","The importance of students feeling connected in school cannot be overstated, as this perception is crucial to support their health and well-being. A lack of school connectedness can lead to adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including bully victimization. Numerous factors, including individual, social, and environmental, influence students' perceived sense of school connectedness. School nurses are well positioned to establish and maintain school connectedness due to their knowledge, accessibility to students, and familiarity with the school environment.

"Mental Well-Being during COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study of Fly-In Fly-Out Workers in the Mining Industry in Australia","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has devastated the world, and its mental health impact has been recognized in the general population. However, little is known about the mental health impact of COVID-19 on fly-in fly-out (FIFO) workers, who are flown to temporarily stay and work in remote areas, during this pandemic. This study examined the mental well-being of FIFO workers in the mining industry during COVID-19 restrictions in Western Australia. An online survey was conducted between May to November 2020 among (<i>N</i> = 842) FIFO workers who underwent COVID-19 screening at a large mining company in Western Australia. The mental well-being score among workers was higher than population norms. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests showed significant differences in mental well-being by age, being placed under travel quarantine, undertaking self-isolation, impact of social distance guidelines, and experience of COVID-19 related symptoms. Multiple linear regression analysis showed workers who were younger, placed under travel quarantine and experienced two or more COVID-19 related symptoms were more likely to have worse mental well-being. Acknowledging the negative emotions and distress experiences among the vulnerable groups could help in providing suitable support to help lessen these negative experiences in FIFO workers.","Asare, Thomas, Affandi, Schammer, Brown, Pilbeam, Harris, Ellison, Kwasnicka, Powell, Reid, Robinson","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182212264","20211127","Australia; COVID-19; FIFO; fly-in fly-out; mental health; mental well-being; mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","",22856,""

"Barriers and Facilitators to Resuming In-Person Psychotherapy with Perinatal Patients amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multistakeholder Perspective","During the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient psychotherapy transitioned to telemedicine. This study aimed to examine barriers and facilitators to resuming in-person psychotherapy with perinatal patients as the pandemic abates. We conducted focus group and individual interviews with a sample of perinatal participants (<i>n</i> = 23), psychotherapy providers (<i>n</i> = 28), and stakeholders (<i>n</i> = 18) from Canada and the U.S. involved in the SUMMIT trial, which is aimed at improving access to mental healthcare for perinatal patients with depression and anxiety. Content analysis was used to examine perceived barriers and facilitators. Reported barriers included concerns about virus exposure in a hospital setting (77.8% stakeholders, 73.9% perinatal participants, 71.4% providers) or on public transportation (50.0% stakeholders, 26.1% perinatal participants, 25.0% providers), wearing a mask during sessions (50.0% stakeholders, 25.0% providers, 13.0% participants), lack of childcare (66.7% stakeholders, 46.4% providers, 43.5% perinatal participants), general transportation barriers (50.0% stakeholders, 47.8% perinatal participants, 25.0% providers), and the burden of planning and making time for in-person sessions (35.7% providers, 34.8% perinatal participants, 27.8% stakeholders). Reported facilitators included implementing and communicating safety protocols (72.2% stakeholders, 47.8% perinatal participants, 39.3% providers), conducting sessions at alternative or larger locations (44.4% stakeholders, 32.1% providers, 17.4% perinatal participants), providing incentives (34.8% perinatal participants, 21.4% providers, 11.1% stakeholders), and childcare and flexible scheduling options (31.1% perinatal participants, 16.7% stakeholders). This study identified a number of potential barriers and illustrated that COVID-19 has fostered and amplified barriers. Future interventions to facilitate resuming in-person sessions should focus on patient-centered strategies based on empathy regarding ongoing risk-aversion among perinatal patients despite existing safety protocols, and holistic thinking to make access to in-person psychotherapy easier and more accessible for perinatal patients.","Andrejek, Hossain, Schoueri-Mychasiw, Saeed, Zibaman, Puerto NiÃƒÂ±o, Meltzer-Brody, Silver, Vigod, Singla","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182212234","20211127","COVID-19; barriers; facilitators; perinatal depression and anxiety; psychotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","",22858,""
"The Effect of the COVID-19 Lockdown on the Position-Specific Match Running Performance of Professional Football Players; Preliminary Observational Study","The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted professional football in the 2019/2020 season, and football experts anticipate that the consequences of lockdown measures will negatively affect the physical performance of players once competition restarts. This study aimed to evaluate position-specific match running performance (MRP) to determine the effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on the physical performance of professional football players. Players' MRPs (<i>n</i> = 124) were observed in matches before and after the COVID-19 lockdown in the 2019/2020 season of the highest level of national competition in Croatia and were classified according to player position: central defenders (CD; <i>n</i> = 42), fullbacks (FB; <i>n</i> = 20), midfielders (MF; <i>n</i> = 46), and forwards (FW; <i>n</i> = 16). The MRPs were measured using Global Positioning System, and included the total distance covered, low-intensity running (Ã¢â€°Â¤14.3 km/h), running (14.4-19.7 km/h), high-intensity running (Ã¢â€°Â¥19.8 km/h), total accelerations (&gt;0.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>), high-intensity accelerations (&gt;3 m/s<sup>2</sup>), total decelerations (less than -0.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>), and high-intensity decelerations (less than -3 m/s<sup>2</sup>). The results indicated that, in matches after the COVID-19 lockdown, (i) CDs and FBs featured lower running and high-intensity running (t-value: from 2.05 to 3.51; all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; moderate to large effect sizes), (ii) MFs covered a greater distance in low-intensity running and achieved a lower number of total accelerations, and total and high-intensity decelerations (t-value: from -3.54 to 2.46; all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, moderate to large effect sizes), and (iii) FWs featured lower high-intensity running (t-value = 2.66, <i>p</i> = 0.02, large effect size). These findings demonstrate that the physical performances of football players from the Croatian first division significantly decreased in matches after the COVID-19 lockdown. A combination of inadequate adaptation to football-specific match demands and a crowded schedule after the competition was restarted most likely resulted in such an effect.","Sekulic, Versic, Decelis, Castro-PiÃƒÂ±ero, Javorac, Dimitric, Idrizovic, Jukic, Modric","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182212221","20211127","SARS-CoV-2; match demands; match running performance; soccer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","",22859,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cancer Patient's Management-Lithuanian Cancer Center Experience","The pandemic spread of the COVID-19 virus significantly affected daily life, but the highest pressure was piled on the health care system. Our aim was to evaluate an impact of COVID-19 pandemic management measures on cancer services at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of Lithuania. We assessed the time period from 1 February 2020 to 31 December 2020 and compared it to the same period of 2019. Data for our analysis were extracted from the NCI Hospital Information System (HIS) and the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). Contingency table analysis and ANOVA were performed. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the cancer services provided by NCI. Reductions in diagnostic radiology (-16%) and endoscopy (-29%) procedures were accompanied by a decreased number of patients with ongoing medical (-30%), radiation (-6%) or surgical (-10%) treatment. The changes in the number of newly diagnosed cancer patients were dependent on tumor type and disease stage, showing a rise in advanced disease at diagnosis already during the early period of the first lockdown. The extent of out-patient consultations (-14%) and disease follow-up visits (-16%) was also affected by the pandemic, and only referrals to psychological/psychiatric counselling were increased. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the structure of cancer services by fostering the application of modified systemic anticancer therapy or hypofractionated radiotherapy. The most dramatic drop occurred in the number of patients participating in cancer prevention programs; the loss was 25% for colon cancer and 62% for breast cancer screening. Marked restriction in access to preventive cancer screening and overall reduction of the whole spectrum of cancer services may negatively affect cancer survival measures in the nearest future.","Dabkeviciene, Vincerzevskiene, Urbonas, Venius, Dulskas, Brasiuniene, Janulionis, Burneckis, Zileviciene, Tiskevicius, Vanseviciute-Petkeviciene, Usinskiene, Briediene, Bulotiene, Stratilatovas, Ostapenko, Gibaviciene, Karnas, Kekstaite, Navickiene, Ulys, Zalimas, Sruogis, Kardelis, Zaremba, Askinis, Cicenas, Tikuisis, Ciurliene, Jarmalaite","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111522","20211127","COVID-19 pandemic; cancer management; national lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","",22860,""
