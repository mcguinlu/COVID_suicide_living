"The immediate and longer-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of older adults in England","Objective To evaluate changes in mental health and wellbeing before and during the initial and later phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate whether patterns varied with age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Design Prospective cohort study. Participants English Longitudinal Study of Ageing cohort of 5146 community dwelling adults aged 52 years and older (53% women, average age 66.74 years, standard deviation 10.62) who provided data before the pandemic (2018-19) and at two occasions in 2020 (June-July and November-December). Main outcome measure Depression, poor quality of life, loneliness and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms increased from 12.5% pre-pandemic to 22.6% in June-July 2020, with a further rise to 28.5% in November-December. This was accompanied by increased loneliness and deterioration in quality of life. The prevalence of anxiety rose from 9.4% to 10.9% between June-July and November-December 2022. Women and non-partnered people experienced worse changes in mental health and wellbeing. Participants with less wealth had lowest levels of mental health before and during the pandemic. Higher socioeconomic groups had better mental health overall, but responded to the pandemic with more negative changes. Patterns of changes were similar across age groups, the only exception was for depression which showed a smaller increase in the 75+ age group than in the youngest age group (50-59 years). Conclusions These data showed that mental health and wellbeing continued to worsen as lockdown continued, and that socioeconomic inequalities persisted. Women and non-partnered people experienced greater deterioration in all mental health outcomes. The immediate provision of diagnosis of mental health problems and targeted psychological interventions should target and support sociodemographic groups of older people at higher risk of psychological distress.","Paola Zaninotto; Eleonora Iob; Panayotes Demakakos; Andrew Steptoe","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.30.21256385","20210503","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13397,""
"Uncovering the compounding effects of COVID-19 and racism on mental health disparities among biomedical PhD and MD students","The increasing visibility of mental health challenges for academic and graduate trainee populations has led to discussion of the role higher education institutions should play to address trainee mental health, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing racial injustice. To address the growing concern about training impacts on medical and biomedical doctoral trainee mental health, a cross-sectional study (n=957) was conducted using institutional annual survey data analyzed by type of training program, race/ethnicity, and survey year on measures of depression, anxiety, hazardous alcohol use, problems related to substance use, and suicidal ideation. Results indicated significant differences for rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, with biomedical doctoral trainees showing greater incidence than medical doctoral trainees, and underrepresented minority trainees showing greater incidence than well-represented trainees. The concerningly high rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among these trainee populations suggest that medical and biomedical doctoral training environments must be transformed in addition to expanding mental health support resources.","Allison Schad; Rebekah L.

"New cancer cases at the time of SARS-Cov2 pandemic and related public health policies: A persistent and concerning decrease long after the end of the national lockdown","The dissemination of SARS-Cov2 may have delayed the diagnosis of new cancers. This study aimed at assessing the number of new cancers during and after the lockdown. We prospectively collected the clinical data of the 11.4 million patients referred to the Assistance Publique HÃƒÂ´pitaux de Paris Teaching Hospital. We identified new cancer cases between 1st January 2018 and 31st September 2020Ã‚Â and compared indicators for 2018 and 2019 to 2020 with a focus on the French lockdown (17th March to 11th May 2020)Ã‚Â across cancer types and patient age classes. Between January and September, 28,348, 27,272 and 23,734 new cancer cases were identified in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The monthly median number of new cases reached 3168 (interquartile range, IQR, 3027; 3282), 3054 (IQR 2945; 3127) and 2723 (IQR 2085; 2,863) in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. From March 1st to May 31st, new cancer decreased by 30% in 2020 compared to the 2018-19 average; then by 9% from 1st June to 31st September. This evolution was consistent across all tumour types: -30% and -9% for colon, -27% and -6% for lung, -29% and -14% for breast, -33% and -12% for prostate cancers, respectively. For patients aged &lt;70 years, the decrease of colorectal and breast new cancers in April between 2018 and 2019 average and 2020 reached 41% and 39%, respectively. The SARS-Cov2 pandemic led to a substantial decrease in new cancer cases. Delays in cancer diagnoses may affect clinical outcomes in the coming years.","Kempf, LamÃƒÂ©, Layese, Priou, Chatellier, Chaieb, Benderra, Bellamine, Bey, BrÃƒÂ©ant, Galula, Taright, Tannier, Guyet, Salamanca, Audureau, Daniel, Tournigand","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.02.015","20210503","COVID-19; Early detection of cancer; Health policy; Incidence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13399,""
"Subjective Distress about COVID-19 and Its Social Correlates: Empirical Evidence from Hubei Province of China","The COVID-19 pandemic generates negative psychological effects such as distress. Social influences on subjective distress associated with COVID-19 remain understudied in the Chinese context. Wuhan with its surrounding areas in Hubei province was not only the locale where first COVID-19 cases were detected in the world but was also the hardest hit across China. Data from Hubei provide a unique opportunity to investigate COVID-19-related subjective distress and its social correlates. We use original data (N=3,465) from the General Social Survey on COVID-19 in Hubei, China, conducted in August 2020. Regression analysis is employed to examine the impact of socioeconomic status, family structure, and social policies on COVID-19-related subjective distress measured by the Impact of Event-Scale-Revised (IES-R). First, individuals with higher socioeconomic status are not more immune to distress, and actually it is those better-educated ones who are more distressed. Second, family structure influences distress. Divorced and widowed individuals are more prone to distress than those who are married or single. Those living with COVID-19-infected family members or living with a larger family are particularly more distressed. Third, stricter lockdown measures promote real and perceived protection and also increase individuals' psychological distance from the disease, thereby reducing subjective distress. The sample is not totally random so we should use caution when generalizing the findings to the general population. The findings contribute to our understanding of mental health disparity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain social groups are at a higher risk of distress than others.","Zhou, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.026","20210503","COVID-19; China; family; socioeconomic status; subjective distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13400,""
"Spontaneous face- and eye-touching: Infection risk versus potential microbiome gain","The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled a review of possible routes of microbial infection, of particular importance since the ocular surface is a likely portal of human Coronavirus invasion. As hand contamination is considered an important and potentially preventable factor for transmission, we have reviewed face touching in the context of a group of disorders known as the Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviours (BFRPs). Spontaneous face-touching is a poorly understood, atavistic, ingrained habit for humans, who engage in this activity approximately 26 times per hour. Nearly half of spontaneous face-touches involve mucous membranes, and one third of those involve the eyes. Historically the majority of research of this curious phenomenon has focused on psychological aspects, despite its pertinence to a range of anterior eye diseases such as keratoconus, trichotillomania and mucus-fishing syndrome. The ocular infectious sequelae through chiral auto-inoculation are well known for diseases including the conjunctivitides, herpetic keratitis, and papillomatosis. Furthermore, touches to the ocular mucous membranes also play an important role in systemic disease through access to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts via the nasolacrimal duct and nasopharynx, and may be relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through this access, chiral touches may also play a significant role in building and maintaining the microbiome, which has been increasingly implicated in ocular disease. This article reviews spontaneous self-touches, and their significant ramifications for ocular and systemic health and disease.","Spencer, Francis, Coroneo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtos.2021.04.008","20210503","Behavioural Medicine; Infectious disease; Microbiology; Microbiome; Ocular pathology; Ocular surface disease; Ophthalmology; Self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13401,""
"Post-infection depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms: A prospective cohort study in patients with mild COVID-19","It remains unclear whether COVID-19 is associated with psychiatric symptoms during or after the acute illness phase. Being affected by the disease exposes the individual to an uncertain prognosis and a state of quarantine. These factors can predispose individuals to the development of mental symptoms during or after the acute phase of the disease. There is a need for prospective studies assessing psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the post-infection period. In this prospective cohort study, nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests were collected at patients' homes under the supervision of trained healthcare personnel. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were classified as mild cases (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯895) at treatment intake were further assessed for the presence of psychiatric symptoms (on average, 56.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯days after the intake). We investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 symptoms at intake and depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms approximately two months later, adjusting for previous mental health status, time between baseline and outcome, and other confounders. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear models were employed for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. A clinically significant level of depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were reported by 26.2% (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯235), 22.4% (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯201), and 17.3% (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯155) of the sample. Reporting an increased number of COVID-related symptoms was associated with the presence of clinically significant levels of depressive (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.059;95%CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.002-1.119), anxiety (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.072;95%CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.012-1.134), and post-traumatic stress (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.092;95%CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.024-1.166) symptoms. Sensitivity analyses supported findings for both continuous and categorical measures. Exposure to an increased number of COVID-19 symptoms may be associated with depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms after the acute phase of the disease. These patients should be monitored for the development of psychiatric symptoms after COVID-19 treatment discharge. Early interventions, such as brief interventions of psychoeducation on coping strategies, could benefit these individuals.","Ismael, Bizario, Battagin, Zaramella, Leal, Torales, Ventriglio, Marziali, Martins, Castaldelli-Maia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110341","20210503","Anxiety; Brazil; COVID-19; Depression; PTSD; Patient","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13402,""
"Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients Treated with Convalescent Plasma or Remdesivir Alone and in Combination at a Community Hospital in California's Central Valley","The purpose of this study was to compare how treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) monotherapy, remdesivir (RDV) monotherapy, and combination therapy (CP + RDV) in patients with COVID-19 affected clinical outcomes. Patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the hospital received CP, RDV, or combination of both. Mortality, discharge disposition, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and total ventilation days were compared between each treatment group and stratified by ABO blood group. An exploratory analysis identified risk factors for mortality. Adverse effects were also evaluated. RDV monotherapy showed an increased chance of survival compared to combination therapy or CP monotherapy (p = 0.052). There were 15, 3, and 6 deaths in the CP, RDV, and combination therapy groups, respectively. The combination therapy group had the longest median ICU LOS (8, IQR 4.5-15.5, p = 0.220) and hospital LOS (11, IQR 7-15.5, p = 0.175). Age (p = 0.036), initial SOFA score (p = 0.013), and intubation (p = 0.005) were statistically significant predictors of mortality. Patients with type O blood had decreased ventilation days, ICU LOS, and total LOS. Thirteen treatment-related adverse events occurred. No significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed between patients treated with RDV, CP, or combination therapy. Elderly patients, those with a high initial SOFA score, and those who require intubation are at increased risk of mortality associated with COVID-19. Blood type did not affect clinical outcomes.","Padilla, Arquiette, Mai, Singh, Galang, Liang","https://doi.org/10.18433/jpps31969","20210503","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13403,""

"Crisis Intervention Psychotherapy in the Age of COVID-19","Crisis intervention psychotherapy (CIP) is an underutilized form of therapy that can be offered as a treatment during psychiatric disasters and emergencies, and it may be especially useful during the age of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). CIP is a problem-solving, solution-focused, trauma-informed treatment, utilizing an individual or systemic/family-centered approach. CIP is a brief form of psychotherapy delivered as a companion or follow-up to psychological first aid. Crisis psychotherapy is designed to resolve a crisis and restore daily functioning. CIP can be adapted as a single session for a COVID-19 mental health emergency or for a hotline or as 2 to 20 sessions of treatment with COVID-19 patients and families offered virtually on a psychiatric inpatient unit, through a consultation-liaison service, or in outpatient settings. This article reviews the history of critical incident stress management and the use of its replacement, psychological first aid. The history and core principles of crisis psychotherapy and 8 core elements of treatment are described. The use of digital and virtual technology has enabled the delivery of crisis psychotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. A case study of a family impacted by COVID-19 is reported as an illustration. The use of a 6-week timeline, an ecological map, and a problem-solving wheel-and-spoke treatment plan are demonstrated.","Feinstein","https://doi.org/10.1097/PRA.0000000000000542","20210503","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13407,""
"Deaths and Severe Adverse Events after the use of Mifepristone as an Abortifacient from September 2000 to February 2019","Primary: Analyze the Adverse Events (AEs) reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after use of mifepristone as an abortifacient. Secondary: Analyze maternal intent after ongoing pregnancy and investigate hemorrhage after mifepristone alone. Adverse Event Reports (AERs) for mifepristone used as an abortifacient, submitted to the FDA from September 2000 to February 2019, were analyzed using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv3). The FDA provided 6158 pages of AERs. Duplicates, non-US, or AERs previously published (Gary, 2006) were excluded. Of the remaining, there were 3197 unique, US-only AERs of which there were 537 (16.80%) with insufficient information to determine clinical severity, leaving 2660 (83.20%) Codable US AERs. (Figure 1). Of these, 20 were Deaths, 529 were Life-threatening, 1957 were Severe, 151 were Moderate, and 3 were Mild. The deaths included: 9 (45.00%) sepsis, 4 (20.00%) drug toxicity/overdose, 1 (5.00%) ruptured ectopic pregnancy, 1 (5.00%) hemorrhage, 3 (15.00%) possible homicides, 1 (5.00%) suicide, 1 (5.00%) unknown. (Table 1). Retained products of conception and hemorrhage caused most morbidity. There were 75 ectopic pregnancies, including 26 ruptured ectopics (includes one death). There were 2243 surgeries including 2146 (95.68%) D&amp;Cs of which only 853 (39.75%) were performed by abortion providers. Of 452 patients with ongoing pregnancies, 102 (22.57%) chose to keep their baby, 148 (32.74%) had terminations, 1 (0.22%) miscarried, and 201 (44.47%) had unknown outcomes. Hemorrhage occurred more often in those who took mifepristone and misoprostol (51.44%) than in those who took mifepristone alone (22.41%). Significant morbidity and mortality have occurred following the use of mifepristone as an abortifacient. A pre-abortion ultrasound should be required to rule out ectopic pregnancy and confirm gestational age. The FDA AER system is inadequate and significantly underestimates the adverse events from mifepristone. A mandatory registry of ongoing pregnancies is essential considering the number of ongoing pregnancies especially considering the known teratogenicity of misoprostol. The decision to prevent the FDA from enforcing REMS during the COVID-19 pandemic needs to be reversed and REMS must be strengthened.","Aultman, Cirucci, Harrison, Beran, Lockwood, Seiler","https://www.google.com/search?q=Deaths+and+Severe+Adverse+Events+after+the+use+of+Mifepristone+as+an+Abortifacient+from+September+2000+to+February+2019.","20210503","Abortifacient; Abortion Pill; Adverse Event Reports; Adverse Events; DIY Abortion; Drug Safety; Emergency Medicine; FAERS; FDA; Medical Abortion; Medical Abortion Complications; Mifeprex; Mifepristone; Misoprostol; No touch abortion; Post-marketing Surveillance; REMS; RU-486; Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy; Self-Administered Abortion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13408,""
"The psychological effect of COVID-19 quarantine on Greek young adults: Risk factors and the protective role of daily routine and altruism","To save lives and slow the spread of COVID-19 Greece imposed a country-wide, 6-week lockdown and a stay-at-home order at an early stage. This study examines the effect of quarantine on young adults by assessing depression, anxiety, stress and the experience of positive and negative affect. The role of potential risk factors such as disruption of normal life, perceived threat of the disease, acquaintance with someone infected and gender; and protective factors, such as adherence to a daily routine and altruism was evaluated. An online questionnaire entailing demographics, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), measures of life disruption, perceived threat and adherence to a daily routine and an altruism scale was completed by 1018 undergraduates. Increased levels of depression, anxiety, stress and negative affect were found. Life disruption and perceived threat of the disease were risk factors in all psychological distress measures, while a stable, satisfying daily routine and altruism mitigated the negative consequences. Gender was a moderator. Acknowledging the psychological effect of quarantine on young adults should be the starting point for interventions. Helping people build a new routine and assign an altruistic meaning to the confinement can protect psychological health.","Kornilaki","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12767","20210503","Altruism; Life disruption; Mental health; Negative affects; Perceived threat","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13409,""
"Biopsychosocial processes of health and disease during the COVID-19 pandemic","The biopsychosocial model provides a useful perspective for understanding the development and characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic and its anticipated long-term consequences for society as well as individuals. This article provides a biopsychosocial perspective on the COVID pandemic and an editorial comment on the articles in this Special Issue of Psychosomatic Medicine. Based on analysis of the PubMed database, it is shown that the attention to psychological and social factors is 74% higher in COVID-19-related articles compared to all other health-related scientific articles published during the same time-period (between 1/1/2020 and 4/18/2021). Specifically, 18.6% of the Ã¢â€°Ë†123,500 articles addressing COVID-19-related topics also included psychological or social factors in their content vs. 10.7% of articles that did not address COVID-19. The biopsychosocial model is relevant to understanding the interrelationships among risk factors and the multidimensional clinical and psychosocial COVID-19 outcomes. Clinical outcomes directly related to COVID-19 range from severe but rare events (mortality and intensive care treatment) to less severe common outcomes such as positive screening tests for COVID-19 with or without symptoms. In addition, psychosocial outcomes range in severity from frequently observed reduced psychological wellbeing to less common clinical mood and anxiety disorders and, in rare cases, suicidality. The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by an unusually strong and short-term link between social factors and biological aspects of the disease, without mediating psychological factors. After a review of the articles presented in this Special Issue, this editorial concludes with suggestions for biopsychosocial models in research on COVID-19 and other large-scale health threats.","Kop","https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000954","20210503","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13410,""
"Referral patterns for specialist child and adolescent mental health services in the Republic of Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 2019 and 2018","Countries worldwide are experiencing a third wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Government-imposed restrictive measures continue with undetermined effects on physical and mental health. To compare child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) referrals over 11 months (January-November) in 2020, 2019 and 2018 and examine any impact the different phases of the COVID-19 restrictions might have on referral rates. Monthly CAMHS Health Service Executive data were examined, covering a catchment population of 260 560 or 12.7% of all youth (age group 0-18 years) in Ireland. The total number of urgent and routine referrals, appointments offered, rates of non-attendances and discharge outcome are presented. There was a significant drop in referrals in 2020, compared with prior years (Ãâ€¡2 = 10.3, d.f. = 2, P = 0.006). Referrals in 2020 dropped from March to May by 11% and from June to August by 10.3%. From September, both routine and urgent referrals increased by 50% compared with previous years (2018/2019), with the highest increase in November 2020 (180%). Clinic activity also increased from September, with double the number of out-patient appointments offered, compared with previous years (Ãâ€¡2 = 5171.72, d.f. = 3, P &lt; 0.001) and lower (6.6%) rates of non-attendance (Ãâ€¡2 = 868.35, d.f. = 3, P &lt; 0.001). In 2020, following an initial decline, referrals to CAMHS increased consistently from September. Such unprecedented increase in referrals places further strain on services that are already underresourced and underfunded, with the likelihood of increased waiting lists post COVID-19.

"Pivotal &quot;New Normal&quot; Telemedicine: secured psychiatric homeopathy medicine transmission in Post-COVID","In this Post-COVID-19 &quot;New Normal&quot; era, the importance of Telemedicine is immense. In telemedicine, the patients' sensitive medical data security is the matter of highest demands. There exists data transmission between the psychiatric patients and psychiatrists through web-based portal. Cryptography is the essential component where medical data is transmitted securely. Insomnia, Depression, Mood swings, Fear of death, etc are the common mental conditions observed in this COVID-19 pandemic. A symmetric key based on randomization of numbers were generated by a reliable and third party Key Distribution Centre. A set of robust binary sequences of 128 bits long were generated, known as secret session keys, and will be transported to both the parties. The web-portal will capture all the patients' symptoms. Then homeopathy E-Prescriptions would be generated by the psychiatrists. This transmission of E-Prescription would be done using the proposed secret session key using Advanced Encryption Standards. Ignatia, Natrum Sulphuricum, Aconite, Arsenicum Album, Belladonna, etc are the important homeopathy medicines as prescribed by the homeopathy psychiatrists in COVID-19. Mathematical calculations were done on this proposed technique with positive efficacy. Hence, homeopathy telemedicine is the pivotal way to cure psychiatric patients remotely in this Post-COVID-19 &quot;New Normal&quot; context.","Dey","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41870-021-00675-1","20210503","Encryption time; Homeopathy E-prescription; Psychiatric diseases; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13412,""

"Challenges and Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Asylum Seeker Health at the US-Mexico Border","<b>Purpose:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents health care challenges to asylum seekers living in congregate encampments, including those along the U.S.-Mexico border. It is necessary to understand the impact of the pandemic among this population to address health care needs, reduce transmission, and diminish COVID-19-related morbidity. <b>Methods:</b> Thirty interviews were conducted with asylum seekers and health care professionals in a temporary camp in Matamoros, Mexico to determine challenges, perceptions, and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were coded in NVivo12 by using a team-based approach. <b>Results:</b> The pandemic caused significant mental health burdens but no perceived adverse physical effects, with the U.S. border closure and health care access barriers as more pressing concerns. Participants reported access to information about COVID-19 but had varied levels of knowledge and adherence to disease reduction strategies due to camp conditions. Most participants believed that they had special protection from COVID-19, including strong immune systems or from God. The nongovernmental organizations providing health care and sanitation faced multiple challenges to implement new policies to manage COVID-19. The institution of required temperature checks and quarantine of COVID-19 positive patients led to distrust, decreased seeking of health care services among asylum seekers, and possible underreporting of COVID-19 cases. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings among asylum seekers in a Matamoros camp highlight the challenges to implementing disease reduction policies in low-resource congregate camps. Policies to address disease outbreaks focusing on the social determinants of health, health care access barriers, and community engagement may be more acceptable to asylum seekers, suggesting the need for effective strategies to provide prevention information that complements such measures.","Reynolds, Ramanathan, Lorenzana, Das, Sagal, Lozada-Soto, Deda, Haque, Schmitzberger, Quiroga, Raven, Heisler","https://doi.org/10.1089/heq.2020.0110","20210503","COVID-19; U.S.-Mexico border; asylum health care; global health; health care services delivery; immigrant health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13414,""
"Increased Oxidative Stress in the Prefrontal Cortex as a Shared Feature of Depressive- and PTSD-Like Syndromes: Effects of a Standardized Herbal Antioxidant","Major depression (MD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) share common brain mechanisms and treatment strategies. Nowadays, the dramatically developing COVID-19 situation unavoidably results in stress, psychological trauma, and high incidence of MD and PTSD. Hence, the importance of the development of new treatments for these disorders cannot be overstated. Herbal medicine appears to be an effective and safe treatment with fewer side effects than classic pharmaca and that is affordable in low-income countries. Currently, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation attract increasing attention as important mechanisms of MD and PTSD. We investigated the effects of a standardized herbal cocktail (SHC), an extract of clove, bell pepper, basil, pomegranate, nettle, and other plants, that was designed as an antioxidant treatment in mouse models of MD and PTSD. In the MD model of &quot;emotional&quot; ultrasound stress (US), mice were subjected to ultrasound frequencies of 16-20 kHz, mimicking rodent sounds of anxiety/despair and &quot;neutral&quot; frequencies of 25-45 kHz, for three weeks and concomitantly treated with SHC. US-exposed mice showed elevated concentrations of oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl, increased gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1ÃŽÂ² and IL-6 and other molecular changes in the prefrontal cortex as well as weight loss, helplessness, anxiety-like behavior, and neophobia that were ameliorated by the SHC treatment. In the PTSD model of the modified forced swim test (modFST), in which a 2-day swim is followed by an additional swim on day 5, mice were pretreated with SHC for 16 days. Increases in the floating behavior and oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl in the prefrontal cortex of modFST-mice were prevented by the administration of SHC. Chromatography mass spectrometry revealed bioactive constituents of SHC, including D-ribofuranose, beta-D-lactose, malic, glyceric, and citric acids that can modulate oxidative stress, immunity, and gut and microbiome functions and, thus, are likely to be active antistress elements underlying the beneficial effects of SHC. Significant correlations of malondialdehyde concentration in the prefrontal cortex with altered measures of behavioral despair and anxiety-like behavior suggest that the accumulation of oxidative stress markers are a common biological feature of MD and PTSD that can be equally effectively targeted therapeutically with antioxidant therapy, such as the SHC investigated here.","de Munter, Pavlov, Gorlova, Sicker, Proshin, Kalueff, Svistunov, Kiselev, Nedorubov, Morozov, Umriukhin, Lesch, Strekalova, Schroeter","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.661455","20210503","antioxidant nutrients; depression; forced swimming; mice; oxidative stress; post-traumatic stress disorder; prefrontal cortex; pro-inflammatory cytokines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13415,""
"Health and Well-Being of Athletes During the Coronavirus Pandemic: A Scoping Review","<b>Background:</b> The ongoing global pandemic has become the world's leading health problem, causing massive public fear and concern. Reports suggest that athletes are seeking mental health support, showing the pressures of boredom, and tension associated with their anticipated social isolation. The current study seeks to evaluate the evidence regarding the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on occupational stress in professional athletes. <b>Method:</b> A scoping review was conducted. A comprehensive search involving Embase and PubMed databases was conducted using a combination of the following key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, and athletes. In this study, articles were retained if they were original studies reporting on the impact of the pandemic on professional athletes. <b>Results:</b> Nine studies were identified as they investigated the impact of the pandemic on athletes. Most were observational and cross-sectional, and one was longitudinal. Outcome measures mainly investigated were level of depression, anxiety, and stress. Dependent variables were physical activity, nutrition, mental state, sleep quality, individual well-being, social identity, exclusivity, negative affectivity, alcohol consumption, psychological distress, and gambling habits. <b>Conclusions:</b> This review highlights the need for proactive engagement with professional athletes, coaches, trainers, and sports councils to facilitate understanding and awareness-raising, process optimization, and delivery of consistent training and psychosocial aid and occupational therapy programs that maintain the health and well-being of athletes while minimizing occupational stress during a pandemic.","Haan, Ali Alblooshi, Syed, Dougman, Al Tunaiji, Campos, Baltatu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.641392","20210503","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; athletes; coronavirus; occupational stress; primary health care; psychosocial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13416,""
"Strange Days: Adult Physical Activity and Mental Health in the First Two Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> In addition to its physical health benefits, physical activity is increasingly recognized as a means to support mental health. Regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is associated with improved mental well-being, reduced likelihood of developing mental illness, and improved symptom management. Despite these benefits, most people fail to achieve minimum recommended levels of MVPA. Population levels of physical activity have further declined since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of public health measures (e.g., shelter-in-place protocols). The potential impact of this decline on mental heath outcomes warrants ongoing investigation. <b>Purpose:</b> To investigate associations between changes in MVPA and mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and life satisfaction) in adults impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Method:</b> Research followed a cross-sectional design. English-speaking adults were invited to complete an online questionnaire. MVPA was assessed retrospectively (before COVID-19) and currently (during COVID-19) with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Mental health was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-Item (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 7-Item (GAD-7), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Regression was used to assess relationships between MVPA and mental health. ANOVA with follow-up tests examined whether participants who differed in mental health status (e.g., no symptoms vs. severe symptoms) differed in their change in MVPA. <i>T</i>-tests were used to examine differences in mental health symptomatology between participants who were sufficiently (i.e., achieving MVPA guidelines of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 150 min/week) vs. insufficiently active. <b>Results:</b> Prior to COVID-19, 68.2% of participants were classified as being sufficiently active, vs. 60.6% during COVID-19. The majority of participants reported experiencing some level of depressive symptoms (62.0%) or anxiety symptoms (53.7%). After controlling for covariates, changes in MVPA accounted for significant variability in the PHQ-9 (7.7%), GAD-7 (2.5%), and SWLS (1.5 %). Participants with clinically significant mental health symptomatology reported greater declines in MVPA than those who reported no symptoms. Conversely, participants who were sufficiently active during COVID-19 reported significantly lower depression and anxiety, and higher life satisfaction. <b>Conclusion:</b> Participants who experienced the greatest declines in MVPA reported relatively greater psychological distress and lower life satisfaction. While preliminary, these findings suggest the importance of maintaining and promoting physical activity during a period of pandemic.","Gierc, Riazi, Fagan, Di Sebastiano, Kandola, Priebe, Weatherson, Wunderlich, Faulkner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.567552","20210503","anxiety; depression; life satisfaction; moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13417,""
"Italia Ti Ascolto [Italy, I am listening]: an app-based group psychological intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic","The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted individuals' psychological wellbeing resulting in heightened perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. However, a significant issue in accessing psychological care during a lockdown is the lack of access to in-person interventions. In this regard, research has shown the efficacy and utility of psychological app-based interventions. 'Italia Ti Ascolto' (ITA) has been developed as a population tailored internet-based intervention to offer an online professional solution for psychological support needs. The ITA app is available on iOS and Android systems. Users completed a baseline assessment on emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), psychological stress, anxiety, depression, and perceived social support. Participants could select among several one-hour long clinical groups held by expert psychotherapists. After every session, people were asked to complete a quick users' satisfaction survey. Our contribution presents ITA's intervention protocol and discusses preliminary data on psychological variables collected at baseline. Data showed significant associations between emotion regulation strategies, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and level of stress. Moreover, the role of perceived social support is considered. Future developments and implications for clinical practice and treatment are discussed.","Parolin, Benzi, Fanti, Milesi, Cipresso, Preti","https://doi.org/10.4081/ripppo.2021.517","20210503","COVID-19; E-mental health; groups; online psychological interventions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13418,""
"Living with primary immunodeficiency disease during the Covid-19 pandemic","The purpose of this survey study was to investigate the impact of Covid-19 on the lives of individuals living with primary immunodeficiency disease (PID). An online survey was distributed through social media to individuals with a diagnosis of PID to investigate behaviors and concerns during the Covid-19 pandemic. Five hundred and fifty seven responses were collected, of which 495 surveys were 100% complete; partial responses were analyzed. Respondents have been extremely cautious and have minimized their potential Covid-19 exposure risk. In this study, 56.6% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°289) participated in telehealth visits with the physician responsible for managing their PID during the Covid-19 pandemic. Respondents reported they would be somewhat comfortable with returning to normal activities if there was widespread herd immunity (40.9%, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°209), an effective vaccine (46.0%. <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°235), or public health protections (44.0%, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°225).

"Agitation and Dementia: Prevention and Treatment Strategies in Acute and Chronic Conditions","Agitation is a behavioral syndrome characterized by increased, often undirected, motor activity, restlessness, aggressiveness, and emotional distress. According to several observations, agitation prevalence ranges from 30 to 50% in Alzheimer's disease, 30% in dementia with Lewy bodies, 40% in frontotemporal dementia, and 40% in vascular dementia (VaD). With an overall prevalence of about 30%, agitation is the third most common neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia, after apathy and depression, and it is even more frequent (80%) in residents of nursing homes. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying agitation is represented by a frontal lobe dysfunction, mostly involving the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), respectively, meaningful in selecting the salient stimuli and subsequent decision-making and behavioral reactions. Furthermore, increased sensitivity to noradrenergic signaling has been observed, possibly due to a frontal lobe up-regulation of adrenergic receptors, as a reaction to the depletion of noradrenergic neurons within the locus coeruleus (LC). Indeed, LC neurons mainly project toward the OFC and ACC. These observations may explain the abnormal reactivity to weak stimuli and the global arousal found in many patients who have dementia. Furthermore, agitation can be precipitated by several factors, e.g., the sunset or low lighted environments as in the sundown syndrome, hospitalization, the admission to nursing residencies, or changes in pharmacological regimens. In recent days, the global pandemic has increased agitation incidence among dementia patients and generated higher distress levels in patients and caregivers. Hence, given the increasing presence of this condition and its related burden on society and the health system, the present point of view aims at providing an extensive guide to facilitate the identification, prevention, and management of acute and chronic agitation in dementia patients.","Carrarini, Russo, Dono, Barbone, Rispoli, Ferri, Di Pietro, Digiovanni, Ajdinaj, Speranza, Granzotto, Frazzini, Thomas, Pilotto, Padovani, Onofrj, Sensi, Bonanni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.644317","20210503","Alzheimer's Disease; COVID-19; Dementia with Lewy Bodies; Frontotemporal Dementia; Vascular Dementia; agitation; dementia; hyperkinetic delirium","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13422,""

This study examined the mediating roles of meaning-based coping and spiritual well-being in the link between coronavirus stress and subjective well-being in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample included 427 young adults (71% female), ranging in age between 18 and 48 years (<i>M</i> = 21.06; <i>SD</i> = 2.62). Turkish young adults completed an online survey, including measures of coronavirus stress, subjective well-being, meaning-based coping, and spiritual well-being. The results indicate that greater meaning-based coping and spiritual well-being mediated decreases in the adverse impacts of coronavirus stress on subjective well-being. These results suggest that the importance of a combination of meaning-based coping and spirituality processes mitigate the adverse effects of stress on well-being during the coronavirus pandemic.

This study investigates how exposure to and trust in information sources, and anxiety and depression, are associated with conspiracy and misinformation beliefs in eight countries/regions (Belgium, Canada, England, Philippines, Hong Kong, New Zealand, United States, Switzerland) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected in an online survey fielded from May 29, 2020 to June 12, 2020, resulting in a multinational representative sample of 8,806 adult respondents. Results indicate that greater exposure to traditional media (television, radio, newspapers) is associated with lower conspiracy and misinformation beliefs, while exposure to politicians and digital media and personal contacts are associated with greater conspiracy and misinformation beliefs. Exposure to health experts is associated with lower conspiracy beliefs only. Higher feelings of depression are also associated with greater conspiracy and misinformation beliefs.

"A Diary Study on When and With Whom Recovery Experiences Modulate Daily Stress and Worry During a COVID-19 Lockdown","In April 2020, almost six out of 10 people around the world were in lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Being locked down usually has a deleterious effect on the confined individual's mental health. In this exceptionally challenging context, finding ways to minimize negative mood about the pandemic is essential. Pandemic-related negative states (&quot;negative mood&quot;) and recovery experiences were investigated in a sample of 264 individuals who completed daily surveys four times per day over 7 consecutive days. MSEMs analyses revealed that negative mood persisted from moment-to-moment through the day, thus showing a response lag effect. Further analyses revealed that when someone experienced pandemic-related psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery, control, pleasure, or relatedness at specific periods of the day, mood had improved at the next measured time period, suggesting a protective effect. However, the pattern displayed by singles with dependents suggests that some recovery experiences at specific periods during the day seem to have a backfiring effect and worsen subsequent mood. These findings bring new insight into the role of recovery experiences during lockdowns and suggest that many could benefit from such experiences throughout the day when self-isolating. However, for individuals with multiple risk factors such as being single with dependents, some recovery experiences, at specific periods during the day, might not bring the desired outcome and future research is needed to examine if guilt or domestic burden may explain this finding. Results contribute to our understanding of how to take care of one's mental health during the current pandemic, and concrete recommendations adapted to individual contexts are provided.","MÃƒÂ©nard, Foucreault, Leduc, Meunier, TrÃƒÂ©panier","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.620349","20210503","COVID-19; coronavirus outbreak; lockdown; mental health; mood; pandemic; self-isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13426,""

Comparatively, females, nurses, first-line department, never exercised, and low income were risk factors for psychological symptoms. Social support including objective support, subjective support, support utility, and regular sports over 3 times per week were protective and manageable elements that could protect from and manage the psychological symptoms of medical staff. <b>Conclusion:</b> The susceptibility of psychological symptoms among medical staff should be of concern to policymakers and the public in the long-term, and the aggravation of mental health problems of medical staff could be eased by providing adequate social support during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.","Luo, Yao, Xi, Zhang, Li, Li, Wang, Zhong, Lv","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.603553","20210503","COVID-19; medical staff; protective elements; psychological symptoms; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13427,""

"Substance Use Disorders and Behavioral Addictions During the COVID-19 Pandemic and COVID-19-Related Restrictions","COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019 and appeared in the United States 1 month later. Between the onset of the pandemic and January 13, 2021, over 92 million people have tested positive for the virus and over 1.9 million people have died globally. Virtually every country in the world has been impacted by this virus. Beginning in March 2020, many U.S. state governments enforced a &quot;quarantine&quot; to respond to the growing health crisis. Citizens were required to remain at home; schools, restaurants, and non-essential businesses were forced to close, and large gatherings were prohibited. Americans' lives were transformed in a span of days as daily routines were interrupted and people were shuttered indoors. Mounting fear and unpredictability coupled with widespread unemployment and social isolation escalated anxiety and impacted the mental health of millions across the globe. Most (53%) U.S. adults reported that the coronavirus outbreak has had a negative impact on their mental health, including inducing or exacerbating use of alcohol, drugs, gambling and overeating as coping mechanisms. In this paper, we will examine substance use and addictive behaviors that have been used to manage the stress and uncertainty wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. We review the changing treatment landscape as therapy pivoted online and telemedicine became the norm.","Avena, Simkus, Lewandowski, Gold, Potenza","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.653674","20210503","COVID-19 pandemic; addictive behaviors; food addiction; gambling; mental health services; substance-related disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13429,""
"Workplace Violence Against Chinese Frontline Clinicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Associations With Demographic and Clinical Characteristics and Quality of Life: A Structural Equation Modeling Investigation","<b>Background:</b> Workplace violence is a major concern for clinicians worldwide. There has been little data on the epidemiology of workplace violence against frontline clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the pattern of workplace violence and its association with quality of life (QOL) against frontline clinicians during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in China. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional online study was conducted in China between March 15 and March 20, 2020. Frontline clinicians' experience with workplace violence was measured with six standardized questions derived from the Workplace Violence Scale, while anxiety, depressive, and insomnia symptoms, and QOL were measured using the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively. Univariate analyses, multivariable logistic regression analyses, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were conducted. <b>Results:</b> A total of 15,531 clinicians completed the assessment; 2,878 (18.5, 95% CI = 17.92-19.14%) reported workplace violence during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (verbal violence: 16.1%; physical violence: 6.9%). According to multivariable models, key correlates of workplace violence were male gender, longer work experience, higher education level, smoking, working in the psychiatry or emergency department, working in tertiary hospitals, being involved in direct care of infected patients, having infected family/ friends/ colleagues, and frequently using social communication programs. Clinicians working in inpatient departments were less likely to report workplace violence compared to those working in outpatient departments. SEM analysis revealed that both violence and emotional disturbances (anxiety, depression, and insomnia) directly affected QOL (standardized direct effect = -0.031, and -0.566, respectively, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), while emotional disturbances partly mediated the association between work violence and QOL (standardized indirect effect = -0.184, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Frontline clinicians were vulnerable to workplace violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the negative impact of workplace violence on quality of care and clinicians' QOL, health authorities and policymakers should take effective measures to reduce workplace violence against clinicians.","Yang, Li, An, Zhao, Zhang, Cheung, Hall, Ungvari, An, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.649989","20210503","COVID-19; clinician; frontline; violence; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13430,""
"Problematic Smartphone and Social Media Use Among Bangladeshi College and University Students Amid COVID-19: The Role of Psychological Well-Being and Pandemic Related Factors","<b>Background:</b> Smartphone and social media use are an integral part of our daily life. Currently, the impact of excessive smartphone and social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate problematic smartphone use (PSPU) and problematic social media use (PSMU) among Bangladeshi college and university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 5,511 Bangladeshi college and university students (male: 58.9%; mean age: 21.2 years [<i>SD</i> = 1.7]; age range: 18-25) during the social-distancing in the COVID-19 pandemic (July 2020). A self-reported survey containing questions regarding socio-demographic, lifestyle, and home quarantine activities along with four psychometric scales was completed by participants. <b>Results:</b> The mean scores of PSPU and PSMU were 20.8 Ã‚Â± 6.8 (out of 36) and 14.7 Ã‚Â± 4.8 (out of 30). Based on a hierarchical regression analysis, PSPU and PSMU were positively associated with lower age, poor sleep, social media use, watching television, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, PSMU was linked to being female, living with nuclear family, having urban residence, irregular physical exercise, poor engagement with academic studies, and avoiding earning activities, whilst being male, being married, living with lower-income family, and alcohol consumption were linked to PSMU. <b>Conclusions:</b> The findings indicate that PSPU and PSMU were linked to poor psychological well-being (i.e., anxiety and depression) and other factors (especially lower age, poor sleep) during the pandemic, further suggesting the need for interventions including virtual awareness programs among college and university students.","Islam, Sujan, Tasnim, Mohona, Ferdous, Kamruzzaman, Toma, Sakib, Pinky, Islam, Siddique, Anter, Hossain, Hossen, Sikder, Pontes","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.647386","20210503","Bangladesh; college; problematic use; smartphone; social media; students; university","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13431,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Among the General Population in Jordan","<b>Objective:</b> Pandemics are claimed to result in certain stressors. However, the potential psychological impact of a pandemic is often overlooked. The current study aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Jordanians and to evaluate the influence of the socio-demographic variables on this impact. <b>Method:</b> The current study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) via a web-based questionnaire. The researchers utilized convenience sampling which led to a total of 2,854 participants from the 12 governorates of Jordan. <b>Results:</b> The average score of the participants' responses on the IES-R questionnaire turned out to be 22.5 Ã‚Â± 11.7. Females were found to have more than double the odds of having an increased IES-R score [odds ratio (OR) = 2.2, confidence interval (CI) = 1.76-2.67] and participants who were older than 65 years had triple the odds of having the same risk compared to young adults aged 18-25 years (OR = 3.1, CI = 1.3-7.4). Significantly, having a family member diagnosed with COVID-19 placed individuals at a 7-fold higher risk of having an increased IRS-R score compared to their counterparts who did not have a family member diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR = 7, CI = 3.7-13.3). <b>Conclusion:</b> COVID-19 pandemic has imposed significant level of psychological burden on Jordanians, especially among females. Governments should collaborate with psychiatrists, mental health professionals and local institutions to offer high-quality, timely crisis-oriented psychological services to the affected individuals for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khatatbeh, Khasawneh, Hussein, Altahat, Alhalaiqa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.618993","20210503","COVID-19; anxiety; mental health; psychological; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13432,""
"Negative Appraisals of the COVID-19 Social Impact Associated With the Improvement of Depression and Anxiety in Patients After COVID-19 Recovery","<b>Objective:</b> Little is known about the factors affecting the recovery of mental health in COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this study is to look into the change of psychological distress and to explore the role of negative appraisals in the improvement of psychological distress in COVID-19 patients after they recovered from the infection. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a longitudinal survey on patients with COVID-19 infection in Changsha. The 9-item Patient Health scale, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, and a newly developed measure, the COVID-19 Impact Scale (CIS) were applied to assess patients' depression, anxiety, and negative appraisal toward COVID-19 infection during their hospitalization and 1 month post-discharge. <b>Results:</b> Seventy-two patients were included in the analysis. A significant decrease in anxiety and depression levels was observed after patients were discharged from hospital. Two meaningful factors of the CIS were extracted based on factor analysis, namely &quot;health impact,&quot; and &quot;social impact.&quot; The change of social impact explained the 12.7 and 10.5% variance in the depression and anxiety symptom improvement, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> Change in negative appraisals, especially the appraisals related to COVID-19 social impact may play a vital role in the relief of psychological distress of infected patients. Therefore, a cognitive and social care perspective might be considered when promoting the mental health recovery and readjustment to society among COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Ju, Liu, Huang, Yang, Zhou, Wang, Liao, Shu, Liu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.585537","20210503","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; mental health; negative appraisals; patients; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13433,""
"Adverse Psychological Reactions and Psychological Aids for Medical Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak in China","<b>Background:</b> The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused panic and psychological stress throughout the World. We investigated the extent of adverse psychological reactions in two medical staff groups in China, and explored the importance of online psychological assistance for them. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional online survey including Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was utilized to assess anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to match sex and age between the two groups. Differences in the prevalence of adverse psychological reactions between the two groups were compared by a Chi-square test. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to search for associated adverse psychological reaction factors of two groups. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,920 medical staff took part in the survey, including 470 frontline and 2,450 non-frontline medical staff. The risk of the frontline group experiencing anxiety, depression, insomnia-early, insomnia-middle, and insomnia-late were 1.16, 1.28, 1.26, 1.22, 1.28 times those of the non-frontline group after PSM. For frontline medical staff, the spinsterhood state (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00-1.51; <i>P</i> = 0.05) was a risk factor for anxiety. Bachelor or college degree (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.24-4.02, <i>P</i> = 0.01) and a contact history with COVID-19 patients (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.10-2.40; <i>P</i> = 0.02) were risk factors for insomnia. For non-frontline medical staff, being a woman (OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.08-2.06, <i>P</i> = 0.01) was a risk factor for anxiety, whilst being in a middle age group was a protective factor for anxiety (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50-0.99, <i>P</i> = 0.04) and depression (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.45-0.93, <i>P</i> = 0.02). Being a woman (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.14-1.89, <i>P</i> = 0.003) and working in a COVID-19 unit (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.11-1.54, <i>P</i> = 0.001) were risk factors for insomnia, whilst the spinsterhood state (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.95; <i>P</i> = 0.01) was a protective factor for insomnia. Online forms of psychological aid were all popular with medical staff. <b>Conclusions:</b> The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in frontline medical staff was significantly higher than in the non-frontline group.

"Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak Quarantine, Isolation, and Lockdown Policies on Mental Health and Suicide","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has made a huge impact on people's physical and mental health, and it remains a cause of death for many all over the world. To prevent the spread of coronavirus infection, different types of public health measures (social isolation, quarantine, lockdowns, and curfews) have been imposed by governments. However, mental health experts warn that the prolonged lockdown, quarantine, or isolation will create a &quot;second pandemic&quot; with severe mental health issues and suicides. The quarantined or isolated people may suffer from various issues such as physical inactivity, mental health, economic and social problems. As with the SARS outbreak in 2003, many suicide cases have been reported in connection with this current COVID-19 pandemic lockdown due to various factors such as social stigma, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, fear of COVID infection, loneliness, and other mental health issues. This paper provides an overview of risk factors that can cause suicide and outlines possible solutions to prevent suicide in this current COVID-19 pandemic.","Ganesan, Al-Jumaily, Fong, Prasad, Meena, Tong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.565190","20210503","COVID-19; isolation; lockdown; mental health; quarantine; social distancing; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13435,""
"Physically distant but socially close? Changes in non-physical intergenerational contacts at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic among older people in France, Italy and Spain","Physical distancing is intended to mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, the impact of a decrease in face-to-face contacts on non-physical social contacts of older people remains unclear. In particular, we focus on intergenerational contacts that are especially relevant for older people's mental health. Our analyses rely on an online quota sampling survey conducted in France, Italy and Spain during April 14-24, 2020. We considered the subsample of individuals aged 50Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°(<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4207). We calculated post-stratification weights based on official statistics and used logistic regressions to analyze how changes in intergenerational contacts differed by socioeconomic factors and to what extent non-physical contacts (via phone, social media, etc.) have compensated the reduction in face-to-face contacts. Finally, the change in digital devices' use has been explored as a consequence of both decreased physical intergenerational contacts (PIC) and increased non-physical intergenerational contacts (NPIC). We found that about 50% of older people have increased their NPIC during the first lockdown. Younger individuals, those with medium level of education, and those economically better off displayed higher probabilities of increased NPIC as compared to their counterparts. NPIC increased especially for individuals whose face-to-face contacts decreased, particularly so if this happened with respect to contacts with children. A large share of older people has increased their use of video calls and instant messages, while only some increased the use of social media. These findings are relevant to understand how intergenerational contacts changed during the pandemic and may be central to better plan future outbreak responses.

"The Relationship between Anxiety and Depression Levels with Perceived Stress and Coping Strategies in Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, locally and internationally after it started in Hubei province of China in December 2019. During the spread of this infectious disease in the world, health care workers are taking place as the main people in the screening and treatment of the disease. The present study aims to evaluate the relationship between anxiety and depression levels with perceived stress and coping strategies in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, 200 participants were included. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BDI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) were applied. Mean scores for BDI and BAI were 9.2Ã‚Â±8.9 and 8.2Ã‚Â±9.2, respectively. BDI scores of 33 (16.5%) of 200 participants were Ã¢â€°Â¥17. 62% of the participants had minimal depression, 21.5% of the participants had mild depression, 13.5 % of the participants had moderate depression, and 3% of the participants had severe depression according to BDI scores. 60.5% of the participants had minimal anxiety, 25.5% of the participants had mild anxiety, 8.5% of the participants had moderate anxiety and 5.5% of the participants had severe anxiety according to BAI scores. BAI and BDI scores of the female participants were statistically higher than the male participants. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between BAI and BDI scores and PSS-10 scores. A statistically significant difference was found in the averages of BAI and BDI, PSS-10 COPE 3 (Focus on and venting of emotions), 7 (Religious coping) and 13 (Acceptance) subscales levels in occupational groups. A statistically significant difference was found in BDI levels in the clinical units during the pandemic. This study indicated that different coping strategies can be used in health care workers regarding anxiety, depression and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. While problem-solving and emotion-focused adaptive coping mechanisms help reduce symptoms, maladaptive and negative coping mechanisms can cause symptoms to exacerbate. Thus, training should be given to developing attitudes of health care workers to cope with stress.","Besirli, Erden, Atilgan, Varlihan, Habaci, Yeniceri, Isler, Gumus, Kizileroglu, Ozturk, Ozer, Ozdemir","https://doi.org/10.14744/SEMB.2020.57259","20210503","Anxiety; COVID-19; coping; depression; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13439,""
"Predicting compassion fatigue among psychological hotline counselors using machine learning techniques","During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, psychological hotline counselors frequently address help-seekers' traumatic experiences from time to time, which possibly causes counselors' compassion fatigue. The present study aimed to explore the predictors of compassion fatigue among a high-risk population of psychological hotline counselors. Seven hundred and twelve psychological hotline counselors were recruited from the Mental Health Service Platform at Central China Normal University, Ministry of Education, then were asked to complete the questionnaires measuring compassion fatigue, trait empathy, social support, trait mindfulness, counselor's self-efficacy, humor, life meaning, and post-traumatic growth. A chi-square test was utilized to filter for the top-20 predictive variables. Machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and naÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes were employed to predict compassion fatigue. The results showed that the most important predictors of compassion fatigue were meaning in life, counselors' self-efficacy, mindfulness, and empathy. Except for the decision tree, the rest machine learning techniques obtained good performance. NaÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes presented the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.803. Random forest achieved the least classification error of 23.64, followed by NaÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes with a classification error of 23.85.

"Coronavirus stress and COVID-19 burnout among healthcare staffs: The mediating role of optimism and social connectedness","Coronavirus stress has been associated with undesirable mental health and well-being outcomes, including burnout. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism of change. The present study aimed to examine if optimism and social connectedness mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and COVID-19 burnout in a large sample of healthcare staffs. Participants included 1046 healthcare staffs (56.8% females) aged 20-61Ã‚Â years (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30.29Ã‚Â years, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.80), who completed the measures of coronavirus stress, optimism, social connectedness, and COVID-19 burnout. Females reported more coronavirus stress and burnout and less social connectedness. People confirmed with COVID-19 reported lower optimism. The results indicated that coronavirus stress did not only have a direct effect on increased COVID-19 burnout but also had an indirect effect on it through reduced optimism and social connectedness. These results are important given the shortage of intervention efforts targeting coronavirus stress. Future intervention efforts aimed at reducing coronavirus stress and related outcomes may benefit from simultaneously focusing on optimism and social connectedness.","YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±rÃ„Â±m, Ãƒâ€¡iÃƒÂ§ek, Ã…Å¾anlÃ„Â±","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01781-w","20210503","COVID-19 burnout; Coronavirus stress; Healthcare staffs; Optimism; Social connectedness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13441,""
"Typhoons during COVID-19 Pandemic in the Philippines: Impact of Double Crises on Mental Health","The Philippines, a disaster-prone country in Asia, was hit by 22 tropical cyclones during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the 22 tropical cyclones, one is recorded as the strongest tropical cyclone that made a landfall in world history. The recurrent typhoons in the Philippines during the pandemic have led to a long-lasting humanitarian crisis as hundreds of thousands of houses and collateral assets have been destroyed due to floods and landslides, leaving thousands of Filipinos homeless. Concurrently, the country has been experiencing a rise in number of COVID-19 cases due to overcrowding in evacuation centers and lack of social distancing. The simultaneous existence of natural disasters and pandemic has caused devastating and detrimental effects to the mental health of Filipinos. Nonetheless, the Philippine government, together with the World Health Organization and other humanitarian organizations, has been working hand-in-hand in implementing mental health approaches and providing psychological interventions to Filipinos who were greatly affected by the natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rocha, Dos Santos Costa, Islam, Jain, Goyal, Mohanan, Essar, Ahmad","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.140","20210503","COVID-19; Disasters; Mental Health; Pandemics; Philippines; Typhoons","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13442,""
"Climate change during the COVID-19 outbreak: scoping future perspectives","Neither war nor recession or any kind of prior disaster has been considered a prelude to the looming threat of climate change over the past era as coronavirus (hereafter COVID-19) has in only a few months. Although numerous studies have already been published on this topic, there has not been compelling evidence critically assessing the impact of COVID-19 by and on climate change. The present study fills this gap by taking a more holistic approach to elaborate factors, e.g., natural and anthropogenic factors, ocean submesoscales, radiative forces, and greenhouse gas/CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, that may affect climate change in a more prevalent and pronounced manner. Based on the statistical data collected from the NASA Earth Observatory, the European Space Agency, and the Global Carbon Project, the findings of this study reveal that the climate/environment has improved during COVID-19, including better environmental quality and water quality with low carbon emissions and sound pollution. In the lockdown during the epidemic, the emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) significantly decreased because of the lower usage of transportation, decreased electricity demand, and halted industrial activities. The policy implications of this study suggested that keeping the climate healthy even in the post-COVID-19 era is a serious concern that needs to be addressed by investing in clean and green projects, ensuring green energy evolution, dealing with a large volume of medical waste, building health-ensuring and livable societies, and halting the funding of pollution. For governmental and regulatory bodies, these factors will provide a strong foundation to build safer, healthier, and environmentally friendly societies for generations to come.","Usman, Husnain, Riaz, Riaz, Ali","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14088-x","20210502","Climate change; Coronavirus (COVID-19); NO2 and CO2 emission; Post-COVID-19 era","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13443,""
"Telephone delivery of psychological interventions: Balancing protocol with patient-centred care","Common mental health problems of anxiety and depression affect significant proportions of the global population. Within the UK, and increasingly across western countries, a key policy response has been the introduction of high volume, low intensity psychological assessment and treatment services, such as the NHS's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service, the largest service delivery model yet to be implemented at a national level (England). IAPT may be delivered in face-to-face meetings or over the telephone, as well as through other media. In order to increase access and achieve wide reach with efficient use of resources, IAPT's service models utilise relatively structured and standardised protocols, whilst aiming simultaneously to deliver a tailored and personalised experience for patients. Previous research has revealed that this can be a challenging balance for front-line practitioners to strike. Here we report research into the telephone delivery of guided self-help, low intensity interventions within IAPT, examining the challenges faced in remote delivery when combining structure with personalisation during assessment and treatment sessions. We show the ways in which the lack of flexibility in adhering to a system-driven structure can displace, defer or disrupt the emergence of the patient's story, thereby compromising the personalisation and responsiveness of the service. Our study contributes new insights to our understanding of the association between personalisation, engagement and patient experience within high volume, low-intensity psychological treatment services. Our research on the telephone delivery of IAPT is particularly timely in view of the current global Covid-19 health crisis, as a result of which face-to-face delivery of IAPT has had to be (temporarily) suspended.","Drew, Irvine, Barkham, Faija, Gellatly, Ardern, Armitage, Brooks, Rushton, Welsh, Bower, Bee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113818","20210502","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13444,""

"Altered immunoemotional regulatory system in COVID-19: From the origins to opportunities","The emergence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have led to social regulations that caused substantial changes in manners of daily life. The subsequent loneliness and concerns of the pandemic during social distancing, quarantine, and lockdown are psychosocial stressors that negatively affect the immune system. These effects occur through mechanisms controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis that alter immune regulation, namely the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), which promotes inflammation and diminishes antiviral responses, leading to inadequate protection against viral disease. Unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, sleep disturbances, and mental health consequences of COVID-19 add on to the pathological effects of loneliness, making immunity against this ferocious virus an even tougher fight. Therefore, social isolation, with its unintended consequences, has inherently paradoxical effects on immunity in relation to viral disease. Though this paradox can present a challenge, its acknowledgment can serve as an opportunity to address the associated issues and find ways to mitigate the adverse effects. In this review, we aim to explore, in detail, the pathological effects of the new social norms on immunity and present suggested methods to improve our physical, psychological, and healthcare abilities to fight viral infection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pourriyahi, Saghazadeh, Rezaei","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2021.577578","20210502","COVID-19; CTRA; Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis; IMMERS; Immune booster; Immune regulation; Immunoemotional regulatory system; Loneliness; Pandemic; Quarantine; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13446,""
"PH CARE COVID survey: an international patient survey on the care for pulmonary hypertension patients during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the health care systems suspended their non-urgent activities. This included the cancellation of consultations for patients with rare diseases, such as severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), resulting in potential medication shortage and loss of follow-up. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate PH patient health status evolution, access to health care and mental health experience during the early phase of the pandemic. We conducted an online patient survey, available in 16 languages, between 22/05/2020 and 28/06/2020. The survey included questions corresponding to demographic, COVID-19 and PH related information. 1073 patients (or relatives, 27%) from 52 countries all over the world participated in the survey. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of responders reported a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension and 15% of chronic thromboembolic PH. The COVID-19 related events were few: only 1% of all responders reported a diagnosis of COVID-19. However, 8% of patients reported health deterioration possibly related to PH, and 4% hospitalization for PH. Besides, 11% of the patients reported difficulties to access their PH expert centre, and 3% interruption of treatment due to shortage of medication. Anxiety or depression was reported by 67% of the participants. Although COVID-19 incidence in PH patients was low, PH related problems occurred frequently as the pandemic progressed, including difficulties to have access to specialized care. The importance of primary health care was emphasized. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of COVID-related PH care disruption.","Godinas, Iyer, Meszaros, Quarck, Escribano-Subias, Vonk Noordegraaf, Jansa, D'Alto, Luknar, Milutinov Ilic, Belge, Sitbon, Reis, Rosenkranz, Pepke-Zaba, Humbert, Delcroix","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-021-01752-1","20210502","COVID-19; Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; Patient survey; Pulmonary arterial hypertension; Pulmonary hypertension","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13447,""
"Functional health and symptoms in Spain before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on wellbeing and health has so far been studied using mostly cross-sectional designs. To place recent findings into context, we compared symptoms and functional health status in two independent samples assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited via an online panel using quota sampling. We assessed symptoms, functional health, and global quality of life with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in two general population samples in Spain (collected in July 2019 and April 2020). We also assessed several COVID-19 related variables, such as adherence to social distancing. Data from NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1010 participants before the pandemic (mean age 47.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 50.5% female) were compared with data from NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°504 participants during the pandemic (mean age 47.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 50.8% female). Participants during the pandemic (vs. before the pandemic) reported lower role functioning and emotional functioning, as well as less symptom burden. A lower degree of social distancing was associated with better functional health and lower symptom burden. Our findings indicate an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on functional health and symptom burden in the Spanish general population. The comparison of before and during the pandemic can be used to benchmark results raised only during the pandemic.","Lehmann, Holzner, Giesinger, Bottomley, Ansari, von Butler, Kemmler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10899-2","20210502","COVID-19; Health-related quality of life; Mental health, Spain; Quality of life; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13448,""
"Feelings of Worthlessness Links Depressive Symptoms and Parental Stress: A Network Analysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The prevalent co-occurrence between parental stress and depression has been previously established prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. However, no studies to date have identified the connections through which these symptom domains interact with each other to emerge into a complex and detrimental mental health state, along with the plausible mechanistic variables that may play key roles in maintaining parental stress and depression. The aim of this research is to uncover these interactions in a period where parents experience heighted demands and stress as a consequence of the strict social distancing protocols. Network analysis is utilized to examine parental stress and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large cross-sectional study (N = 2868) of parents. Two graphical Gaussian graphical network models were estimated, one in which only parental stress and depression symptoms were included, and another in which several mechanistic variables were added. Expected influence and bridge expected influence revealed that feeling worthless was the most influential node in the symptoms network and bridged the two psychological states. Among the mechanistic variables, worry and rumination was specifically relevant in the depressive cluster of symptoms, and self-criticism was connected to both constructs. The study display that the co-occurrence of parental stress and depression have specific pathways, were manifested through feelings of worthlessness, and have specific patterns of connection to important mechanisms of psychopathology. The results are of utility when aiming to avoid the constellation of co-occurring parental stress and depressive symptoms during the pandemic.","Nora Skjerdingstad et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46048-D12-246","20210504","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; network analysis; mechanisms; parental stress; covid-19; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-04","",13449,""

"â€œTell me what Iâ€™m doing wrongâ€: Criticism of parenting choices and mental health during COVID-19","Objective: To explore longitudinal associations between receiving criticism about parenting choices with parental anxiety, depression, and financial worries during COVID-19. Background: During COVID-19, parents have struggled with high levels of economic insecurity, parenting stress, and mental health difficulties. Parents were also forced to make difficult parenting decisions with little evidence-based guidance. Social cognitive theory suggests that receiving criticism (i.e., negative feedback) from others can contribute to psychological distress. Methods: Data were collected via an online survey at two time points during April 2020 from a national U.S. sample of 359 parents. Quantitative analyses were conducted using logistic and linear regression, and qualitative responses were coded to elucidate topics of criticism. Results: Mothers received more parenting criticism and reported higher levels of anxiety, depression, and financial worries than fathers. The most common sources of criticism were from oneâ€™s spouse/childâ€™s other parent (T1: 67.65%; T2: 73.86%), oneâ€™s parents (T1: 30.77%; T2: 33.33%), in-laws (T1: 23.60%; T2: 25.00%), and social media (T1: 19.54%; T2: 14.08%). Criticism about parenting choices at T1 was associated with increased parental anxiety, depression, and financial worries at T2, after controlling for these outcomes at T1. Parents were criticized for lenient parenting (20.63%) and being too strict when making decisions related to COVID-19, (18.13%), illustrating the paradox of parenting during a pandemic. Conclusion and Implications: Receiving criticism about parenting choices may exacerbate mental health problems. Parents may benefit from receiving positive feedback about their parenting, either through social media or in conversations with family members.","Kaitlin P.
