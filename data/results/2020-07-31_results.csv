"Knowledge and Anxiety Levels of African University Students Against COVID-19 During the Pandemic Outbreak by an Online Survey","Introduction: The first case of COVID-19 in Nigeria was recorded on March 10, 2020  With a constant increment in numbers, all tertiary educational institutions were closed with an order of the Ministry of Education by March 20, 2020, and the government announced the initial lockdown of big cities on March 30, 2020  In this study, the information and anxiety levels of African university students against COVID-19 during the epidemic outbreak was investigated  Method: One hundred and eighty-three Nigerian university students participated in the study  Participants were 69 men and 114 women who were 17-21 years of age  To get their knowledge and anxiety scores, the questions selected by referencing previous and current epidemic studies were used  Results: The correct rate of knowledge was approximately 88% of Nigerian university students  The anxiety score was higher in women than in men  The students of the college of health sciences had higher knowledge scores than both students of faculty of natural and applied sciences and students of faculty of art and social sciences  Additionally, the 100 level students had lower knowledge scores than both 200 and 300 level students  Discussion: The gender difference supports the previous studies in which depression and alexithymia scores were high in women compared to men  The faculty difference may be attributed to a good and effective education of medical faculty students  The level difference may be attributed to the lower education level in the first-year students  Conclusion: The results of the present study and previous studies suggest that the knowledge levels should be increased and thus the anxiety levels should be decreased to overcome this disease via online systems  Also, the mental health of university students should be monitored","Rakhmanov, Ochilbek; Dane, Senol","https://www.google.com/search?q=Knowledge+and+Anxiety+Levels+of+African+University+Students+Against+COVID-19+During+the+Pandemic+Outbreak+by+an+Online+Survey","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Research in Medical and Dental Science;8(3):53-56, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Research in Medical and Dental Science;8(3):53-56, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3588,""
"Penetrating trauma during a global pandemic: changing patterns in interpersonal violence, self-harm and domestic violence in the Covid-19 outbreak","Introduction The restrictions imposed on social activity in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have had a profound impact globally  In the UK, the NHS was placed on a war-footing, with elective surgery, face-to-face outpatient clinics, and community care facilities all scaled back as a temporary measure to redistribute scarce resources  There has been concern during this period over increasing levels of violence in the domestic setting, as well as self-harm  Methods Data was collected on all patients presenting with traumatic penetrating injuries during the â€˜lockdownâ€™ period of 23rd March to 29th April 2020  Demographics and injury details were compared with the same period in the two preceding years  Results Overall trauma fell by 35% compared with the previous year  Over one in four penetrating injuries seen were a result of self-harm, which was significantly higher than in previous years (11% in 2019, 2% in 2018)  There were two cases of injuries due to domestic violence, while a total of 4 cases of injury arose in separate violent domestic incidents  Self-harm commonly involved penetrating injury to the neck  Discussion Our centre has seen an increase in the proportion of penetrating injuries as a result of both self-harm and violence in the domestic setting  The number of penetrating neck injury cases, which can represent suicidal intent or a major presentation of psychiatric illness, is of particular concern  We must further investigate the effect of social restrictions on violent injury, and how home confinement may influence a changing demographic picture of victims","Olding, James; Zisman, Sophia; Olding, Carole; Fan, Kathleen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.07.004","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: The Surgeon;2020.; Publication details: The Surgeon;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3589,""

"Anxiety and depression in COVID-19 survivors: role of inflammatory and clinical predictors","Infection-triggered perturbation of the immune system could induce psychopathology, and psychiatric sequelae were observed after previous coronavirus outbreaks  The spreading of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could be associated with psychiatric implications  We investigated the psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in survivors, also considering the effect of clinical and inflammatory predictors  We screened for psychiatric symptoms 402 adults surviving COVID-19 (265male,meanage58), at one month follow-up after hospital treatment  A clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires were used to investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology  We collected sociodemographic information, clinical data, baseline inflammatory markers and follow-up oxygen saturation levels  A significant proportion of patients self-rated in the psychopathological range: 28% for PTSD, 31% for depression, 42% for anxiety, 20% for OC symptoms, and 40% for insomnia  Overall, 56% scored in the pathological range in at least one clinical dimension  Despite significantly lower levels of baseline inflammatory markers, females suffered more for both anxiety and depression  Patients with a positive previous psychiatric diagnosis showed increased scores on most psychopathological measures, with similar baseline inflammation  Baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which reflects the immune response and systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts, positively associated with scores of depression and anxiety at follow-up  PTSD, major depression, and anxiety, are all high-burden non-communicable conditions associated with years of life lived with disability  Considering the alarming impact of COVID-19 infection on mental health, the current insights on inflammation in psychiatry, and the present obervation of worse inflammation leading to worse depression, we recommend to assess psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors and to deepen research on inflammatory biomarkers, in order to diagnose and treat emergent psychiatric conditions","Gennaro Mazza, Mario; De Lorenzo, Rebecca; Conte, Caterina; Poletti, Sara; Vai, Benedetta; Bollettini, Irene; Maria Teresa Melloni, Elisa; Furlan, Roberto; Ciceri, Fabio; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Benedetti, Francesco","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.037","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Brain, Behavior, and Immunity;2020.; Publication details: Brain, Behavior, and Immunity;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3591,""
"Pseudoscientific beliefs and psychopathological risks increase after COVID-19 social quarantine","The health crisis caused by COVID-19 has led many countries to opt for social quarantine of the population  During this quarantine, communication systems have been characterized by disintermediation, the acceleration of digitization and an infodemic (excess and saturation of information)  The following debate arises: Do the levels related to the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs related to the interpretation of information vary before and after social quarantine? This research aims to examine the psychological effects of social quarantine on the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs-experiences of the general nonclinical population  The following hypothesis was posed: social quarantine alters the levels of magical thinking, pseudoscientific beliefs and anomalous perceptions due to quarantine  A pre- and posttest analysis design was applied based on the difference in means, and complementary Bayesian estimation was performed  A total of 174 Spanish subjects responded to different questionnaires that evaluated psychopathological risks based on psychotic phenotypes, pseudoscientific beliefs and experiences before and after quarantine  Significant differences were obtained for the variables positive psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and certain perceptual alterations (e g , cenesthetic perceptions), and a significant increase in pseudoscientific beliefs was also observed  The perceptual disturbances that increased the most after quarantine were those related to derealization and depersonalization  However, paranoid perceptions showed the highest increase, doubling the initial standard deviation  These high increases could be related to the delimitation of physical space during social quarantine and distrust towards information communicated by the government to the population  Is it possible that social alarmism generated by the excess of information and pseudoscientific information has increased paranoid perceptual alterations? Measures taken after quarantine indicate that perceptual disturbances, subclinical psychotic symptoms and beliefs in the pseudoscience have increased  We discuss which elements of quarantine coincide with the social marginality theory and its clinical repercussions","EscolÃ -GascÃ³n, Ãlex, MarÃ­n, Francesc-Xavier; RusiÃ±ol, Jordi; Gallifa, Josep","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00603-1","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Globalization and Health;16(1):72-72, 2020.; Publication details: Globalization and Health;16(1):72-72, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3592,""

"COVID-19: Psychological Flexibility, Coping, Mental Health, and Wellbeing in the UK during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered the daily lives of many people across the globe, both through the direct interpersonal cost of the disease, and the governmental restrictions imposed to mitigate its spread and impact  The UK has been particularly affected and has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe  In this paper, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health and well-being in the UK during a period of â€˜lockdownâ€™ (15thâ€“21st May 2020) and the specific role of Psychological Flexibility as a potential mitigating process  We observed clinically high levels of distress in our sample (N=555)  However, psychological flexibility was significantly and positively associated with greater wellbeing, and inversely related to anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-related distress  Avoidant coping behaviour was positively associated with all indices of distress and negatively associated with wellbeing, while engagement in approach coping only demonstrated weaker associations with outcomes of interest  No relationship between adherence to government guidelines and psychological flexibility was found  In planned regression models, psychological flexibility demonstrated incremental predictive validity for all distress and wellbeing outcomes (over and above both demographic characteristics and COVID-19-specific coping responses)  Furthermore, psychological flexibility and COVID-19 outcomes were only part-mediated by coping responses to COVID-19, supporting the position that psychological flexibility can be understood as an overarching response style that is distinct from established conceptualisations of coping  We conclude that psychological flexibility represents a promising candidate process for understanding and predicting how an individual may be affected by, and cope with, both the acute and longer-term challenges of the pandemic","Dawson, David L.; Golijani-Moghaddam, Nima","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.010","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3594,""

"Prevalence of depression and its correlative factors among female adolescents in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could increase the risk of depression. However, epidemiological data on outbreak-associated depressive morbidity of female adolescents are not available. This study determines the incidence and correlates of depression among female adolescents aged 11-18 years during the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China. METHODS: A large cross-sectional sample, nationwide online survey was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak. Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the correlative factors of depression were analyzed. RESULTS: In this study, 4805 female adolescents were enrolled with a median (range) age of 15 (11-18) years. Of them, 1899 (39.5%) suffered from depression with a CES-D score of > 15. The onset of depression was significantly related to age, grade, distant learning, attitude toward COVID-19, sleep duration, and physical exercise duration. Furthermore, participants aged 15-18 years (OR = 1.755, 95% CI: 1.550-1.987, p < 0.001), participating in distant learning (OR = 0.710, 95% CI: 0.564-0.894, p = 0.004), concerned about COVID-19 (OR = 0.414, 95% CI: 0.212-0.811, p = 0.010), with sleep duration/day of < 6 h (OR = 2.603, 95% CI: 1.946-3.483, p < 0.001),and with physical exercise duration/day < 30 min (OR = 1.641, 95% CI: 1.455-1.850, p < 0.001) represented to be independent factors for suffering from depression. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, depression was common among female adolescents. Older age, distant learning, concern about COVID-19, short sleep duration, and physical exercise duration represented the independent factors for suffering from depression.","Zhou, Jiaojiao; Yuan, Xiaofei; Qi, Han; Liu, Rui; Li, Yaqiong; Huang, Huanhuan; Chen, Xu; Wang, Gang","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00601-3","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Global Health;16(1): 69, 2020 Jul 28.; Publication details: Global Health;16(1): 69, 2020 Jul 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3599,""
"The role of the interface of sport and tourism in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic","This feature editorial discusses the role of the interface of sport and tourism in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key concepts are set out as context for discussion under two headings. Under Sports Fixtures and Events: a parochial attitude to cancelling major sports events; the impact of recreated and relived sports events on wellbeing; the response of sports audiences to live sport behind closed doors. Under Activity, Movement and Travel: the appetite and provision for outdoor activity during lockdown, and the role of a sense of movement; the factors that might lead to observed increases in sustainable modes of travel being sustained post-lockdown. Lessons and questions for future research, policy and provision are discussed, and the potential is identified for activities at the interface of sport and tourism to make significant contributions to outcomes and policy goals for wellbeing, physical health, mental health, and in supporting green space and sustainable travel as a response to the climate crisis. A challenge is set for managers, administrators and researchers working at the interface of sport and tourism to look outwards beyond their own development concerns, and recognise and accept both a responsibility and an opportunity to make these contributions. The feature editorial concludes with an invitation for researchers to take up the challenge of submitting research to the Journal of Sport & Tourism that either focuses on the contribution to the COVID-19 response, or that explores contributions that can be made to wider social, economic and health outcomes and policy goals.","Weed, Mike","https://doi.org/10.1080/14775085.2020.1794351","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: J.

"An online compassion-focused crisis intervention during COVID-19 lockdown: a cases series on patients at high risk for psychosis","Aim: To pilot-test the effectiveness of a online compassion-focused crisis intervention for persons who were diagnosed with brief psychotic disorder and were still at high risk for a psychotic episode at the Italian announcement of lockdown on March 9 th, 2020. Methods: Six patients who, at the moment of the lockdown, were treated through different psychotherapy approaches and antipsychotic drugs for a first brief psychotic episode accessed a 4-week online compassion-focused intervention comprising a weekly individual video-call session, and an open messenger service with audio-recorded compassion focused practices. Primary outcome (general symptomatology) was assessed one-week before and at the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety and stress symptoms) were assessed daily during the intervention, for a total of 28Â days. Results: Five of six participants demonstrated a reliable change in both primary and secondary outcomes, and no one reported acute psychotic episodes during the lockdown.

"Financing COVID-19, Inflation and the Fiscal Constraint","The COVID-19 pandemic is producing an economic depression that, however, could be substantially reduced if the state in each country, besides making the required health spending, compensates the companies and households that are losing with the social distance and lockdown policies. Governments, however, limit their expenditures not to increase the public debt. There is, however, the possibility that central banks buy new securities from the Treasury to finance such exceptional spending. Considering several economic constraints that policymakers face, this policy will not conflict with the inflation constraint. Money is an endogenous variable that does not cause but just validates a going inflation. It conflicts partially with the fiscal constraint, but avoids the increase in the public debt. And, in this case, it does not have the bad consequences of fiscal indisciplineâ€”excess demand that, successively, causes increases in imports and current account deficits that appreciate the national currency, accelerate inflation, and lead to currency crises. Monetary financing of the COVID-19 will not cause any of these three evils.","Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos","https://doi.org/10.1080/07360932.2020.1792176","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Forum Soc.

"Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation From CT Images","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","Fan, Zhou, Ji, Zhou, Chen, Fu, Shen, Shao","https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2020.2996645","20200730","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3606,""

"A Scoping Review of Literature About Mental Health and Well-Being Among Immigrant Communities in the United States","Immigration-both the experience of migrating and events after migration-can affect the mental health and well-being of immigrants and their communities. However, evidence suggests that immigrants in the United States do not access mental health services to the same extent as nonimmigrants. In particular, immigrant adolescents and young adults may have unique stressors related to their developmental stage, experiences in school and with peer groups, and shifting roles within family systems. This scoping review summarizes findings from published research studies and practitioner-focused gray literature about the mental health needs of immigrant communities in the United States. The review finds that specific mental health needs vary across factors like age, racial/ethnic group, immigration status, and place of residency. Findings also indicate that structural factors like immigration-related laws affect both access to mental health services and stressors in the overall environment for immigrants and their families. This review also explores models of community-level initiatives that utilize strengths-based approaches to promoting mental health and well-being among immigrant communities. Findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the mental health needs and current barriers to care among diverse immigrant populations, as immigration continues to play a major role in U.S. public policy and discourse. The COVID-19 pandemic taking place as this article goes to press in 2020 also raises questions regarding health equity and access for marginalized populations, including immigrants and their communities, and so these findings also indicate the need for further interdisciplinary research to assess intersections among the pandemic's many impacts, including those related to mental health and well-being.","Rodriguez, Hill, McDaniel","https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839920942511","20200730","health disparities; health research; international/cross-cultural health; minority health; qualitative research; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3608,""
"Supporting the vulnerable: developing a strategic community mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant risks to the vulnerable patient population supported by community mental health (CMH) teams in South Australia. This paper describes a plan developed to understand and mitigate these risks. Public health and psychiatric literature was reviewed and clinicians in CMH teams and infectious disease were consulted. Key risks posed by COVID-19 to CMH patients were identified and mitigation plans were prepared. A public health response plan for CMH teams was developed to support vulnerable individuals and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This plan will be reviewed regularly to respond to changes in public health recommendations, research findings and feedback from patients and clinicians. The strategic response plan developed to address risks to vulnerable patients from COVID-19 can assist other CMH services in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Thomson, Doan, Liu, Schubert, Toh, Boyd, Galletly","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220944701","20200730","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; public health; schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3609,""
"Psychological sequelae within different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review of extant evidence","The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a potentially significant impact on not only physical health but also psychological well-being. To our best knowledge, no review thus far has consolidated the psychological impact of COVID-19 across different subpopulations. A systematic search of the literature until 15 June 2020 found 150 empirical papers pertinent to the mental health consequences of the pandemic. The majority (87.3%) were from China (45.3%), the rest of Asia (22.0%) and Europe (20.0%), and mostly examined the general population (37.3%), healthcare workers (31.3%) and those with pre-existing mental and physical illnesses (14.7%). The most common psychological responses across these subpopulations were anxiety (overall range 24.8%-49.5%), depression (overall range 18.6%-42.6%) and traumatic stress symptoms (overall range 12.7%-31.6%). Healthcare workers and those with pre-existing physical and mental illnesses were more severely affected. Future studies are needed on under-examined subgroups such as the elderly and recovered COVID-19 patients.","Tng, Chew, Sim","https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020111","20200730","healthcare workers; infectious diseases; psychological responses; vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3610,""
"Chest CT for early detection and management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a report of 314 patients admitted to Emergency Department with suspected pneumonia","The purpose of our study was to assess the potential role of chest CT in the early detection of COVID-19 pneumonia and to explore its role in patient management in an adult Italian population admitted to the Emergency Department. Three hundred and fourteen patients presented with clinically suspected COVID-19, from March 3 to 23, 2020, were evaluated with PaO2/FIO2 ratio from arterial blood gas, RT-PCR assay from nasopharyngeal swab sample and chest CT. Patients were classified as COVID-19 negative and COVID-19 positive according to RT-PCR results, considered as a reference. Images were independently evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the RT-PCR results and classified as &quot;CT positive&quot; or &quot;CT negative&quot; for COVID-19, according to CT findings. According to RT-PCR results, 152 patients were COVID-19 negative (48%) and 162 were COVID-19 positive (52%). We found substantial agreement between RT-PCR results and CT findings (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000001), as well as an almost perfect agreement between the two readers. Mixed GGO and consolidation pattern with peripheral and bilateral distribution, multifocal or diffuse abnormalities localized in both upper lung and lower lung, in association with interlobular septal thickening, bronchial wall thickening and air bronchogram, showed higher frequency in COVID-positive patients. We also found a significant correlation between CT findings and patient's oxygenation status expressed by PaO2/FIO2 ratio. Chest CT has a useful role in the early detection and in patient management of COVID-19 pneumonia in a pandemic. It helps in identifying suspected patients, cutting off the route of transmission and avoiding further spread of infection.","Gaia, Maria Chiara, Silvia, Chiara, Maria Luisa, Giulia, Silvia, Lucia, Alessandra, Annarita, Cristina, Maria, Maria Rosaria, Giacinta, Riccardo, Zaher, Andrea, Maddalena, Catalano, Paolo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01256-1","20200730","COVID-19; Chest CT; Emergency radiology; Pandemic; Pneumonia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3611,""
"Digital or Digitally Delivered Responses to Domestic and Intimate Partner Violence During COVID-19","Before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), 1 in 3 women and girls, globally, were victimized by an abusive partner in intimate relationships. However, the current pandemic has amplified cases of domestic violence (DV) against women and girls, with up to thrice the prevalence in DV cases compared to the same time last year. Evidence of the adverse effects of the pandemic on DV is still emerging, even as violence prevention strategies are iteratively being refined by service providers, advocacy agencies, and survivors to meet stay-at-home mandates. Emotional and material support for survivors is a critical resource increasingly delivered using digital and technology-based modalities, which offer several advantages and challenges. This paper rapidly describes current DV mitigation approaches using digital solutions, signaling emerging best practices to support survivors, their children, and abusers during stay-at-home advisories. Some examples of technology-based strategies and solutions are presented. An immediate priority is mapping out current digital solutions in response to COVID-19-related DV and outlining issues with uptake, coverage, and meaningful use of digital solutions.","Emezue","https://doi.org/10.2196/19831","20200730","COVID-19; abuse; coronavirus; digital interventions; domestic violence; intimate partner violence; mental health; pandemic; prevention; technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3612,""
"COnVida-20(1)","An increasing number of studies have addressed the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in the general population. Nevertheless, far less is known about the impact in specific populations such as university students, whose psychological vulnerability has been shown in previous research. This study sought to examine different indicators of mental health in university students during the Spanish lockdown; we also analyzed the main sources of stress perceived by students in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, and the coping strategies adopted when faced with the situation. Data was collected from 932 students (704 women) through a web-based platform. Measures of anxiety (i.e., GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), irritability and self-perceived change in mental health were administered, as well as ad hoc measures of stressors and coping strategies. Results indicated that students experienced considerable psychological problems during the confinement, with higher rates of emotional difficulties in women and undergraduate students than in men and postgraduates, respectively. Psychological distress was mainly related to several specific domains of stressors, as perceived by the participants: academic future, task overload, worsening of interpersonal conflicts, and restrictions in pleasant social contact; and far less related to the spread of the disease and its consequences for physical health. As regards coping strategies, both reframing skills and daily routines were shown to be the most effective. A path-analysis model integrating stressors, coping, and mental health revealed that coping strategies partially channeled the effect of stressors on psychological health. In general, results suggest that studentsâ€™ psychological health was substantially affected by the COVID-19 situation and that the academic and relational changes were the most notable sources of stress. This study reinforces the need to monitor and promote mental health in university students to boost resilience in times of crisis. Our results on effective coping strategies may inform preventive programs aimed at helping students to deal with challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Isabel PadrÃ³n et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46181-A5C-11A","20200731","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; psychological impact; coping; stressors; university students; convida-20.","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3613,""
