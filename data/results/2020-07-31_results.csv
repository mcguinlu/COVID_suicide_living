"Roadmap to strengthen global mental health systems to tackle the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID pandemic has been devastating for not only its direct impact on lives, physical health, socio-economic status of individuals, but also for its impact on mental health  Some individuals are affected psychologically more severely and will need additional care  However, the current health system is so fragmented and focused on caring for those infected that management of mental illness has been neglected  An integrated approach is needed to strengthen the health system, service providers and research to not only manage the current mental health problems related to COVID but develop robust strategies to overcome more long-term impact of the pandemic  A series of recommendations are outlined in this paper to help policy makers, service providers and other stakeholders, and research and research funders to strengthen existing mental health systems, develop new ones, and at the same time advance research to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID19  The recommendations refer to low, middle and high resource settings as capabilities vary greatly between countries and within countries  The recommendations for policy makers are focused on strengthening leadership and governance, finance mechanisms, and developing programme and policies that especially include the most vulnerable populations  Service provision should focus on accessible and equitable evidence-based community care models commensurate with the existing mental health capacity to deliver care, train existing primary care staff to cater to increased mental health needs, implement prevention and promotion programmes tailored to local needs, and support civil societies and employers to address the increased burden of mental illness  Researchers and research funders should focus on research to develop robust information systems that can be enhanced further by linking with other data sources to run predictive models using artificial intelligence, understand neurobiological mechanisms and community-based interventions to address the pandemic driven mental health problems in an integrated manner and use innovative digital solutions  Urgent action is needed to strengthen mental health system in all settings  The recommendations outlined can be used as a guide to develop these further or identify new ones in relation to local needs","Maulik, Pallab K.; Thornicroft, Graham; Saxena, Shekhar","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00393-4","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Journal of Mental Health Systems;14(1):57-57, 2020.; Publication details: International Journal of Mental Health Systems;14(1):57-57, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3517,""

"18F-FDG brain PET hypometabolism in post-SARS-CoV-2 infection: substrate for persistent/delayed disorders?","Purpose Several brain complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported  It has been moreover speculated that this neurotropism could potentially cause a delayed outbreak of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases of neuroinflammatory origin  A propagation mechanism has been proposed across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, from the nose to the olfactory epithelium, and possibly afterward to other limbic structures, and deeper parts of the brain including the brainstem  Methods Review of clinical examination, and whole-brain voxel-based analysis of 18 F-FDG PET metabolism in comparison with healthy subjects (p voxel &lt; 0 001, p-cluster &lt; 0 05, uncorrected), of two patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 explored at the post-viral stage of the disease  Results Hypometabolism of the olfactory/rectus gyrus was found on the two patients, especially one with 4-week prolonged anosmia  Additional hypometabolisms were found within amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, cingulate cortex, pre-/ post-central gyrus, thalamus/hypothalamus, cerebellum, pons, and medulla in the other patient who complained of delayed onset of a painful syndrome  Conclusion These preliminary findings reinforce the hypotheses of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism through the olfactory bulb and the possible extension of this impairment to other brain structures  18 F-FDG PET hypometabolism could constitute a cerebral quantitative biomarker of this involvement  Post-viral cohort studies are required to specify the exact relationship between such hypometabolisms and the possible persistent disorders, especially involving cognitive or emotion disturbances, residual respiratory symptoms, or painful complaints  Several brain complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been already reported including acute cerebrovascu-lar disorders, encephalopathy, encephalitis, and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndromes [1]  It has been moreover speculated that SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism could potentially cause a delayed outbreak with onset and progression of neuro-psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases of neuroinflammatory origin [2]  A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of other coronavirus infections confirms confusion, depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory, or insomnia in 27 9 to 41 9% of patients in the acute illness, while in the post-illness stage, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was of 32 2%, and almost 15% for depression and anxiety disorders [3], with also a clinical overlap with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome [4]","Guedj, E.; Million, M.; Dudouet, P.; Tissot-Dupont, H.; Bregeon, F.; Cammilleri, S.; Raoult, D.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-020-04973-x","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging;2020.; Publication details: European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3519,""

It targets Arab culture, although globalisation and the media may have harmonised any substantial cross-cultural variations  Various ramifications have emerged through analysing social-media posts, online classes and interviews  Concerning social and cultural ramifications, some may, for ideological considerations, tolerate, support, reject or subvert this education through campaigning, rumour and humour  Regarding pedagogical and psychological ramifications, unreadiness and incompetence may compromise education  Additionally, staying home may entail problems (pandemic-related stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, divorce and pregnancy), preventing students and teachers from learning and teaching  Concerning procedural and logistical ramifications, some Arab contexts may be digitally readier than non-Arab contexts  Additionally, stakeholders may intensify efforts to profit, ethically or unethically, from the over-demand for this education  Distance education is one of several social distancing initiatives, which Arabs have welcomed despite their well-rooted social closeness, bonding to debond, forming unorthodox â€˜distanceshipâ€™","Al Lily, Abdulrahman Essa; Ismail, Abdelrahim Fathy; Abunasser, Fathi Mohammed; Alhajhoj Alqahtani, Rafdan Hassan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101317","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Technology in Society;2020.; Publication details: Technology in Society;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3535,""

Unprecedented hardship due to ongoing fears of exposure and threats to personal safety, along with societal measures enacted to curb disease transmission, have had broad psychosocial impact on patients and healthcare workers alike.

"CoViD-19 and psychiatry: can mental illness justify further exceptions to the obligation to stay at home?","To face the CoViD-19 pandemic, the italian government has approved regulations which state, with no exceptions, that it is considered offence for people tested positive to the virus to leave their house, whereas other people are allowed to leave their house for proven needs such as work, health or emergencies. The authors contextualize these regulations with European and international sets of principles, in the light of the characteristics that some psychiatric disorders can present. Evaluate if such European principles need to be implemented with further specific exceptions to the obligation to stay at home for some people with mental disorders. Prohibition to leave the house can aggravate mental disorders, resulting in the concrete risk of harmful actions, in particular in psychotic and bipolar patients, even with mild excitement, depressed patients, or in cases of delusional patients, resulting from uninterrupted cohabitation with emotionally significant family members. Even the health of subjects with anxiety pathologies, or with different forms of mental retardation can be prejudiced by forced permanence at home. From numerous provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union there emerges that collective health must be balanced with individual health and with the dignity of the human person. As the European and international provisions are hierarchically above the national provisions, the latter should be interpreted so that the non-compliance to the obligation to stay at home: a) does not constitute offence for a person tested positive to the virus, if therapeutic treatments resulting in hospitalization are deemed necessary; b) it does not constitute administrative offence if the subject proves, based on clinical and factual documented evidence, that leaving the house is necessary to avoid recrudescence of mental disorder. In addition, for evaluation purposes, particular attention should be paid to the severity of psychiatric illness in the specific case. In order to distinguish suitable subjects from those not suitable for home isolation, the reference criterion cannot be the only diagnostic element, but it will be necessary to take into account above all the severity of the condition. In the absence of such a qualitative assessment, there would be a risk of unfounded infringements of the obligation to stay at home.","Montanari Vergallo, Bersani, Rinaldi","https://doi.org/10.1708/3417.34002","20200729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3569,""

Biological disaster like SARS and COVID-19 not only has strong impact on mental health in those being infected and their family, friends, and coworkers, but also affect wellbeing in general public. There are evidenced that clear and timely psychoeducation, psychological first aid and psychological debriefing could amileorate negative impact of disaster, thus might also be helpful amid COVID-19 pandemic.","Hsieh, Kao, Li, Lu, Tsai, Chen, Chou, Huang, Hsu, Chou","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020944200","20200729","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); biological disaster; culture; mental health; religion; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3574,""
"Love in the time of Corona","As the world struggles to come to terms with &quot;corona,&quot; we find our collective experience to be entirely alien, struggling to find meaning in the forms of feeling being evoked. When words cannot provide meaning to experience, metaphor is often utilized. Words like &quot;love&quot; are informed autobiographically as &quot;growing words,&quot; with no rules defining their use. The significance of &quot;love&quot; to an individual is created through personal history, such that sophisticated understanding is only constructed following a lifetime of experience. &quot;Corona&quot; is perhaps a growing word; we cannot yet grasp its meaning in the face of <i>cÃƒÂ³lera</i> (passion) and <i>pati</i> (suffering) informing our collective traumatic script. Psychiatrists should aim to focus on the positive forms of feeling emerging during the pandemic, in order to be better equipped to meet the impending &quot;second wave&quot; of mental health complications.","Alchin, McLean, Korner","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220936142","20200729","COVID-19; Conversational Model; corona; coronavirus; metaphor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3575,""

"Alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems during the COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review","To summarise publications reporting on alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in a narrative review. ProQuest, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for articles published in 2020. This search used two terms: 'alcohol' and 'COVID'. Reference lists of articles were reviewed to identify additional articles. There is growing concern around an increase in alcohol intake and alcohol-related harms. These concerns are related to the impact of excessive alcohol consumption in a person with COVID-19 and/or with alcohol use disorder, as well as with a potential increase in the prevalence of harmful drinking, alcohol use disorder, withdrawal symptoms, intimate partner violence, harm to children, suicide, mental health problems and non-communicable diseases. The need for assessing alcohol use and providing adequate advice during the pandemic have been highlighted. The time for action is now, and all necessary measures to prevent an increase in alcohol-related problems should be adopted. At the same time, healthcare services should also prepare for such potential increase, while adapting to the exceptional circumstances presented by the pandemic, such as physical distancing.","Ramalho","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220943024","20200729","COVID-19; alcohol; alcohol use; alcohol-related problems; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3577,""
"Potential Digital Tools for Psychological Symptoms associated with COVID-19","Introduction In the four months since the discovery of the index case, there has been several studies highlighting the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline healthcare workers and on members of the general public. It is evident from these studies that individuals have elevated levels of anxiety and depression both in the acute phase when first becoming aware of the pandemic and that the psychological distress persists into subsequent weeks. It is becoming apparent that technological tools, such as text-messages, web-based interventions, mobile-based interventions, and conversational agents, could help ameliorate the psychological distress in the workplace and society. From our knowledge, there are limited publications that describes how digital tools (except for that of Zhou XY et al., 2020) (6) have been used to ameliorate psychological symptoms amongst individuals. It is thus the aim of this article to identify existing text, web, mobile and conversational agents that the general public could access to ameliorate the psychological symptoms that they face amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In order to identify any digital tools that have been published specifically for COVID-19, a search was ran through PubMed and MEDLINE from inception of the databases through to the 17th of June 2020. The following keywords were used, that of &quot;NCOV OR 2019-nCoV OR SARS-CoV-2 or Coronavirus or COVID19 OR COVID&quot; and &quot;mHealth OR eHealth OR text&quot;. Another search was conducted on PubMed and MEDLINE to identify existing digital tools for depression and anxiety disorders. A web-based search engine (Google.com) was used to identify if the web-based intervention cited could be assessed. A mobile application search application, that of App Annie was used to determine if identified mobile applications could be assessed commercially. Results A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the identified web-based interventions, 5 websites were accessible. Of the identified mobile-based interventions, 7 applications were accessible. Of the identified conversational agents, only 2 were accessible. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant psychological distress. Digital tools that are commercially available could potentially be of use for at-risk individuals, or individuals with pre-existing psychiatric symptoms.","Zhang, Smith","https://doi.org/10.2196/19706","20200729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3578,""

"Depression symptoms mediate mismatch between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and diminished compliance with prevention measures","Without any known vaccine or cure, sustaining individualsâ€™ cooperation in following prevention measures is crucial to prevent spreading of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Here, we monitored national representative samples with changes in beliefs about the pandemic, depressive symptoms, and motivation to comply with prevention measures between the end of the first wave (Time1) and beginning of the second wave (Time2) of the COVID-19 in South Korea. Participantsâ€™ beliefs about the pandemic closely reflected the change of the COVID-19 situations. Strikingly, inconsistent with the accurate belief update, individuals regarded social distancing less important and externalized their motives to comply with preventive measures more at Time2 than Time1. This mismatch was mediated by depressive symptoms, such that increased depressive symptoms followed by negative belief change were associated with decreased perceived importance of social distancing and voluntary motivation. Our data highlights the importance of considering psychological reactions in promoting individualsâ€™ compliance with prevention measures.","Jiwon Park et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BE-CD1-974","20200729","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; depression; covid-19; belief; social distancing","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3580,""
"Factors Mediating the Psychological Well-Being of Healthcare Workers Responding to Global Pandemics: A Systematic Review","The worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the likelihood of future pandemics has raised the attention to the effects of pandemics on the psychological well-being of individuals. Given their indispensable role in such situations, healthcare workers are at greater risk of mental health issues. This paper aimed to review the mediators of psychological well-being among healthcare workers responding to global pandemics. After registration on PROSPERO, a systematic review was performed in four databases. Following study selection (PRISMA guidelines), inclusion criteria and analysis methods were assessed. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the EPHPP criteria. Out of 1467 references, 39 studies were included in this review. In most studies, worse well-being outcomes, such as stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout were related to demographic characteristics, direct contact with infected patients, and poor perceived support. In turn, self-efficacy, coping ability, altruism, and support from employers and organisations were found to be protective factors. Despite some limitations in the quality of the available evidence, this review highlights the prevalence of poor mental health outcomes in healthcare workers responding to global pandemics. Future interventions should target the identified mediators to promote psychological well-being among this population, particularly social and organisational support, which may improve workersâ€™ mental health and reduce burnout and turnover.","Jekaterina Schneider et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46164-DBE-BD0","20200730","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; healthcare professionals; mediation; pandemic; covid-19; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3581,""
"How communication technology helps mitigating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on individual and social wellbeing: Preliminary support for a compensatory social interaction model","The present study preliminary tested the compensatory social interaction model for individuals experiencing the Covid-19 pandemic. This original model comprises two distinct processes: expression of online emotions leads to post-traumatic growth, which can favor positive mental health and prosocial behaviors; and receiving online social support leads to increases in positive mental health, which can also favor prosocial behaviors. Adults living in Italy (n=1412) completed an online survey during the lockdown period in March 2020. Results showed that being more involved in expression of online emotions was associated with higher post-traumatic growth that in turn was associated with prosocial behaviors. Moreover, participants who perceived higher online social support were more likely to report higher positive mental health that in turn was associated with prosocial behaviors. Collectively, these two social interaction processes suggest that communication technologies appear to be critical resources in helping individuals cope with difficulties raised by the Covid-19 pandemic.","Natale Canale et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-AFF-C0E","20200730","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3582,""
"Relationships between Nutrition and Physical Activity, and the Symptoms of Insomnia, Depression and Anxiety among Adolescents in South China During COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has caused mental health issues among adolescents. This study aimed to explore the related factors of nutrition, physical activity (PA), and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety, and to investigate associations between the two lifestyle behaviors (insolated or combined) with symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Cross-sectional data of 1,756 middle school students from a survey conducted in May 2020 was used. The t-tests or c2 tests were used to determine the related factors of nutrition, PA, and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety across the subgroups when appropriate. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between nutrition and PA, and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Girls, rural students, left-behind, sibling, students with low family income or excessive fear had worse lifestyle or mental status. Both poor nutrition and inactive PA were related to higher odds of reporting symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Students with both poor nutrition and inactive PA tended to report insomnia symptoms (OR = 2.16) and depressive symptoms (OR = 2.57) than those with only one behavior or neither of them after controlling for confounding factors. The present study indicates the importance of helping adolescents to pursue a healthier lifestyle.","Xinli Chi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-373-450","20200730","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3583,""
"Helplessness Among University Students: An Empirical Study Based on a Modified Framework of Implicit Personality Theories","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and within a very short period of time, teaching in the 2020 summer term changed from predominantly on-site to online instruction. Students suddenly faced having to adapt their learning process to new demands for which they may have had both insufficient digital skills and a lack of learning resources. Such a situation carries the risk that a substantial number of students become helpless. The aim of our empirical study was to test a hybrid framework of helplessness that includes both objective causes of helplessness and students' subjective interpretations of them. Before lectures or courses began, students of a full-scale university were invited to participate in an online survey. The final sample consists of 1,690 students. Results indicate that objective factors as well as their subjective interpretations contribute to the formation of helplessness.","Albert Ziegler et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F3-952-403","20200730","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learner","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-31","",3584,""
