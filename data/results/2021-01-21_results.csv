"Remote care for mental health: qualitative study with service users, carers and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic","ABSTRACT Objectives: To explore the experiences of service users, carers and staff seeking or providing secondary mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Qualitative interview study, co-designed with mental health service users and carers. Methods: We conducted semi-structured, telephone or online interviews with a purposively constructed sample; a peer researcher with lived experience conducted and analysed interviews with service users. Analysis was based on the constant comparison method. Setting: NHS secondary mental health services in England between June and August 2020. Participants: Of 65 participants, 20 had either accessed or needed to access English secondary mental healthcare during the pandemic; 10 were carers of people with mental health difficulties; 35 were members of staff working in NHS secondary mental health services during the pandemic. Results: Experiences of remote care were mixed. Some service users valued the convenience of remote methods in the context of maintaining contact with familiar clinicians. Most participants commented that a lack of non-verbal cues and the loss of a therapeutic safe space challenged therapeutic relationship building, assessments, and identification of deteriorating mental wellbeing. Some carers felt excluded from remote meetings and concerned that assessments were incomplete without their input. Like service users, remote methods posed challenges for clinicians who reported uncertainty about technical options and a lack of training. All groups expressed concern about intersectionality exacerbating inequalities and the exclusion of some service user groups if alternatives to remote care are lost. Conclusions: Whilst remote mental healthcare is likely to become increasingly widespread in secondary mental health services, our findings highlight the continued importance of a tailored, personal approach to decisions about remote mental healthcare. Further research should focus on which types of consultations best suit face-to-face interaction, and for whom and why, and which can be provided remotely and by which medium.","Elisa Liberati; Natalie Richards; Jennie Parker; Janet Willars; David Scott; Nicola Boydell; Vanessa Pinfold; Graham Martin; Mary Dixon-Woods; Peter B Jones","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250032","20210120","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9664,""
"Sleeping under the waves: a longitudinal study across the contagion peaks of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy","After the March-April 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, a second contagion wave afflicted Europe in autumn. This study aimed to evaluate sleep health/patterns of Italians during this further challenging situation. A total of 2013 Italians longitudinally participated in a web-based survey during the two contagion peaks of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the risk factors for sleep disturbances during the second wave, and we compared sleep quality and psychological well-being between the two assessments (March-April and November-December 2020). Female gender, low education, evening chronotype, being at high-risk for COVID-19 infection, reporting negative social or economic impact, and evening smartphone overuse predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and insomnia symptoms during the second wave. Advanced age, living with high-risk subjects for COVID-19 infection, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19 before the prior two weeks were risk categories for poor sleep quality. Living with children, having contracted COVID-19 before the prior two weeks, being pessimistic on the vaccine, and working in healthcare were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. The follow-up assessment highlighted reduced insomnia symptoms and anxiety. Nevertheless, we showed reduced sleep duration, higher daytime dysfunction and sleep medication use, and advanced sleep phase, confirming the alarming prevalence of poor sleepers (~60%) and severe depression (~20%) in a context of increased perceived stress. This study demonstrated a persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and mental health. Large-scale interventions to counteract the chronicity and exacerbation of sleep and psychological disturbances are necessary, especially for the risk categories.","Federico Salfi; Aurora D'Atri; Daniela Tempesta; Michele Ferrara","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.21249947","20210120","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9665,""
"Life with Parkinson's Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Pressure Is ""OFF""","People with Parkinson's disease (PwP) have been suggested to be more vulnerable to negative psychological and psycho-social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim was to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in PwP. A Danish/Swedish cohort of 67 PwP was analysed. Health-related quality of life (HRQL), depression, anxiety, apathy, sleep and motor symptom-scores were included in the analysis. Additionally, the Danish participants provided free-text descriptions of life during the pandemic. Overall, the participants reported significantly better HRQL during the COVID-19 period compared with before. Reduced social pressure may be part of the explanation. Despite worsened anxiety, night sleep improved.","HÃ˜rmann Thomsen, Trine; Wallerstedt, Susanna M; Winge, Kristian; Bergquist, Filip","https://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JPD-202342","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Parkinsons Dis;2021 Jan 12.; Publication details: J Parkinsons Dis;2021 Jan 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9666,""

"Digging Signatures in 13-Month-Old 3xTg-AD Mice for Alzheimer's Disease and Its Disruption by Isolation Despite Social Life Since They Were Born","The severity of this pandemic's scenarios will leave significant psychological traces in low resistant and resilient individuals  Increased incidence of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder has already been reported  The loss of human lives and the implementation of physical distance measures in the pandemic and post-COVID scenarios may have a greater impact on the elderly, mostly in those with dementia, as OCD and other neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are quite prevalent in this population  Modeling NPS in animals relies in neuroethological perspectives since the response to new situations and traumatic events, critical for survival and adaptation to the environment, is strongly preserved in the phylogeny  In the laboratory, mice dig vigorously in deep bedding to bury food pellets or small objects they may find  This behavior, initially used to screen anxiolytic activity, was later proposed to model better meaningless repetitive and perseverative behaviors characteristic of OCD or autism spectrum disorders  Other authors found that digging can also be understood as part of the expression of the animalsâ€™ general activity  In the present brief report, we studied the digging ethograms in 13-month-old non-transgenic and 3xTg-AD mice modeling normal aging and advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively  This genetic model presents AD-like cognitive dysfunction and NPS-like phenotype, with high mortality rates at this age, mostly in males  This allowed us to observe the digging pattern's disruption in a subgroup of 3xTg-AD mice that survived to their cage mates  Two digging paradigms involving different anxiogenic and contextual situations were used to investigate their behavior  The temporal course and intensity of digging were found to increase in those 3xTg-AD mice that had lost their â€˜room partnersâ€™ despite having lived in social structures since they were born  However, when tested under neophobia conditions, this behavior's incidence was low (delayed), and the temporal pattern was disrupted, suggesting worsening of this NPS-like profile  The outcomes showed that this combined behavioral paradigm unveiled distinct features of digging signatures that can be useful to study these perseverative behaviors and their interplay with anxiety states already present in the AD scenario and their worsening by naturalistic /forced isolation","","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2020.611384","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience;2021.; Publication details: Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9670,""
"COVID-19 policies in the UK and consequences for mental health","The lockdown to ""flatten the curve"" of COVID-19 has caused harm to many people globally  Over the past 6 months it has been nearly impossible to discern what the UK government strategy is in relation to the virus: suppression, or following of the model used in Sweden to foster community immunity? In mid-September, things became clearer: the UK is on a course for suppression until a vaccine or effective mass testing is in place  For good measure, UK residents have all been punished by new limits to the number of people socialising together, and have been warned that further restrictions could be imposed unless their supposedly reckless social behaviour improves  Frightening graphs depicting scenarios rather than predictions have been used to terrify people about the resurgence of the virus  However, it might be years before a safe vaccine is available, and the mass testing proposal dubbed moonshot is scientifically unsound and could do more harm than good  There is another way  One which takes account of the fact that COVID-19 does not have equal effects across age groups: for young people the risk of COVID-19 seems to be very low but the mental health of young people has been disproportionately affected during this crisis  We should allow young people to go about their lives normally and protect those who are older and more susceptible in a humane and compassionate manner;infectious diseases specialists have good ideas about implementing this suggestion  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366%2820%2930457-0","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: The Lancet Psychiatry;7(12):1014-1015, 2020.; Publication details: The Lancet Psychiatry;7(12):1014-1015, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9671,""

"The comparison and interaction of age and gender effects on cycling mode-share: An analysis of commuting in England and Wales","Introduction The physical and mental health benefits of cycling are well established  During the COVID-19 pandemic cycling has also presented additional health benefits by enabling social distancing compared to public transport modes  In low-cycling countries these benefits are unevenly realised, with substantial differences in cycling mode share by age and gender  In England and Wales women are four times less likely to commute by bicycle than men;and commuters aged 35â€“49 cycle more than other age categories  Methods This paper explores these demographic effects and their interactions  It uses logit models to examine the relationship between 17 determinants of cycling mode share and cycling rates for six demographic groups (males and females in age categories of 18-34, 35â€“49 and 50â€“74) across 29,694 small geographic units in England and Wales  The determinants comprise: distance;population density;cycle paths;cycle lanes;traffic density;hilliness;temperature;sun;rain;wind;wealth;lower social status;children;green votes;bicycle performance;traffic risk and parking costs  Results Determinants associated with physical effort (hilliness and distance) and traffic (traffic density and cycle lanes) are more important in the older age groups for both men and women  More important than the qualitative mix of determinants is their combined effect, or utility  Women require a higher threshold of utility to start cycling than men;and in higher utility environments gender differences are almost non-existent  Differences in cycling rates by age-group also reduce in higher utility environments, although the effects are less pronounced and older commuters still cycle less than other age-groups even in the highest utility environemnts  Conclusions The results provide insight into the relative importance of gender versus age, and illustrate that cycling rates are more strongly associated with gender than age  For both dimensions, better cycling environments are shown to be more equal cycling environments","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2020.101004","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Transport & Health;20:101004, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Transport & Health;20:101004, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9681,""

Cancer survivors are at particular risk of changes in behavioral patterns, as they were encouraged to be more vigilant and observe stricter social distancing guidelines. We explored 1) changes in physical activity/sedentary behaviors since COVID-19, and mental health status, 2) alternative strategies to support the survivors' physical activity and social support during and after COVID-19 including the role of digital health. A survey was distributed to cancer survivors participating (currently or in the past) in a community-based physical activity program, LIVESTRONG at the Y, from 3 sites surrounding an urban area of Massachusetts. Questions addressed pre-COVID vs. current changes in physical activity and sedentary time. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the GAD-2 and PHQ-2 with scores Ã¢â€°Â¥3 classified as clinically diagnosed anxiety/depression. Digital health preferences were assessed using closed ended questions. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Open-ended responses addressing other preferences for physical activity programs and social support were analyzed, coded and categorized into themes. Of the 61 participants, (mean age=62 Ã‚Â± 10.4; female=83.6%), 67.2% reported performing less physical activity and 67.2% reported sitting more since COVID-19 began. For the GAD-2 and PHQ-2, 24.6% and 26.2% met the criteria for clinical anxiety and depression, respectively. All participants (100%) reported having a cellphone; 90% had a smartphone. Preferences reported for physical activity programming (n=28) included three themes: 1) Use of digital/remote platforms (Zoom, online, videos), 2) Specific activities and locations (e.g. outdoors, walking, gardening, biking, YMCA, senior centers) and 3) Social support is important regardless of the type of activity (e.g. family, friends, peers and coaches). Participants reported a mean score of 71.8 Ã‚Â± 21.4 (scale 0-100) for importance of social support during physical activity programs. Social support preferences (n=15) included three themes: 1) Support from remote platforms (e.g. text messaging, Zoom, phone calls, emails and Facebook), 2) Tangible support in person (YMCA, Senior Center), and 3) Social support with no specific platform (e.g. small groups and family/friend visits). Since the start of COVID-19, cancer survivors in our study have experienced decreased physical activity and increased sedentary time. Depression and anxiety were reported by one-quarter of respondents. Both physical activity and mental health are critical factors in survivor's quality of life, and interventions tailored to survivors' preferences for activity are necessary. Digital remote physical activity programs with added social support may be a promising way to address ongoing needs during and after the pandemic.","Faro, Mattocks, Nagawa, Lemon, Wang, Cutrona, Sadasivam","https://doi.org/10.2196/25317","20210120","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9697,""
"Physical and Mental Health of Older People while Cocooning during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Cocooning or shielding, i.e. staying at home and reducing face-to-face interaction with other people, was an important part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic for older people. However, concerns exist regarding the long-term adverse effects cocooning may have on their physical and mental health. To examine health trajectories and healthcare utilization while cocooning in a cohort of community-dwelling people aged Ã¢â€°Â¥70 years. Survey of 150 patients (55% female, mean age 80 years, mean Clinical Frailty Scale Score 4.8) attending ambulatory medical services in a large urban university hospital. The survey covered four broad themes: access to healthcare services, mental health, physical health and attitudes to COVID-19 restrictions. Survey data was presented descriptively. Almost 40% (59/150) reported that their mental health was 'worse' or 'much worse' while cocooning, while over 40% (63/150) reported a decline in their physical health. Almost 70% (104/150) reported exercising less frequently or not exercising at all.Over 57% (86/150) of participants reported loneliness with 1 in 8 (19/150) reporting that they were lonely 'very often'. Half of participants (75/150) reported a decline in their quality of life (QOL).Over 60% (91/150) agreed with government advice for those Ã¢â€°Â¥70 years but over 40% (61/150) reported that they disliked the term 'cocooning'. Given the likelihood of further restrictions in coming months, clear policies and advice for older people around strategies to maintain social engagement, manage loneliness, continue physical activity and access timely medical care and rehabilitation services should be a priority.","Bailey, Ward, DiCosimo, Baunta, Cunningham, Romero-Ortuno, Kenny, Purcell, Lannon, McCarroll, Nee, Robinson, Lavan, Briggs","https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcab015","20210120","COVID-19; Loneliness; Mental health; Older; Shielding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9698,""
"Tinnitus in COVID-19 Pandemic","Tinnitus is a symptom that can significantly affect the quality of life of every patient. In patients with tinnitus, one of the most important diagnostic element is medical history data. Patients classify the pitch and loudness of tinnitus graphically using the visual analog scale (VAS). Visual analog scale and similar questionnaires constitute a valuable addendum of the clinical picture in patients with tinnitus. It seems essential, especially in the light of the information presented in the case report on the probability of correlation between tinnitus and stress and depression associated with social isolation infection avoidance. The knowledge about the patient's hearing condition before contracting COVID-19, the early symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the method of diagnosis of the infection, the time and method of isolation of the patient, and the time from the diagnosis of COVID-19 to the appearance of otolaryngological symptoms might enable the reader to gain more knowledge on the correlation between COVID-19 and tinnitus.

"[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent health and development: a role to play for physicians]","This article summarizes the conclusion of a two-days interprofessional online workshop held under the auspices of the Brocher Foundation. The objectives were to review the impact of COVID on adolescent health and development and to generate some key responses to the situation. The pandemic has severely affected the mental health of a large proportion of adolescents and has significantly reduced access to health care. It has as well disturbed the school education of vulnerable youngsters and decreased social contacts with adults and peers. In the future, authorities should better consider the rights of young people and request their opinion and participation in decision making. Physicians should systematically explore their young patients' opinions and queries regarding the COVID and address problematic situations such as family conflicts, misuse of internet or risky behaviour.

"Promoting Healthy Aging During COVID-19","Older adults have been markedly impacted by the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The American Geriatrics Society previously published a White Paper on Healthy Aging in 2018 that focused on a number of domains that are core to healthy aging in older adults: health promotion, injury prevention, and managing chronic conditions; cognitive health; physical health; mental health; and social health. The potentially devastating consequences of COVID-19 on health promotion are recognized. The purpose of this article is multifold. First, members of the Healthy Aging Special Interest Group will present the significant difficulties and obstacles faced by older adults during this unprecedented time. Second, we provide guidance to practicing geriatrics healthcare professionals overseeing the care of older adults. We provide a framework for clinical evaluation and screening related to the five aforementioned domains, that uniquely impact older adults. Last, we provide strategies that could enhance healthy aging in the era of COVID-19.","Batsis, Daniel, Eckstrom, Goldlist, Kusz, Lane, Loewenthal, Coll, Friedman","https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17035","20210120","COVID-19; healthy aging; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9702,""
"A severe COVID-19 case with schizophrenia as well as other chronic diseases","The prognosis of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is usually poor when it occurs in aged adults or in patients with chronic diseases, which brought a great challenge to clinical practice. Furthermore, widespread depression, anxiety, and panic related to SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2) infection affected treatment compliance and recovery. Here we report the successful treatment of a 57-year-old male with severe COVID-19, schizophrenia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The patient's negative emotions (such as tension, panic, and anxiety), particularly his aggression and paranoia, seriously hindered treatment, leading to a deteriorating condition. Psychological counseling and supportive psychotherapy were given but the effect was weak. To improve adherence, risperidone and quetiapine fumarate were replaced by olanzapine for anti-schizophrenic treatment to reduce insomnia and anxiety side effects, associated with sedative-hypnotic drugs as well as psychological counseling. The treatment compliance of the patient improved significantly. The patient's serum alanine aminotransferase increased abnormally in the late stage of hospitalization, suggesting potential liver damage after complex medication strategies. We also monitored the changes of lymphocyte subsets and retrospectively analyzed the virus-specific antibody response. The results suggested that dynamic monitoring of lymphocyte subsets and virus-specific antibody response could facilitate disease progression evaluation and timely treatment plan adjustments. An effective psychotropic drug intervention associated with psychological counselling and psychotherapy are essential for the successful adherence, treatment, and rehabilitation of psychiatric disorders in COVID-19 patients.","Zeng, Zhang, He, Lai, Huang, Lin, Zhong, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1590/1414-431X202010426","20210120","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9703,""
"Association between maternity harassment and depression during pregnancy amid the COVID-19 state of emergency","Maternity harassment, known in English as pregnancy discrimination, remains prevalent in developed countries. However, research examining the mental health effects of maternity harassment is lacking. We aimed to examine the association between maternity harassment and depression during pregnancy in Japan. A cross-sectional Internet survey was conducted on 359 pregnant employees (including women who were working at the time their pregnancy was confirmed) from May 22 to May 31, 2020, during which time a COVID-19 state of emergency was declared. Maternity harassment was defined as being subjected to any of the 16 adverse treatments prohibited by national guidelines. Depression was defined as a score of Ã¢â€°Â¥9 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (Japanese version). Logistic regression analysis was performed. Overall, 24.8% of the pregnant employees had experienced maternity harassment by supervisors and/or colleagues. After adjusting for demographics, pregnancy status, work status, and fear of COVID-19, pregnant employees who experienced maternity harassment were more likely to have depression than those who did not (odds ratio 2.48, 95% confidential interval 1.34-4.60). This association was not influenced by whether they were teleworking or not as a COVID-19 measure. One quarter of pregnant employees experienced maternity harassment and had a higher prevalence of depression than those who did not. Being physically away from the office through teleworking may not reduce the effect of maternal harassment on depression. To protect the mental health and employment of pregnant women, employers should comply with the laws and take measures to prevent maternity harassment.","Kachi, Fujiwara, Eguchi, Inoue, Baba, Ohta, Tsutsumi","https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12196","20210120","maternity harassment; mental health; pregnancy discrimination; pregnant employees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9704,""

Here we investigated the impact of male sex and age by infecting adult male, aged male, and adult female ferrets with SARS-CoV-2. Aged male ferrets had a decrease in temperature which was accompanied by prolonged viral replication with increased pathology in the upper respiratory tract after infection. Transcriptome analysis of the nasal turbinates and lungs indicated that female ferrets had significant increases in interferon response genes (OASL, MX1, ISG15, etc.) on day 2 post infection which was delayed in aged males. In addition, genes associated with taste and smell such as RTP1, CHGA, and CHGA1 at later time points were upregulated in males but not in females. These results provide insight into COVID-19 and suggests that older males may play a role in viral transmission due to decreased antiviral responses.","Francis, Richardson, McNeil, Rioux, Foley, Ge, Pechous, Kindrachuk, Cameron, Richardson, Lew, Cameron, Gerdts, Falzarano, Kelvin","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.12.426381","20210120","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9705,""
"Mixed Method Study to Explore Ethical Dilemmas and Health Care Workers' Willingness to Work Amid COVID-19 Pandemic in Palestine","<b>Background:</b> The high potential risks involved in working in a healthcare setting during a pandemic and the associated fear that may affect health care workers' (HCWs') willingness to work are important to understand to eliminate potential barriers to working. This study aimed to assess Palestinian HCWs' willingness to work and the related factors as well as to explore their ethical dilemmas during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Quantitative (survey questionnaire) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews) data were collected. Frontline HCWs (<i>n</i> = 550) received an online survey link via closed institutional networks. Frequencies summarized the data, and chi-square compared variables and outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) and multivariable analysis examined predictors for willingness to work. Fifteen HCWs (physicians, nurses, and lab and radiology technicians) were purposefully sampled and agreed to interviews to explore their thoughts, motivations, and worries. Thematic analysis focused on ethical dilemmas to enhance the breadth and the depth of the study. <b>Results:</b> Almost 25% of surveyed HCWs were not willing to work during the pandemic. Logistic model results showed that physicians and nurses had higher willingness to work than others (<i>p</i> = 0.004, Adj. OR = 3.5). Lower stress levels and longer professional experience were predictors of more willing to work (<i>p</i> = 0.03, Adj. OR = 2.5; <i>p</i> = 0.03, Adj. OR = 2.6, respectively). Interviews showed that willingness to work did not preclude HCWs from fulfilling their duties despite grueling workloads and grave fears about safety and security. HCWs felt poorly prepared, unappreciated, and frustrated by unfair work distribution. The occupation presented additional safety issues. <b>Conclusion:</b> Physicians and nurses were more likely to comply with a commitment to their professional ethics and the duty or obligation to work. Stress levels could be mitigated in the future with better leadership, adding supports to address mental health and psychosocial challenges to enhance HCWs' well-being and improve quality of care. The realities of the occupation added additional threats and uncertainty.","Maraqa, Nazzal, Zink","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.576820","20210120","COVID 19; Palestine; duty to work; ethical dilemmas; health care workers; willingness to work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9706,""
"Mental Health Outcomes in Healthcare Workers in COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Care Units: A Cross-Sectional Survey in Belgium","The literature shows the negative psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on frontline healthcare workers. However, few are known about the mental health of physicians and nurses working in general hospitals during the outbreak, caring for patients with COVID-19 or not. This survey assessed differences in mental health in physicians and nurses working in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 medical care units. A cross-sectional mixed-mode survey was used to assess burnout, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress. A total of 1,244 physicians and nurses from five general hospitals in Belgium, working in COVID-19 care units (CCU), non-COVID-19 care units (NCCU), or both (CCU + NCCU) were informed of the study. Six hundred forty-seven healthcare workers participated in the survey (response rate = 52%). Validated instruments were used to assess the outcomes: the <i>PFI</i> (burnout/professional fulfillment), the <i>ISI</i> (insomnia), and the <i>DASS-21</i> (depression, anxiety, and stress). Results showed high prevalence of burnout, insomnia, depression, and anxiety among participants. After adjusting for confounders, multivariate analysis of variance showed no differences between CCU, NCCU, and CCU + NCCU workers. Univariate general linear models showed higher level of burnout, insomnia, and anxiety among nurses in comparison to physicians. Being a nurse, young, isolated, with an increased workload were risk factors for worse mental health outcomes. The mental health of the tested sample, before the outbreak, is unknown. Moreover, this cross-sectional design provides no information on the evolution of the mental health outcomes over time. Directly caring for patients with COVID-19 is not associated with worse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers in general hospitals. High prevalence of burnout, insomnia, depression, and anxiety among physicians and nurses requires special attention, and specific interventions need to be implemented.

"Is Fear of COVID-19 Contagious? The Effects of Emotion Contagion and Social Media Use on Anxiety in Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, causing substantial anxiety. One potential factor in the spread of anxiety in response to a pandemic threat is emotion contagion, the finding that emotional experiences can be socially spread through conscious and unconscious pathways. Some individuals are more susceptible to social contagion effects and may be more likely to experience anxiety and other mental health symptoms in response to a pandemic threat. Therefore, we studied the relationship between emotion contagion and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. We administered the Emotion Contagion Scale (ESC) along with a measure of anxiety in response to COVID-19 (modified from a previous scale designed to quantify fear of the Swine Flu outbreak) and secondary outcome measures of depression, anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. These measures were completed by a large (<i>n</i> = 603) student sample in the United States. Data were collected in the months of April and May of 2020 when the fear of COVID-19 was widespread. Results revealed that greater susceptibility to emotion contagion was associated with greater concern about the spread of COVID-19, more depression, anxiety, stress, and OCD symptoms. Consumption of media about COVID-19 also predicted anxiety about COVID-19, though results were not moderated by emotion contagion. However, emotion contagion did moderate the relationship between COVID-19-related media consumption and elevated OCD symptoms. Although limited by a cross-sectional design that precludes causal inferences, the present results highlight the need for study of how illness fears may be transmitted socially during a pandemic.","Wheaton, Prikhidko, Messner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567379","20210120","COVID-19; anxiety; emotion contagion; media effect; pandemic (COVID-19)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9708,""

As the world faces the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, the oncology community is being impacted by unprecedented challenges. During this trying time, patients with ovarian cancer (OC) have been affected by a delay in diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and oncology follow-ups being conducted via telemedicine instead of in-person visits. OC patients and their oncologists are balancing the fears of COVID-19 and cancer treatment with the consequences of delaying cancer care. The delay in treatment care that women with OC are experiencing has resulted in higher levels of cancer worry, anxiety, and depression. In this article, we succinctly review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment and ongoing clinical trials of OC. We also discuss the psychological effects of COVID-19 on women with OC and alternative therapeutic strategies to limit in-person hospital visits to reduce the spread of the disease, and the impact of COVID-19 on OC patients.","Jacome, Deshmukh, Thulasiraman, Holliday, Singh","https://doi.org/10.2147/CMAR.S287152","20210120","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; cancer care delay; ovarian cancer management; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9709,""
"Patients' Responses to the Sudden Interruption of Chemotherapy During the Outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus: A Cross-Sectional Study","This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the responses of cancer patients' indifferent chemotherapy cycles to the unstructured treatment interruption during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Data from 156 adult patients with common solid tumors undergoing chemotherapy or ready to begin chemotherapy after surgery before the COVID-19 outbreak were analyzed in the study. Patients' responses to the chemotherapy interruption and their anxiety were assessed. Overall, 141 (90%) patients completed the study, and 115 (81.6%) accepted a switch from their previous intravenous chemotherapy to oral chemotherapy. Of these, 29 (65.9%) patients with lung cancer, 25 (86.2%) with gastric cancer, 33 (89.2%) with colorectal cancer and 28 (90.3%) with breast cancer switched from intravenous to oral treatment, heeding their doctor's advice. Of the participants, 85 (60.3%) patients reported that they had taken at least one kind of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) scores increased in patients with advanced refractory cancer compared with the scores of adjuvant chemotherapy patients (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). The prevalence of anxiety was high in cancer patients aged 60 years or older. Furthermore, anxiety was associated with advanced incurable cancer (<i>PÃ¢â‚¬Å </i>&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05), and this finding remained after adjusting for chronic pain. In addition, there were significantly increased scores of anxiety in patients with lung cancer (<i>PÃ¢â‚¬Å </i>&lt;0Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). Our study shows that most cancer patients remained relatively stable and had switched from intravenous to oral treatment at home.

We evaluated the impact of the lockdown in terms of healthcare provisions, physical health, mental health and social well-being within a multicentre cross-sectional study in India. The SMART India study is an ongoing house-to-house survey conducted across 20 regions including 11 states and 1 union territory in India to study diabetes and its complications in the community. During the lockdown, we developed an online questionnaire and delivered it in English and seven popular Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Telegu, Kannada, Bengali, Malayalam) to random samples of SMART-India participants in two rounds from 5 May 2020 to 24 May 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the overall impact on health and healthcare provision in phases 3 and 4 of lockdown in red and non-red zones and their interactions. A total of 2003 participants completed this multicentre survey. The bivariate relationships between the outcomes and lockdown showed significant negative associations.

"Post-traumatic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic in carers of children in Portugal and the UK: cross-sectional online survey","Although the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health have attracted interest, little attention has focused on its positive effects and possible post-traumatic growth. To assess anxiety, well-being and post-traumatic growth in carers of children aged 6-16 years in Portugal and the UK. A cross-sectional online survey of volunteers conducted at the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 during lockdown (1 May to 27 June 2020). A total of 385 caregivers (Portuguese, n = 185; UK, n = 200), predominantly mothers (n = 341, 88.6%), completed the survey. The majority were working exclusively from home (n = 271, 70.4%), almost half reported a reduction in income (n = 174, 45.2%), most children were home taught (n = 358, 93%), and 75 (19.5%) identified a family member with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In total, 341 caregivers (88.6%) identified positives arising from COVID-19, most commonly related to the post-traumatic growth domains of improved relationships, a greater appreciation of life, discovering and embracing new possibilities, and positive spiritual change. A comparison of those who did (n = 341) and did not (n = 34) report any positives found a significant difference in well-being scores (t373 = 2.24, P = 0.025) but not in anxiety scores (t373 = 0.75, P = 0.45). Despite experiencing considerable adversity, examples of post-traumatic growth during the lockdown were common. Although the voluntary online nature of our survey is a limitation, our findings suggest that further research exploring post-traumatic growth following pandemics is warranted.","Stallard, Pereira, Barros","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1","20210120","COVID-19; Carers; cross sectional; post-traumatic growth; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9714,""
"What was the impact of a global pandemic (COVID-19) lockdown period on experiences within an eating disorder service? A service evaluation of the views of patients, parents/carers and staff","The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic on the 11th March 2020. As a result, the UK Government imposed severe restrictions on working and social contact as part of &quot;lockdown.&quot; Whilst the full extent of the pandemic's impact on eating disorder patients is unknown, the literature suggests that patients with pre-existing mental illness may be more vulnerable to the mental health impacts. In addition, the restrictions greatly reduced the access to mental health services and presented new challenges to service delivery. A service evaluation was carried out to explore how the COVID-19 global pandemic changed service provision in a young person's eating disorder service and how this affected patient, family and staff experiences. An audit was carried out to explore how the lockdown period had impacted referrals and service delivery. Quantitative data was collected in an online survey and qualitative data was collected in two formats: open ended answers as part of the online survey and open-ended focus groups, structured using narrative enquiry. The 43 participants consisted of 12 patients, 19 parents/carers, and 12 staff members. Patients were under the age of 18 and had a diagnosis of an eating disorder. COVID-19 and lockdown increased the pressure on the service and changed service provision significantly. This has impacted the relational experiences for patients and their carers and staff have been faced with new challenges. Patients, parents/carers and staff all preferred face-to-face appointments over virtual options. There was no difference in service satisfaction before and during COVID-19. It is possible to provide an eating disorder service in lockdown restrictions that patients and parents report high satisfaction with. Providing face-to-face appointments at the beginning of treatment and including families in the planning should be prioritised. Staff support is crucial to be able to continue delivering high quality services. The key themes are identified, and clinical recommendations are made to guide service delivery.","Shaw, Robertson, Ranceva","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00368-x","20210120","COVID-19; Eating disorders; Global pandemic; Lockdown; Parent/Carer experience; Patient experience; Service development; Service evaluation; Service satisfaction; Staff experience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9715,""
"Physician Athletes Promoting Physical Fitness Through Social Media During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our daily lives and functioning. To reduce the potential transmission, countries throughout the world practiced social distancing. Unfortunately, this social distancing often contributed to a sense of social isolation and physical inactivity. Two physician athletes on opposite coasts of the United States sought to change this narrative by promoting physical activity among the general population with the #SocialDistancingFitnessChallenge. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April 2020, these physicians would post exercises during the 5-day workweek-one would post yoga/flexibility exercises, while the other would post high-intensity cardio and strength exercises on two social media platforms. Some posts would amass over 100,000 views. They received daily feedback on how this challenge not only encouraged others to be engaged in physical activity during the most challenging pandemic of our lifetimes, but it also improved their mental health and outlook on the future amid great uncertainty.","Stanford, Salles","https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839920988261","20210120","COVID-19; exercise; fitness; health; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9716,""
"Inter-proteomic posttranslational modifications of the SARS-CoV-2 and the host proteins Ã¢â‚¬â€™ A new frontier","Posttranslational modification of proteins, which include both the enzymatic alterations of protein side chains and main-chain peptide bond connectivity, is a fundamental regulatory process that is crucial for almost every aspects of cell biology, including the virus-host cell interaction and the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The posttranslational modification of proteins has primarily been studied in cells and tissues in an intra-proteomic context (where both substrates and enzymes are part of the same species). However, the inter-proteomic posttranslational modifications of most of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by the host enzymes and <i>vice versa</i> are largely unexplored in virus pathogenesis and in the host immune response. It is now known that the structural spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 undergoes proteolytic priming by the host serine proteases for entry into the host cells, and N- and O-glycosylation by the host cell enzymes during virion packaging, which enable the virus to spread. New evidence suggests that both SARS-CoV-2 and the host proteins undergo inter-proteomic posttranslational modifications, which play roles in virus pathogenesis and infection-induced immune response by hijacking the host cell signaling. The purpose of this minireview is to bring attention of the scientific community to recent cutting-edge discoveries in this understudied area. It is likely that a better insight into the molecular mechanisms involved may open new research directions, and thereby contribute to novel therapeutic modality development against the SARS-CoV-2. Here we briefly discuss the rationale and touch upon some unanswered questions in this context, especially those that require attention from the scientific community.","Mishra, Bassi, Nyomba","https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370220986785","20210120","Covid-19; host reaction; protein modifications; proteome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9717,""
"American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Recommendations to Address Psychiatric Staff Shortages in Emergency Settings","The psychological sequelae of the COVID-19 crisis will increase demands for psychiatric care in already strained emergency and mental health systems. To address the shortage of psychiatrists (and nurse practitioners and physician assistants) in emergency settings (ESs), the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry (AAEP) has established recommendations for utilizing nonprescribing mental health professionals in the evaluation and management of psychiatric patients in these contexts. Faced with limited research on the roles and competencies of nonprescribing psychiatric emergency clinicians (PECs), a multidisciplinary committee of members of AAEP was tasked with developing recommendations for use of PECs. The committee developed eight recommendations regarding the role of PECs in evaluation and management of patients who present to ESs with behavioral emergencies. PECs should have the following competencies: conducting independent psychiatric and substance abuse evaluations; managing behavioral emergencies; aiding in the recognition of confounding medical illnesses, intoxication and withdrawal states, and adverse drug reactions; developing appropriate treatment plans; recognizing when consultation from a psychiatrist or emergency physician is indicated; possessing self-awareness and recognizing clinician-patient dynamics; understanding medicolegal issues, such as involuntary holds and decision-making capacity; and collaborating with clinical teams in ESs. PECs are not meant to replace psychiatrists but to extend the psychiatrist's reach. Use of PECs has already been implemented in some areas of the country. On the basis of the AAEP recommendations, ESs can address staffing shortages while ensuring safe management of patients with behavioral emergencies. With appropriate orientation and training, the PEC can serve effectively and competently in an ES.","Richmond, Dragatsi, Stiebel, Rozel, Rasimus","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.201900501","20210120","Emergency psychiatry; Staff relationships/roles","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9718,""
"Palliative Care Professionals' Inner Lives: Cross-Cultural Application of the Awareness Model of Self-Care","Compassionate professional qualities traditionally have not received the most attention in either critical or end of life care. Constant exposure to death, time pressure and workload, inadequate coping with personal emotions, grieving, and depression urge the development of an inner curricula of competences to promote professional quality of life and compassionate care. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the universality of these problems and the need to equip ourselves with rigorously validated measurement and monitoring approaches that allow for unbiased comparisons. The main objective of this study was to offer evidence on the generalizability of the awareness model of self-care across three care systems under particular idiosyncrasy. Regarding the sample, 817 palliative care professionals from Spain, Argentina, and Brazil participated in this cross-sectional study using a multigroup structural equation modeling strategy. The measures showed good reliability in the three countries. When testing the multigroup model against the configural and constrained models, the assumptions were fulfilled, and only two relationships of the model revealed differences among contexts. The hypotheses posited by the awareness model of self-care were supported and a similar predictive power on the professional quality of life dimensions was found. Self-care, awareness, and coping with death were competences that remained outstanding no matter the country, resulting in optimism about the possibility of acting with more integrative approaches and campaigns by international policy-makers with the consensus of world healthcare organizations.","Oliver, Galiana, Simone, TomÃƒÂ¡s, Arena, Linzitto, Grance, SansÃƒÂ³","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9010081","20210120","compassion fatigue; compassion satisfaction; compassionate care; cross-cultural comparison","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9719,""
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, Sleep and Self-Regulation in Spanish Preschoolers during the COVID-19 Lockdown","A better understanding of the effects of the lockdown on lifestyle behaviors may help to guide the public health response to COVID-19 at a national level and to update the global strategy to respond COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on device-measured physical activity (PA), sedentary time, sleep and self-regulation; and to determine whether PA and sleep are related to self-regulation problems during the lockdown. PA, sedentary time and sleep were assessed using accelerometry in the week in which the Spanish national state of alarm was declared (<i>n</i> = 21). Parents reported preschooler's self-regulation difficulties (internalizing and externalizing) before (<i>n</i> = 268) and during the lockdown (<i>n</i> = 157) by a validated questionnaire. Preschoolers showed a decrease in total PA (mean difference [MD] = -43.3 min per day, 95% CI -68.1 to -18.5), sleep efficiency (MD = -2.09%, 95% CI -4.12 to -0.05), an increase in sedentary time (MD = 50.2 min per day, 95% CI 17.1 to 83.3) internalizing (MD = 0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28) and externalizing (MD = 0.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.44) problems. Preschoolers who met the World Health Organization recommendations for PA had lower internalizing scores than non-active peers (MD = -1.28, 95% CI -2.53 to -0.03). Our findings highlight the importance of meeting PA recommendations to reduce psychosocial difficulties during a lockdown situation.","Alonso-MartÃƒÂ­nez, RamÃƒÂ­rez-VÃƒÂ©lez, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Alonso, Izquierdo, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Hermoso","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020693","20210120","coronavirus; healthy lifestyle; mental health; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-21","",9720,""

"â€œMy brain feels like a browser with 100 tabs openâ€: A longitudinal study of teachersâ€™ mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020","Teaching and caring for pupils during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for many teachers. In a time of greater job demands and limited job resources, its impact on teachersâ€™ mental health and wellbeing (MHWB) should be of great national and international concern, especially as it has implications for educational systems now and in the future. In this light, the current study examines 24 primary and secondary school teachersâ€™ MHWB experiences across three time points (April to November 2020) using longitudinal qualitative trajectory analysis. Generally, teachersâ€™ MHWB seemed to have declined throughout the pandemic, especially for primary school leaders. Moreover, using the Job Demandsâ€“Resources Model as a theoretical framework, we identified six job demands contributing negatively to teachersâ€™ MHWB (i.e., uncertainty, workload, negative perception of the profession, concern for othersâ€™ wellbeing, health struggles, and multiple roles) and three job resources contributing positively to their MHWB (i.e., social support, work autonomy, and coping strategies). Implications for policymakers and practitioners in supporting teachersâ€™ MHWB by engaging in more collaborative communication and ensuring greater accessibility to sources of social support are discussed.","Lisa E.
