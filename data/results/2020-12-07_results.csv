"A cross-national study of factors associated with perinatal mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background. Pregnant and postpartum women face unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic that may put them at elevated risk of mental health problems. However, few large-scale and no cross-national studies have been conducted to date that investigate modifiable pandemic-related behavioral or cognitive factors that may influence mental health in this vulnerable group. This international study sought to identify and measure the associations between pandemic-related information seeking, worries, and prevention behaviors on perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Findings. An anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant and postpartum women was conducted in 64 countries between May 26 2020 and June 13 2020. The survey, available in twelve languages, was hosted on the Pregistry platform for COVID-19 studies (https://corona.pregistry.com), and advertised predominantly in social media channels and online parenting forums. Participants completed measures on demographic characteristics, COVID-19 exposure and worries, media exposure, COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and mental health symptoms including posttraumatic stress symptoms via the IES-6, anxiety/depression via the PHQ-4, and loneliness via the UCLA-3. Of the 6,894 participants, substantial proportions of women scored at or above the cut-offs for elevated posttraumatic stress (2,979 [43%]), anxiety/depression (2,138 [31%], and loneliness (3,691 [53%]). Information seeking from any source (e.g., social media, news, talking to others) five or more times per day was associated with more than twice the odds of elevated posttraumatic stress and anxiety/depression, in adjusted models. A large majority of women (86%) reported being somewhat or very worried about COVID-19. The most commonly reported worries were related to pregnancy and delivery, including family being unable to visit after delivery (59%), the baby contracting COVID-19 (59%), lack of a support person during delivery (55%), and COVID-19 causing changes to the delivery plan (41%). Greater worries related to children (i.e. inadequate childcare, their infection risk) and missing medical appointments were associated with significantly higher odds of posttraumatic stress, anxiety/depression and loneliness. Engaging in hygiene-related COVID-19 prevention behaviors (face mask-wearing, washing hands, disinfecting surfaces) were not related to mental health symptoms or loneliness. Conclusions. Clinically significant posttraumatic stress, anxiety/depression, and loneliness are highly prevalent in pregnant and postpartum women across 64 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive information seeking and worries related to children and medical care are associated with clinically significant symptoms, whereas engaging in hygiene-related preventive measures were not. In addition to screening and monitoring mental health symptoms, reinforcing healthy information seeking, addressing worries about access to medical care and the well-being of their children, and strategies to target loneliness (e.g., online support groups) should be part of intervention efforts for perinatal women. Public and mental health interventions need to explicitly address the impact of COVID-19 on both physical and mental health in perinatal women, as prevention of viral exposure itself does not mitigate the mental health impact of the pandemic.","Archana Basu; Hannah Hayoung Kim; Karmel Choi; Lily Charron; Nora Kelsall; Rebecca Basaldua; Sonia Hernandez-Diaz; Diego Wyszynski; Karestan Koenen","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.03.20243519","20201204","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7815,""
"Covid-19 Will Reduce US Life Expectancy at Birth by More Than One Year in 2020","On December 3rd, 2020, the cumulative number of U.S. Covid-19 deaths tallied by Johns Hopkins University (JHU) online dashboard reached 275,000, surpassing the number at which life table calculations show Covid-19 mortality will lower the U.S. life expectancy at birth (LEB) for 2020 by one full year. Such an impact on the U.S. LEB is unprecedented since the end of World War II. With additional deaths by the year end, the reduction in 2020 LEB induced by Covid-19 deaths will inexorably exceed one year. Factoring the expected continuation of secular gains against other causes of mortality, the U.S. LEB should still drop by more than a full year between 2019 and 2020. By comparison, the opioid-overdose crisis led to a decline in U.S. LEB averaging .1 year annually, from 78.9 years in 2014 to 78.6 years in 2017. At its peak, the HIV epidemic reduced the U.S. LEB by .3 year in a single year, from 75.8 years in 1992 to 75.5 years in 1993. As of now, the US LEB is expected to fall back to the level it first reached in 2010. In other words, the impact of Covid-19 on U.S. mortality can be expected to cancel a decade of gains against all other causes of mortality combined.","Patrick Heuveline","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.03.20243717","20201204","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7816,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and well-being of people living with a long-term physical health condition: a qualitative study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions caused major global disruption. Individuals with long-term physical health conditions (LTCs) are at higher risk of severe illness and often subject to the strictest pandemic guidance, so may be disproportionally affected. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore how living with a LTC during the COVID-19 pandemic affected mental health and wellbeing. Sample and methods: 32 participants, mean age 57 (SD 13) years, 66% female and 72% white British, who reported having LTCS (most commonly cancer, respiratory conditions or cardiovascular diseases), participated in telephone/video call interviews based on a semi-structured topic guide. Key themes and subthemes were determined using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. Results: There were four overarching themes specific to living with a LTC. These were 1) high levels of fear and anxiety related to perceived consequences of catching COVID-19, 2) impact of shielding/isolation on mental health and wellbeing, 3) experience of healthcare during the pandemic and 4) anxiety created by uncertainty about the future. Fourteen subthemes were identified, including concerns about accessing essential supplies and the importance of social support. Individuals who lived alone and were advised to shield could be profoundly negatively affected. Conclusions: This study found that there were a number of aspects of living with a LTC during the pandemic that had a significant impact on mental health and well-being. There should be focus on how best to provide practical and social support to people with LTCs during a pandemic, particularly if they have to shield or isolate.","Abigail Fisher; Anna Roberts; Alison R McKinlay; Daisy Fancourt; Alexandra Burton","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.03.20243246","20201204","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7817,""
"Mental health problems in the general population during and after the first lockdown phase due to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic: Rapid review of multi-wave studies","Background The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic and the lockdown response have increased mental health problems in general populations compared to pre-pandemic times. The course of mental health problems during and after the first lockdown phase has not yet been reviewed. Methods We conducted a rapid review of multi-wave studies in general populations with time points during and after the first lockdown phase. Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were included. The main outcome assessed was whether indicators of mental health problems have changed during and after the first lockdown phase. The study was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42020218640 Findings 23 studies with 56 indicators were included in the qualitative review. Studies that reported data from pre-pandemic assessments through lockdown indicated an increase in mental health problems. During lockdown no uniform trend could be identified. After lockdown mental health problems decreased slightly. Interpretation As mental health care utilization indicators and data on suicides do not suggest an increase in demand during the first lockdown phase, we regard the increase in mental health problems as general distress that is to be expected during a global health crisis. Several methodological, pandemic-related, response-related and health policy-related factors need to be considered when trying to gain a broader perspective on the impact of the first wave of the pandemic and the first phase of lockdown on general populations' mental health.","Dirk Richter; Steffi Riedel-Heller; Simeon Zuercher","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.03.20243196","20201204","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7818,""
"Quality of life and depressive symptoms among Peruvian university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives . Characterize the quality of life and depressive symptoms of university students in Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine the associated factors. Methods. Multi-centre study in 1634 university students recruited by convenience sampling. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions at three levels (EQ-5D-3L) and depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionarie-9 (PHQ-9). To evaluate factors associated with QoL and depressive symptoms, linear and adjusted regressions were used, with robust variance reporting coefficients ({beta}). Results. The percentage of participants most affected by QoL dimension was: anxiety/depression (47.2%) and pain/discomfort (35.6%). Regarding the Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) of QoL, the score was 76.0 + 25.6. Those who had family economic decline during quarantine ({beta}=-3.4, IC95%=-6.5 to -0.3) or family with chronic diseases ({beta}=-3.7, IC95%=-6.1 to -1.4) presented significantly lower scores in their QoL. Regarding depressive symptomatology, the university students reported a moderate to severe level (28.9%). A higher risk of depressive symptoms was found in residents of Ayacucho ({beta}=0.8, IC95%=0.1 to 1.5), those who were released from quarantine ({beta}=0.7, IC95%=0.2 to 1.2) and those who had a family member with chronic disease ({beta}=1.5, IC95%=1.0 to 2.1). Conclusions. Almost half and one third of participants reported anxiety/depression, and pain/discomfort in their QoL respectively. Nearly a third presented moderate and severe depressive symptoms. The deterioration of QoL was worse in those who had a decrease in income and a family member with chronic illness. The presence of depressive symptoms was found in students in Ayacucho, those who left home during quarantine and those who had a family member with chronic diseases.","Joel Figueroa-QuiÃ±ones; Miguel IpanaquÃ©-Zapata; Daniel Machay-Pak; Juan Rodriguez-Ruiz","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.411330","20201204","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7819,""

"How People Evaluate Anti-Corona Measures for Their Social Spheres: Attitude, Subjective Norm, and Perceived Behavioral Control","Restrictions on outdoor activities, tips for hygiene, and tips for mental health are among the most common initiatives to counter the COVID-19 pandemic  These measures aim to protect peopleâ€™s health and, at the same time, impact their social lives  So far, it is little known how people evaluate those anti-Corona measures with regard to their social spheres (close family, wider family and friends, colleagues, and society)  Furthermore, it is plausible that the subjective evaluation of attitudinal objects and especially severe events, like the COVID-19 pandemic and the related counter-measures, is multidimensional  Against this background, we combine the social spheres with the elements of the Theory of Planned Behavior  On the methodological basis of the Means-End Theory of Complex Cognitive Structures, we determine the perceived relevance and quality of the attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and social spheres regarding anti-Corona measures  Furthermore, the applied methodology allows the deduction of norm strategies to define the priority of securing or increasing the effectiveness of elements of anti-Corona measures  Based on the answers of 663 participants, we found that the protection from COVID-19 and its consequences (attitude) are more important to people than the practicability of anti-Corona measures in their social lives (perceived behavioral control), which, again, has a higher subjective relevance than the willingness to fulfill the expectations of others (subjective norm)  Additionally, people distinguish between their close family (higher subjective relevance) and their other social spheres (lower subjective relevance)  The people attribute the highest quality to the tips on hygiene, followed by the restrictions on outdoor activities and the tips for mental health  The protection and practicability of the anti-Corona measures have higher quality ratings than the willingness to fulfill the expectations of others  Based on the norm strategies, policymakers should secure the effectiveness of the current anti-Corona measures with a high priority by focusing on the protection and practicability with regard to close and wider family and friends  Increasing the effectiveness of the protection and practicability of anti-Corona measures in work and society also has a high priority  Focusing on the subjective norm should be of lower priority  Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Godbersen, Hofmann and Ruiz-FernÃ¡ndez","Godbersen, H.; Hofmann, L.

"Transitioning from face-to-face treatment to iCBT for youths in primary care â€“ therapistsâ€™ attitudes and experiences","Background To address the increasing mental health problems among young people, health care needs to broaden the spectrum of interventions and increase access to care  One particularly promising first-line intervention is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via the Internet (iCBT)  The outbreak of the Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19) has made the need for solid digital mental health care systems clear  This is the first published study exploring the transition among therapists of working with face-to-face treatment to using iCBT for youths suffering from anxiety treated in primary care  Methods Fourteen primary care therapists were included in the study  Semi-structured interviews (n=26) were conducted on two occasions: before starting to use iCBT for youths, and at a subsequent follow-up after gaining treatment experience  Data was summarized into thematic categories  Results The overarching themes that were identified were: Attitudes to iCBT before and after implementation;Experiences of treatment delivery;Characteristics of â€œthe right patient;â€ and The role of the digital therapist  Conclusion The participants generally had positive attitudes to iCBT for youths and saw it as a valuable alternative to face-to-face treatments  However, they identified challenges related to patient selection, and to motivating patients and maintaining a therapeutic relationship through mainly written communication  The participants appreciated the increase in variety that iCBT brought to their schedules, and also experienced iCBT as a relief from common challenges of therapeutic work, such as emotional stress and high cognitive demands  The participating therapistsâ€™ positive experiences support the introduction of iCBT for youths in routine primary care","Anonymous","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100356","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Internet Interventions;: 100356, 2020.; Publication details: Internet Interventions;: 100356, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7847,""
"Infection of horses with Equine Coronavirus (ECoV)","Coronaviruses have always been part of our biozoenosis  Different biological properties are part of their evolutionary strategies, such as the change of host systems, pathogenicity, organotropism, antigenicity and immunogenicity  In addition to humans and domesticated animals, a wide range of susceptible animal host systems exists  Coronaviruses have been divided into former group 1 and group 2 based on the different antigenic relationships  The new taxonomy now divides these viruses into the genera alpha-, beta- (man and animals) and gammacoronaviruses (poultry)  The first isolation of typical coronavirus particles was found by electron microscopy in faecal samples from foals in Kentucky  They died or were killed in the acute stages of gastroenteritis, described by Bass and Sharpee (1974)  Neutralizing antibodies against calf diarrhoea coronavirus were identified in equine sera  Durham et al  (1979) investigated foals in New Zealand with profuse watery diarrhoea and detected coronavirus in their faeces  They described a wide range of ages of the animals infected and serological cross-reaction with calf coronavirus  More virus-positive cases of enteric foal disease were reported in the following years  Eugster and Jones (1988) reported on coronavirus in an aborted equine foetus and Ward et al  (1983) described the presence of coronavirus in foals with diarrhoea  Sato et al  (1981) demonstrated neutralizing antibodies to calf diarrhoea coronavirus also in horses in Japan  All these reports deal with cases of severe gastroenteritis and foal diarrhoea  The first coronavirus-associated diarrhoea in mature horses was documented by Huang et al  (1983)  There were 113 clinical cases of an acute form of diarrhoea in Maryland, USA, in the summer of 1982  The isolated virus was not related to bovine coronavirus, swine transmissible gastroenteritis or avian infectious bronchitis based on fluorescent antibody tests  Coronavirus could be isolated not only from faeces but also from plasma samples of the sick horses  The classic virological diagnostic techniques have been now replaced by molecular tests using qPCR  Reports on disease associated with equine coronavirus (ECoV) infections mainly in mature horses in the U S A  have been based on qPCR positive faeces since about 1990  The description of the clinical signs, virus transmission and diagnosis of the ECoV disease could be summarized as follows  It is spread via oral investigation of qPCR positive faeces and faecal-oral transmission can also occur when horses make oral contact with surfaces or objects that have been contaminated with infected faeces  The disease is diagnosed most commonly in winter  Subclinically infected horses (11â€“93%) can spread ECoV depending on their carrier status  This pertains to foals and adult horses  Incubation is two to four days and the clinical signs are fever up to 40 5Â°C, anorexia, depression, sometimes colic, diarrhoea may or may not be present, and frequent lying down  Low white blood cell count (leucopenia, lymphopenia), hyperammonemia could be responsible, with signs of encephalopathic disease  The faecal virus load (ECoV genome equivalents per gram of faeces) might be of prognostic value in the horses affected  Prognosis is good in most cases  Exposure to the virus can result in up to 85% infection rate, however, most horses do not show clinical signs  A horse with fever and no respiratory clinical signs may have ECoV in the faeces  Therefore, the qPCR of their faeces is recommended  Epidemiological studies of ECoV infections are still limited  The seroprevalence has been investigated by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing ECoV spike S1 protein since 2017  Using this test, Zhao et al  (2019) demonstrated seroconversion by analysing 27 paired sera from horses involved in an ECoV outbreak  Seropositivity was carried by 25 9% (young horses) to 82 8% (adult horses) from 1084 sera from healthy Dutch horses  Sera of Icelandic horses reacted positive in 62%  This ELISA demonstrated the surprisingly high percentag of seropositive European horses  Seroprevalence in 9 6% of 5247 sera of healthy horses from different geographic regions of the U S A  was demonstrated by Kooijman et al  (2017)  Summarizing the results available, ECoV could be demonstrated in high percentages in faecal material and nasal secretions (Pusterla et al , 2019) and plasma and blood (Huang et al  1982, Goodrich et al  2020) from healthy and/or diseased horses  Therefore, it seems to be questionable whether faecal-oral transmission is be the only infection chain  Further investigations are necessary  This is also part of the recommended methods of prevention  The latter are based on the following: high standards of sanitation in all equine facilities;disinfection methods;isolation of horses for three weeks, especially those with fever and no evidence of respiratory illness and horses moving to new facilities, especially in cases where they moved from a facility with ECoV;and positive faeces test are recommended  Â©

"Aktueller Forschungsstand zur Psychotherapie fÃ¼r zu Hause lebende vulnerable Ã¤ltere Erwachsene mit depressiven Erkrankungen; Current state of research on psychotherapy for home-living vulnerable older adults with depression","Older home-living vulnerable adults often suffer from chronic conditions accompanied by restrictions in mobility, social participation and reduced independence. Among this rapidly growing population depression is aÂ common and serious health problem; however, there are shortcomings in the diagnosis of depression and provision of psychotherapy. Despite growing evidence in treating depression among the group of nursing home residents or the ""young-old"", there is aÂ research gap regarding needs-oriented healthcare strategies for very old, frail or care-dependent older adults living at home. The present article provides an overview of different outpatient psychotherapeutic treatment approaches for vulnerable older adults with depression, in particular adaptations tailored to those who are homebound or in need of care. Based on the current state of research, this article derives recommendations for psychotherapy in this special setting to consider the physical and psychosocial resources of this patient group. Furthermore, healthcare strategies for embedding psychotherapy in collaborative, telehealth or home-delivered healthcare services are described and their applicability as psychosocial support for older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is discussed. Psychotherapy is an efficacious treatment for depression in home-living vulnerable older adults. Further implementing telehealth or home delivered settings, individually tailored psychotherapeutic approaches as well as collaborative and stepped care approaches can increase utilization and medical supply of this patient group. More research and innovative programs are needed to improve access to and provision of psychotherapeutic care as well as their social inclusion.","Tegeler, Christina; Beyer, Ann-Kristin; Hoppmann, Fee; Ludwig, Valentina; Kessler, Eva-Marie","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00391-020-01805-3","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Z Gerontol Geriatr;2020 Nov 13.; Publication details: Z Gerontol Geriatr;2020 Nov 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7853,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on nurses working in a University Health System in Singapore: A qualitative descriptive study","Given Singapore's high population density and extensive geographical interconnections, it is unsurprising that the country reported one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases in Asia. Past pandemic studies have suggested that nurses working in such crises might experience a deterioration of mental health, which could persist for years beyond the initial outbreak. This study used a qualitative descriptive design to explore nurses' experiences of working in tertiary hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 17 registered nurses who had worked for at least one year prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were recruited from a University Health System in Singapore from March to June 2020. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews lasting at least an hour conducted over an online platform by the principal investigator. The data were analysed through Braun and Clarke's six-step thematic analysis independently by two researchers. Three main themes emerged: (i) challenging moments of COVID-19, during which the participants reported physical and psychological challenges relating to working conditions of the hospital in the initial months of the pandemic; (ii) the professional role as nurses, in where the participants dispelled their worries and demonstrated commitment to their role as nurses; and (iii) support for nurses, which originated from their family, friends and leaders from their organizations for them to persevere and overcome the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19. The nurses in this study demonstrated resilience and professionalism despite the challenges of COVID-19. The findings highlighted the importance of a robust support system for healthcare professionals.","Goh, Ow Yong, Chen, Ho, Chee, Chee","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12826","20201206","COVID-19; challenges: impact; nurses; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7854,""

Attention and resources have focused on physicians, patients, and healthcare systems with little information regarding the effects on nurses and technologists in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL). A national, online survey was conducted for nurses and technologists working in the CCL in the United States. The survey was self administered, anonymous, and included 45 questions assessing baseline demographics, logistical changes to workflow and responsibilities, staff preparedness, and mental health. A total of 450 respondents completed the survey, including 283 nurses (63%) and 167 technologists (37%). A total of 349 (78%) were female and mean age range was 41-50 years. Responses indicated that 68% were the primary financial provider for their families, and 74% experienced &gt;75% decrease in case volume despite a low inpatient COVID-19 census (54% of respondents with census &lt;10%). There were high rates of direct care for COVID-19 patients (47%), relocation (45%), lay-off/furloughs of part-time or per diem staff (42%), lay-offs of full-time staff (12%), and decreased work hours (65%). A total of 95% expressed decreased morale with an increase in mental distress, including depression (36%). Predictors of depression included relocation status, staff preparedness, and work hours. Logistical changes to CCL staffing resulted in relocation, lay-offs, furloughs, and diminished work hours, with financial and emotional ramifications.

"Cardiac Injury and Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 in New York City","Prior studies demonstrated that elevated troponin in patients with COVID-19 was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. However, the association of cardiac injury and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of cardiac injury with ECG abnormality and with in-hospital mortality. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 between 13 March and 31 March 2020. Those patients with troponin I measurement were included in the study and divided into those who had elevated troponin I (cardiac injury group) and those who did not (no cardiac injury group). Statistical analyses were performed to compare differences between the groups, and a multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to assess the effect of cardiac injury on in-hospital mortality. One hundred and eight-one (181) patients were included, 54 of whom were in the cardiac injury group and 127 in the no cardiac injury group. The mean age was 64.0Ã‚Â±16.6 years and 55.8% were male. The cardiac injury group was more likely to be older, have a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure compared to the no cardiac injury group (all p&lt;0.05); there was no difference in presence of chest pain (cardiac injury group versus no cardiac injury group: 17.0% versus 22.5%, p=0.92); the cardiac injury group had a significantly higher value of brain natriuretic peptide, procalcitonin, interleukin-6 and D-dimer (all p&lt;0.05); they had numerically more frequent ECG abnormalities such as T wave inversion (13.2% versus 7.5%, p=0.23) and ST depression (1.9% versus 0.0%, p=0.13) although statistically not significant; they had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (42.3% versus 12.6%, p&lt;0.001). With a multivariate logistic regression model, age (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.033 [1.002-1.065], p=0.034) and cardiac injury (3.25 [1.40-7.54], p=0.006) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Patients with COVID-19 with elevated troponin I had a relatively low proportion of chest pain and ECG abnormality.

"Exploring changes in body image, eating and exercise during the COVID-19 lockdown: A UK survey","Early reports suggest that lockdown measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., social distancing) are having adverse consequences for people's mental health, including increases in maladaptive eating habits and body dissatisfaction. Certain groups, such as those with pre-existing mental health difficulties, may be especially at risk. The current study explored perceived changes in eating, exercise, and body image during lockdown within the United Kingdom, using an online survey (n = 264). There were large individual differences in perceived changes in eating, exercise, and body image in this period. Women were more likely than men to report increasing struggles with regulating eating, preoccupation with food and worsening body image. Those with a current/past diagnosis of eating disorders reported significantly greater difficulties in regulating eating, increased preoccupation with food, exercise thoughts and behaviours and concern about appearance, even when compared to those with other mental health and developmental disorders. Ongoing research to explore individual differences in the trajectories of change in eating, exercise and body image as lockdown measures ease will be important for understanding the full psychological impact of this pandemic and improve service and public health planning going forward.","Robertson, Duffy, Newman, Bravo, Ates, Sharpe","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.105062","20201205","COVID-19; body image; eating behaviour; eating disorders; exercise; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7857,""
"Identification of Functional Limitations and Discharge Destination in COVID-19 Patients","The objectives of this study were to identify functional limitations in COVID-19 patients admitted to acute care hospitals, to evaluate functional limitations by demographic, medical and encounter characteristics, and to examine functional limitations in relation to discharge destination. This is a cross sectional, retrospective study of adult patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from two different types of hospitals (academic medical center and a community hospital) within one healthcare system between January 1 and April 30, 2020. Patients were identified from the Cedars-Sinai COVID-19 data registry who had a new onset positive test for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 273 cases were identified, which included 230 cases that were discharged alive and 43 patients who expired and were excluded from the study sample. Not applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional limitations in COVID-19 patients in acute care hospitals and the predictors for discharge disposition. A total of 230 records were analyzed including demographic, encounter, medical, and functional variables. In a propensity-score matched cohort based on age and comorbidity, 88.2% had functional physical health deficits, 72.5% had functional mental health deficits, and 17.6% experienced sensory deficits. In the matched cohort, individuals discharged to an institution experienced greater physical (62.7% vs. 25.5%, p&lt;.001) and mental health (49.0% vs. 23.5%, p=.006) deficits than patients discharged home. Marital status (OR 3.17, p=.011) and physical function deficits (OR 3.63, p=0.025) were associated with an increase odds ratio of discharge to an institution. This research highlights that functional status is a strong predictor for discharge destination to an institution for COVID-19 patients. Patients who were older, in the acute care hospital longer, and with comorbidities were more likely to be discharged to an institution. Rehabilitation is a significant aspect of the healthcare system for these vulnerable patients. The challenges of adjusting the role of rehabilitation providers and systems during the pandemic needs further exploration. Moreover, additional research is needed to look more closely at the many facets and timing of functional status needs, to shed light in utilization of interdisciplinary rehabilitation services, and to guide providers and healthcare systems in facilitating optimal recovery and patient outcomes.","Roberts, Wertheimer, Park, NuÃƒÂ±o, Riggs","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2020.11.005","20201205","COVID-19; functional limitations; rehabilitation practices","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7858,""
"Explaining the rise and fall of psychological distress during the COVID-19 crisis in the United States: Longitudinal evidence from the Understanding America Study","It has been shown that psychological distress rose rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged and then recovered to pre-crisis levels as social lockdown restrictions were eased in the United States. The aim of the current study was to investigate psychosocial and behavioural factors that may explain the rise and fall of distress during the initial months of the COVID-19 crisis. This study examined six waves of longitudinal nationally representative data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between March and June 2020 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7,138, observationsÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 34,125). Mediation analysis was used to identify whether changes in distress (PHQ-4) during the COVID-19 pandemic were explained by the following factors: perceived infection risk and risk of death, perceived financial risks, lifestyle changes resulting from the virus, perceived discrimination related to the virus, and changes in substance use and employment status. All mediating factors played a role in explaining changes in distress and together accounted for 70% of the increase in distress between 10-18 March and 1-14 April and 46.4% of the decline in distress between 1-14 April and early June 2020. Changes in perceived health risks were most important in explaining changes in distress followed by changes in lifestyle and the perceived financial risks associated with COVID-19. This study provides longitudinal population-based evidence detailing the mediating factors explaining changes in distress during the COVID-19 crisis. Perceived health risks associated with the virus may play a key role in explaining rising and falling levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Robinson, Daly","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12493","20201205","COVID-19; coronavirus infection; longitudinal study; mental health; national study; perceived risk; psychological distress; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7859,""
"Cutting Edge: Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Humans Is Defined by a Shift in the Serum Lipidome, Resulting in Dysregulation of Eicosanoid Immune Mediators","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 20 million people worldwide, with mortality exceeding 800,000 patients. Risk factors associated with severe disease and mortality include advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Each of these risk factors pathologically disrupts the lipidome, including immunomodulatory eicosanoid and docosanoid lipid mediators (LMs). We hypothesized that dysregulation of LMs may be a defining feature of the severity of COVID-19. By examining LMs and polyunsaturated fatty acid precursor lipids in serum from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we demonstrate that moderate and severe disease are separated by specific differences in abundance of immune-regulatory and proinflammatory LMs. This difference in LM balance corresponded with decreased LM products of ALOX12 and COX2 and an increase LMs products of ALOX5 and cytochrome p450. Given the important immune-regulatory role of LMs, these data provide mechanistic insight into an immuno-lipidomic imbalance in severe COVID-19.","Schwarz, Sharma, Roberts, Peng, Bermejo, Leighton, Casanovas-Massana, Minasyan, Farhadian, Ko, Dela Cruz, Bosio","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2001025","20201205","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7860,""
"Low assets and financial stressors associated with higher depression during COVID-19 in a nationally representative sample of US adults","COVID-19 and related containment policies have caused or heightened financial stressors for many in the USA. We assessed the relation between assets, financial stressors and probable depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 31 March 2020 and 13 April 2020, we surveyed a probability-based, nationally representative sample of US adults ages 18 and older using the COVID-19 and Life stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (n=1441). We calculated the prevalence of probable depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (cut-off Ã¢â€°Â¥10) and exposure to financial stressors by financial, physical and social assets categories (household income, household savings, home ownership, educational attainment and marital status). We estimated adjusted ORs and predicted probabilities of probable depression across assets categories and COVID-19 financial stressor exposure groups. We found that (1) 40% of US adults experienced COVID-19-related financial stressors during this time period; (2) low assets (OR: 3.0, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 2.1 to 4.2) and COVID-19 financial stressor exposure (OR: 2.8, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 2.1 to 3.9) were each associated with higher odds of probable depression; and (3) among persons with low assets and high COVID-19 financial stressors, 42.7% had probable depression; and among persons with high assets and low COVID-19 financial stressors, 11.1% had probable depression. Persons with high assets and high COVID-19 financial stressors had a similar prevalence of probable depression (33.5%) as persons with low assets and low COVID-19 financial stressors (33.5%). The more assets a person had, the lower the level of probable depression. Populations with low assets are bearing a greater burden of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ettman, Abdalla, Cohen, Sampson, Vivier, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215213","20201205","depression; inequalities; social inequalities; socio-economic; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7861,""
"Infection and mortality of healthcare workers worldwide from COVID-19: a systematic review","To estimate COVID-19 infections and deaths in healthcare workers (HCWs) from a global perspective during the early phases of the pandemic. Systematic review. Two parallel searches of academic bibliographic databases and grey literature were undertaken until 8 May 2020. Governments were also contacted for further information where possible. There were no restrictions on language, information sources used, publication status and types of sources of evidence. The AACODS checklist or the National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools were used to appraise each source of evidence. Publication characteristics, country-specific data points, COVID-19-specific data, demographics of affected HCWs and public health measures employed. A total of 152Ã¢â‚¬â€°888 infections and 1413 deaths were reported. Infections were mainly in women (71.6%, n=14Ã¢â‚¬â€°058) and nurses (38.6%, n=10Ã¢â‚¬â€°706), but deaths were mainly in men (70.8%, n=550) and doctors (51.4%, n=525). Limited data suggested that general practitioners and mental health nurses were the highest risk specialities for deaths. There were 37.2 deaths reported per 100 infections for HCWs aged over 70 years. Europe had the highest absolute numbers of reported infections (119 628) and deaths (712), but the Eastern Mediterranean region had the highest number of reported deaths per 100 infections (5.7). COVID-19 infections and deaths among HCWs follow that of the general population around the world. The reasons for gender and specialty differences require further exploration, as do the low rates reported in Africa and India. Although physicians working in certain specialities may be considered high risk due to exposure to oronasal secretions, the risk to other specialities must not be underestimated. Elderly HCWs may require assigning to less risky settings such as telemedicine or administrative positions. Our pragmatic approach provides general trends, and highlights the need for universal guidelines for testing and reporting of infections in HCWs.","Bandyopadhyay, Baticulon, Kadhum, Alser, Ojuka, Badereddin, Kamath, Parepalli, Brown, Iharchane, Gandino, Markovic-Obiago, Scott, Manirambona, Machhada, Aggarwal, Benazaize, Ibrahim, Kim, Tol, Taylor, Knighton, Bbaale, Jasim, Alghoul, Reddy, Abuelgasim, Saini, Sigler, Abuelgasim, Moran-Romero, Kumarendran, Jamie, Ali, Sudarshan, Dean, Kissyova, Kelzang, Roche, Ahsan, Mohamed, Dube, Gwini, Gwokyala, Brown, Papon, Li, Ruzats, Charuvila, Peter, Khalidy, Moyo, Alser, Solano, Robles-Perez, Tariq, Gaddah, Kolovos, Muchemwa, Saleh, Gosman, Pinedo-Villanueva, Jani, Khundkar","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003097","20201205","diseases; disorders; infections; injuries; public health; review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7862,""
"Scoping review protocol: the use of telemedicine in providing opioid agonist treatment and related psychosocial supports","The global opioid-related disease burden is significant. Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) can be effective in reducing illicit opioid use and fatal overdose, and improving multiple health and social outcomes. Despite evidence for its effectiveness, there are significant deficits in OAT globally. COVID-19 has required rapid adaptation of remote models of healthcare. Telemedicine is not used routinely in OAT, and little is known about the current levels of use and effectiveness. The objective of this review is to describe models of telemedicine and their efficacy. This scoping review uses the review methodology described by Arksey and O'Malley and adapted by Levac <i>et al</i>. The search strategy developed by the medical librarian at the Irish College of General Practitioners in conjunction with the research team will involve five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycInfo and OpenGrey) and the hand searching of reference lists. A limited initial search of two databases will be completed to refine search terms, followed by a second comprehensive search using newly refined search terms of all databases and finally hand searching references of included studies. To be included, studies must report on remote ways of providing OAT (including assessment, induction and monitoring) or related psychosocial support; be published in English after 2010. Two researchers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles considered for inclusion. Data will be extracted onto an agreed template and will undergo a descriptive analysis of the contextual or process-oriented data and simple quantitative analysis using descriptive statistics. Research ethics approval is not required for this scoping review. The results of this scoping review will inform the development of a national remote model of OAT. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant conferences.","Crowley, Homeniuk, Delargy","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040556","20201205","public health; substance misuse; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7863,""

"COVID-19: it happens to nurses too-a case study","The COVID-19 pandemic will have long-term ramifications for many patients, including those who work in the NHS and have been victims of the disease. This short case study describes the journey of an emergency department (ED) charge nurse who contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalised in the intensive care unit (ICU). Post-discharge, he experienced a multitude of physical and mental health complications, which ultimately impacted on each other. Therefore, a bio-psycho-pharmaco-social approach to care is recommended from admission through ICU, discharge and beyond.

"Home-based exercise can be beneficial for counteracting sedentary behavior and physical inactivity during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults","The novel pandemic called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as a global public health emergency, seems to be having a major impact on physical activity (PA) behaviors. Older adults are at high risk of death from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). Health authorities around the world have been implementing preventive health measures, including quarantine and self-isolation, to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak. This period is characterized by cessation of outdoor exercising. During this period of lockdown, PA has been one of the rare reasons for going out in some countries. To avoid the harmful effects of periods of exercise cessation, PA could be prescribed to older adults, which is of great importance for breaking their sedentary lifestyle and improving their immunity. The present review discusses the potential impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on sedentary behavior and physical inactivity in older adults. The importance of performing PA to reduce the harmful effects of COVID-19 pandemic is discussed, and useful recommendations on home-based exercise for the older adults to maintain their level of independence, physical and mental health as well as their wellbeing are provided.","Ghram, Briki, Mansoor, Al-Mohannadi, Lavie, Chamari","https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2020.1860394","20201204","Coronavirus; aging; exercise; health; physical activity; sedentary","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7867,""
"COVID-19 and Tinnitus","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, brings with it a plethora of health concerns. Although most people have mild symptoms, which are respiratory in nature, some experience neurological symptoms, central nervous system manifestations, peripheral nervous manifestations, and skeletal muscle manifestations. But the damaging impact of COVID-19 virus on the hearing organs in the inner ear is a new finding yet to be explored. Currently, there is little evidence published connecting novel coronavirus and tinnitus directly. But according to the American Tinnitus Association, preexisting behavioral conditions make it more likely for patients to experience tinnitus due to the stress and depression associated with social isolation and infection avoidance. Hearing loss and Tinnitus is a common pathology seen in otolaryngology and there are numerous papers in literature describing its associations with other infections. However, this is the first reported case of hearing loss and tinnitus in a COVID-19 patient, in the State of Qatar, and this case report strives to contribute to the ocean of literature highlighting the need for otorhinolaryngologists to be aware of its correlation with COVID-19 virus.","Chirakkal, Hail, Zada, Vijayakumar","https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561320974849","20201204","COVID-19; OAE; SARS-CoV-2; tinnitus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7868,""
"Rising to the challenge: Pharmacy residents on the front lines during COVID-19 pandemic","To provide pharmacy residents' perspective on how the department of pharmacy at a large academic medical center prepared and managed the surge in admissions of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to describe how residents were trained for intensive care unit (ICU) staffing, and to provide recommendations on how residency programs nationally could navigate a second wave of COVID-19 admissions or other disaster response situations. The majority of postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) pharmacy residents at the institution were trained for ICU staffing and deployed throughout the hospital to ICU units converted to dedicated COVID-19 ICUs to assist in patient care. The training process included live videoconference lectures about relevant ICU topics and on-site experiences with critical care clinical pharmacists. Based on their experience in training for and participating in ICU care of patients with COVID-19, the pharmacy residents recommend considering additional cross-training of residents, integration of additional clinical education, creation of opportunities for resident involvement in telehealth, advancement of residents' roles in emergency responses, building robust mental health services, and continued advocacy for the advancement of pharmacists' and pharmacy residents' scope of practice. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the institution to reevaluate the allocation of resources, and the department of pharmacy elected to deploy PGY1 pharmacy residents with previous ICU experience to assist in caring for an ICU patient census that had doubled. This experience will be valuable in preparing for another potential wave of COVID-19 cases and a surge in admissions of other groups of patients who deferred care due to the pandemic.","Uchida, Long-Fazio, Marshall, Fortier","https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa273","20201204","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; disaster response; pharmacy residency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7869,""
"Loneliness and depression in patients with cancer during COVID-19","Feelings of loneliness are likely to exacerbate risk of depression in people living with cancer during COVID-19. Five hundred and eighteen people with cancer with data extracted from two waves (2017-19 and April 2020) of the Understanding Society UK dataset participated. An increased risk of depression was observed for cancer of the breast, prostate, blood, but not other cancers (e.g., lung, melanoma). After controlling for prior depression and other factors, it was loneliness during COVID-19, and not previous loneliness, that was predictive. Those currently lonely had a 4.5-fold increased risk of depression. These findings demonstrate that people living with cancer are at increased risk of developing depression during COVID-19, and that feelings of isolation help explain this risk. These particular findings have implications for health promotion and intervention work and how best to support people who may feel lonely in this vulnerable group.","Gallagher, Bennett, Roper","https://doi.org/10.1080/07347332.2020.1853653","20201204","COVID-19; cancer; depression; isolation; loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7870,""

Currently, COVID-19 has become a new source of stigmatization. The aim of the present study is to analyze longitudinally the evolution of intersectional perceived discrimination and internalized stigma among the general population of Spain, at three points in time throughout the confinement. Participants completed an online survey. Results show an increase in both variables from the first to the second evaluation, and a slight decrease from the second to the third evaluation.

"Effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the anxiety and depression levels in patients who applied to the cosmetology unit","The relationship between the skin and the brain is based on their origin from the same ectodermal structure, as well as being affected by similar hormones and neurotransmitters. At this point, psychodermatology forms a common field of study based on the relationship and interaction between psychiatry and dermatology. Cosmetology is a special group within dermatology, and the psychosocial needs of this group differ. In this study, it was aimed to examine the moods such as anxiety, fear and depression experienced by the patients during their application to the cosmetology unit during the COVID-19 pandemic process and to compare them with the control group. A total of 162 cases, 80 cases from the cosmetology unit meeting the specified conditions and 82 cases as the control group, were retrospectively evaluated. In all participants, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) scores decreased significantly compared to the beginning of the pandemic (p=0.001). In the study, while depression (HAM-D) and general anxiety (HAM-A) were higher in the cosmetology group compared to the control group (respectively p=0.049, p=0.001), there was no difference in coronavirus anxiety scores (CAS) (p=0.24). It should be known that patients who underwent cosmetological procedures during the pandemic period may have anxiety and depression. In this patient group, which requires a special psychodermatological approach, pandemic effects should also be considered. In patients who apply to cosmetology units during the pandemic period, attention should be paid to the relationship between surreal cosmetological process requests and their anxiety and depression state.

"[Reflections on the Nursing Work Environment in Light of the Experience With COVID-19]","Labor issues related to the nursing profession have been gaining prominence in Taiwan as well as overseas. In 2016, the United Nations highlighted the importance of societies investing sufficient funds in their professional nurses to support and promote public health, gender equality, and economic growth. Good-quality care requires that nurses have good physical and mental health, while creating and maintaining a friendly nursing work environment rely on cooperation among the government, labor unions, and hospitals. Over the past decade, the Taiwan government has increasingly promoted relevant regulations and established a friendly platform to allow nursing staffs to identify problems and report labor rights violations. In addition, nurses have formed unions to defend and advocate for their professional rights. After the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019, the Department of Nursing and Health Care of the Ministry of Health and Welfare actively proposed policies related to creating and maintaining good nursing work environments. The Taiwan Nursing and Medical Industries Union took a supervisory role in this process, providing feedback on policies from the perspective of Taiwan's professional nurses and arguing for the reasonable and fair subsidization of epidemic prevention facilities, implementation of mask and protective equipment, nursing labor rights, and social respect for the nursing profession. Much work still needs to be done to improve the domestic working environment for nursing staffs, including improving and expanding education, normalizing and effectively utilizing nursing staff feedback and whistleblowing information, promoting information transparency, and implementing better policies.

"[Reviewing and Reflecting on Nursing During the COVID-19 Pandemic]","We remain in the midst of the global COVID-19 epidemic. As of November 11th, 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in 189 countries/regions around the world, with a total of 51,510,611 confirmed cases and more than 1,275,211 deaths, with a global fatality rate of 2.48% (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020b). Therefore, countries are facing lockdown crises and their populations face daily lives full of chaos, anxiety, and reorganization. The characteristics of this epidemic are most often described as &quot;unprecedented&quot; and replete with &quot;uncertainty&quot; (Davidson et al., 2020). In order to prevent the spread of this virus, health measures such as quarantine, wearing protective masks, and enforced lockdowns have been adopted by governments around the world, producing psychosocial (emotional distress, anxiety, suicide) and economic side-effects (Lima et al., 2020; Montemurro, 2020). Despite its close geographical proximity to China, Taiwan's number of confirmed infections has been relatively small (584 people diagnosed as of November 11th, with 7 total COVID-19-related fatalities; Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020b). Taiwan's tragic experience 17 years ago with the SARS epidemic helped prepare the government to respond rapidly to the COVID-19 threat, make thorough preparations and advanced deployments, and formulate relevant anti-epidemic border control measures, quarantine and isolation measures, mask-wearing requirements, and public education strategies. Actions such as mask wearing, washing hands frequently, and practicing proper social distancing by the public and the government maintaining a master travel history, occupation, contact history, and cluster (TOCC) database have proven effective in detecting and diagnosing cases early (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare, ROC, 2020a; Yang et al., 2020). Furthermore, providing first-line personnel with appropriate protective equipment, education, and training as well as timely and transparent information and epidemic prevention guidelines have kept nurses supplied with appropriate personal protective equipment, infection-prevention and control education, training and exercises, and sufficient professional knowledge and skills to provide care safely to patients (Chen et al., 2020; Huang &amp; Chen, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Concurrently, it has been a challenge to nursing educators regarding how to suspend classes while not stopping academic education and to plan meaningful, alternative clinical experiences during the pandemic (Morin, 2020) and how to redefine and evaluate student performance to maintain teaching quality and learning effectiveness. In addition, &quot;disaster nursing&quot; is a critical area of professional knowledge for nurses in the 21st century, and all nurses should have an appropriate level of competence in professional disaster nursing. Therefore, core concepts related to infection control, disasters, and disaster preparedness should be incorporated into the curriculum and objectives. Finally, although we in Taiwan have faced the COVID-19 challenge in an environment in which the pandemic risk has been relatively well controlled, our daily lives are no longer taken for granted. When we look back on this experience, what will we learn from these experiences and how will this experience change how we approach healthcare and pandemic threats in the future? These changes will bring us more thoughts and challenges in nursing.

"Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 on Quarantine Hotel Employees in China","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a far-reaching and unprecedented influence on economies worldwide. It has also impacted on the global population's mental health and caused negative psychosocial effects, which may lead to psychological crises. During the pandemic, the challenges for quarantine hotel employees are not only the increased workloads created by operating a quarantine hotel but also high psychological stress associated with job insecurity, risk of exposure and contagion for themselves, their friends and families. This research attempts to explore COVID-19-related depression, anxiety, and stress among quarantine hotel employees in China. The mental health of quarantine hotel employees, who have faced unprecedented changes, is paramount while they provide hospitality and care for healthcare workers and quarantine guests during mandatory quarantine periods. This is a cross-sectional study that applied convenience sampling to collect questionnaire samples from 170 quarantine hotel employees in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic, from May 20 to June 10, 2020. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to collect data. The study uses descriptive analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal that 43.5% of respondents report moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression; 68.2% have moderate to extremely severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.2% indicated moderate to extremely severe stress symptoms. Quarantine hotel employees who have a higher level of education are less likely to experience anxiety, and those with higher incomes are less likely to experience depression. In order to mitigate the increasing levels of anxiety and depression among their staff, quarantine hoteliers or managers urgently need to implement mental health assistance programs, such as providing extra training in hygiene and knowledge about COVID-19, offering online counseling and psychological support services, training in positive thinking, encouraging staff to keep in touch with their personal support networks, and constructing a resilience model.","Teng, Wu, Lin, Xu","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S286171","20201204","COVID-19; DASS-21; Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; mental health; quarantine hotel employee","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7876,""
"Impact of enhanced personal protective equipment on the physical and mental well-being of healthcare workers during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) in healthcare workers in patient-facing roles. We describe the impact on the physical and mental well-being of healthcare professionals who use enhanced PPE consistently. We conducted a single-centre, cross-sectional study among healthcare professionals who use enhanced PPE. A web-based questionnaire was disseminated to evaluate the effects on individuals' physical and mental well-being. Physical and mental impact was assessed through a visual analogue scale. Prospective analysis of the views of 72 respondents is reported. 63.9% were women and 36.1% were men. Physical impact included exhaustion, headache, skin changes, breathlessness and a negative impact on vision. Communication difficulties, somnolence, negative impact on overall performance and difficulties in using surgical instrumentation were reported. Our study demonstrates the undeniable negative impact on the front-line healthcare workers using enhanced PPE and lays the ground for larger multicentric assessments given for it to potentially be the norm for the foreseeable future.","Swaminathan, Mukundadura, Prasad","https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139150","20201204","adult otolaryngology; health policy; infection control; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7877,""
"Mental health status of Chinese residents during the COVID-19 epidemic","To investigate the mental health status of Chinese residents during the epidemic of COVID-19, as well as to identify the positive and negative factors and regulatory effect of negative cognitive processing bias on mental health. A total of 60,199 residents in China were surveyed via an internet-based survey containing a general questionnaire, such as the self-rating depression scale, the state anxiety inventory, and the negative cognitive processing bias questionnaire. An ordered multiple logistic regression analysis model was used to analyze the collected data. The survey revealed mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms in 62.65, 11.33, and 6.14% participants, respectively, and mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptoms in 33.21, 41.27, and 22.99% participants, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that factors, such as female gender, being older than 55Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, high school education level, medical staff, marital conflicts, negative attention bias, rumination, and death growth rate, positively affected depression and anxiety symptoms. The good family functionality, democratic working atmosphere, and a myriad of social activities negatively affected the level of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Chinese residents exhibited a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the epidemic. Thus, psychological interventions should focus on the vulnerable groups, and cognitive training should focus on reducing the negative cognitive processing bias. This might be an effective way to alleviate the mental stress of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jiang, Liu, Zhang, Feng","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02966-6","20201204","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Negative cognitive processing bias","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7878,""

"Health Care Providers' Perceptions of Quality, Acceptance, and Satisfaction With Telebehavioral Health Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Survey-Based Study","Due to rapidly increasing rates of COVID-19 across the country, system-wide changes were needed to protect the health and safety of health care providers and consumers alike. Technology-based care has received buy-in from all participants, and the need for technological assistance has been prioritized. The objective of this study was to determine the initial perceptions and experiences of interprofessional behavioral health providers about shifting from traditional face-to-face care to virtual technologies (telephonic and televideo) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey-based study was performed at a large, integrated medical health care system in West-Central Florida that rapidly implemented primary care provision via telephone and televideo as of March 18, 2020. A 23-item anonymous survey based on a 7-point Likert scale was developed to determine health care providers' perceptions about telephonic and televideo care. The survey took 10 minutes to complete and was administered to 280 professionals between April 27 and May 11, 2020. In all, 170 respondents completed the survey in entirety, among which 78.8% (134/170) of the respondents were female and primarily aged 36-55 years (89/170, 52.4%). A majority of the respondents were outpatient-based providers (159/170, 93.5%), including psychiatrists, therapists, counselors, and advanced practice nurses. Most of them (144/170, 84.7%) had used televideo for less than 1 year; they felt comfortable and satisfied with either telephonic or televideo mode and that they were able to meet the patients' needs. Our survey findings suggest that health care providers valued televideo visits equally or preferred them more than telephonic visits in the domains of quality of care, technology performance, satisfaction of technology, and user acceptance.","Wright, Dewan, Hilty, Dewan","https://doi.org/10.2196/23245","20201204","COVID-19; acceptability; behavior; health care provider; mental health; perception; quality; satisfaction; telehealth; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7880,""

"Effects of Covid-19 lockdown on parental functioning in vulnerable families","The Covid-19 pandemic has caused major changes to family life followed by a call for knowledge about how these changes have affected parental functioning, particularly in vulnerable families (Prime, Wade & Brooks, 2020). This study uses a natural experiment design to investigate the effect of the Covid-19 lockdown on parental mental health, parenting stress and three dimensions of destructive interparental conflict in a heterogeneous sample characterized by pre-existing relationship problems. Results from mixed model regression analyses showed that despite significantly higher levels of parenting stress in the lockdown group (n = 744 families) compared with the control group (n = 427 families), lockdown did not adversely affect parental mental health or levels of destructive conflicts behaviors. In fact, levels of verbal aggression and child involvement in conflict decreased during lockdown among parents living apart. Pre-existing destructive conflict levels, financial problems and age of youngest child did not moderate any of the associations. Thus, findings indicated that pre-existing family vulnerability did not predispose for reduced parental functioning during lockdown, beyond increased parenting stress. Resilient processes and an increased sense of purpose may be potential mechanisms. Caution should be taken when generalizing the findings due to the welfare context of the sample and as long-term lockdown effects were not investigated. Importantly, children in vulnerable families may have been negatively impacted by increased family time, despite relatively stable parental functioning during lockdown.","Maren Sand Helland et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-EFC-79A","20201207","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Experimental Design and Sample Surveys; vulnerable families; covid-19; natural experiment design; parental functioning","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7886,""
"Stress as a meaningful variable in models of covid-19 spreading","Covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus â€“ 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified in Wuhan China in December 2019.

Besides visible socio-economic and documented health effects, the impact of Covid-19 on peopleâ€™s mental health including stress-related effects on disease spreading remains yet to be addressed. Here, we argue about the relevance of incorporating stress factors into models of covid-19 spreading and the level of detail in which such models should take stress into consideration.","Carlos Trenado et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FB-67B-BC4","20201206","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; corona virus; covid-19; lockdown measures; macroscale; microscale; stressor; stress; multiscale; stress models","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-07","",7887,""
