"The first COVID-19 infanticide-suicide case: Financial crisis and fear of COVID-19 infection are the causative factors","Background The global suicide occurrences have been aggravated because of COVID-19 crisis-related issues such as fear of infection, the financial crisis, being infected with COVID-19, loneliness, social boycott, etc  Although two studies reported about the seven dyadic suicidality cases (i e , suicide pacts), child homicide-suicide has not been studied  Case presentation On 14 May, two dead bodies (i e , a 30-years old Indian woman and her six-month-old baby) were found in a Riyadh apartment complex  The perpetrator (a person who kills the others and later commits suicide) â€“ a trained nurse, was in search of a job  The woman's husband was recently retrenched from his technician job at a company in Madinah Airport  Her husband was admitted to a hospital with symptoms related to the COVID-19 infection four days before the suicide incidence  The 70-year-old mother-in-law alerted the neighbors after finding that the apartment is locked from inside and there was no response on knocking the doors  After this, the neighbors gathered and called the police  Police found two dead-bodies after opening the flat and suspected that the child was killed before the woman committed suicide  Conclusions Based on the present findings, further child filicide-suicide possibilities in families with economically distressed and/or positive COVID-19 status are expected  Hence, proper financial supports, providing authentic information (COVID-19), and mental health promotional strategies are suggested for decreasing incidences of COVID-19 related infanticide-suicide cases","Mamun, Mohammed A.; Bhuiyan, A.

"Higher executive control network coherence buffers against puberty-related increases in internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Early pubertal maturation has been posited to be a biopsychosocial risk factor for the onset of internalizing psychopathology in adolescence;further, early-maturing youth exhibit heightened reactivity to stressful events  School closures and enforced social distancing, as well as health and financial uncertainties, during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to adversely affect mental health in youth, particularly adolescents who are already at risk for experiencing emotional difficulties  The executive control network (ECN) supports cognitive processes required to successfully navigate novel challenges and regulate emotions in stressful contexts  Methods: We examined whether functional coherence of the ECN, measured using resting-state fMRI five years before the pandemic (at T1), is a neurobiological marker of resilience to increases in the severity of internalizing symptoms during COVID-19 in adolescents who were in more advanced stages of puberty at T1 relative to their same-age peers (N=85;49 F)  Results On average, participants reported an increase in symptoms from the three months prior to pandemic to the two most recent weeks during the pandemic  We found that early-maturing youth exhibited greater increases in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic if their ECN coherence was low;in contrast, relative pubertal stage was not associated with changes in internalizing symptoms in adolescents with higher ECN coherence at T1  Conclusions These findings highlight the role of the functional architecture of the brain that supports executive functioning in protecting against risk factors that may exacerbate symptoms of internalizing psychopathology during periods of stress and uncertainty","Chahal, Rajpreet; Kirshenbaum, Jaclyn S.; Miller, Jonas G.; Ho, Tiffany C.; Gotlib, Ian H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.08.010","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging;2020.; Publication details: Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-01","",4226,""

To assess the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation in HCPs. Cross-sectional study in 21 ICUs in France between April 20 and May 21, 2020. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire were used. Factors independently associated with reported symptoms of mental health disorders were identified. Response rate was 67%, with 1058 respondents (median age 33 y, 71% women, 68% nursing staff). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation was 50.4%, 30.4%, and 32%, respectively, with the highest rates in nurses. By multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with lower prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation (Odds Ratio of 0.58(0.42-0.79), 0.57(0.39-0.82) and 0.49(0.34-0.72), respectively. HCPs working in non-university-affiliated hospitals and nursing assistants were at high risk of symptoms of anxiety and peritraumatic dissociation. Importantly, we identified six modifiable determinants of symptoms of mental health disorders: fear of being infected, inability to rest, inability to care for family, struggling with difficult emotions, regret about the restrictions in visitation policies, and witnessing hasty end-of-life decisions. HCPs experience high levels of psychological burden during the COVID-19 epidemic. Hospitals, ICU directors, and ICU staff must devise strategies to overcome the modifiable determinants of adverse mental illness symptoms.

"Changes in Interventional Pain Physician Decision-Making, Practice Patterns, and Mental Health During the Early Phase of the SARS-CoV-2 Global Pandemic","The novel coronavirus outbreak (SARS-CoV-2) began in late 2019 and dramatically impacted health care systems. This study aimed to describe the impact of the early phase of the pandemic on physician decision-making, practice patterns, and mental health. An anonymous survey was distributed to physician members of the Spine Intervention Society (SIS) on March 24 and April 7, 2020. Respondents provided information regarding changes in clinical volume, treatment, and mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-4]) before April 10, 2020. Of the 1,430 individuals who opened the survey, 260 completed it (18.2%). Overall clinical and procedural volume decreased to 69.6% and 13.0% of prepandemic volume, respectively. Mean in-person clinic visits were reduced to 17.7% of total prepandemic clinic volume. Ongoing clinical visits were predominantly completed via telemedicine (video) or telephone (74.5%), rather than in-person (25.5%). Telemedicine and telephone visits represented 24.6% and 27.3% of prepandemic clinical volume, respectively. Respondents decreased in-person visits of select groups of high-risk patients by 85.8-94.6%. Significantly more providers reported increasing rather than decreasing prescriptions of the following medications: opioids (28.8% vs 6.2% of providers, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), muscle relaxants (22.3% vs 5.4%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), neuropathic pain medications (29.6% vs 3.8%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and acetaminophen (26.2% vs 4.2%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"Implication of coronavirus pandemic on obsessive-compulsive-disorder symptoms","This review assesses various sources regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms and the coronavirus pandemic via a study of literature related to OCD conditions in the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and India. Coronavirus's morbidity and its status as a global pandemic transmittable from one person to another has subsequently intensified the personal perception of distress. The projected shortage of vital medical equipment to fight coronavirus due to daily increases in COVID-19 cases creates social unrest. The world confronts perpetual news about high numbers of coronavirus cases, more people in quarantine, and more deaths; those not infected feel increasing fear about its proximity. Social media, print media, and electronic sources offer much advice on how to prevent coronavirus infection. Pandemics extend beyond pathophysiology and medical phenomena to associations with intense psychosocial impact. Studies have established that people with existing mental disorders are prone to relapses, the fear of faulty COVID-19 prevention measures, distress, and suicidal thoughts during pandemics. Precautionary measures aim to slow the spread of coronavirus, but these radical repetitive measures create great anxiety in the mental health of individuals suffering from OCD. Despite the nature of their conditions, these people must adhere to routine processes, such as washing hands, wearing masks and gloves, and sanitizing hands. Given the asymptomatic nature of people suffering from OCD, the routine measures for addressing COVID-19 have a hectic and adverse effect on their mental health and their state of relaxation. Through a systematic literature review, this paper provides insight into the coronavirus pandemic's implications for OCD symptoms.","Sulaimani, Bagadood","https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2020-0054","20200831","COVID-19; coronavirus; distress; mental health; obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-01","",4245,""

A cross-sectional study in Germany (n = 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°037) were conducted. Demographics, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed. Additionally, all instruments used were adapted to measure the participants' mental health and health status before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information about COVID-19 were examined. Overall, the participants showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms, and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Impairment in mental health was predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Pre-existing mental illness predicted an increase in depression symptoms and a deterioration in health status. Trust in governmental actions and the subjective level of information predicted less increase in psychological burden.

"Lessons Learned in Implementing VA Video Connect for Evidence-Based Psychotherapies for Anxiety and Depression in the Veterans Healthcare Administration","A top priority for the Veteran's Healthcare Administration is improving access to high-quality mental healthcare. Mobile and telemental healthcare are a vital component of increasing access for veterans. The Veteran's Healthcare Administration is making efforts to further broaden how veterans receive their care through VA Video Connect, which allows veterans to connect with their provider from their residence or workplace. In this mixed-methods study, successes and challenges associated with the rapid implementation of VA Video Connect telemental health appointments are examined through (1) administrative data and (2) qualitative interviews at one medical center. Within 1Ã‚Â year of the telehealth initiative, the number of providers experienced with telemental health increased from 15% to 85%, and telehealth appointments increased from 5376 to 14,210. Provider reported barriers included administrative challenges and concerns regarding care. Having an implementation model of telehealth champions and a team of experienced mental health providers allowed for rapid adoption of telehealth. Utilizing a similar model in other settings will further enable more veterans with depression and anxiety to have access to evidence-based psychotherapy, regardless of location or national crisis. With the dramatic increase in both training for providers as well as veteran use of telemental healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic response, future research should aim to better understand which teams were able to switch to telehealth easily versus those which struggled, along with examining system-wide and provider-level factors that facilitated continued use of telehealth after social distancing requirements related to COVID-19 were relaxed.","Myers, Coulon, Knies, Dickens, Keller, Birks, Grubaugh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41347-020-00161-8","20200831","Access to care; Mental health; Technology; Telehealth; Veteran","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-01","",4251,""
"A study on variation of atmospheric pollutants over Bhubaneswar during imposition of nationwide lockdown in India for the COVID-19 pandemic","The nationwide lockdown in India to flatten the pandemic COVID-19 curve has resulted in the reduction of anthropogenic emission sources to a great extent. This study reports change in air quality and its impact on the environment during the unique lockdown scenario at Bhubaneswar, a coastal smart city in east India. The urban air shows a remarkable reduction in the mean pollutant levels influenced by traffic emission viz. NO<sub>x</sub> (~ 67 %) and BC (~ 47 %) during lockdown over the pre-lockdown. Comparatively, a lower reduction of CO (~ 14 %) is attributed to the dominance of natural atmospheric chemical regulation and biogenic sources in addition to anthropogenic contributions. In addition to the lockdown, frequent rain events due to depression in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) also had a significant role in the reduction of the primary pollutants over the study site. An enhancement of secondary pollutant viz. O<sub>3</sub> (~ 3%) with a distinct diurnal pattern was observed during the first phase of lockdown over the pre-lockdown period. An anti-correlation between O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> during pre-lockdown points to a higher O<sub>3</sub> production potential with decreasing NO<sub>x</sub>. While a reduction in the titration of O<sub>3</sub> due to suppression of fresh NO emissions led to accumulation of O<sub>3</sub> in the first phase of lockdown, inhibited photochemistry due to cloudy skies as well as reduction in precursors led to lower O<sub>3</sub> values during the later phases of lockdown.","Panda, Mallik, Nath, Das, Ramasamy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11869-020-00916-5","20200831","Air quality; BC; CO; Lockdown; NOx; O3","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-01","",4252,""

La prÃƒÂ©sente ÃƒÂ©tude sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢est donnÃƒÂ©e pour ambition dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©valuer la prÃƒÂ©valence des symptÃƒÂ´mes de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© et de la dÃƒÂ©pression chez les professionnels de santÃƒÂ© dans les trois RÃƒÂ©gions les plus concernÃƒÂ©es au Cameroun.<i>MatÃƒÂ©riels et methods:</i> Le choix des trois RÃƒÂ©gions du Cameroun se justifie non seulement par le fait quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢elles totalisent 95,8Ã¢â‚¬â€°% des cas de coronavirus au pays depuis le dÃƒÂ©but de la pandÃƒÂ©mie, mais aussi parce quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢elles disposent de plus de la moitiÃƒÂ© des personnels de santÃƒÂ© (56Ã¢â‚¬â€°%). Il sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢agit dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une ÃƒÂ©tude transversale, descriptive et analytique. Les participants sont des professionnels de la santÃƒÂ© en service dans les RÃƒÂ©gions du Centre, Littoral et de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ouest du Cameroun. La mÃƒÂ©thode dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©chantillonnage non probabiliste de convenance couplÃƒÂ©e Ãƒ celle de boule de neige via un web questionnaire a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© adoptÃƒÂ©e. La collecte des donnÃƒÂ©es a durÃƒÂ© du 5 au 19Ã¢â‚¬â€°avril 2020, intervalle de temps aprÃƒÂ¨s lequel on nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢avait plus eu de rÃƒÂ©pondants. Ãƒâ‚¬ la fin de cette pÃƒÂ©riode, la taille de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©chantillon non exhaustive ÃƒÂ©tait de 292 professionnels. Le diagnostic de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©tat anxio-dÃƒÂ©pressive ÃƒÂ©tait posÃƒÂ© via lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©chelle de HAD (<i>Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale</i>). Dans le HAD, chaque rÃƒÂ©ponse cotÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ©value de maniÃƒÂ¨re semi-quantitative l'intensitÃƒÂ© du symptÃƒÂ´me au cours de la semaine ÃƒÂ©coulÃƒÂ©e. Un score total est obtenu ainsi que des scores aux deux sous-ÃƒÂ©chelles : le score maximal est de 42 pour lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©chelle globale et de 21 pour chacune des sous-ÃƒÂ©chelles. Le coefficient alpha de Cronbach est de 0,70 pour la dÃƒÂ©pression et de 0,74 pour l'anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©. Certains auteurs aprÃƒÂ¨s plusieurs travaux ont proposÃƒÂ© quÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une note infÃƒÂ©rieure ou ÃƒÂ©gale Ãƒ 7 indique une absence dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ou de dÃƒÂ©pression ; celle comprise entre 8 et 10 suggÃƒÂ¨re une anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ou une dÃƒÂ©pression faible Ãƒ bÃƒÂ©nigne ; entre 11 et 14, pour une anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ou une dÃƒÂ©pression modÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©eÃ¢â‚¬â€°; enfin, une note comprise entre 15 et 21 est rÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©latrice dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© sÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ¨re. Le logiciel Excel 2013 et Epi Info version 7.2.2.6 ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© utilisÃƒÂ©s pour les traitements statistiques. Les liens entre les variables ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© considÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©es significatifs pour une valeur de <i>P</i> &lt; 0,05.<i>RÃƒÂ©sultats:</i> Les rÃƒÂ©sultats montrent que le personnel fÃƒÂ©minin a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© relativement plus reprÃƒÂ©sentatif (54,50%) avec un sex-ratio (F/M) de 1,19. La classe mÃƒÂ©diane [31-35 ans] prÃƒÂ©sente la plus grande frÃƒÂ©quence (35,30%) en termes de tranche dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ¢ge. La catÃƒÂ©gorie InfirmiÃƒÂ¨res et MÃƒÂ©decins ÃƒÂ©tait en tÃƒÂªte des rÃƒÂ©pondants avec les frÃƒÂ©quences respectives de 57,50 % et 25,30Ã¢â‚¬â€°%. LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©tude montre que les prÃƒÂ©valences des symptÃƒÂ´mes de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© et de la dÃƒÂ©pression chez le personnel de la santÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©taient respectivement de 42,20Ã¢â‚¬â€°% et 43,50Ã¢â‚¬â€°%. On note aussi dans la prÃƒÂ©sente ÃƒÂ©tude des taux de 27,10Ã¢â‚¬â€°% pour lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© modÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©e et de 15,10Ã¢â‚¬â€°% pour lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© sÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ¨re dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une part et dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢autre part de 33,90Ã¢â‚¬â€°% pour la dÃƒÂ©pression modÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©e et 9,60Ã¢â‚¬â€°% pour la dÃƒÂ©pression sÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ¨re. On a aussi observÃƒÂ© une forte disparitÃƒÂ© de cette prÃƒÂ©valence au sein des diffÃƒÂ©rentes catÃƒÂ©gories professionnelles spÃƒÂ©cifiques. En ce sens, les taux dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© de 57,90Ã¢â‚¬â€°% et de dÃƒÂ©pression de 52,60Ã¢â‚¬â€°% ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© notÃƒÂ©s dans la catÃƒÂ©gorie dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aide-Soignant, les inscrivant au premier rang de la dÃƒÂ©tresse psychologique. Dans une perspective gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale, la symptomatologie anxieuse des soignants ÃƒÂ©tait entre autres associÃƒÂ©e Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ¢ge des participants (0,006) Ãƒ la peur de se contaminer (<i>P</i>= 0,019) et de mourir (<i>P</i>=0,000). En ce qui concerne la symptomatologie dÃƒÂ©pressive, la seule relation statistiquement significative ÃƒÂ©tait celle lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢associant Ãƒ la peur de mourir (P=0,000).<i>Conclusions:</i> LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢amÃƒÂ©lioration des conditions de travail et notamment la fourniture dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©quipement de protection, la mise en place des cellules spÃƒÂ©ciales dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©coute pour le personnel de santÃƒÂ© pourraient ÃƒÂªtre proposÃƒÂ©s.","Keubo, Mboua, Tadongfack, Tchoffo, Tatang, Zeuna, Noupoue, Tsoplifack, Folefack","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.012","20200831","Anxiety; Cameroon; Depression; Health professional; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-01","",4254,""
"What COVID-19 can mean for people with hemophilia beyond the infection risk","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents an unprecedented global health crisis. To combat its effects, many governments have opted for strategies of social isolation that involve a radical change in people's behavior. For patients with hemophilia, the negative consequences of these measures can be greater, given they modify aspects of health care and lifestyles needed to counteract the adverse effects of hemophilia. The long-term consequences of the pandemic on patients with hemophilia are not well known. The aim of this special report is to show what COVID-19 could mean for this population, beyond the risk of infection. Considerations of the clinical, care, therapeutic, physical, nutritional, mental health, pain, and disability aspects that might be affected are included. Strategies are also suggested to minimize the effects that these issues can have on patients' lives. Patients, health professionals, and society as a whole must work together to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on people with hemophilia.","De la Corte-Rodriguez, Alvarez-Roman, Rodriguez-Merchan, Jimenez-Yuste","https://doi.org/10.1080/17474086.2020.1818066","20200831","COVID-19; Clinical care; Hemophilia; Lifestyle; Mental health; Nutrition; Pain and disability; Physical condition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-01","",4255,""

"â€œI hate thisâ€: A qualitative analysis of adolescentsâ€™ self-reported challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges for adolescents due to disruptions in school and social life. We compiled high schoolersâ€™ open-ended responses to the following question: â€œWhat are your 3 biggest challenges right now?â€ (N=717). Using open and axial coding, we identified N=1902 thematic units (M=2.64, SD=.701) and 14 thematic categories, including mental health, physical health, family, friends, social connection and community, academics, missing important events, socioeconomic, routine, COVID rules and adjustment (e.g., social distancing), contraction/exposure to COVID, technology (e.g., screen time), and future plans. Adolescents most commonly reported challenges related to academics (23.7%), but also cited high numbers of challenges in mental (14.8%) and physical health (13.2%), and friend (11.4%) domains. These findings suggest that efforts should focus on helping adolescents cultivate academic skills needed during school closures, providing mental and physical health resources, and helping adolescents navigate their peer relationships in the short and long-term given ongoing remote education and social distancing due to the pandemic.","Samantha Scott et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-ACD-28C","20200901","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; social distancing; public health; school closures; adolescents; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-01","",4257,""
"COVID-19: A Boon or a Bane for Creativity?","In many countries, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a period of lockdown that impacted individualâ€™s lifestyles, in both professional and personal spheres. New problems and challenges arose, as well as opportunities. Numerous studies have examined the negative effects of lockdown measures, but few have attempted to shine light on the potential positive effects that may come out of these measures. We focused on one particular positive outcome that might have emerged from lockdown: creativity. To this end, this paper compared professional creativity (Pro-C) and everyday creativity (little-c) before and during lockdown, using a questionnaire-based study conducted on a French sample (N = 1266). We expected participants to be more creative during than prior to lockdown, in both professional and everyday spheres. Regarding professional creativity, we did not see any significant differences between the two comparison points, before and during lockdown. Regarding everyday creativity, we observed a significant increase during lockdown. Furthermore, our results suggest that participants with a lower baseline creativity (before lockdown) benefited more from the situation than those with a higher initial baseline creativity. Our results provide new insights on the impact of lockdown and its positive outcomes. These measures may have inarguably negative consequences on the physical and mental health of many, but their positive impact exists as well.","Maxence Mercier et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-44D-278","20200901","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Creativity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Innovation and Technology; covid-19; creativity development; creativity; pro-c; little-c; positive outcome; lockdown","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-01","",4258,""
"The role of personality in shaping pandemic response: Systemic sociopolitical factors drive country differences","The current study utilizes the current COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the importance of accounting for the influence of external political and economic factors in personality public-health research. We investigated the extent to which systemic factors modify the relationship between personality and pandemic response. Results shed doubt on the cross-cultural generalizability of common big-five factor models. Individual differences only predicted government compliance in autocratic countries and in countries with income inequality. Personality was only predictive of mental health outcomes under conditions of state fragility and autocracy. Finally, there was little evidence that the big five traits were associated with preventive behaviors. Our ability to use individual differences to understand policy-relevant outcomes changes based on environmental factors and must be assessed on a trait-by-trait basis, thus supporting the inclusion of systemic political and economic factors in individual differences models.","Meghan Siritzky et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607A-8FA-A5B","20200831","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; democracy; gini; personality; autocracy; pandemic; polity; covid-19; state fragility; health behavior; individual differences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-01","",4259,""
"Digital screen time during COVID-19 pandemic: A public health concern","The use of digital screens, including television, computers, mobile phones, and smart devices, can be associated with a wide range of health outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, different population groups may have been adapted to varying levels of screen time, which may have profound implications on their health and wellbeing. The available evidence suggests that screen time is associated with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, myopia, depression, sleep disorders, and many other noncommunicable diseases. This elevated burden of diseases is prevalent among individuals who have sedentary lifestyles and other unhealthy behaviors that are likely to increase during quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. As several empirical studies have reported a rising trend of screen time during this pandemic, it is critical to assess the adverse health outcomes that may appear as its long-term consequences globally. Researchers and practitioners need to revisit the available guidelines and incorporate evidence-based interventions for preventing unhealthy screen time among the affected individuals. Such interventions may address not only unhealthy screen use behavior but also promote active lifestyles that may improve health across populations during and after this pandemic.","Abida Sultana et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46184-928-6EC","20200901","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Child Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; covid-19; screen use; screen time; health promotion; coronavirus","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-01","",4260,""
