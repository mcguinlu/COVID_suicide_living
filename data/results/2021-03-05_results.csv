"Analyzing COVID-2019 Impact on Mental Health Through Social Media Forum","This study aims to identify the potential association of mental health and social media forum during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic  COVID-19 brings a lot of challenges to government globally  Among the different strategies the most extensively adopted ones were lockdown, social distancing, and isolation among others  Most people with no mental illness history have been found with high risk of distress and psychological discomfort due to anxiety of being infected with the virus  Panic among people due to COVID-19 spread faster than the disease itself  The misinformation and excessive usage of social media in this pandemic era have adversely affected mental health across the world  Due to limited historical data, psychiatrists are finding it difficult to cure the mental illness of people resulting from the pandemic repercussion, fueled by social media forum  In this study the methodology used for data extraction is by considering the implications of social network platforms (such as Reddit) and levering the capabilities of a semi-supervised co-training technique-based use of NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers  The experimental results shows the efficacy of the proposed methodology to identify the mental illness level (such as anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, PTSD, schizophrenia, and OCD) of those who are in anxious of being infected with this virus  We observed 1 to 5% improvement in the classification decision through the proposed method as compared to state-of-the-art classifiers","Huma, Muhammad Khalid, Sohail, Akhtar, Nadeem, Dost, Muhammad, Afzal, Humaira, Muhammad Rafiq, Mufti, Hussain, Shahid, Ahmed, Mansoor","https://doi.org/10.32604/cmc.2021.014398","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Computers, Materials, & Continua;67(3):3737-3748, 2021.; Publication details: Computers, Materials, & Continua;67(3):3737-3748, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11537,""

"Longitudinal changes of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: The role of pre-existing anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders","Especially individuals with mental disorders might experience an escalation of psychopathological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the role of anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders for levels and longitudinal changes of COVID-19-related fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. In a longitudinal observational design with four assessment waves from March, 27th until June, 15th 2020, a total of 6,551 adults from Germany was assessed. 4,175 individuals participated in one, 1,070 in two, 803 in three, and 503 in all four waves of data collection. Multilevel analyses revealed that across all assessment waves, COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were significantly higher in individuals with vs. without anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders. All symptoms decreased on average over time, and this decrease was significantly stronger in individuals with vs. without anxiety disorders, and particularly driven by individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. Our findings suggest that individuals with mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders - and in particular those with a generalized anxiety disorder - seem to be vulnerable to experience psychological strain in the context of the pandemic, might likely overestimate potential threat, and should be targeted by preventive and therapeutic interventions.","Bendau, Kunas, Wyka, Petzold, Plag, Asselmann, StrÃƒÂ¶hle","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102377","20210304","Corona; Distress; Mental health; Mental strain; SARS-CoV-2; Vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11544,""

However, studies focused on Western samples and multivariate analyses of relations between potential risk factors and mental health in this population are lacking. To assess the mental health of Chinese adults bereaved due to COVID-19. To elucidate the associations of demographic and loss-related characteristics with mental health after COVID-19 bereavement. Four hundred twenty-two Chinese adults (56% male; Mean age: 32.73 years) recently bereaved due to COVID-19 completed an online survey. Demographic and loss-related characteristics and prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were assessed. Clinically relevant prolonged grief (49%, n=207), posttraumatic stress (22%, n=92), depressive (70%; n=294), and anxiety symptoms (65%; n=272) were reported by a substantial group of participants.

"Gender differences in unpaid care work and psychological distress in the UK Covid-19 lockdown","To describe how men and women divided childcare and housework demands during the height of the first Covid-19 lockdown in the UK, and whether these divisions were associated with worsening mental health during the pandemic. School closures and homeworking during the Covid-19 crisis have resulted in an immediate increase in unpaid care work, which draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. Data come from the wave 9 (2017-19) of Understanding Society and the following April (n = 15,426) and May (n = 14,150) waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at both before and during the lockdown, and unpaid care work was measured during the lockdown. Linear regression models were used. Women spent much more time on unpaid care work than men during lockdown, and it was more likely to be the mother than the father who reduced working hours or changed employment schedules due to increased time on childcare. Women who spent long hours on housework and childcare were more likely to report increased levels of psychological distress. Working parents who adapted their work patterns increased more psychological distress than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother. Fathers increased more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours. There are continued gender inequalities in divisions of unpaid care work. Juggling home working with homeschooling and childcare as well as extra housework is likely to lead to poor mental health for people with families, particularly for lone mothers.","Xue, McMunn","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247959","20210304","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11547,""
"'It's like being in a war with an invisible enemy': A document analysis of bereavement due to COVID-19 in UK newspapers","The COVID-19 pandemic has been followed intensely by the global news media, with deaths and bereavement a major focus. The media reflect and reinforce cultural conventions and sense-making, offering a lens which shapes personal experiences and attitudes. How COVID-19 bereavement is reported therefore has important societal implications. We aimed to explore the reportage and portrayal of COVID-19 related bereavement in the top seven most-read British online newspapers during two week-long periods in March and April 2020. We conducted a qualitative document analysis of all articles that described grief or bereavement after a death from COVID-19. Analysis of 55 articles was informed by critical discourse analysis and Terror Management Theory, which describes a psychological conflict arising between the realisation that death is inevitable and largely unpredictable and the human need for self-preservation. We identified three main narratives: (1) fear of an uncontrollable, unknown new virus and its uncertain consequences-associated with sensationalist language and a sense of helplessness and confusion; (2) managing uncertainty and fear via prediction of the future and calls for behaviour change, associated with use of war metaphors; and (3) mourning and loss narratives that paid respect to the deceased and gave voice to grief, associated with euphemistic or glorifying language ('passed away', 'heroes'). Accounts of death and grief were largely homogenous, with bereavement due to COVID-19 presented as a series of tragedies, and there was limited practical advice about what to do if a loved one became seriously ill or died. Reporting reflected the tension between focusing on existential threat and the need to retreat from or attempt to control that threat. While the impact of this reporting on the public is unknown, a more nuanced approach is recommended to better support those bereaved by COVID-19.","Sowden, Borgstrom, Selman","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247904","20210304","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11548,""
"Temporal Dynamics of Emotions during the COVID-19 Pandemic at the Center of Outbreak: A Sentimental Analysis of Weibo Tweets from Wuhan","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic increased the general public's anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychological stress in various degrees worldwide. Better tailored mental health services and interventions cannot be achieved until we understand the patterns of mental health issues after disasters, especially in the rapid transmission of the COVID-19. Understanding the public's emotions and needs and their distribution attributes are critical for making appropriate public policies and eventually respond to the disasters effectively, efficiently, and equitably. This study aims to detect the temporal patterns of emotional fluctuation, the significant events that affected the emotional changes and variations, and the hourly variations of the emotions within a day. Based on a longitudinal dataset of 816,556 posts tweeted by 27,912 Weibo users in Wuhan from December 31, 2019, to April 31, 2020, we processed general sentiment inclination rating and the type of sentiments of Weibo tweets by Pandas and SnowNLP Python libraries. We also grouped the hours into five time groups to measure the netizens' sentimental changes during different periods in a day. Overall, negative emotions like surprise, fear, and anger are the salient emotions on the social media platform. Milestone events, such as the confirmation of human-to-human transmission, are the primary events that ignited the emotions. Emotions varied within a day. Although all emotions are more prevalent in the afternoon and night, fear and anger are more dominant in the morning and afternoon, while depression is more salient during the night. Milestone events during the pandemic are the primary events that ignited the citizens' emotions. In addition, the emotions varied within a day. Better-tailored mental health services and interventions could be conducted accordingly.","Yu, Eisenman, Han","https://doi.org/10.2196/27078","20210304","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11549,""
"Different emotional profile of health care staff and general population during the COVID-19 outbreak","The aims of this study were to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related emotions, to identify vulnerable groups within health care workers (HCW) and to study the relationship between the emotional state and some environmental features. We conducted a cross-sectional study on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. A list of emotional states was compared in HCW and non-HCW and within HCW roles. The relationship between COVID-19 related symptoms, information, and protective measures and the emotional state was analyzed. Fear (<i>p</i> &lt; .001, Ãâ€ <sub>c</sub> = .11), irritability (<i>p</i> = .001, Ãâ€ <sub>c</sub> = .08), frustration (<i>p</i> &lt; .001, Ãâ€ <sub>c</sub> = .10), anger (<i>p</i> = .013, Ãâ€ <sub>c</sub> = .06), and helplessness (<i>p</i> &lt; .001, Ãâ€ <sub>c</sub> = .13) appear significantly more frequently in HCW compared to non-HCW. Within HCW, a higher percentage of physicians, especially the less experienced, significantly perceived uncertainty and frustration (<i>p</i> = .001, Ãâ€ <sub>c</sub> = .13 and <i>p</i> = .025, Ãâ€ <sub>c</sub> = .10, respectively), while a higher percentage of nurses significantly experienced sadness (<i>p</i> = .024, Ãâ€ c = .10). Having a confirmatory diagnosis of the disease was related to hypochondria sensation (<i>p</i> = .026, Ãâ€ <sub>c</sub> = .10).

The knowledge of the most prevalent different emotional patterns in HCW, as well as in the general population, will allow the detection of subjects at risk for the development of mental disorders and the implementation of therapeutic approaches in future similar situations of pandemic or outbreak of the current one.

This study aims to measure prevalent depressive symptoms and its associates among older adults amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was carried out among 1032 older Bangladeshi adults, aged 60Ã‚Â years and above, through telephone interviews in October 2020. We used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data on participants' socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, and COVID-19-related information. Meanwhile, depressive symptoms were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). The binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with depressive symptoms. Two-in-five participants showed depressive symptoms on the GDS-15 scale. Poor socioeconomic characteristic such as low family income, dependency on the family for living, recipient of financial support during the pandemic was associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms.

"Feasibility and Preliminary Effectiveness of a Peer-Developed and Virtually Delivered Community Mental Health Training Program (Emotional CPR): Pre-Post Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global mental health crisis, highlighting the need for a focus on community-wide mental health. Emotional CPR (eCPR) is a program and practice developed by persons with a lived experience of recovery from trauma or mental health challenges to train community members from diverse backgrounds to support others through mental health crises. eCPR trainers have found that eCPR may promote feelings of belonging by increasing supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health problems. Thus, clinical outcomes related to positive and negative affect would improve along with feelings of loneliness. This study examined the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of eCPR. We employed a pre-post design with 151 individuals, including peer support specialists, service users, clinicians, family members, and nonprofit leaders, who participated in virtual eCPR trainings between April 20, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Instruments were administered before and after training and included the Herth Hope Scale; Empowerment Scale; Flourishing Scale (perceived capacity to support individuals); Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; Active-Empathic Listening Scale (supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health challenges); Social Connectedness Scale (feelings of belonging and connection with others); Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; and University of California, Los Angeles 3-item Loneliness Scale (symptoms and emotions). The eCPR fidelity scale was used to determine the feasibility of delivering eCPR with fidelity. We conducted 2-tailed paired t tests to examine posttraining improvements related to each scale. Additionally, data were stratified to identify pre-post differences by role. Findings indicate that it is feasible for people with a lived experience of a mental health condition to develop a program and train people to deliver eCPR with fidelity. Statistically significant pre-post changes were found related to one's ability to identify emotions, support others in distress, communicate nonverbally, share emotions, and take care of oneself, as well as to one's feelings of social connectedness, self-perceived flourishing, and positive affect (PÃ¢â€°Â¤.05). Findings indicated promising evidence of pre-post improvements (not statistically significant) related to loneliness, empowerment, active-empathetic listening, mindfulness awareness, and hope. Nonprofit leaders and workers demonstrated the greatest improvements related to loneliness, social connectedness, empathic listening, and flourishing. Peer support specialists demonstrated the greatest improvements related to positive affect, and clinicians demonstrated the greatest improvements related to mindfulness awareness. Promising evidence indicates that eCPR, a peer-developed and peer-delivered program, may increase feelings of belonging while increasing supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health problems and improving clinical outcomes related to positive and negative affect and feelings of loneliness.","Myers, Collins-Pisano, Ferron, Fortuna","https://doi.org/10.2196/25867","20210304","Emotional CPR (eCPR); community mental health; mental health; peer support; peer-delivered training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11552,""

A research on very recent literature outlines the necessity for patients facing the complexity of IC during the COVID-19 outbreak to prevent the temporary crisis, to broaden perspectives, to deal with confusion, to support in struggling with unpleasant and unexpected events. People affected by IC have a psychological vulnerability that needs tailored support interventions, particularly in the COVID era. A multidisciplinary approach offers a personalized treatment through a web-mediated counseling intervention for patients and their caregivers: a space for continuous discussion and reflection can favour a relationship-based process of change aimed at an improvement in quality of life.","Marano, Gaetani, Marturano, Sani, Gasbarrini, Scambia, Mazza","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202102_25116","20210304","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11553,""
"Teleprecepting: A timely approach to clinical education during COVID-19","Clinical training is a key component of nurse practitioner (NP) education. The rapid shift to telehealth necessitated by the pandemic has also created a need for socially distanced education and precepting. This article presents teleprecepting as a modality for clinical opportunities and connecting students to previously limited experiences, such as training in small specialties, in rural areas, and with interdisciplinary teams. Precepting NP students using telehealth follows similar principles as in-person teaching, but some modifications and additional considerations are needed to transition to the virtual environment. At a time when many NPs have swiftly adapted to telehealth in practice, this article will offer a brief &quot;how-to&quot; for teleprecepting. Prior to COVID-19, teleprecepting was piloted with less than 2% of NP students in the school's pilot teleprecepting project. Seven months after the initial surge of cases and restrictions, 72% of students (n = 151) in the family nurse practitioner, psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, and pediatric nurse practitioner specialties had transitioned to teleprecepting. This project was implemented rapidly during the pandemic, and thus, evaluations comparing competency outcomes and experiences of students and preceptors are still in process. Additionally, feasibility of this educational model may change as telehealth regulations continue to evolve. COVID-19 poses challenges for both patient care and clinical training of NP students across specialties. With some adaptation, clinical placements can be transitioned to the virtual environment of telehealth. Future studies should examine student competencies based on teleprecepting experiences and preceptor training to support teleprecepting roles.","Johnson, Gatewood, Ling, Kuo","https://doi.org/10.1097/JXX.0000000000000567","20210304","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11554,""
"Medical treatment and COVID-19 related worries in patients with inflammatory bowel disease","The aim of this study was to explore changes in medical therapy and document the level of COVID-19-specific worries in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark. A cross-sectional survey including 619 IBD patients was conducted. Patients answered questionnaires regarding IBD, IBD medicine, sociodemographic information, mental health, and COVID-19-specific worries (response rate = 64.6%). In total, 14.3% of patients using IBD medication had paused or stopped their IBD treatment during the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, the majority (61.4%) either due to remission or because of side-effects. Only five patients stated that COVID-19 contributed to their decision. The majority of patients (70.5%) expressed worries about an increased risk of infection with coronavirus-2 and worries that their IBD and/or IBD treatment might result in severe COVID-19. Women, patients taking immunomodulators and patients who considered their IBD to be severe were significantly more worried than the remaining population. Age, type of IBD, co-morbidity, level of education, work capacity and mental health were not associated with an increased level of COVID-19-specific worries. In this selected IBD population, medical IBD treatment was rarely stopped or paused during the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic even though 70% of the respondents expressed COVID-19-specific worries. These worries should, nevertheless, be addressed and the characteristics of the population who expressed concerns may be used in future targeted information to secure compliance. none. not relevant.","Haase, Thorsgaard, LÃƒÂ¸drup","https://www.google.com/search?q=Medical+treatment+and+COVID-19+related+worries+in+patients+with+inflammatory+bowel+disease.","20210304","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11555,""
"Monitoring the effects of COVID-19 in emerging adults with pre-existing mood and anxiety disorders","The COVID-19 quarantine closed many mental health services. Emerging adults with pre-existing mood or anxiety disorders were of concern for worsening symptoms. We sought to demonstrate a method for monitoring mental health status of a group of patients with reduced access to their usual mental health services during quarantine. A total of 326 patients enrolled in the First-Episode Mood and Anxiety Program in London, Ontario, Canada were invited to participate in online questionnaires regularly. Patients were flagged for high level of risk based on depression scores, suicidal ideation and worsening in anxiety, depression or quality of health. All patients were also asked if they wanted contact with a clinician. One hundred and fourteen (35%) patients completed at least one questionnaire. Thirty were flagged based on scores; 37 (32.5%) participating patients requested help. Participants who were flagged for concerning scores were younger, more likely to be on the wait list for treatment, to have been laid off from work and have more functional impairment. Participants requesting support had higher symptom scores for depression and lower scores on quality of health. The process utilized here identified patients at risk and in need of clinical support in the context of pandemic quarantine. It provided an accessible avenue for invited patients to communicate both symptom status and need for contact. Such a process can provide valuable monitoring during times when the usual communications between patients and health care providers is compromised and clinician time is limited. It is easily implemented.","Osuch, Demy, Wammes, Tremblay, Vingilis, Carter","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13135","20210304","adolescents; anxiety disorders; mental health services; mood disorders; quarantine; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11556,""

"Sociodemographic and Psychological Risk Factors for Anxiety and Depression: Findings from the Covid-19 Health and Adherence Research in Scotland on Mental Health (CHARIS-MH) Cross-sectional Survey","Investigations about mental health report prevalence rates with fewer studies investigating psychological and social factors influencing mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic. (1) identify sociodemographic groups of the adult population at risk of anxiety and depression and (2) determine if the following social and psychological risk factors for poor mental health moderated these direct sociodemographic effects: loneliness, social support, threat perception, illness representations. Cross-sectional nationally representative telephone survey in Scotland in June 2020. If available, validated instruments were used, for example, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. A total of 1006 participants; median age 53Ã‚Â years, 61.4% female, from all levels of area deprivation (i.e., 3.8% in the most deprived decile and 15.6% in the most affluent decile). Analyses show associations of anxiety and depression with sociodemographic (age, gender, deprivation), social (social support, loneliness) and psychological factors (perceived threat and illness representations). Mental health was poorer in younger adults, women and people living in the most deprived areas. Age effects were exacerbated by loneliness and illness representations, gender effects by loneliness and illness representations and deprivation effects by loneliness, social support, illness representations and perceived threat. In each case, the moderating variables amplified the detrimental effects of the sociodemographic factors. These findings confirm the results of pre-Covid-19 pandemic studies about associations between sociodemographics and mental health. Loneliness, lack of social support and thoughts about Covid-19 exacerbated these effects and offer pointers for pre-emptive action.","Hubbard, den Daas, Johnston, Dixon","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-021-09967-z","20210304","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Illness representations; Loneliness; Public mental health; Social support; Threat perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11558,""
"How Does COVID-19 Affect the Neurobiology of Suicide?","The aim of this review was to analyze COVID-19 effect on the biological features of suicidal vulnerability and its interaction with suicide-related biological pathways. We carried out a narrative review of international publications on the interactions of COVID-19 with the biological bases of suicide. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with multiple biological processes that underlie suicidal behavior, such as the renin-angiotensin system, nicotinic receptors, and central and systemic inflammation. Social distancing measures may also worsen subjective or objective social disconnection, thus increasing the risk of suicide. Interestingly, the drugs used to prevent suicide could be promising options to counteract brain damage caused by this coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with multiple biological pathways involved in suicide and opens a new window for understanding the suicidal process. The development of suicide prevention treatments in the context of a pandemic may benefit from knowledge on these interactions.","Conejero, Nobile, OliÃƒÂ©, Courtet","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01227-x","20210304","COVID-19; HPA axis; Inflammation; Psychotropic treatments; Social isolation; Suicidal vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11559,""

The aim of this study was to assess the mental health impact of COVID-19 in French General Practitioners (GPs). We carried out a postal-based survey during the first lockdown. Four psychological validated self-report questionnaires were used to assess stress,post-traumatic stress symptoms, burnout and self-efficacy (Perceived Stress scale, Impact of Event Scale-revised, Maslach Burnout Inventory and General Self-Efficacy scale). The sample consists of 332 general practitioners (43.50% women, mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°50.74Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.91). General practitioners working in high epidemic location represented 27.71% of the sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°92). Thirty four GPs reported significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (10.59%). High burnout symptoms were found in 79 (24.46%), 137 (42.41%) and 17 (5.26%) participants.

"Prevalence of Poor Sleep Quality Among Physicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Sleep quality is influenced adversely or favorably by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors and sleep deprivation is a common problem facing doctors. To assess sleep quality among physicians during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and correlate it with possible predictors. This cross-sectional four-months study included a total of 344 physicians from different medical centers in the period between July 2020 and October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Physicians were aged between 24 and 60 years from different specialties. Data were collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and HospitalÃ‚Â Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Among our participant physicians there was poor sleep quality in 71.2%, while good sleep quality was present in 28.8%. There were significant correlations between poor sleep quality and the following parameters in the univariate logistic regression analysis: anxiety features (P value &lt;0.001), depressive features (P value &lt;0.001), and past history of COVID-19 (P value 0.003). However, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only the presence of anxiety features (P valueÃ‚Â &lt;0.001) and depressive features (P value &lt;0.001) could be used as significant independent predictor of poor sleep quality among physicians during COVID-19.

"DetectaWeb-Distress Scale: A Global and Multidimensional Web-Based Screener for Emotional Disorder Symptoms in Children and Adolescents","Emotional disorder symptoms are highly prevalent and a common cause of disability among children and adolescents. Screening and early detection are needed to identify those who need help and to improve treatment outcomes. Nowadays, especially with the arrival of the COVID-19 outbreak, assessment is increasingly conducted online, resulting in the need for brief online screening measures. The aim of the current study was to examine the reliability and different sources of validity evidence of a new web-based screening questionnaire for emotional disorder symptoms, the DetectaWeb-Distress Scale, which assesses mood (major depression and dysthymic disorder), anxiety (separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, social phobia, panic disorder/agoraphobia, and specific phobia), obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidality (suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts), and global distress. A total of 1,499 participants (aged 8-18) completed the DetectaWeb-Distress Scale and specific questionnaires for emotional disorder symptoms, suicidal behaviors, and well-being through a web-based survey. Results indicated that a structural model of 10 correlated factors fits reasonably better in comparison to the remaining models; measurement invariance for age and gender; good internal consistency (McDonald's Ãâ€° ranging from 0.65 to 0.94); and significant positive correlation with other measures of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or distress, and negative correlation with well-being measures, displaying support for convergent-discriminant validity. We also found that girls scored higher than boys on most of the subscales, and children had higher scores for social anxiety, specific phobia, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, whereas adolescents scored higher on depressive symptoms, suicidality, and generalized anxiety, but the effect sizes were small to medium for all comparisons. The DetectaWeb-Distress Scale is a valid, innovative, and useful online tool for the screening and evaluation of preventive programs for mental health in children and adolescents.","Piqueras, Garcia-Olcina, Rivera-Riquelme, Martinez-Gonzalez, Cuijpers","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.627604","20210304","anxiety; children and adolescents; depression; detectaweb-distress; distress; emotional; screener; web-based","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11562,""
"Risk Perception and PTSD Symptoms of Medical Staff Combating Against COVID-19: A PLS Structural Equation Model","Medical staff were battling against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the expense of their physical and mental health, particularly at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this case, intervening PTSD of medical staff and preparing them for future outbreaks are important. Previous studies showed that perceived stress was related to the development of PTSD. Hence, in this study, the association between risk perception of medical staff and PTSD symptoms in COVID-19 and the potential links were explored. Three hundred four medical staff's exposure to COVID-19 patients, risk perception for working during COVID-19, PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and sleep quality were measured. Mediation analysis tested the indirect effects of anxiety and sleep quality on the relationship between risk perceptions and PTSD symptoms; 27.6% of participants were deemed as having probable PTSD diagnosis. Mediation analysis showed a significant chain-mediating effect of anxiety and sleep quality on the relationships between risk perceptions and PTSD symptoms; higher risk perceptions were related to increased anxiety, worsened sleep quality, and severe PTSD symptoms. Conclusively, medical staff have a high prevalence of PTSD symptoms after 3 months of COVID-19. Their PTSD symptoms were associated with the perceived risk level through the potential links with anxiety and sleep quality. Therefore, risk perception could be critical for our medical staff's responses to public health emergencies. It could be plausible to intervene in the perceived stress to alleviate aroused anxiety and improve sleep quality and thereby deter the development of PTSD.","Yin, Chen, Song, Deng, Dong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.607612","20210304","PLS model; PTSD symptoms; anxiety; risk perceptions; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11563,""
"Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms Among People Under Quarantine During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine as an effective public health measure has been widely used in China and elsewhere to slow down the spread, while high-risk psychological response populations remain under-reported. <b>Objective:</b> The aim of the study is to investigate the depressive and anxiety symptoms among the high-risk individuals quarantined during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. <b>Methods:</b> An online survey was conducted from February 29 to April 10, 2020, among individuals quarantined for at least 2 weeks due to the high-risk exposure. Chinese versions of the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) with a seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) were applied to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Compliance with quarantine and knowledge of COVID-19 was also assessed. An unconditional logistic regression model was performed to identify the correlators. <b>Results:</b> Of the 1,260 participants completing the full survey, 14.0% (95% CI: 12.2-16.1%), 7.1% (95% CI: 5.9-8.7%), and 6.3% (95% CI: 5.1-7.8%) had at least moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and a combination of depression and anxiety (CDA), respectively; 14.8% (95% CI: 13.0-16.9%) had at least one condition. Multivariate analysis showed that participants with an undergraduate or above degree were more likely to report depressive (OR = 2.98, 95% CI: 1.56-5.72) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.14-7.63) than those with middle school education. Those who were unemployed (OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.21-0.65 for depression; OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.14-0.73 for anxiety), students (OR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.04-0.48 for depression; OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01-0.85 for anxiety), and more knowledgeable of COVID-19 (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73-0.96 for depression, OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.98 for anxiety) were less likely to report depressive and anxiety symptoms. Higher quarantine compliance correlated with lower risks of depressive (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91-0.96) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.98). <b>Conclusion:</b> Individuals under quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic suffered prevalent depressive and anxiety symptoms.

"Healthcare Worker's Mental Health and Their Associated Predictors During the Epidemic Peak of COVID-19","The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare workers (HCWs) globally. This study investigated potential factors related to depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of Chinese HCWs during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. An online survey was distributed to Chinese HCWs using respondent-driven sampling. Data were collected between February 13th and February 20th, 2020, immediately following the COVID-19 contagion peak in Hubei. A total of 1208 respondents were eligible for analysis. Mental health problems and social support were measured by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSS). The prevalence rates of depression, (DASS-depression &gt; 9) anxiety (DASS-anxiety &gt; 7) and stress (DASS-stress &gt; 14) were 37.8%, 43.0% and 38.5%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regressions revealed that stress, anxiety, and depression were positively related to lower levels of social support, longer working hours, discrimination experience and workplace violence. The scarcity of medical equipment was correlated with increased stress and depression. Chinese HCWs working at COVID 19 designated hospitals were more likely to report anxiety. Additionally, volunteering to work in the frontline health facilities was inversely associated with depression. Mental health problems among Chinese HCWs were alarming during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic.

"Levels of stress in medical students due to COVID-19","For medical schools, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated examination and curricular restructuring as well as significant changes to clinical attachments. With the available evidence suggesting that medical students' mental health status is already poorer than that of the general population, with academic stress being a chief predictor, such changes are likely to have a significant effect on these students. This online, cross-sectional study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 on perceived stress levels of medical students, investigate possible contributing and alleviating factors, and produce recommendations for medical schools to implement during future healthcare emergencies. The majority (54.5%) of respondents reported levels of stress ranging from moderate to extreme. Higher levels of stress were significantly associated with female gender (p=0.039) and international status (p=0.031).

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults with autism: a survey study across three countries","Previous studies have reported a negative psychological and mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This impact is likely to be stronger for people with autism as they are at heightened risk of mental health problems and because the pandemic directly affects social functioning and everyday routines. We therefore examined COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in mental health, the impact of the pandemic on their social life and routines, satisfaction with pandemic-related information and tips, and participants' wishes for guidance. We used a mixed-method approach, collecting quantitative and qualitative survey data from adults with and without autism across three European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1044). We found an increase in depression and anxiety symptoms in response to the pandemic for both the non-autism and the autism group, which was greater for adults with autism. Furthermore, adults with autism showed a greater increase in worries about their pets, work, getting medication and food, and their own safety/security. They felt more relieved from social stress, yet experienced the loss of social contact as difficult. Adults with autism also felt more stressed about the loss of routines. Pleasant changes noted by adults with autism were the increase in solidarity and reduced sensory and social overload. Adults with autism frequently reported problems with cancellation of guidance due to the pandemic and expressed their wish for (more) autism-specific information and advice. Our sample is likely to reflect some degree of selection bias, and longitudinal studies are needed to determine long-term effects. Results highlight the psychological burden of the pandemic on adults with autism and shed light on how to support them during this COVID-19 pandemic, which is especially important now that the pandemic is likely to have a prolonged course. There is a need for accessible, affordable (continued) support from health services. Guidance may focus on the maintenance of a social network, and adjusting routines to the rapid ongoing changes. Finally, we may learn from the COVID-19 pandemic-related changes experienced as pleasant by adults with autism to build a more autism-friendly society post-pandemic.","Oomen, Nijhof, Wiersema","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-021-00424-y","20210304","Autism; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-05","",11567,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Fertility behaviour and Intentions in the Republic of Moldova","The COVID Pandemic could affect fertility behaviour and intentions in many ways. Restrictions on service provision may reduce access to family planning services and increase fertility in the short term. By contrast, the economic uncertainty brought about by the pandemic and its impact on mental health and well-being may reduce fertility. These various pathways have been explored in the context of high income countries such as the United States and Western Europe, but little is known about middle income countries. In this paper we asses the impact of the COVID pandemic on fertility intentions and behaviour in the Republic of Moldova, a middle income country in Eastern Europe, using the Generations and Gender Survey. This survey was conducted partially before and partially after the pandemic, allowing for detailed analysis of individual circumstances.
