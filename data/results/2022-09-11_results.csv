"Healthcare practitioner perceptions on barriers impacting cannabis prescribing practices","Canadians seeking medical cannabis (MC) may encounter difficulties in finding a healthcare provider (HCP) who authorizes their access to it. Barriers that HCPs face in authorizing MC are unclear. The objectives of this study were to evaluate HCP opinions, knowledge, comfort, and practice in MC prescribing and counseling on recreational cannabis use, and whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected MC prescribing practices. Eligible participants included HCPs (e.g., attending physicians, nurses, pharmacists) in Canada. A questionnaire evaluating their knowledge, comfort, and practice in medical and recreational cannabis was designed based on instruments developed in previous studies. Between April 13<sup>th</sup>-December 13<sup>th</sup> 2021, ninety-one healthcare associations were asked to distribute the survey to their members, and an advertisement was placed in the online Canadian Medical Association Journal. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the results. Twenty-four organizations agreed to disseminate the survey and 70 individuals completed it. Of respondents, 71% were attending physicians or medical residents, while the remainder were nurses, pharmacists or other HCPs. Almost none (6%) received training in MC in professional school but 60% did receive other training (e.g., workshops, conferences). Over half (57%) received more questions regarding MC since recreational cannabis was legalized, and 82% reported having patients who use MC. However, 56% felt uncomfortable or ambivalent regarding their knowledge of MC, and 27% were unfamiliar with the requirements for obtaining MC in Canada. The most common symptoms for recommending MC were pain and nausea, whereas the most common conditions for recommending it were cancer and intractable pain. The strongest barrier to authorizing MC was uncertainty in safe and effective dosage and routes of administration. The strongest barrier to recommending or authorizing MC was the lack of research evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy. During the pandemic, many respondents reported that a greater number of their patients used cannabis to relieve anxiety and depression. Our results suggest that HCPs across Canada who responded to our survey are unfamiliar with topics related to MC. The strongest barriers appear to be lack of clinical research, and uncertainty in safe and effective MC administration. Increasing research, training, and knowledge may help HCPs feel more equipped to make informed treatment/prescribing decisions, which may help to improve access to MC.","Hachem, Abdallah, Rueda, Wiese, Mehra, Rup, Cowan, Vigano, Costiniuk","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-022-03716-9","20220908","Attitude of health personnel; Canada; Covid-19; Medical cannabis; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37400,""
"Introversion, Extraversion, and Worsening of Chronic Pain Impact during Social Isolation: A Mediation Analysis","COVID-19 social distancing mandates increased social isolation, resulting in changes in pain severity and interference among individuals with chronic pain. Differences in personality (e.g., introversion/extraversion) may modulate responses to social isolation. We examined the influence of introversion on reported social distancing-related increases in pain interference and assessed for mediators of this relationship. Individuals with chronic pain (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°150) completed validated questionnaires 4-8Ã‚Â weeks after implementation of social distancing mandates. Introversion/extraversion was measured using a subscale of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and changes in pain and psychosocial variables were calculated by comparing participants' recalled and current scores. Association between introversion/extraversion and other variables were assessed using linear regression. A parallel mediation was used to examine mediators of the association between introversion and change in pain interference. Higher introversion was associated with a decrease in pain interference after social distancing (RhoÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°.194, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.017). Parallel mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between introversion/extraversion and change in pain interference was mediated by changes in sleep disturbance and depression, such that higher introversion was associated with less isolation-induced sleep disruption and depression, and thereby less worsening of pain interference. These findings suggest that personality factors such as introversion/extraversion should be considered when personalizing treatment of chronic pain.","Flowers, Colebaugh, Hruschak, Azizoddin, Meints, Jamison, Wilson, Edwards, Schreiber","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10880-022-09901-9","20220908","COVID-19; Chronic pain; Introversion; Pain interference; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37401,""
"Rumination as a Mechanism of the Longitudinal Association Between COVID-19-Related Stress and Internalizing Symptoms in Adolescents","The current prospective longitudinal study evaluated brooding rumination as an intervening mechanism of the association between COVID-19-related stress and internalizing symptoms during the firstÃ‚Â year of the pandemic. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) status and adolescent sex were tested as moderators of the indirect effect. Adolescents with and without ADHD (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°238; M ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.74) completed rating scales of COVID-19 stress and both adolescents and parents completed ratings scales of internalizing symptoms in May/June 2020 (T1). In October/November 2020 (T2), adolescents reported on their brooding rumination. Adolescents and parents reported on internalizing symptoms again in March/April 2021 (T3). Covariates included participant characteristics and baseline symptoms. T1 self-reported COVID-19-related stress was associated with increased T3 self-reported anxiety (abÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.10), self-reported depression (abÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07), and parent-reported depression (abÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.09) via T2 brooding rumination. The indirect effect did not differ for adolescents with and without ADHD or for female and male adolescents. Brooding rumination may be one mechanism to target to promote the mental health adjustment of adolescents during periods of high stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and future stressors.","Fredrick, Nagle, Langberg, Dvorsky, Breaux, Becker","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-022-01435-3","20220908","Adolescence; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Rumination; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37402,""
"A UPLC-MS/MS Method for Plasma Biological Monitoring of Nirmatrelvir and Ritonavir in the Context of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Application to a Case","Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir association has been authorized for conditional use in the treatment of COVID-19, especially in solid-organ transplant recipients who did not respond to vaccine and are still at high risk of severe disease. This combination remains at risk of drug interactions with immunosuppressants, so monitoring drug levels seems necessary. After a simple protein precipitation of plasma sample, analytes were analyzed using an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography system coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in a positive ionization mode. Validation procedures were based on the guidelines on bioanalytical methods issued by the European Medicine Agency. The analysis time was 4 min per run. The calibration curves were linear over the range from 10 to 1000 ng/mL for ritonavir and 40 to 4000 ng/mL for nirmatrelvir, with coefficients of correlation above 0.99 for all analytes. Intra-/interday imprecisions were below 10%. The analytical method also meets criteria of matrix effect, carryover, dilution integrity, and stability. In the context of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a renal transplant recipient, we present a case of tacrolimus overdose with serious adverse events despite discontinuation of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. The patient had still effective concentrations of nirmatrelvir and tacrolimus 4 days after drug discontinuation. This method was successfully applied for therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical practice.","Guyon, Novion, Fulda, Ducint, Molimard, Couzi, Kaminski, Salvo, Bouchet","https://doi.org/10.1021/jasms.2c00204","20220909","COVID-19; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; nirmatrelvir; ritonavir","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37403,""
"Psychological and physical health behavior deviations in students amidst the COVID-19 pandemic","<b>Objective:</b> This study sought to understand how the pandemic impacted mental and physical health behaviors in University students. <b>Methods:</b> Undergraduate and graduate students were asked to answer questions on depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, and physical activity ""prior to"" and ""during"" the shutdown. <b>Results:</b> 457/960 (47.6%) completed the entire survey. Paired samples <i>t</i>-tests showed significant change in mental and physical health behaviors over time. Hierarchical regression models indicated that negative experiences during the shutdown were associated with depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality (all <i>p</i>'sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), but not time spent exercising or sedentary behavior. In addition, positive experiences during the shutdown acted as a buffer. <b>Conclusion</b>: The COVID-19 pandemic shutdown negatively impacted University students. Significant mental and physical health consequences were observed. These effects may linger long past the re-opening of society, and it may be prudent to prepare for additional demand on campus resources. Students in undergraduate and graduate programs experience daily stress related to finances, workload, and time management, as well as the entry into emerging adulthood. This period of transition and its corresponding stressors are especially concerning when looking at the impact of a global pandemic on public health. The present study substantiates previous research concluding that college student health negatively changed during COVID-19 and extends it to include graduate students and a more extensive view of health behaviors.","Okun, Walden, Robertson, Oltz, Ingram, Feliciano","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2111216","20220909","Anxiety; COVID; college; depression; health; sleep; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37404,""

"Coping profiles and differences in well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: A latent profile analysis","During the current COVID-19 pandemic, people need to cope with multiple stressors which may affect their well-being. This study aimed (1) to identify latent coping profiles in the German general population, and (2) to investigate differences between these profiles in well-being. In total, N = 2,326 German participants were recruited as part of the European Society of Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS) ADJUST study from June to September 2020 using an online survey. Coping strategies were assessed using the Brief-COPE and the Pandemic Coping Scale (PCS); well-being was assessed using the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. Coping profiles were identified using latent profile analysis; differences between profiles were examined using the automatic BCH method and multiple group analyses. Five coping profiles were identified that included different types and numbers of coping strategies: (1) High functional coping (17.84%), (2) Moderate functional coping (40.63%), (3) High functional and religious coping (9.07%), (4) Low functional coping (22.06%), (5) Moderate functional and dysfunctional coping (10.40%). The identified profiles significantly differed in well-being (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 503.68, p = &lt;.001). Coping profiles indicating high functional coping were associated with greater well-being compared to coping profiles indicating low (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 82.21, p = &lt;.001) or primarily dysfunctional (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 354.33, p = &lt;.001) coping. These results provide insight into how people differ in their coping strategies when dealing with stressors in an early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study indicates higher levels of well-being in coping profiles with more frequent use of functional strategies. To promote well-being in the general population, it might be beneficial to train functional coping strategies in appropriate interventions that are associated with increased well-being.

"Shugan Jieyu capsule improve sleep and emotional disorder in coronavirus disease 2019 convalescence patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","To evaluate the efficacy of the Shugan Jieyu capsule on improving sleep and emotional disorder during Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescence. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and recruit 200 COVID-19 convalescence patients and then divide the subjects into two groups respectively: the experimental group ( 100) and the control group ( 100). Patients in the control group were given doses as a placebo, while those in the experimental group were given Shugan Jieyu capsule. The investigators mainly observed the differences between the two groups before and after treatment in terms of the rate of reduction and the rate of efficiency in Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) total scores from baseline, and recorded the scores of Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale at 2 week, the 4 week and the 6 week respectively after treatment, and compared the differences between the groups. And the occurrence of adverse events was recorded. After 6-week treatment, there were statistically significant differences in the rate of reduction as well as efficiency in HAMD-17 scores, HAMA Total Scores, PHQ-15 Score, ISI Score from baseline in the experimental group and control group (&lt; 0.05).

"Positive influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on community dwelling adults in Trinidad and Tobago: a cross sectional study","Since the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic its negative effects have been highlighted globally. There is little literature that examines the positive impact on daily living. To examine the positive influences of government-imposed COVID-19 public health restrictions on adults throughout Trinidad and Tobago (TT) and their associated factors. A cross-sectional study, using an adapted pretested online survey instrument, was conducted amongst non-institutionalised, community-dwelling adults using convenience sampling. Of 1287 completed and weighted responses, the mean age (S.D.) was 39.2 (14.6) years, 49% were males, and 61% completed secondary level education. The top 5 positive experiences were more time spent with family (80%), more down-time (78%), learning new skills (68%), more time for hobbies (66%), self-care (57%), more time spent with friends (55%) and eating healthier (50%). The importance of religion, working from home, and an increase in marijuana use emerged as positive correlates for certain positive experiences, while participants with chronic illness, and a positive anxiety or depression screen, were negatively associated with most positive experiences. Despite the negative consequences of the COVID19 pandemic, several positives were highlighted in this study. These findings have implications for social policies toward building resilience within the community.","Motilal, Khan, St Bernard, Ivey, Reid","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2022.2118690","20220909","COVID-19; community; exercise; independent living; mental health; pandemic; self-care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37408,""
"Cracks in the foundation: The experience of care aides in long-term care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic","Care aides (certified nursing assistants, personal support workers) are the largest workforce in long-term care (LTC) homes (nursing homes). They provide as much as 90% of direct care to residents. Their health and well-being directly affect both quality of care and quality of life for residents. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 on care aides working in LTC homes during the first year of the pandemic. We conducted semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 52 care aides from 8 LTC homes in Alberta and one in British Columbia, Canada, between January and April 2021. Nursing homes were purposively selected across: (1) ownership model and (2) COVID impact (the rate of COVID infections reported from March to December 2020). Interviews were recorded and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Care aides were mainly female (94%) and older (74% aged 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or older). Most spoke English as an additional language (76%), 54% worked full-time in LTC homes, and 37% worked multiple positions before ""one worksite policies"" were implemented. Two themes emerged from our analysis: (1) Care aides experienced mental and emotional distress from enforcing resident isolation, grief related to resident deaths, fear of contracting and spreading COVID-19, increased workload combined with staffing shortages, and rapidly changing policies. (2) Care aides' resilience was supported by their strong relationships, faith and community, and capacity to maintain positive attitudes. These findings suggest significant, ongoing adverse effects for care aides in LTC homes from working through the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data demonstrate the considerable strength of this occupational group. Our results emphasize the urgent need to appropriately and meaningfully support care aides' mental health and well-being and adequately resource this workforce. We recommend improved policy guidelines and interventions.","Titley, Young, Savage, Thorne, Spiers, Estabrooks","https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.18024","20220909","COVID-19 pandemic; care aides; long-term care home; long-term care workers; nursing home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37409,""
"[The impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on the well-being of women giving birth]","The objective of this work is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 health crisis on the psychological status in the first few days after giving birth.

"Development of a Graphene-Oxide-Deposited Carbon Electrode for the Rapid and Low-Level Detection of Fentanyl and Derivatives","The opioid overdose crisis in North America worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with multiple jurisdictions reporting more deaths per day due to the fentanyl-contaminated drug supply than COVID-19. The rapid quantitative detection of fentanyl in the illicit opioid drug supply or in bodily fluids at biologically relevant concentrations (i.e., &lt;80 nM) remains a significant challenge. Electroanalytical techniques are inexpensive and can be used to rapidly detect fentanyl, but detection limits need to be improved. Herein, we detail the development of an electrochemical-based fentanyl analytical detection strategy that used a glassy carbon electrode modified with electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) via electrophoretic deposition. The resulting surface was further electrochemically reduced in the presence of fentanyl to enhance the sensitivity. Multiple ERGO thicknesses were prepared in order to prove the versatility and ability to fine-tune the layer to the desired response. Fentanyl was detected at &lt;10 ppb (&lt;30 nM) with a limit of detection of 2 ppb and a calibration curve that covered 4 orders of concentration (from 1 ppb to 10 ppm). This method was sensitive to fentanyl analogues such as carfentanil. Interference from the presence of 100-fold excess of other opioids (heroin, cocaine) or substances typically found in illicit drug samples (e.g. caffeine and sucrose) was not significant.","Jun, Sammis, Rezazadeh-Azar, Ginoux, Bizzotto","https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c02057","20220909","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37411,""

"Predictors of depressive symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with respiratory problems","COVID-19 patients and survivors quite often experience depressive symptoms, which can increase risk for lower immune system response and poorer recovery. Vulnerability to depressive symptoms may be elevated in those patients who have the most severe COVID-19 course of illness, that is, patients who require supplementary oxygen therapy or even intubation. The current study involved a unique sample of patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 and who required respiratory support (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 34, 10 women) in which we investigated depressive symptoms as well as psychopathological personality traits (PID5) as predictors. The majority of patients (76.5%) presented some degree of depressive symptoms. Although we expected severe levels of depressive symptoms to be most prevalent, more patients showed rather moderate levels. At the same time, Negative Affectivity was most predictive of depressive symptoms. We suggest that medical care for patients with greater emotional sensitivity and vulnerability to stress be supplemented with psychological support in order to address depressive symptoms and foster recovery.","Zajenkowska, WiÃ…â€ºniewska, Leniarska, Jasielska, Bodecka, Zajenkowski, KaÃ…Âºmierczak, Klimiuk, Niemczyk, Niemczyk, Pinkham","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2121970","20220909","COVID-19 patients; depression; psychopathological personality traits (PID5); respiratory problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37413,""
"Asian American and Pacific Islander Access to Abortion During COVID-19: A Complex Interplay of Factors","Often stereotyped as the ""model minority,"" health care providers, lawmakers, and the general public regularly underestimate and ignore the health concerns of Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the racism that AAPIs face-many communities report facing severe xenophobia during the pandemic, which has increased hesitancy to obtain needed medical treatment and heightened mental health issues at a time of isolation. The pandemic is also exacerbating the barriers that already exist in accessing abortion care-with travel restrictions, quarantine measures, lesser availability of appointments, and more burden on the health care staff and system. There has been no discussion on the impact of the pandemic on AAPIs' access to abortion care. We discuss challenges that are specific to AAPIs in accessing sexual and reproductive care, especially abortion, and how these are compounded by the lack of appropriate data and methods. We then discuss the added complexity that comes with accessing abortion care during a pandemic and provide recommendations for research methods to better reach these populations.","Chandrasekaran, Choimorrow","https://doi.org/10.1089/heq.2022.0036","20220909","AAPI; COVID-19; abortion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37414,""
"Association of Delayed Sleep/Wake Rhythm with Depression During the First COVID-19 Lockdown in France","The containment of the population during the COVID-19 pandemic led to the emergence or recurrence of psychiatric conditions and sleep disorders. The influence of sleep/wake rhythm on mental health is well known. The objective of our study was to evaluate the link between the shift in sleep/wake rhythm and the presence of depressive symptoms during the March to May 2020 lockdown in the French population. Participants (n = 2513) were recruited via newspapers and social networks in March 2020. We evaluated i) the chronotype before and during the lockdown, assessed by the change in mid-sleep time on work-free days corrected for sleep debt on workdays (delta MSFsc); ii) morningness-eveningness circadian preference (Horne &amp; Ostberg questionnaire); iii) depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9). The delta MSFsc and the PHQ-9 score were compared between circadian preference types. A multivariate model adjusted for age, sex, circadian preference, housing type, and marital status was used to assess the influence of delta MSFsc on the PHQ-9 score in the whole population. The population consisted of 77% women, of median (IQR) age 39 (30-48) years. Compared with the pre-lockdown period, the median (IQR) MSFsc was shifted by 30 (0-66) min during the lockdown, with a significant difference between evening [60 (15-120) min], morning [15 (0-46) min] and neutral [30 (0-70) min] circadian type individuals, p &lt; 0.001. One-third of all participants had moderate to severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10). A 1-hour shift in MSFsc was associated with a 0.50-point increase [95% CI (0.28; 0.72), p &lt; 0.001] in the PHQ-9. A phase delay in the chronotype was observed in the general population during lockdown. Such disruption was associated with depressive symptoms but the direction of the relationship remains hypothetical. The impact on mental health of preventive measures targeting the sleep/wake rhythm in this context needs further evaluation.","Felician, Galvao, Lefebvre, Nourredine, Peter-Derex","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S369859","20220909","chronotype; circadian preference; containment; mental health; pandemic; phase delay","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37415,""
"Time estimation and passage of time judgment predict eating behaviors during COVID-19 lockdown","Poor eating habits often lead to health concerns. While mental health conditions such as stress and anxiety have been linked as predictors for eating behaviors, cognitive factors may also contribute to eating practices during the early stages of the mandatory COVID-19 lockdown. In the current study, participants responded to a survey that asked them to judge the passing of time (PoTJ) and to produce short intervals (<i>via</i> a time production task) as an index of the internal clock speed. Additionally, they responded to questions about snacking frequency and the tendency to overeat during lockdown. We observed that those who judged time to pass slowly also reported a greater tendency to snack and overeat during the pandemic. Additional analysis also revealed that the effect of PoTJ on snacking is moderated by the internal clock speed such that those who felt time was passing by slowly, and in combination with a faster internal clock (as indexed by shorter duration production), had a greater tendency to snack. The results suggest that different aspects of temporal cognition play potential roles in influencing different types of eating behaviors. Our findings therefore have implications for eating disorders, along with the potential of time-based intervention or behavioral modification approaches.","Isham, Lomayesva, Teng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.961092","20220909","eating behaviors; overeating; passage of time judgment; snacking; time perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37416,""
"Validation of the fear of COVID-19 scale in a central Balkan country - Serbia","High levels of fear of COVID-19 may be associated with increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as decreased resilience and life expectancy. This study aimed to translate and confirm the Serbian version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale as well as to investigate its psychometric properties. The translation and intercultural adaptation of the Fear of COVID-19 scale was performed by the leading standard of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research. When the distribution was normal, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. The reliability of the Serbian version of FCV-19S was tested by measuring the internal consistency through the value of Cronbach's alpha. The original version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale was tested on a sample of 256 subjects with a mean age of 25.38 Ã‚Â± 12.47. The Cronbach's alpha value was 0.864. We divided the scale by the split-half method (Spearman-Brown), and the value of the coefficient for the questionnaire as a whole was 0.882. Divergent criterion validity was tested through the non-parametric correlation between the scores of the Fear of COVID-19 scale and the Fear of Hospitalization scale. A score of the Fear of COVID-19 scale was calculated as the sum of each question for each of the respondents. Convergent criterion validity was tested through the non-parametric correlation between the scores of the Fear of COVID-19 scale and the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire. The validated version of the scale in Serbia complements versions available in other cultures and other languages and facilitates global studies related to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zivkovic Zaric, Zaric, Canovic, Jankovic, Stojadinovic, Zornic, Nesic, Spasic, Jovanovic, Jug, Jakovljevic, Pejcic","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.972668","20220909","COVID-19; anxiety; fear; scale; validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37417,""
"Anxiety and depression among adult tobacco users during the COVID-19 restrictions in India","The world witnessed a highly contagious and deadly disease, COVID-19, toward the end of 2019. India is one of the worst affected countries. We aimed to assess anxiety and depression levels among adult tobacco users and people who recently quit tobacco during COVID-19 lockdown in India. The study was conducted across two Indian cities, Delhi and Chennai (July-August, 2020) among adult tobacco users (<i>n</i> = 801). Telephonic interviews were conducted using validated mental health tools (Patient Health Questionnaire-PHQ-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD-7) to assess the anxiety and depression levels of the participants. Descriptive analysis and multiple logistic regression were used to study the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety. We found that 20.6% of tobacco users had depression symptoms (3.9% moderate to severe); 20.7% had anxiety symptoms (3.8% moderate to severe). Risk factors associated with depression and anxiety included food, housing, and financial insecurity. During COVID-19 lockdown, mental health of tobacco users (primarily women) was associated with food, housing and financial insecurity. The Indian Government rightly initiated several health, social and economic measures to shield the most vulnerable from COVID-19, including a ban on the sale of tobacco products. It is also necessary to prioritize universal health coverage, expanded social security net, tobacco cessation and mental health services to such vulnerable populations during pandemic situations.","Bassi, Nazar, Joshi, Sharma, Pandian, Deepa, Mohan, Patel, Ali, McNeill, Tandon, Mohan, Prabhakaran, Arora","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.964949","20220909","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; lockdown; mental health; tobacco users","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37418,""

"The Impact of COVID-19-Related Living Restrictions on Eating Behaviours in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review","The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the imposition of physical and social distancing measures worldwide. Emerging data suggest that younger age groups may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse mental health impacts of the pandemic. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented increase in demand for child and adolescent eating disorder services. The aim of this review was to systematically review and appraise the current literature on the impact of COVID-19-related living restrictions on the eating behaviours of children and adolescents. Searches of eight electronic databases were conducted in March 2021 and December 2021 for published and grey literature on eating behaviours of population samples of children and adolescents (aged 18 months to 18 years old) who were exposed to COVID-19-related living restrictions. Of 3165 retrieved references, sixteen studies were included in this review, comprising data from 125, 286 participants. There was a pattern towards healthier eating behaviours among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, young people from lower socioeconomic groups showed a tendency towards more unhealthy eating behaviours, and there was an association between mood difficulties and greater changes in eating; this suggests that such groups may be more vulnerable to the adverse health consequences of lockdowns.","Brakspear, Boules, Nicholls, Burmester","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14173657","20220909","COVID-19; adolescents; children; coronavirus; eating; living restrictions; lockdown; pandemic; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37423,""

We analyzed all Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) validated by Campania Pharmacovigilance Regional Centre from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2021 and reported a CM (ATC code V08) as a suspected drug. We compared CM-related reporting between 2 years before (period 1) and 2 years during (period 2) the COVID-19 pandemic. From our analysis, it emerged that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, CM-related ADR reporting decreased, but a significant increase in reporting of serious cases emerged. Serious ADRs were mainly related to iodinated CM (V08A ATC) compared to magnetic resonance imaging CM (V08C ATC).

"Association of Acute Headache of COVID-19 and Anxiety/Depression Symptoms in Adults Undergoing Post-COVID-19 Rehabilitation","As a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny. Identifying risk factors associated with post-COVID headache will ensure immediate action and counseling for this population of patients. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the relationship between headache and psychological state (stress level, depression, and anxiety symptoms) in adults undergoing post-COVID-19 rehabilitation. In addition, we used mediation analysis to evaluate the mediation effect of psychological variables in the relationship between headache and quality of life. This cross-sectional study included 147 patients undergoing post-COVID-19 rehabilitation at the Public Hospital in Poland (64 males, 83 females, with mean age of 56.97 years). Psychological parameters were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the brief World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BRIEF). Additionally, all participants completed a questionnaire related to COVID-19 symptoms and their severity, the place of COVID-19 treatment, and the need for oxygen therapy during hospitalization. Of all participants, 65% experienced headache during COVID-19. Of the participants with headache, there were significantly more females in this group (69% vs. 31%), and they were significantly younger (mean age 55.47 vs. 59.78 years). Participants with headache had a 27% higher HADS-D score, a 21% higher HADS-A score, and a 13% higher PSS-10 score. Moreover, gender and headache were found to be important predictor variables for total HADS and HADS-D, accounting for 11% and 7%, respectively. Mediation analysis has shown that the tested psychological variables mediated 39-68% of the total effect of headache influence on WHOQOL domains. In conclusion, our study demonstrated several relationships between headache that occurred during COVID-19 and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress level during post-COVID rehabilitation also in the context of quality of life. Our results show that patients who experienced headaches during COVID-19 are at high risk of developing anxiety-depressive symptoms later. Female gender is associated with a higher prevalence of headache during COVID-19.","Mazurek, CieÃ…â€ºlik, Szary, Rutkowski, Szczegielniak, SzczepaÃ…â€žska-Gieracha, Gajda","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11175002","20220909","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; headache; long-term complications; pain; quality of life; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37426,""
"Virtual Learning during COVID-19: Exploring Challenges and Identifying Highly Vulnerable Groups Based on Location","Amid the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 2020, educational platforms have been forced to change and adapt from conventional physical learning to virtual learning. Nearly all higher learning institutions worldwide are forced to follow the new educational setting through virtual platforms. Sabah is one of the poorest states in Malaysia with the poorest infrastructure, with the technology and communication facilities in the state remaining inept. With the changes in virtual platforms in all higher education institutions in Malaysia, higher learning institutions in Sabah are expected to follow the lead, despite the state lagging in its development. This has certainly impacted the overall productivity and performance of students in Sabah. Therefore, this study aims to explore the challenges of the implementation of virtual learning among students in Sabah. More specifically, this study seeks to identify vulnerable groups among students based on their geographical location. To achieve the objective of this study, a survey has been conducted on a total of 1,371 students in both private and public higher learning institutions in Sabah. The sample selection for this study was determined using a purposive sampling technique. Based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), it was found that there are five challenges in virtual learning faced by students in higher learning institutions in Sabah. These are the unconducive learning environment (var(X) = 20.12%), the deterioration of physical health (var(X) = 13.40%), the decline of mental health (var(X) = 12.10%), the limited educational facilities (var(X) = 10.14%) and social isolation (var(X) = 7.47%). The K-Means Clustering analysis found that there are six student clusters in Sabah (Cluster A, B, C, D, E &amp; F), each of which faces different challenges in participating in virtual learning. Based on the assessment of location, almost half of the total number of districts in Sabah are dominated by students from Cluster A (9 districts) and Cluster B (4 districts). More worryingly, both Cluster A and Cluster B are classified as highly vulnerable groups in relation to the implementation of virtual learning. The results of this study can be used by the local authorities and policymakers in Malaysia to improve the implementation of virtual learning in Sabah so that the education system can be more effective and systematic. Additionally, the improvement and empowerment of the learning environment are crucial to ensuring education is accessible and inclusive for all societies, in line with the fourth of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-4).","Jafar, Dollah, Dambul, Mittal, Ahmad, Sakke, Mapa, Joko, Eboy, Jamru, Wahab","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191711108","20220909","Malaysia; Sabah; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); e-learning; higher education; online learning; quality education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37427,""
"Factors Affecting Perceived Work Environment, Wellbeing, and Coping Styles: A Comparison between Physicians and Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is a current emergency worldwide. All the consequent changes in sanitary systems have negatively affected the work-life balance. In particular, healthcare workers suffered from anxiety, stress, and depression, mostly nurses compared to physicians. To handle this situation, the adoption of different coping strategies has played a strategic role in psychophysical wellbeing. Our main goal is to the assess the perception of work environment and wellbeing (EQ-5D questionnaire), as well as to analyze possible differences in coping styles between physicians and nurses (brief COPE questionnaire). The arising differences were compared between the two groups, and associations with variables were assessed through a bivariate correlation analysis. This cross-sectional study was conducted from November to December 2020 through an online survey. A total of 172 respondents (117 physicians and 55 nurses), of which 102 were women and 70 were men, accepted to join the study. Our results showed that physicians referred a higher perception of wellbeing, and nurses reported an increased perception of work activity and efficiency, along with an unchanged economic status. The most frequently adopted coping strategies were Active and Planning (self-sufficient coping). Physicians showed a greater tendency to use avoidant coping strategies. More-experienced nurses and physicians were less prone to adopt socially supported coping strategies, emphasizing the need for novel organizational measures at the social dimension that favored sharing and interaction between peers. Future research should aim to further investigate the relationship between the perception of work environment and coping strategies in order to identify risk factors to be prevented by promoting adequate measures at an organizational level.","Costa, Teodoro, De Vita, GiambÃƒÂ², Mento, Muscatello, Alibrandi, Italia, Fenga","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191711104","20220909","COVID-19; coping strategies; healthcare workers; wellbeing; work environment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37428,""

It also assessed the changes which occurred in the level of PA and in generalised anxiety in young adults as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was carried out online with 506 young adults aged 18 to 34 years (=24.67 years Ã‚Â± 4.23 years). Respondents provided two answers to each question, i.e., information relating to the last 7 days during the pandemic (first hard lockdown), and to a period of 7 days before the pandemic (retrospective). The levels of physical activity were measured using 7-item International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), whereas the level of generalised anxiety was assessed using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) questionnaire. During the pandemic there was a significant correlation between the level of generalised anxiety and the level of physical activity reported by the respondents (<i>p =</i> 0.048). A higher level of physical activity corresponded to lower level of generalized anxiety in young adults. During the pandemic, young adults spent significantly less time performing physical activity (8752.5 vs. 6174.6 metabolic equivalents (MET) min/week, <i>p &amp;lt;</i> 0.001), they spent more time engaging in sedentary behaviours (Me = 240 vs. Me = 300 min/day, <i>p &amp;lt;</i> 0.001), and they walked much less (from Me = 6930.0 (MET) min/week vs. 3861.0 (MET) min/week (44.29% decrease). Furthermore, after the outbreak of the pandemic the level of perceived generalised anxiety increased significantly (<i>p &amp;lt;</i> 0.001). Physical activity may play an important role in reducing anxiety disorder in young adults. During the COVID-19 pandemic young adults were significantly less involved in PA, which adversely affected their physical and mental condition. The importance of sufficient PA should be emphasised during this specific period, particularly among young adults.","Czenczek-Lewandowska, Leszczak, WyszyÃ…â€žska, Baran, Weres, Lewandowski","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191711086","20220909","COVID-19; generalised anxiety; physical activity; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37429,""
"Post-Acute COVID-19 Sequelae in a Working Population at One Year Follow-Up: A Wide Range of Impacts from an Italian Sample","Long COVID-19 is a term used to describe the symptomatic sequelae that develop after suffering from COVID-19. Very few studies have investigated the impact of COVID-19 sequelae on employment status. The aim of this research was to characterise sequelae of COVID-19 in a population of workers who tested positive for COVID-19, with a follow-up within one year of the acute illness, and to analyse the possible association between this and changes in the workers' occupational status. In this retrospective cohort study, a questionnaire was administered to 155 workers; descriptive, univariate (chi-square tests), and multivariate (logistic regression model) analyses were carried out. The mean age was 46.48 years (SD Ã‚Â± 7.302); 76 participants were males (49.7%), and 33 participants reported being current smokers (21.3%). Overall, 19.0% of patients reported not feeling fully recovered at follow-up, and 13.7% reported a change in their job status after COVID-19. A change in occupational status was associated with being a smoker (OR 4.106, CI [1.406-11.990], <i>p</i> = 0.010); hospital stay was associated with age &amp;gt; 46 years in a statistically significant way (<i>p</i> = 0.025) and with not feeling fully recovered at follow-up (<i>p</i> = 0.003). A persistent worsening in anxiety was more common in women (<i>p</i> = 0.028). This study identifies smoking as a risk factor for workers not able to resume their job; furthermore, occupational physicians should monitor mental health more closely after COVID-19, particularly in female workers.","Buonsenso, Gualano, Rossi, Valz Gris, Sisti, Borrelli, Santoro, Tumminello, Gentili, Malorni, Valentini, Ricciardi, Moscato","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191711093","20220909","COVID-19; employment status; long COVID-19; occupational medicine; smoking; workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37430,""
"Are You Willing to Protect the Health of Older People? Intergenerational Contact and Ageism as Predictors of Attitudes toward the COVID-19 Vaccination Passport","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the vulnerability of older people to COVID-19 has been stressed in political discourse and the mass media, with the call to protect older adults. Therefore, policies aimed at reducing the spread of coronavirus, such as the COVID-19 vaccination passport policy, might be perceived as policies aimed at preserving the health of older people, and negative attitudes toward older people (i.e., ageism) might underlie negative attitudes toward such policies. While intergenerational contact is one of the main antecedents of reduced ageism, the pandemic has forced people to separate, and direct intergenerational contact in particular might have been reduced, possibly being replaced by telephone and virtual contact. In a correlational study (<i>N</i> = 153 Italian university students) we found that quantity and quality of direct intergenerational contact diminished during the pandemic. Virtual intergenerational contact was unexpectedly less frequent than direct contact. Quality of direct contact before the pandemic was associated, over and above the effects of other contact forms under investigation, with reduced ageism, which was in turn associated with negative attitude toward the vaccination passport. Findings will be discussed focusing on the roles of intergenerational contact and ageism for public health.","Visintin, Tasso","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191711061","20220909","COVID-19 vaccination; COVID-19 vaccination passport; ageism; intergenerational contact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37431,""

Based on empirical voices from 18 IFMs in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing, this study used trauma-informed care as its primary theoretical lens to examine potential traumatic incidents and risk factors. Findings showed that participants had neuroses about the omen of lockdowns and felt exhausted and frustrated about persistent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. They also experienced or witnessed burnout and dropout due to leisure constraints. Most notably, participants had concerns about families and friends during the series of lockdowns, entailing extreme stress due to separation, illness, loss, and grief.

"The Role of Psychobiotics to Ensure Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Current State of Knowledge","Psychobiotics are defined as probiotics, mainly of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, that confer mental health benefits to the host when consumed in a particular quantity through the interaction with commensal gut microbiota. The gut microbiota, which means a diverse and dynamic population of microorganisms harboring the gastrointestinal tract, communicates with the brain and vice versa through the brain-gut axis. The mechanisms of action of psychobiotics may be divided into four groups: synthesis of neurotransmitters and neurochemicals, regulation of the HPA axis, influence on the immune system, and synthesis of metabolites. Recent years showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected not only physical, but also mental health. Social isolation, fear of infection, the lack of adequate vaccine, disinformation, increased number of deaths, financial loss, quarantine, and lockdown are all factors can cause psychiatric problems. The aim of this review was to discuss the potential role of psychobiotic in light of the current problems, based on <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, meta-analyses, clinical trials evidence, and registered studies assessing probiotics' therapeutic administration in the prevention or treatment of symptoms or side effects of COVID-19.","ZieliÃ…â€žska, Karbowiak, Brzezicka","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191711022","20220909","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; probiotics; psychobiotics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37433,""
"Multivariate Analysis on Physical Activity, Emotional and Health Status of University Students Caused by COVID-19 Confinement","Confinement as a result of COVID-19 had a strong impact around the world and restricted mobility. The university community started to take routine classes in a virtual and sedentary way, causing negative effects on their health and habits. The objective of this research is to analyze the impact of confinement through surveys of students and interviews with university professors, in order to study the effects of confinement on physical activity, emotional state, and health. The methodology was as follows: (i) preliminary data; (ii) survey development, interviews, and information collection; (iii) data processing and multivariate presentation of the results, using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and multiple factor analysis (MFA). The results of 375 respondents show that there is a low level of physical activity (&amp;lt;300 METs, 49.6%), where women register sedentary behavior (73%). Emotionally, most of them show feeling bored. Some express anxiety, depression, discomfort, and frustration. In terms of health, there are rheumatic, circulatory, respiratory, and other diseases related to obesity. It is essential to create programs that promote physical exercise to reduce the consequences of sedentary lifestyles on the physical, social, and mental health of university students, especially engineering students, who experienced greater effects of confinement than those studying nutrition and social sciences.","MerchÃƒÂ¡n-SanmartÃƒÂ­n, Brocel-BajaÃƒÂ±a, Pambabay-Calero, Bauz-Olvera, MontalvÃƒÂ¡n-Burbano, Aguilar-Aguilar, CarriÃƒÂ³n-Mero","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191711016","20220909","anxiety; depression; pandemic; physical exercise; sedentarism; undergraduates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37434,""
"Mental Health Status of French School-Aged Children's Parents during the COVID-19 Lockdown and Its Associated Factors","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread social isolation. This study aimed to determine anxiety levels among parents of school-aged children and investigate the associated factors. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, living and working conditions, family relationships, social support (MSPSS) and health status (SF-12) were collected from French parents through an online survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used to assess anxiety. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with moderate to severe anxiety. Among 698 parents, 19.2% experienced moderate to severe anxiety. A low level of resilience (OR = 4.3, 95% CI: 2.7-6.7) and confirmed COVID-19 cases involving hospitalization (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 2.0-7.3) among individuals in one's household or in the family circle were found to be the main risk factors for moderate to severe anxiety. Other factors were also identified: a level of education less than high school (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3-3.2), conflicts at home (OR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.4-3.7), noises outside the home (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.0-3.9), confirmed cases not involving hospitalization (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0-3.1) and suspected cases (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0-3.8).

"Associations of Work-Family Conflict with Family-Specific, Work-Specific, and Well-Being-Related Variables in a Sample of Polish and Ukrainian Adults during the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","The conflict between work and family demands increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to changes in lifestyle related to the lockdown. This study examines the associations between work-family conflict (WFC) and family-work conflict (FWC) with work-specific, family-specific, and well-being-related variables during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results may be used in practice to improve the well-being of employees by adjusting home-based work and family areas of life to dynamic changes during the pandemic. The sample of 736 adults from Poland (53.26%) and Ukraine (46.74%), aged between 19 and 72 (<i>M</i> = 39.40; <i>SD</i> = 10.80), participated in the study. The cross-sectional study was performed using an online survey, including sociodemographic variables, measures of WFC, time pressure, remote work assessment (RWAS), physical health (GSRH), life satisfaction (SWLS), perceived stress (PSS-10), anxiety (GAD-7), and depression (PHQ-9). This study showed numerous inter-group differences in all variables across the country, gender, relationship status, parenthood, caring for children under 12, and remote working status. A high WFC is more likely among Polish workers (than Ukrainian workers), people with a low level of self-perceived time pressure, and high symptoms of stress. Caring for children under 12, low self-perceived time pressure, and high stress can predict FWC. Various paths lead from perceived stress via WFC and FWC, physical health, anxiety, and depression to life satisfaction, as suggested by the structural equation modeling analysis. Parents of children under 12 and women are the most vulnerable groups for increased WFC, FWC, and worse mental health and well-being. Prevention programs should focus on reducing stress, anxiety, and work demands in these adult populations. A unique contribution to the existing knowledge revealed patterns of associations between WFC and FWC in relation to well-being dimensions in a cross-cultural context during the pandemic.","KuÃ…â€ºnierz, Rogowska, Chilicka, Pavlova, Ochnik","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710954","20220909","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; gender; parenthood; perceived stress; relationship status; remote work; time pressure; work-family conflict","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37436,""
"Working Conditions and Wellbeing among Prison Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Comparison to Community Nurses","The psychological health and work challenges of nurses working in prisons during the COVID-19 pandemic are understudied. We evaluated the work and wellbeing characteristics of a California prison nurse group, with a comparison to those of a community nurse group. From May to November 2020, an online survey measured psychosocial and organizational work factors, sleep habits, psychological characteristics, COVID-19 impacts, and pre-pandemic recall among 62 prison nurses and 47 community nurses. Prison nurses had significantly longer work hours (54.73 Ã‚Â± 14.52, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001), higher pandemic-related work demands, and less sleep hours (5.36 Ã‚Â± 1.30, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.0001) than community nurses.

Between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, both groups had significantly increased night shift assignments and decreased sleep hours, but the prison group had increased work hours. Although not statistically significant, both groups had high occupational stress and prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Our results indicate that prison nurses experienced work and wellbeing challenges during the pandemic.

"Psychological and Biochemical Effects of an Online Pilates Intervention in Pregnant Women during COVID-19: A Randomized Pilot Study","The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of real-time online Pilates exercise during COVID-19 on women's body composition, blood lipids, and psychological health after childbirth. The participants were 16 pregnant women (24-28 weeks pregnant) enrolled at the C Women's Culture Center in Seoul, South Korea, classified into online Pilates groups and non-exercise groups (PE, n = 8; CON, n = 8). The online Pilates program was conducted for 8 weeks, twice a week, and 50 min a day using a real-time video chat app. Participants visited the hospital twice for body composition and blood tests. Questionnaires on postpartum depression, sleep disorder, and stress were conducted at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after childbirth. We found a significant difference between groups in body composition. The weight, percentage of body fat, body fat mass, and BMI of the PE group decreased. Blood lipids showed significant differences between the groups in TC, TG, LDL and CRP, while insulin and HDL showed no difference. All blood lipids, insulin, and CRP in the PE group were reduced. There were significant differences between the groups in postpartum depression, sleep disorders, and perceived stress indices performed in the post-test, and the serotonin concentration in the PE group increased. Serotonin levels were significantly correlated with postpartum depression, body fat mass, and body fat rate. Pregnant women's online Pilates in this study was effective at reducing weight and depression in women after childbirth and should be used to promote women's mental health during COVID-19.","Kim, Hyun","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710931","20220909","body composition; online exercise; postpartum depression; pregnancy Pilates; serotonin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37438,""

However, little is known about mental health conditions and the possible risk and protective factors of specific population groups, such as institutionalized vs. community-dwelling elderly. We investigated the abovementioned aspects in a sample of 65-89-year-old people during the third wave of COVID-19 in Italy. We employed a sociodemographic survey and four questionnaires on health-related quality of life (SF-36), loneliness (UCLA), spirituality (FACIT-Sp), and anxiety/depression (HADS). Our findings suggest that the physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being of the elderly had not been seriously impaired by the events related to the pandemic, although most of the participants reported a worsening of their social life and a moderate/high fear of COVID-19. In regression analyses, these two latter aspects turned out to be predictors of higher anxiety, while spiritual well-being and the possibility to get out of the house/institution emerged as protective factors against anxiety and for preserving quality of life, respectively.

"Male-Type Depression Mediates the Relationship between Avoidant Coping and Suicidal Ideation in Men","Despite known links between men's avoidant coping behaviours (e.g., distraction, denial, substance use) and suicide risk, little research has explored the mechanisms underpinning this relationship. This study sought to examine whether male-type depression symptoms (e.g., anger, aggression, emotion suppression), assessed by the Male Depression Risk Scale, mediate the association between avoidant coping and suicide/self-harm ideation in men. Data were drawn from an online survey of a community sample of 606 Australian men (<i>M</i> age = 50.11 years; SD = 15.00), conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mediation analyses were applied to examine the effect of male-type depression on the association between avoidant coping and suicidal/self-harm ideation, controlling for age, resilience and the experience of two psychosocial stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic (financial stress and government restrictions). Avoidant coping was associated with suicidal/self-harm ideation, <i>r</i> = 0.45, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001. Results supported a mediating role of male-type depression symptoms in this relationship, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i>=</i> 0.29, <i>P<sub>M</sub></i> = 0.36, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001, underscoring the importance of screening for male-type depression symptoms to better identify men at risk of suicidal/self-harm ideation.

"Assessing Prevalence and Unique Risk Factors of Suicidal Ideation among First-Year University Students in China Using a Unique Multidimensional University Personality Inventor","University students with suicidal ideation are at high risk of suicide, which constitutes a significant social and public health problem in China. However, little is known about the prevalence and associated risk factors of suicidal ideation among first-year university students in China, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. To investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and its factors in first-year Chinese university students from a vocational college in Zhejiang during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a cluster sampling technique, a university-wide survey was conducted of 686 first-year university students from Hangzhou in March 2020 using University Personality Inventory (UPI). UPI includes an assessment for suicidal ideation and possible risk factors. Suicidal ideation prevalence was calculated for males and females. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted, adjusting for age and sex. Analyses were carried out using the SPSS version 22.0 software. The prevalence of 12-month suicidal ideation among first-year university students during March 2020 was 5.2%, and there was no significant difference between males and females (4.8% vs. 6.0%, x2 = 0.28, <i>p</i> = 0.597).

Data collection was carried out online with a questionnaire made available via Google Forms containing sociodemographic, occupational, and clinical questions, and the Symptom Assessment Scale-40-R, for the assessment of psychopathological symptoms. Differences between mean scores for the severity of psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Mann-Whitney and Kruskall-Wallis tests. <b>Results:</b> There was a significant difference in the psychoticism domain scores according to Brazilian geographic region, with greater severity among professionals from the North and Northeast regions when compared with those from the South region. Social context variables (gender, age group, and marital status) and clinical variables (psychological and psychiatric follow-up; psychological or emotional support by the institution; family member, friend, neighbor, or co-worker with COVID-19, and death among them; use of psychiatric medication without a medical prescription; and taking steps to take care of their mental health) were significantly related to psychopathological symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results point to the importance of mental health promotion strategies for professionals through psychological or emotional support, as evidence indicates that this support can be a predictor of reduced psychological distress.","NÃƒÂ³brega, Kogien, Marcon, de Souza GonÃƒÂ§alves, Bittencourt, Pena, Silva, Santos Junior, Mendes, Moreira, da Silva Chaves, Alves, da Silva Lins, Alves","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710766","20220909","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37444,""
"A Social Return on Investment Evaluation of the Pilot Social Prescribing EmotionMind Dynamic Coaching Programme to Improve Mental Wellbeing and Self-Confidence","The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to longer waiting lists for people seeking to access mental health services. The NHS Five Year Forward View encourages the development of empowerment-based social prescribing interventions to supplement existing mental health programmes. Based in South Wales, EmotionMind Dynamic (EMD) is a lifestyle coaching programme that supports individuals suffering from anxiety or depression. In this evaluation of lifestyle coaching, a mixed-method social return on investment (SROI) methodology was used to value quantitative and qualitative data from face-to-face and online participants. Data collection took place between June 2021 and January 2022. Participants included both self-referred clients and those referred from health services. Mental wellbeing data were collected at baseline and at the end of the programme using the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Baseline and follow-up data were available for 15 face-to-face participants and 17 online clients. Wellbeing valuation quantified and valued outcomes from participants. Results indicated that for every GBP 1 invested, lifestyle coaching generated social values ranging from GBP 4.12-GBP 7.08 for face-to-face clients compared with GBP 2.37-GBP 3.35 for online participants. Overall, lifestyle coaching generated positive social value ratios for both face-to-face and online clients.","Makanjuola, Lynch, Hartfiel, Cuthbert, Wheeler, Edwards","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710658","20220909","lifestyle coaching; mental health; social costÃ¢â‚¬â€œbenefit analysis; social prescribing; social return on investment (SROI); wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37445,""
"How Did the COVID-19 Pandemic Affect Population Mobility in Taiwan?","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impairs the free movement of human beings. The study aims to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected population mobility. The study obtained Google COVID-19 population mobility report and e Taiwan COVID-19 pandemic information from Our World in Data. During the Alpha wave, transit decreased the most, with an average difference of &amp;gt;50%, followed by parks, workplaces, groceries, and pharmacies. During the Omicron wave, the average population flow in parks and transit decreased by about 20%. During the pre-existing wave, the average population visits of transit decreased by 10% at the most, followed by parks and workplaces. The peak of daily new confirmed cases per million (7-day rolling average) was 25.02, 6.39, and 0.81 for Alpha, Omicron, and the pre-existing wave, respectively. Daily new confirmed cases per million people correlated with the change in population visits of various places (all <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). The reproduction rate (7-day rolling average) correlated with the change of population visits of most places, except retail and recreation. We conclude the Alpha variant affected more individuals than Omicron and pre-existing type. Furthermore, changes in population visits in transit were most impacted. This change was consistent with daily new confirmed cases per million people and reproduction rate (7-day rolling average). The Alpha variant affected more individuals than the Omicron and pre-existing types. Furthermore, changes in population visits in transit locations were most impacted. This change was consistent with the daily new number of confirmed cases per million people and the 7-day rolling average reproduction rate.","Liu, Chang, Liu, Kuo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710559","20220909","Alpha; COVID-19; Omicron; Taiwan; pandemic; population mobility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-11","",37446,""
