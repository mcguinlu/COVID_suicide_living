"Telepsychiatry: What clinicians need to know about digital mental healthcare","SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly accelerated the use of online and remote mental healthcare provision. The immediate need to transform services has not allowed for thorough examination of the literature supporting remote delivery of psychiatric care. In this article we review the history of telepsychiatry, the rationale for continuing to offer services remotely and the limitations of psychiatry without in-person care. Focusing on randomised controlled trials we find that evidence for the efficacy of remotely delivered psychiatric care compared with in-person treatment is of low quality and limited scope but does not demonstrate clear superiority of one care delivery method over the other.

"Addressing leadership communication, parenting demands and mental health challenges: a mixed-methods case study of clinical and translational scientists during COVID-19","BackgroundIn March 2020, academic research centres in Colorado were closed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Scientists and research staff were required to continue their work remotely with little time to prepare for the transition.MethodsThis survey study used an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to explore clinical and translational researcher and staff experiences of the transition to remote work during the first 6 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants indicated the level of interference with their research and shared their experiences of remote work, how they were impacted, how they were adapting and coping, and any short-term or long-term concerns.ResultsMost participants indicated that remote work interfered with their research to a moderate or great degree. Participant stories illuminated the differences of remote work prior to and during COVID-19. They described both challenges and silver linings. Three themes that highlight the challenges of transitioning to remote work during a pandemic were: (1) Leadership communication: â€˜Leadership needs to revisit their communication strategyâ€™;(2) Parenting demands: Parents are â€˜multitasked to deathâ€™ every day and (3) Mental health challenges: The COVID-19 experience is â€˜psychologically taxingâ€™.ConclusionsThe study findings can be used to guide leaders in building community, resiliency and support productivity during current and future crises. Potential approaches to address these issues are proposed.","Leonard, Chelsea, Connelly, Brigid, Kwan, Bethany, Albright, Karen, Gilmartin, Heather","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2021-000523","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Leader;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35877,""
"Changes in depression levels for US rural communities before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic","The objective of this research is to identify whether there were statistically significant changes in depression severity for rural residents in the United States before the COVID-19 pandemic and after its start in 2020. This study uses paired-sample t tests to differentiate between depression levels, measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, before the pandemic and after its start for a sample of rural residents (n = 324), as well as a subsample of women (n = 224) and Black clients (n = 55). Results indicate that the average Patient Health Questionnaire-9 decreased from 11.86 to 11.77 for the total sample and from 12 to 11.99 for the subsample of women, whereas the subsample of Black residents increased from 10.58 to 11.27 for prepandemic versus postpandemic levels, though the differences are not statistically significant. Given the urban/rural differences in coping with challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States cannot have a one-size-fits-all pandemic response policy.

"Responding to individuals and communities after disasters and other traumatic events: An introduction","Public service psychologists are often at the forefront of responding to communities affected by disasters, violence, and other traumatic events. Through prevention efforts, risk management and treatment response interventions practiced in prisons, military installations, law enforcement, Veterans Affairs (VA) centers, state hospitals, and schools, public service psychologists offer care to those impacted. This introduction provides an overview of articles culled from a call for papers focusing on theoretical and empirical explorations of organized responses to traumatic events. The thirteen papers presented here are organized into two sections of articles illustrating two broad groupings of response-those that are immediate and those produced through a lengthier evaluation process. Public sector psychologists are an innovative and nimble workforce who can immediately meet urgent service delivery needs. They are also well equipped to perform the lengthier research and evaluation tasks that can be used to benefit service delivery responses during future events. From across these two groupings, an array of papers are presented, from psychological and mental health first aid to other innovative programs that offer an organized response to individuals and communities after traumatic events, including the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The range of interventions offered by public service psychologists to individuals and communities in an increasing number of traumatic events suggests that the field is pacing itself to meet this growing need.

"Examining the postpartum period through social media: A content and thematic analysis of #postpartum Instagram posts","The postpartum period is a time of great adjustment to women's lifestyle, mental health, body dissatisfaction, sleep, and interpersonal relationships. Postpartum women may use social media in an attempt to gain connection to others, particularly during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although social media can be beneficial for postpartum women, previous research suggests there may also be harmful consequences to social media use. The current study used content analysis to describe attributes of 700 #postpartum Instagram posts. Thematic analysis was also used to uncover underlying themes within the #postpartum posts. Content analysis revealed that #postpartum posts most frequently included content related to exercise. Thematic analysis unveiled four themes within the data: a focus on relationships, a focus on emotions, a focus on parenting, and a focus on the mother's body. Both content and thematic analysis found that postpartum women have difficulty accepting appearance-related bodily changes in the postpartum period. Future research should consider using experimental designs to examine the impact of viewing social media content in the postpartum period. In addition, qualitative designs would be beneficial to help uncover postpartum women's experience of using social media. The current study has implications for increasing media literacy for postpartum women in an attempt to buffer against negative consequences of media use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Posts on Instagram labeled #postpartum mostly include content related to exercise and many posts suggested postpartum women have a strong appearance-related focus on their bodies. These #postpartum posts also suggest postpartum women post on Instagram about their relationships, emotions, and parenting.

"More than just a game: Using Loteria in play therapy with Mexican/Mexican American clients","The therapeutic value of games in therapy has been well-established and is a common practice among clinicians, especially those working with children and families. However, an underlying assumption is that games are universal, without attention to the role of culture. The incorporation of traditional cultural games, such as Loteria, brings the benefits of game play with the addition of cultural sensitivity. Loteria is a traditional Mexican game, similar to Bingo, that is recognizable and accessible within the Mexican/Mexican American community. Mental health disparities among Latinx populations, and Mexican/Mexican Americans specifically, have been well-documented and exacerbated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we will discuss how the game Loteria helps to address the needs of this community, outlining the theoretical underpinnings of the approach, providing a detailed didactic application of the game, as well as presenting a case study to illustrate these components. This is all framed within the context of the pandemic, attending to both in-person and virtual applications.

"Lonely for touch? A narrative review on the role of touch in loneliness","Loneliness is an increasingly ubiquitous topic in academic, policy, and healthcare domains. This work typically focuses on its negative physical and mental health consequences, generally employing a singular cognitive definition of loneliness. In doing so, one central aspect of our social world has been neglected in loneliness research and policy: touch. Touch is a fundamental human behaviour and a powerful form of communication which plays a role in physical and psychological wellbeing. This narrative review outlines a conceptual basis upon which to consider the relationship between loneliness and social touch and reviews the available research examining this connection. There are strong indications that these social phenomena can interact in a variety of ways and this review argues that elements of presence, absence, and type of touch may impact upon loneliness experiences. Additionally, this review considers the challenges inherent to researching touch and loneliness, reflecting on their sensitive and subjective nature. The increasing relevance of the touch-loneliness connection is described in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and recommendations are given for research, policy, and practice. This review proposes that touch should be a key topic for investigation in loneliness research and outlines the potentially invaluable role of touch in understanding loneliness.

"Experiences of healthcare workers across the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa (preprint)","Background: Little is known about the experiences and impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (HCWs) particularly in Global South contexts where there are significant resource shortages and disparities between public and private healthcare systems. Objective: As part of a larger study exploring mental health amongst HCWs in this context, we examined the qualitative experiences of HCWs at different points during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. Methods: We used a survey design that included open-ended questions about participantsâ€™ general work and life experiences and their support mechanisms. Our sample included 621 HCWs from various professions and health sectors who completed the survey during the pandemic peaks of waves I, II and III in South Africa. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: We identified three overarching themes in the data, namely stress, adjustment to work during COVID-19, and support experiences and needs. These major themes were generally common across all three survey waves, with some minor differences noted across the waves. An overarching thread of uncertainty seems central to HCWsâ€™ experiences of working during COVID-19, related to pressures in the South African healthcare system that have been aggravated by the pandemic. Conclusions: These findings have the potential to inform the development of contextually relevant approaches to support the mental health needs of HCWs during and after the pandemic. In particular, workplaces need to actively offer psychological support to all HCWs, not just to workers traditionally defined as frontline.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zywt3","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35883,""
"Risk and protective factors for new onset binge eating, low weight, and self-harm symptoms in over 25,000 individuals in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Objective: The disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with poor mental health, including increases in eating disorder and self-harm symptoms. We investigated risk and protective factors for new onset of these symptoms during the pandemic. Method: Data were from the COVID-19 Psychiatry and Neurological Genetics study and the Repeated Assessment of Mental health in Pandemics Study (n = 45,058). Exposures were socio-demographic characteristics, lifetime psychiatric disorder, and COVID-related variables, including SARS-CoV-2 infection/illness with COVID-19. We identified four sub-samples of participants without pre-pandemic experience of our outcomes: binge eating (n = 18,172), low weight (n = 19,148), suicidal and/or self-harm ideation (n = 12,650), and self-harm (n = 20,266). Participants reported on our outcomes at frequent intervals (fortnightly to monthly). We fitted four logistic regression models to identify factors associated with new onset of our outcomes. Results: Within each subsample, new onset was reported by: 16.9% for binge eating, 8.9% for low weight, 26.6% for suicidal and/or self-harm ideation, and 3.3.% for self-harm. Shared risk factors included having a lifetime psychiatric disorder, not being in paid employment, and higher pandemic worry scores. Conversely, infection with SARS-CoV-2/illness with COVID-19 was linked to lower odds of all outcomes. Other factors were associated with one outcome, such as pandemic-related loneliness with suicidal and/or self-harm ideation. Discussion: Overall, we detected shared risk factors that may drive the comorbidity between eating disorders and self-harm. Subgroups of individuals with these risk factors may require more frequent monitoring during future pandemics.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qsbwf","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35884,""
"College, Interrupted: Profiles in First-Year College Students Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic Across One Year (preprint)","First-year college students in the 2019-2020 academic year are at risk of having their mentalhealth, identity work, and college careers derailed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess emerging and evolving impacts of the pandemic on mental health/well-being, identity development, and academic resilience, we collected data from a racially, ethnically, geographically, and economically diverse group of 629 students at 4 universities across the US within weeks of lockdown, and then followed up on these studentsâ€™ self-reported mental health, identity, and academic resilience three times over the following year. Our findings suggest that: 1) studentsâ€™ mental health, identity development, and academic resilience were largely negatively impacted compared to pre-pandemic samples;2) these alterations persisted and, in some cases, worsened as the pandemic wore on;and 3) patterns of change were often worse for students indicating more baseline COVID-related stressors.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ktnr4","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35885,""
"Parentsâ€™ intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 (preprint)","Usually, parents and caregivers are the ones responsible for children's vaccination, their intention to vaccinate children depending on many factors. In a society where almost half of adults have refused to take a jab against COVID-19, it is important to know which factors increase or decrease the odds of a child getting vaccinated. In the present study, we examined parentsâ€™ reasons for/against children vaccination and predictors of this intention. We found that about 30% of parents intended to have their children vaccinated to protect the health of children and their close ones. On the other hand, parents who did not intend to have their children vaccinated were typically afraid of long-term consequences of vaccination and its side effects, with less than one fifth of them being skeptical about vaccination per se. Using logistic regression analyses, we found that a higher willingness to vaccinate was in male, older parents, and those with higher (socio)economic status. Parents with a higher adherence to restrictions, and higher trust in government and authorities were more likely to vaccinate their children. Moreover, parents who had themselves been vaccinated or were more positive towards vaccination in general were much more willing to vaccinate their children. On the contrary, belief in conspiracy theories decreased this intention 10-times. No other variables (e.g., demographic characteristics, mental health indicators, or direct experience with COVID-19) significantly predicted parentsâ€™ intention to vaccinate their children. The study offers several implications related to the complexity of factors which determine hesitant parentsâ€™ intention to vaccinate their children. We aimed to answer questions on how, when, and by whom parents should be approached to improve their awareness on vaccination decisions.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/58pbg","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35886,""

"The Mediating Role of Social Support on the Relationship between Stress and Anxiety with Coping Mechanisms Among University Students in a COVID-19 Mandatory Confined Environment in Malaysia (preprint)","Like the world, university students have been affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, thus leading to mental challenges, including anxiety and stress. This study aims to determine the mediating role of social support in the relationship between stress, anxiety, and students' coping mechanisms during their stay in a COVID-19 mandatory confined environment. The study employed a quantitative exploratory survey design for students of International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). The study employed Anxiety uncertainty management theory to guide its execution. The study comprised 210 students sampled randomly. Results show a positive relationship between stress, anxiety, and social support with coping with students in a COVID-19 mandatory confined environment. Furthermore, social support partially mediated the relationship between anxiety, stress, and students' coping strategies. The findings imply that using social support and the application of various coping mechanisms is likely to reduce anxiety and stress among students in confined settings. Findings from this study will serve as a guiding tool for policy formulation and implementation by the University and the government of Malaysia, in particular on the management of students who reside inside universities during crises and make sure that they minimize the effects of their mental health as a result of anxiety and stress.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1895037/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35888,""
"Supporting Weight Management during COVID-19 (SWiM-C): Twelve-month follow-up of a randomised controlled trial of a web-based, ACT-based, guided self-help intervention (preprint)","Objectives:  We developed a guided self-help intervention (Supporting Weight Management during COVID-19, â€œSWiM-Câ€) to support adults with overweight or obesity in their weight management during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study evaluated the effect of SWiM-C on weight and determinants of weight management over twelve months. Methods: : Participants (=18 years, body-mass-index =25kg/m 2 ) were randomised to the SWiM-C intervention or to a standard advice group. Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline, four months, and twelve months. The primary outcome was change in self-reported weight from baseline to twelve months;secondary outcomes were eating behaviour (uncontrolled eating, emotional eating, cognitive restraint of food intake), experiential avoidance/psychological flexibility, mental health (depression, anxiety, stress), wellbeing and physical activity. Interventions: SWiM-C is based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Participants had access to an online web platform with 12 weekly modules and limited email and telephone contact with a trained, non-specialist coach. Standard advice was a leaflet on managing weight and mood during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: : 388 participants were randomised (SWiM-C: n=192, standard advice: n=196). The baseline-adjusted difference in weight change between SWiM-C and standard advice participants was -0.81kg (95% CI: -2.24 to 0.61kg). SWiM-C participants reported a greater reduction in experiential avoidance (-2.45, 95% CI: -4.75 to -0.15), uncontrolled eating (-3.36, 95% CI: -5.66 to -1.06), and emotional eating (-4.14, 95% CI: -7.25 to -1.02) and an increase in physical activity (8.96, 95% CI: 0.29 to 17.62) compared to standard advice participants. Conclusions: : Whilst the effect of the SWiM-C intervention on weight was inconclusive, SWiM-C improved eating behaviours, psychological flexibility and physical activity. These factors have been previously identified as determinants of successful weight management. Further refinement of the SWiM-C intervention is necessary to ensure meaningful effects on weight prior to implementation in practice.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1886468/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35889,""
"Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms Developed During COVID-19 and Their Impact on the Academic Performance of Egyptian College Students (preprint)","Introduction:  The COVID-19 pandemic has increased levels of anxiety and depression among the public;however, the impact on the faculty of medicine students in Egypt with respect to academic achievement has not been well-documented.

A previously validated questionnaire sheet containing standardized scale for anxiety and depression, named Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) form is used in this study.Results and Conclusion: Among the 396 participants, 28.5% experience symptoms of anxiety, and 35.6% are considered to have developed anxiety disorder. With respect to depressive symptoms, 21.2% are borderline and 38.1% experience actual depressive symptoms. However, there has been no significant association between these mental health issues and academic achievement. Families with sufficient savings and income as well as male students have fallen among the protective factors. High prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety among medical students during COVID 19 pandemic is alarming. Evidently, there is no significant impact on studentsâ€™ academic performance;nevertheless, further studies are required to detect the long-term impact of this pandemic on student performance.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1875405/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35890,""
"Paediatric mental health predictors during COVID-19: Parent- and child-specific vulnerability factors (preprint)","To prevent deterioration of paediatric mental health during a pandemic, it is important to understand the various factors that may impact mental health outcomes. This study examined which vulnerability factors predicted poorer anxiety and depression symptoms in Australian children and youth (aged 4-17 years) during the initial lockdown period (May â€“ August 2020), and whether outcomes varied according to gender or age. A parent-report questionnaire was used to investigate parent-related vulnerability factors including parent mental health, family accommodation behaviours, and COVID-19-related worries, and child-related factors including fears about illness/contamination, fears about social distancing, behaviour modification, and virus impact. Data was analysed using four multiple regression models. Greater parent stress and family accommodation predicted increased child anxiety symptoms, whilst family accommodation predicted increased child depression symptoms. Regarding child-specific vulnerability factors, perceived virus impact predicted increased anxiety and depression symptoms. Greater social-distancing fears predicted depression symptoms, but not anxiety symptoms.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1865955/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35891,""
"Societal movement restrictions and adverse mental health outcomes (preprint)","During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments struggled to find the right balance between re-strictive measures to contain the spread of the virus, and the effects of these measures on peopleâ€™s psychological wellbeing. This paper investigates the relationship between limitations to mobility and mental health for the UK population during the COVID-19 pandemic, using a unique combination of high-frequency mobility data from Google and longitudinal monthly survey data collected during the pandemic. We find a strong and robust correlation between high-frequency mobility data and established low-frequency mental health survey data. We show that increased residential stationarity predicts a mental wellbeing deterioration even when we control for regional COVID-19 prevalence and lockdown stringency. We uncover heterogeneity in this relationship. Particularly high levels of distress are seen in young, healthy people living alone with an active working life. Women also suffer more from mobility restrictions than men, especially if they have young children.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1848170/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35892,""
"Patterns of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Admissions Before and After the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Clinical Study from Istanbul (preprint)","Background:  Very few studies compared the rates of child psychiatry diagnoses between the initial phase of the pandemic and the pre-pandemic records in clinical samples. This study from Istanbul aimed to compare the child and adolescent psychiatric admissions and diagnosis rates between the first three months of the pandemic, the previous three months in the same year and the same months in the previous year. Methods Children and adolescents were grouped according to the admission dates. Group A, between March 11 to June 1 2020;Group B, between January 1st to March 11 2020 and;Group C, between March 11 to June 1 2019. Only clinical interviews and diagnoses according to Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) interview were included. Results The total number of admissions were n = 1052 for group A, n = 5792 for group B and n = 5800 for group C. In the group A;mean age of the sample was 11.21 Â± 3.77 (%33 girls), while the same findings were 10.42 Â± 3.91 (%34 girls) and 10.02 Â± 3.87 (%33 girls) in group B and C, respectively. Regarding the diagnostic groups;Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)/Tic Disorder and Intellectual Disability (ID) diagnoses were found to be higher in group A than group B and C (for ASD, 6.4%, 4.3% and 3.6%;for OCD/Tic Disorder 2.9%, 1.8%, 1.7%;for ID, 3.7%, 2.5%, 2.1%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.001). Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis was higher in group A than only group B (59.8%, 49.7%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.001). Depression was higher in group A than only group C (4.1%, 2.2%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.001). Conduct Disorder (CD) diagnosis was lower in group A than only group B (3.6%, 6.4%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.005). The diagnoses of Adjustment Disorder (AD) and others (psychiatric problems apart from the aforementioned diagnoses) were lower in group A than group B and C (for AD, 0.7%, 3.1%, 3.4%;for others 3.3%, 12.6%, 9.6%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.001). Discussion Child psychiatry diagnosis rates, and related healthcare needs, were found to change significantly during the inital phase of the pandemic period. Children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders appear to be more affected than other diagnostic groups.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1846063/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35893,""
"Anxiety and depression status prior to radioactive iodine therapy among differentiated thyroid cancer patients during the COVID-19 epidemic (preprint)","Objection: The psychological health of thyroid cancer patients cannot be ignored, however, few studies have been conducted on the psychological status and influencing factors of thyroid cancer patients before radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of anxiety and depression in thyroid cancer patients prior to RAI therapy. Methods: : Clinical data were collected among differentiated thyroid cancer patients (DTCs) preparing for RAI therapy. Anxiety and depression were measured before RAI therapy by using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). We used chi-square test and logistic regression analysis to find independent risk factors for anxiety and depression. Results: : A total of 112 patients with thyroid cancer were included. Of these, 72.32 % (n=81) were female, with an mean age of 41.50 years. Anxiety and depression were reported by 46 (41.08%) and 38 (33.93%) patients, respectively. Based on chi-square test and univariate logistic regression analysis, being female and having ever-experienced RAI therapy were independent risk factors for anxiety and depression among DTCs prior to RAI therapy. On multivariate analysis, only being female was significant associated with anxiety and depression in these patients. Conclusions: : Incidence of anxiety and depression increased in DTCs prior to RAI therapy. Being female and ever-experienced RAI therapy significant influenced anxiety and depression. Based on these findings, anxiety and depression assessment should be an important part of pre-RAI therapy in DTCs, and appropriate psychological nursing intervention can be carried out for key patients.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1841252/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35894,""
"Factors Influencing COVID-19 Health Protective Behaviours in Zambian University Students with Symptoms of Low Mood (preprint)","Background:  Health protective behaviours are crucial in the prevention of the spread of COVID-19, particularly in university students who typically live and study in large groups. Depression and anxiety are common in students and can impact young peopleâ€™s motivations to follow health advice. The study aims to assess the relationship between mental health and COVID-19 health-protective behaviours in Zambian university students with symptoms of low mood. Methods The study was a cross-sectional, online survey of Zambian university students. Invitation emails were sent explaining the study aims and directed students who self-identified as having low moods in the past two weeks to an online survey. Measures included COVID-19 preventive behaviours, COVID-19-related self-efficacy and Hospital and Anxiety Depression scale. Results A total of 620 students (n = 308 female, n = 306 male) participated in the study, with a mean participant age of 22.47 Â± 3.29 years (range 18â€“51). Students reported a mean protective behaviour score of 74.09/105 and only 168 (27%) said they would accept vaccination against COVID-19, with male students being twice as likely to be willing to accept COVID-19 vaccination (p &lt; 0.001). Over half the students (54%) scored above the threshold for depression and nearly three-quarters (74%) scored above the threshold for possible anxiety disorder. Three-way ANOVA showed lower COVID-19 protective behaviours in students scoring above the threshold for anxiety (p = .024) and those with low self-efficacy (p &lt; 0.001). Gender was non-significant. Conclusion Students who self-identify as having symptoms of depression have high levels of anxiety. The results suggest that interventions to reduce anxiety and promote self-efficacy might enhance studentsâ€™ COVID-19 protective behaviours. Further qualitative research is needed to understand the high rates of vaccine hesitancy in this population.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1840402/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35895,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal mental health, early childhood development, and parental practices: a global scoping review (preprint)","Background:  In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), generating stark economic and social repercussions that directly or indirectly affected familiesâ€™ wellbeing and health status. Aims: : This review aims at mapping the existing evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal mental health, early childhood development, and parental practices, worldwide, to identify evidence gaps and better inform future delivery of care and health policy measures. Methods: : Following the protocol defined by PRISMA-ScR, this systematic review has searched for relevant studies published between January 2020 and June 2021, selecting evidence sources based on pre-established criteria. From a total of 2,308 articles, data were extracted from 537 publications from 35 countries on all three health domains. Results: : The combined stressors brought forth by the pandemic have exerted a heavy burden on the mental health of mothers and the development of young children, partly mediated by its impact on parental practices. Conclusions: : Despite remaining gaps, we have identified sufficient evidence pointing to an urgent need for more concerted global research efforts and rapid policy responses to timely address severe and pervasive negative impacts to the mental health of mothers and children at a key developmental stage.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1787279/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35896,""
"A Self-Monitoring Wellbeing Screening Methodology for Keyworkers, â€˜My Personal Wellbeingâ€™, using an Integrative Wellbeing Model (preprint)","Background:  The detrimental impact of Covid-19 has led to an urgent need to support the wellbeing of UK National Health Service and care workers. This research develop an online diary to support the wellbeing of staff in public healthcare in real-time, allowing the exploration of population wellbeing and pro-active responses to issues identified. Methods:  The diary was co-produced by NHS and care stakeholders and university researchers. It was based on an integrative model of mental health and wellbeing. Diary users were encouraged to reflect on their experience confidentially, empowering them to monitor their wellbeing. The data collected was analysed using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis statistical tests to determine any significant wellbeing trends and issues. Results:  A statistically significant decline in wellbeing ( P &lt;2.2E-16), and a significant increase in symptoms ( P =1.2E-14) was observed. For example, indicators of post-traumatic stress, including, flashbacks, dissociation, and bodily symptoms (Kruskal-Wallis P =0.00081, 0.0083, and 0.027, respectively) became significantly worse and users reported issues with sleeping (51%), levels of alertness (46%), and burnout (41%). Conclusions:  The wellbeing diary demonstrated the value of population-based wellbeing data driven by an integrative model of wellbeing. It successfully demonstrated the capability to distinguish trends and wellbeing problems. Thus, informing how staff wellbeing services can determine and respond to need with timely interventions. The results particularly emphasised the pressing need for interventions that help staff with burnout, self-compassion, and flashbacks.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1766314/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35897,""
"The potential of the GHQ-12 questionnaire in assessing psychological impairment on a health-care workers population facing Covid-19: an item response theory-based analysis (preprint)","Background:  The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) is a widely used tool, both in clinical and research settings, due to its brevity and easy administration. Researchers often adopt a dichotomous measurement method, considering a total score above or below a certain threshold. This leads to an extreme simplification of the gathered data and therefore to the loss of clinical details.In a multi-step evaluation study aimed at assessing health care workersâ€™ mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic, the GHQ-12 proved to be the most effective tool to detect psychological distress compared to other scales adopted. These results led to deepening the understanding of the GHQ-12 properties through a statistical study, by focusing on itemsâ€™ properties and characteristics. Methods:  GHQ-12 responses were analyzed using Item Response Theory (IRT), a suitable method for scale assessment. Instead of considering the single overall score, in which each item accounts equally, it focuses on individual itemsâ€™ characteristics. Moreover, IRT models were applied combined with the latent class (LC) analysis, aiming to the determination of subgroups of individuals according to their level of psychological distress. Results:  GHQ-12 was administered to 990 health-care workers and responses were scored using the binary method (0-0-1-1). We applied the 2-PL (two-parameters logistic) model, finding that the items showed different ways of responses and features. The latent class analysis classified subjects into three sub-groups according to their responses to the GHQ-12 only: 47% of individuals with general well-being, 38% expressing signs of discomfort without severity and 15% of subjects with a high level of impairment. Such a result almost reproduces subjectsâ€™ classification obtained after administering the six questionnaires of the study protocol. Conclusions:  Accurate statistical techniques and a deep understanding of the latent factors underlying the GHQ-12 resulted in a more effective usage of such psychometric questionnaire â€“ i.e. a more refined gathering of data and a significant time and resource efficiency.We underlined the need to maximize the extraction of data from questionnaires and the necessity of them being less lengthy and repetitive.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1699132/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35898,""
"A mental health-informed, online health promotion program targeting physical activity and healthy eating for adults aged 60+ years: study protocol for the MovingTogether randomised controlled trial (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing regulations have led to an increased risk of social isolation and physical inactivity, particularly among older adults. The benefits of physical activity for reducing fall risk and improving mood and mental functioning have been well documented. The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of the MovingTogether program on psychological distress (primary outcome) and physical activity, social capital, cognition, concern about falling, loneliness, physical functioning, quality of life and physical activity enjoyment (secondary outcomes). Methods A randomised controlled trial with a waitlist control will be conducted, recruiting 80 adults aged 60 + years with access to Facebook and a computer or tablet and not currently meeting the aerobic physical activity guidelines. Randomisation will be completed using REDCap. The intervention group (n = 40) will join a private Facebook group where allied health facilitators will provide targeted healthy lifestyle education throughout the 10-week program with weekly telehealth group calls. Intervention participants will also be provided access to tailored strength and aerobic exercise guidance and an evidence-based eHealth balance exercise program. Psychological distress and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 11 weeks (post intervention) and 16 weeks (one month follow-up). Linear mixed models will be applied for each outcome measure as per an intention-to-treat approach to determine between group differences. Secondary analyses are planned in people with greater adherence and those with higher psychological distress. Discussion COVID-19 has highlighted the need for a scalable, effective, and novel methods to improve and protect the health of older adults. The integration of an evidence-based falls prevention program with a mental health-informed online health promotion program may help to improve mental and physical health outcomes among older adults.

"The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Disordered Eating Behaviors in a Community Sample: The Mediation Role of Psychological Distress (preprint)","Objective: This study aims to explore associations between disordered eating behaviors in adults during the COVID-19 lockdown period, and the experienced psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, depressive symptomatology, anxiety/stress levels. Methods: This was a community-based cross-sectional study assessing 254 Portuguese adults (82.7% women;35.82 Â±11.82 years) one week after the end of the mandatory COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. An online survey was conducted to evaluate psychological distress, disordered eating, and psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pearson correlations and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were performed. Results: Participants reported the presence of meal skipping (52.8%), grazing eating behavior (80.9%), overeating (81.0%), loss of control over eating (47.2%), and binge eating episodes (39.2%) during lockdown. Uncontrolled and emotional eating were significantly correlated with the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic, depression, anxiety, and stress levels. SEM analyses indicated that the relationship between experienced psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors was mediated through psychological distress experienced (CMIN/DF= 1.499, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .045). Conclusions: The psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis may lead to disordered eating, and this relation may occur through the elevation of psychological distress. These findings inform about clinical targets for preventive interventions to promote disordered eating in a community sample during potential similar future situations","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-98867/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35900,""
"A prospective, longitudinal, case-control study protocol to evaluate the neurodevelopment of children from birth to adolescence exposed to COVID-19 in utero (preprint)","Background:  The COVID 19 pandemic has created unprecedented acute global health challenges. However, it also presents a set of unquantified and poorly understood risks in the medium to long term, specifically, risks to children whose mothers were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus during pregnancy. Methods: We have designed a prospective, case-controlled study to investigate the long-term impacts of SARS-CoV2 exposure on children exposed in utero. Women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy will be recruited from Monash Health, the Royal Womenâ€™s Hospital and Western Health (Melbourne, Australia) and Londrina Municipal Maternity Hospital Lucilla Ballalai and PUCPR Medical Clinical (Londrina, Brazil). A control group in a 2:1 ratio (2 non-exposed: 1 exposed mother infant dyad) comprising women who gave birth in the same month of delivery, are of similar age but did not contract SARS-CoV-2 during their pregnancy will also be recruited. We aim to recruit 150 exposed and 300 non-exposed mother-infant dyads. Clinical and socio-demographic data will be collected directly from the mother and medical records. Biospecimens and clinical and epidemiological data will be collected from the mothers and offspring at multiple time points from birth through to 15 years of age using standardised sample collection, and neurological and behavioural measures. Discussion: The mapped neurodevelopmental trajectories and comparisons between SARS-CoV2 exposed and control children will indicate the potential for an increase in atypical neurodevelopment. This has significant implications for strategic planning in the mental health and paediatrics sectors and long-term monitoring of children globally.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.pex-1980/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35901,""
"Experiences Shared by the (Future) Public Health Workforce during the COVD-19 Pandemic in Germany: Results of A Survey on Workload, Work Content, and Related Challenges among Students and Young Professionals (preprint)","Although previous studies have focused on the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on various professional groups (particularly in the health and nursing care sector), this study aims to close a research gap by assessing perspectives of students and young professionals in epidemiology and public health in Germany in terms of shifts in workload, work content, and related challenges caused by the pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional survey between mid-February and mid-March 2022. Quantitative data were analyzed via standardized mean differences. Qualitative data based on answers to open-ended questions were analyzed via a qualitative content analysis. Overall, 172 individuals participated in this survey. Results indicate that students felt burdened the most by lack of exchange with other students and lecturers. Study participants employed in public health experienced changes in their employment, because they had changes in their work content- and administration-wise, which was accompanied with a high burden due to the workload. Multiple demands that can have an impact on both acquired skills and mental health during the professional qualification phase were mentioned by the participants. Therefore, more in-depth analyses are needed for investigating the impact the pandemic will have on the (future) public health workforce in the long run.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202208.0035.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35902,""
"Patient satisfaction with mental and physical health services: Findings from a UK-wide online survey (preprint)","Introduction:  - Despite extensive debate surrounding mental health services in the UK, there is little empirical evidence regarding the views of those who use them. We therefore used data collected as part of a wider survey to examine satisfaction amongst those seeking treatment from mental and physical health services. Methods:  â€“ An online survey designed with input from people with experience of mental illness was used to measure satisfaction with NHS mental and physical health services at first contact and in the previous 12 months. Results:  â€“ A total of 2187 people responded. During the 12 months prior to the survey, 526 respondents had sought mental health care and 1379 had sought physical health care. Participants were significantly more satisfied with their most recent contact with mental health services (48.1% very/satisfied) than with their first contact (38.2% very/satisfied). More than 1 in 10 respondents who sought mental health care (11.4%) stated that they received no treatment/support from the NHS, compared to approximately 1 in 20 respondents who sought physical health care (4.6%). Of those who received the mental health treatment they requested (n = 424), most were satisfied or very satisfied with their care (54.7%), although this was lower than the corresponding figure (77.9%) for satisfaction with physical health care received (n = 1190). Conclusion:  â€“There was evidence that mental health services are satisfactory for a slim majority of users, but people were generally more satisfied with NHS physical health care. This survey was conducted in the year prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Future research could examine what influences satisfaction with care and whether this picture has changed following the emergence of the pandemic and consequent impact on health service delivery and daily life.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17973.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35903,""
"Yoga to improve maternal mental health and immune function during the COVID-19 crisis (Yoga-M2 trial): study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial (preprint)","Background:  Mental health of women is adversely affected during pregnancy. Stress and depression during pregnancy negatively impact birthweight and neuro-cognitive development of the fetus. The current crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic further adds to the stressful situation. Yoga practiced during pregnancy has beneficial effects on improving stress and depression and preliminary evidence suggests that yoga-based interventions can improve immunity. This study aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a Yoga -based intervention for maternal M ental health and i M munity (Yoga-M 2 ) in a rural community in India.Â  Â Â  Methods: : The study design will be a single-blind individual randomized parallel group-controlled pilot trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Adult pregnant women, with gestational age between 12â€“24 weeks will be randomly allocated to either the Yoga-M 2 group or the Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) group. Participants in the Yoga-M 2 arm will attend weekly group yoga sessions for 12 weeks and will be encouraged to practice yoga at home. In the EUC arm, participants will receive a single session of health education. Eligibility of the participants, recruitment, retention-in-care, and study completion rates will be estimated and feasibility of delivering Yoga-M 2 and acceptability of this intervention by the participants will be assessed. Change in the scores of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), EuroQoL 5 Dimensions Score (EQ-5D-5L), Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Severity Scale (WURSS-21), and serum C-Reactive Protein at three-months from baseline will be used to assess preliminary efficacy. Discussion:  The key outputs of this trial will be a structured intervention manual and evidence about the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention,Â establishing the foundation to undertake an explanatory randomized controlled trial to assess efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Yoga-M 2 intervention.Â  Trial registration: CTRI/2022/01/039701 .

"The impact of COVID-19-related educational disruption on final year medical students in Birmingham, United Kingdom: a mixed methods study (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems worldwide. Public health measures that intended to limit the spread of the virus had the unintended effect of necessitating the swift development of novel medical educational methods. The medical students most affected by this period of change were those entering their final year. This study aims to explore their perceptions of the impacts of COVID-19 on their clinical learning and mental health, as well as identify ways in which medical schools can mitigate these impacts.Â  Methods: This is a mixed method, single-site descriptive study comprising two parts: a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Participants were final year medical students at the University of Birmingham, UK.Â  Results: Key themes identified were learning opportunities, changes to assessments, communication, and wellbeing. Students were also found to experience higher levels of anxiety mid-pandemic compared to pre-pandemic.Â  Conclusion: The pandemic has had widespread effects on the learning and wellbeing of final year medical students, which may impact their competence and confidence as junior doctors. Improved two-way communication and access to wellbeing services have been identified as factors promoting the adjustment of students to rapid changes in teaching methods and assessments.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/mep.19059.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35905,""
"Effects of vaccination against COVID-19 on the emotional health of older adults (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the mental and emotional health of the elderly, especially those from low to middle-income countries. However, COVID-19 vaccination may reduce this influence. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the effect of vaccination against COVID-19 on the emotional health of older adults. Methods: : We selected a national, random, and stratified sample of non-hospitalized adults aged 60 to 79 years from Peru who intended to receive or had already received the COVID-19 vaccine during recruitment. During June and July 2021, the assessed outcomes were the fear, anxiety, and worry about COVID-19, general anxiety, and depression at baseline and after a month. We estimated the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each altered emotional health outcomes in those who had one and two doses, compared with those who were not vaccinated using multilevel logistic regression with mixed effects. Results: : We recruited 861 older adults with 20.8% of loss to follow-up. At baseline, 43.9% had received only one dose of the vaccine, and 49.1% had two doses. In the analysis during follow-up, those who had two doses had less fear (aOR: 0.19;CI 95%: 0.07 to 0.51) and anxiety to COVID-19 (aOR: 0.45;CI 95%: 0.22 to 0.89), compared to unvaccinated. We observed no effects in those with only one dose. Conclusions: : Two doses of COVID-19 vaccination in older adults improves their perception of COVID-19 infection consequences. This information could be integrated into the vaccination campaign as an additional beneficial effect.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.123395.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35906,""
"Higher Perceived Stress during the COVID-19 pandemic increased Menstrual Dysregulation and Menopause Symptoms (preprint)","Purpose:  The increased stress the globe has experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health, disproportionately affecting women. However, how perceived stress in the first year affected menstrual and menopausal symptoms has not yet been investigated. Methods Residents in British Columbia, Canada, were surveyed online as part of the COVID-19 Rapid Evidence Study of a Provincial Population-Based Cohort for Gender and Sex (RESPPONSE). A subgroup (n=4171) who were assigned female sex at birth (age 25-69) and were surveyed within the first 6-12 months of the pandemic (August 2020-February 2021), prior to the widespread rollout of vaccines, were retrospectively asked if they noticed changes in their menstrual or menopausal symptoms, as well as completing validated measures of stress, depression, and anxiety. Results We found that 27.8% reported menstrual cycle disturbances and 6.7% reported increased menopause symptoms. Those who scored higher on perceived stress, depression, and anxiety scales were more likely to have reproductive cycle disturbances. Free text responses revealed that reasons for disturbances were perceived to be related to the pandemic. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to research womens health issues, such as menstruation. Our data indicates that in the first year of the pandemic, almost a third of the menstruating population reported disturbances in their cycle, which is approximately two times higher than in non-pandemic situations and four times higher than any reported changes in menopausal symptoms across that first year of the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.30.22278213","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35907,""
"The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health in Low and Middle Income Countries (preprint)","We track the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in eight Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and South America utilizing repeated surveys of 21,162 individuals. Many respondents were interviewed over multiple rounds pre- and post-pandemic, allowing us to control for time trends and within-year seasonal variation in mental health. We demonstrate how mental health fluctuates with agricultural crop cycles, deteriorating during pre-harvest ""lean""Â periods. Ignoring this seasonal variation leads to unreliable inferences about the effects of the pandemic. Controlling for seasonality, we document a large, significant, negative impact of the pandemic on mental health, especially during the early months of lockdown.Â  In a random effects aggregation across samples, depression symptoms increased by around 0.3 standard deviations in the four months following the onset of the pandemic. The pandemic could leave a lasting legacy of depression. Absent policy interventions, this could have adverse long-term consequences, particularly in settings with limited mental health support services, which is characteristic of many LMICs.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.29.22278182","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35908,""

"COVID-19, Workplace Mental Health, and the ADA 'Regarded As' Prong: A Hypothetical Case Study (preprint)","This Article explores mental health coverage under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act's â€œregarded asâ€ prong, using a hypothetical case study involving a virtual team environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research suggests that during the pandemic, employer awareness surrounding the mental health needs of their workforces has increased. Mental health factors relating to the pandemic include: Social isolation from in-home sheltering, increased health anxiety, increased substance abuse, trauma or grief from losing loved ones, strain from new responsibilities related to family, financial, self-care, and more. Greater employer awareness about employee mental health and wellness may generally be considered a positive development. However, this added vigilance may also give rise to novel considerations concerning the ways that employers interpret and respond to anomalous employee behavior and conduct, interactions with co-workers, and performance issues. This might be especially true where employers rapidly adopted virtual or hybrid work arrangements and performance management procedures in the wake of the pandemic. This Article situates some of these nuances and legal pitfalls within the context of a hypothetical virtual workforce team and the performance management settings during the pandemic, wherein the strain on American workersâ€™ mental wellness was particularly acute.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19,+Workplace+Mental+Health,+and+the+ADA+'Regarded+As'+Prong:+A+Hypothetical+Case+Study+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35910,""
"Predictive Effect of Extraversion and Neuroticism on Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Hong Kong: The Mediating Effect of Coping Strategies (preprint)","The present study investigated the predictive effect of neuroticism and extraversion on mental health among the Hongkongers during the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic (from May 28 till September 26, 2020), with coping style as a potential mediator. Particularly, a mediation model between personality traits of extraversion and neuroticism, coping strategies and mental health was constructed within the framework of the personality-coping-outcome theory. A sample of 170 participants completed an online questionnaire containing preliminary demographic questions, Coping Strategy Indicator, General Health Questionnaire, and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Brief Version. Results of the mediation analysis indicate that neuroticism can directly affect the psychological well-being of Hongkongers during the pandemic, and have indirect effect (with an effect size of 28.45%) on individual mental health through the mediation of the coping strategy â€œavoidanceâ€. The other two coping strategies, namely â€œproblem solvingâ€ and â€œseeking social supportâ€, do not play any role in the mediation process.

"A Protocol to Assess Adult Outcomes at 30 Years Following Preterm Birth","Among the most intense adversity experiences for infants is premature birth. Early birth marks the beginning of a life course that broadly affects families, health care, education, social systems, and the survivors themselves. For many, the transition to adulthood is challenging and often hampered by cognitive, physical and mental health, and motor and independence difficulties. To share a comprehensive protocol of a 10th follow-up study of premature infants in their 30s. The protocol accounts for stress during the neonatal period, the cumulative context (risk, protection) of development, biological and epigenetic mechanisms, and individual resilience. The prospective 5-group longitudinal design includes 215 term-born and preterm-born individuals with various neonatal morbidities at ages 30-35. Adult outcomes include health, adaptive, executive, and work and social competence. Novel measures are four system indicators of allostatic load (AL) and epigenetics. Contextual measures include socioeconomic risk and individual resilience. All measures were selected based on coherence with constructs of the scientific aims, strong psychometrics, continuity for repeated measures, and minimal subject burden. Objective assessments include body composition imaging, exercise testing, blood and saliva collection, and actigraphy. The 2-phase protocol takes approximately 8 hr. After an 11-month COVID-19 pause, participant response has been strong. As of May 2022, 75 participants have completed the full protocol, and 99 have consented to participate. When socioeconomic risk is controlled, we hypothesize that life course trajectories in physical and psychological health, adaptive function, and executive function will differ between term and preterm neonatal morbidity groups. AL will vary across groups and contribute to outcomes. We expect proximal protection and resilience to mediate the cumulative medical and socioeconomic risk and AL. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation, with estimates of age acceleration, will be examined across groups and explored in longitudinal associations with medical risk, socioeconomic status, and protection. To our knowledge, this is the only U.S. study of premature infants aged 30-35 years. With millions of preterm-born individuals reaching adulthood, the protocol incorporates molecular and genetic biomarkers in a life course developmental examination to inform the timing and content of interventions.","Sullivan, D'Agata, Stanley, Brewer, Kelly","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNR.0000000000000612","20220810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35913,""
"Economic and mental health impacts of multiple adverse events: Hurricane Harvey, other flooding events, and the COVID-19 pandemic","To assess the economic and mental health impacts of COVID-19 in the presence of previous exposure to flooding events. Starting in April 2018, the Texas Flood Registry (TFR) invited residents to complete an online survey regarding their experiences with Hurricane Harvey and subsequent flooding events. Starting in April 2020, participants nationwide were invited to complete a brief online survey on their experiences during the pandemic. This study includes participants in the TFR (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯20,754) and the COVID-19 Registry (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯8568) through October 2020 (joint NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2929). Logistic regression and generalized estimating equations were used to examine the relationship between exposure to flooding events and the economic and mental health impacts of COVID-19. Among COVID-19 registrants, 21% experienced moderate to severe anxiety during the pandemic, and 7% and 12% of households had difficulty paying rent and bills, respectively. Approximately 17% of Black and 15% of Hispanic households had difficulty paying rent, compared to 5% of non-Hispanic white households. The odds of COVID-19 income loss are 1.20 (1.02, 1.40) times higher for those who previously had storm-related home damage compared to those who did not and 3.84 (3.25-4.55) times higher for those who experienced Harvey income loss compared to those who did not. For registrants for whom Harvey was a severe impact event, the odds of having more severe anxiety during the pandemic are 5.14 (4.02, 6.58) times higher than among registrants for whom Harvey was a no meaningful impact event.

"Strengthening the Resilience of Children and Adolescents during a Pandemic: A Scoping Review on Eligible Interventions","The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically affects children's and adolescents' mental health. The accumulation of stress factors and a lack of social support complicate a healthy development. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been almost a doubling of mental health problems in children and adolescents. Promoting resilience is a possible approach to reduce the incidence of mental health problems despite these adverse circumstances. This literature search aims at identifying and evaluating interventions to promote resilience mechanisms, with a special focus on feasibility in a crisis situation. This scoping review is based on a systematic literature search including the databases Cochrane Library, PubMed, Psyc-Info, Psyndex and Google Scholar (2006-2020). Of 1733 identified articles 75 were included. Out of 72 identified intervention studies 28% were feasible under pandemic conditions. The most effective resilience trainings seem to be individualized interventions using cognitive behavioral therapy elements. However, many approaches primarily show short-term success. Few evidence-based programs are feasible online or under pandemic restrictions. Most of them show short-term effects and focus on parents and individuals. Multiple programs are ready for use, but still lack proof of efficacy. The development and improvement of (digital) resilience interventions should be an essential part of preventive health care, especially for risk groups. Die COVID-19-Pandemie beeinflusst die mentale Gesundheit von Kindern und Jugendlichen auf dramatische Weise. Durch eine Akkumulation von Belastungsfaktoren und das Wegfallen sozialer UnterstÃƒÂ¼tzung ist eine regelrechte Entwicklung erschwert. Seit Beginn der Pandemie kam es nahezu zu einer Verdopplung der psychischen AuffÃƒÂ¤lligkeiten. Die FÃƒÂ¶rderung der Resilienz kann ein Ansatz sein, das Auftreten von psychischen AuffÃƒÂ¤lligkeiten trotz dieser widrigen UmstÃƒÂ¤nde zu vermindern. Ziel dieser Literaturrecherche ist die Identifikation und Bewertung von Interventionen zur FÃƒÂ¶rderung von Resilienzmechanismen, mit Fokus auf die DurchfÃƒÂ¼hrbarkeit unter Krisenbedingungen. Dieses Scoping Review basiert auf einer systematischen Literaturrecherche der Datenbanken Cochrane Library, PubMed, Psyc-Info, Psyndex sowie Google Scholar (2006-2021). Von der insgesamt 1733 Artikel umfassenden Suche wurden 75 Artikel eingeschlossen. Von 72 identifizierten Interventionsstudien sind 28% unter Pandemiebedingungen durchfÃƒÂ¼hrbar.

"Fake news in the age of COVID-19: evolutional and psychobiological considerations","The COVID-19 outbreak has been accompanied by a massive infodemic: an overabundance of information, some accurate and some not. At this pandemic we have seen a large scale of fake news and misinformation, leading to anti-vaccine, anti-mask, and anti-5G protests.1 Fake news is intentionally misleading and deceptive news that is written and published with the intent to damage an entity or a person. They may contain false, misleading, imposter, manipulated or fabricated content. Much of the discourse on fake news conflates three notions, named ""information disorders"": (a) Misinformation: false information someone shares without knowing it's untrue, (b) Disinformation: false information that's shared with the intention to harm or mislead, and (c) Malinformation: true information that's used to harm others.2 False beliefs generally arise through the same mechanisms that establish accurate beliefs. People appear to encode all new information as if it were true and later tag the information as being either true or false. Different cognitive, social and affective factors lead people to form or endorse misinformed views. The emotional content of the information shared also affects false-belief formation. An angry mood can boost misinformation sharing, while social exclusion, which is likely to induce a negative mood, can increase susceptibility to conspiratorial content.3 As shown by the Illusory Truth Effect, repeated exposure to an article, whether real or fake, increases people's perceptions of its accuracy. In social media, falsehood seems to diffuse significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects are more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, and science. Moreover, although prior knowledge of a statement leads people to confirm the statement the next time, they see it (confirmation bias), novelty facilitates decision making since it updates our understanding of the world.4 The fitness value of accurate information seems so obvious, while self-deception seems to threaten such hard-won informational gains. Then, why has not it selected out? The American evolutionary biologist and sociobiologist Robert Trivers5 suggested that although our senses have evolved to give us an exquisitely detailed perception of the outside world, as soon as that information hits our brains, it often becomes biased and distorted, usually without conscious effort. Why should this be so? For Trivers, the evolutionary origins of the human propensity for self-deception lie in the adaptive benefits of deceiving others. An animal becomes a better liar when it believes its own lies, or we deceive ourselves the better to deceive others. Deception in animals is the transmission of misinformation by one animal to another, and natural selection favors deceptive signaling when aggression either confers a great benefit to signalers or imposes a great cost to receivers.6 In humans, self-deception process may have a protective role against depression, while depression on its own may reduce mechanisms of self-deception.7, 8 Humans are biased information-seekers that prefer to receive information that confirms their values and worldviews. Maybe, this is why myths and conspiracy theories around COVID-19 and vaccines exist. We may suggest that underlined neuropsychological processes, probably based on biologically determined self- or other-deceptive mechanisms, may serve in the development, and even the conservation, of at least some of the social behaviors related to the fake news phenomenon. These mechanisms may support the human tendency for biased information-seeking, and even the evolutionary persistence of the fake news phenomenon.9 However, in cases such as of COVID-19 pandemic, the native urge to deceive ourselves and others is not without risk. Beliefs in COVID-19-related conspiracy narratives and fake news are negatively associated with vaccination willingness and infection-preventive behavior.1 The COVID-19 pandemic and associated infodemic have magnified the underlying problem of trust. The vaccine hesitancy is primarily a trust issue rather than an informational problem. Fake news, rumors and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and vaccines should not be understood only as false beliefs, but also as indicators of popular anxieties and fears. Stress inoculation treatment can help people prepare for subsequent misinformation exposure and to increase misinformation detection.10 Finally, policymakers are advised to build information literacy skills for different levels and environments, and to move away from polarization attitudes and behaviors.","Giotakos","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2022.087","20220810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35916,""

Rates of screening positive for anxiety were comparable. In the U.K. (n=643,286), racial/ethnic minorities had similarly elevated rates of positive screening for depression and anxiety. These disparities were not fully explained by changes in leisure time activities. Racial/ethnic minorities bore a disproportionate mental health burden during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Non-SARS Coronaviruses in Individuals with Psychiatric Disorders","The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has highlighted the importance of coronaviruses in human health. Several seasonal, non-SARS Coronaviruses are endemic in most areas of the world. In a previous study, we found that the level of antibodies to these seasonal Coronaviruses was elevated in persons with a recent onset of psychosis. In the current study, the level of antibodies to seasonal Coronaviruses was compared between individuals with psychiatric disorders and a non-psychiatric comparison group. Participants (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 195) were persons with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or without a psychiatric disorder. Each participant had a blood sample drawn from which were measured IgG antibodies to the spike proteins in four non-SARS Coronaviruses, 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43, using a multiplex electrochemiluminescence assay. Linear regression models were employed to compare the levels of antibodies between each psychiatric group and the comparison group adjusting for demographic variables. Logistic regression models were employed to calculate the odds ratios associated with increased levels of antibodies to each seasonal Coronavirus based on the 50th percentile level of the comparison group. The schizophrenia group had significantly increased levels of antibodies to the seasonal Coronaviruses OC43 and NL63. This group also had increased odds of having elevated antibody levels to OC43. The major depression group showed a significantly lower level of antibodies to Coronavirus 229E. There were no significant differences between any of the psychiatric groups and the comparison group in the levels of antibodies to seasonal Coronaviruses 229E or HKU1. The elevated level of antibodies to OC43 and NL63 in the schizophrenia group indicates increased exposure to these agents and raises the possibility that Coronaviruses may contribute to the etiopathology of this disorder. The cause-and-effect relationship between seasonal Coronaviruses and psychiatric disorders should be the subject of additional investigations focusing on longitudinal cohort studies.","Dickerson, Severance, Yolken","https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2022_386","20220810","Antibodies; Coronavirus; Infection; Pandemic; Psychiatric disorders; Schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35920,""
"Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms in Severe COVID-19 Survivors: A Prospective Cohort Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, leading to increased concerns about long-term patients' neuropsychiatric consequences. This study aims to describe the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in severe COVID-19 survivors and to identify associated baseline, in-hospital and post-discharge factors. This study is part of the MAPA longitudinal project conducted with severe COVID-19 patients admitted in Intensive Care Medicine Department (ICMD) of a University Hospital (CHUSJ) in Porto, Portugal. Patients with ICMD length of stayÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°24Ã‚Â h, terminal illness, major auditory loss or inability to communicate at follow-up assessment were excluded. All participants were assessed by telephone post-discharge (medianÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°101 days), with a comprehensive protocol assessing depressive and anxiety symptoms, cognition, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) memories recall and health-related quality of life. Out of a sample of 56 survivors (median ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°65; 68% males), 29% and 23% had depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were significantly more prevalent among younger survivors and were associated with cognitive complaints, emotional and delusions ICU memories and fear of having COVID-19 sequelae, sleep problems and pain after discharge (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). An important proportion of these survivors suffers from depression and anxiety symptoms post-discharge, namely younger ones and those who reported more cognitive complaints, ICU memories, fear of having COVID-19 sequelae, sleep problems and pain. These findings highlight the importance of psychological consequences assessment and planning of appropriate and multidisciplinary follow-up care after hospitalization due to COVID-19.","Martins, Ferreira, Fernandes, Vieira, Fontes, Coimbra, Paiva, Fernandes","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-022-09998-z","20220810","Anxiety; COVID-19; Critical care; Depression; Survivors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35921,""
"Predictors of vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria : AÃ‚Â population-based cross-sectional study","Unwillingness to get vaccinated against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is aÃ‚Â major barrier in managing the pandemic. Previous studies have explored predictors of hesitancy to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but evidence on these predictors was partly mixed, and the number of assessed predictors was often limited. This study aimed to explore aÃ‚Â wide range of potential predictors of vaccine hesitancy in aÃ‚Â population-based cross-sectional study. We assessed associations of vaccine hesitancy with individuals' fears about the future, social media use, and sociodemographics in aÃ‚Â hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Data were collected via online questionnaires in aÃ‚Â population-based cross-sectional study with 4018 respondents representative of the Austrian adult population between October and December 2020. Vaccine hesitancy was predicted by freedom-related fears (i.e., fears regarding the political situation, particularly loss of personal freedoms), but were negatively associated with health-related fears (i.e., fears about physical or mental health) and society-related fears (i.e., fears regarding societal issues such as solidarity, distance learning, and isolation). Social media use as well as female gender, younger age, lower education, lower income, and living in rural regions were further predictors of vaccine hesitancy. The study confirms that public health efforts targeting unvaccinated persons need to address freedom-related fears and social media discourse in order to improve vaccine uptake in the population. Particularly individuals in socially and economically disadvantaged groups and social media users need to be targeted to reduce vaccine hesitancy.","Till, Niederkrotenthaler","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00508-022-02061-8","20220810","COVID-19; Fear; Public health; Quota sampling; Social media; Survey; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35922,""
"The extreme gendering of COVID-19: Household tasks and division of labour satisfaction during the pandemic","For many years, scholars have directed our attention to the gender gap in domestic labour. Even when women engage in paid employment, they nevertheless perform the majority of the household labour in most wealthy countries. At the same time, disasters and crises both expose and exacerbate existing social inequalities. In this paper, we ask: in what ways has the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the gender gap in household labour, including childcare? How do women and men feel about this gap? Using data from the Canadian Perspectives survey series (Wave 3), conducted by Statistics Canada three months into the pandemic, our analyses consider the task distribution that made household labour intensely unequal during COVID-19, with women ten times more likely than men to say childcare fell mostly on them, for example. Yet, in nearly all of our models, women did not ubiquitously report being more dissatisfied with the division of domestic tasks within the house, nor were they more likely than men to say that the household division of labour ""got worse"" during COVID; however, parents did feel that it got worse. We discuss what these findings mean for women's mental health, long-term paid labour, and interpersonal power, and raise questions about why it is we are not seeing a decrease in women's reported satisfaction with this division of labour. These findings spotlight gender inequality and the family as ongoing pillars of capitalism, and how the structural and interpersonal weathering of the pandemic comes at a particularly great expense to women. Depuis plusieurs annÃƒÂ©es, lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©cart au niveau des travaux domestiques a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© soulignÃƒÂ© par de nombreux chercheurs. Dans les pays les plus riches, les femmes performent la majoritÃƒÂ© des travaux domestiques mÃƒÂªme si elles ont un emploi rÃƒÂ©munÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©. En mÃƒÂªme temps, les dÃƒÂ©sastres et les crises exposent et empirent les inÃƒÂ©galitÃƒÂ©s sociales. Dans cet article, nous posons ces questions: Comment la pandÃƒÂ©mie du CovidÃ¢Ë†â€™19 a elle contribuÃƒÂ© Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©cart des genres au niveau des travaux domestiques, incluant les tÃƒÂ¢ches parentales? Et, comment les femmes et les hommes se sentent-elles/ils par rapport Ãƒ cet ÃƒÂ©cart?Ã‚Â En utilisant les donnÃƒÂ©es des sondages des Perspectives Canadiennes (3<sup>e</sup> Ã‚Â vague) - conduits par Statistiques Canada trois mois aprÃƒÂ¨s le dÃƒÂ©but de la pandÃƒÂ©mie - nos analyses considÃƒÂ¨rent la distribution des tÃƒÂ¢ches ayant rendu le travail domestique incroyablement inÃƒÂ©gal durant cette pÃƒÂ©riode. Par exemple, durant la pandÃƒÂ©mie, les femmes ont rÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ© avoir ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© dix fois plus forcÃƒÂ©es de s'occuper des tÃƒÂ¢ches parentales que les hommes. Cependant, dans la quasi-totalitÃƒÂ© de nos modÃƒÂ¨les, les femmes n'ont pas uniformÃƒÂ©ment rapportÃƒÂ© avoir ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© dÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ§ues de cette division des tÃƒÂ¢ches. Elles nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©taient pas non plus davantage portÃƒÂ©es Ãƒ se plaindre de cette division des tÃƒÂ¢ches, ou de rapporter que la division des tÃƒÂ¢ches avait empirÃƒÂ© durant la pandÃƒÂ©mie. Cependant, les parents ont ressenti que cette situation avait empirÃƒÂ©e. Nous discutons ce que nos rÃƒÂ©sultats impliquent pour la santÃƒÂ© mentale des femmes, pour leur travail rÃƒÂ©munÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©, ainsi que pour leur pouvoir interpersonnel et nous levons des questions quant Ãƒ l'incongruitÃƒÂ© du fait que les femmes n'aient pas rapportÃƒÂ© davantage d'insatisfaction par rapport Ãƒ la division des travaux domestiques. Ces rÃƒÂ©sultats soulignent que l'inÃƒÂ©galitÃƒÂ© des genres et la famille sont les principaux piliers du capitalisme et que lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©rosion structurelle et interpersonnelle ayant rÃƒÂ©sultÃƒÂ© de la pandÃƒÂ©mie affecte tout particuliÃƒÂ¨rement les femmes.","Haney, Barber","https://doi.org/10.1111/cars.12391","20220810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35923,""
"Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses to Vector, Mix-and-Match, or mRNA Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and the Relationship between the Two Immune Responses","We investigated how differences in age, sex, or vaccine type can affect humoral and cellular immune responses after vaccination with vector (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), mix-and-match (first, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and second, BNT162b2), or mRNA (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Venous blood was collected from 573 subjects (vector, 396; mix-and-match, 96; and mRNA, 81) before the first vaccination (<i>T</i><sub>0</sub>), 7 to 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks (vector) or 3 to 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks (mRNA) after the first vaccination (<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>), and 3 to 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks after the second vaccination (<i>T</i><sub>2</sub>). The humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated using Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche), Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott), cPass SARS-CoV-2 neutralization antibody detection (GenScript), and QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 (Qiagen) kits. At <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, the levels of the receptor-binding domain antibodies (RBD Ab) and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) decreased with aging, but interferon gamma release (IGR) levels increased. The RBD Ab, NAb, and IGR levels were higher in females than in males at <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>. The NAb levels were higher in the mix-and-match and mRNA vaccine groups than in the vector vaccine group at <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>. The RBD Ab and IGR levels were higher in the mRNA vaccine group than in the vector or mix-and-match vaccine groups at <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>. The optimal cutoffs for RBD Ab and NAb, which were used to determine the presence of T cell responses, were 5.7 binding antibody units per milliliter (BAU mL<sup>-1</sup>) and 12.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°IU mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Age, sex, and vaccine type affected the humoral and cellular immune responses, and T cell responses could be estimated from RBD Ab and NAb levels. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> There have been few studies that comprehensively evaluated factors affecting immune responses and the correlation between humoral and cellular immune responses after vector, mix-and-match, and mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of age, sex, and the different vaccine regimens on the immune responses to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The correlation between humoral and cellular immune responses and the cutoffs were derived for RBD antibodies and neutralizing antibodies to predict the presence of the cellular immune responses. In this comprehensive study, we demonstrated that there were differences in the immune responses induced after vaccination depending on the age and sex of an individual. Among the three vaccine regimens, the mix-and-match and mRNA vaccines induced the most robust immune responses. Finally, the proposed optimal cutoffs for RBD and neutralizing antibodies may be useful for predicting cellular immune responses when assays for cellular immune responses are not available.","Nam, Yun, Kim, Kim, Cha, Lee, Kang, Park, Kim, Lee, Chung, Nam, Lee, Cho","https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.02495-21","20220810","cellular immune responses; humoral immune responses; mRNA vaccine; mix-and-match vaccine; vector vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35924,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with inherited neuromuscular disorders","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought substantial challenges for current practices in treating hereditary neuromuscular disorders (hNMDs). However, this infection has not been the only concern for these patients. Social distancing has compromised multidisciplinary assistance and physical activity, and has brought about several mental health issues. We presented a follow-up on 363 patients with hNMDs at a Brazilian tertiary center during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to show the frequency and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection among hNMD patients and to demonstrate the effects of the pandemic on life habits, disease progression and multidisciplinary supportive care status. Three hundred and sixty-three patients (58% male and 42% female) were followed for three months through three teleconsultations during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. There were decreases in the numbers of patients who underwent physical, respiratory and speech therapies. For several patients, their appetite (33%) and sleep habits (25%) changed. Physical exercises and therapies were interrupted for most of the patients. They reported new onset/worsening of fatigue (17%), pain (17%), contractions (14%) and scoliosis (7%). Irritability and sleep, weight and appetite changes, and especially diminished appetite and weight loss, were more frequent in the group that reported disease worsening. There was a low COVID-19 contamination rate (0.8%), and all infected patients had a mild presentation. The isolation by itself was protective from a COVID-19 infection perspective. However, this isolation might also trigger a complex scenario with life habit changes that are associated with an unfavorable course for the NMD.","Moreno, Camelo, Sampaio, Fonseca, Estephan, Silva, Pirola, Silva, Lima, Albuquerque, Camelo Filho, Marques, Yanagiura, Cavalcante, Matsui Junior, Isihi, MendonÃƒÂ§a, Pouza, Carvalho, Reed, Zanoteli","https://doi.org/10.1590/0004-282X-ANP-2021-0166","20220810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35925,""
"Loneliness, internalizing symptoms, and inflammatory markers in adolescent COVID-19 survivors","Concerns about the psychiatric sequelae after COVID-19 infection have increased as the pandemic spreads worldwide. The increase in self-isolation during this pandemic period has also revealed the importance of feelings of loneliness. This study aimed to examine the relationship between baseline inflammation levels, internalizing symptoms, and feelings of loneliness in adolescent COVID-19 survivors in the long term. A total of 74 adolescents (41 girls, 55.4%, mean age 14.88) and their parents were included in the study. This cross-sectional study assessed internalizing symptoms via RCADS (Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale) and feelings of loneliness using the UCLA-loneliness scale. Baseline inflammatory markers at COVID-19 diagnosis were collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors for depression in adolescents. The most common disorder was Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (25.7 %), and 33.8 % of the adolescents were in the clinical range in at least one internalizing domain. Baseline C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels correlated weakly with MDD scores. Loneliness scores correlated with all internalizing symptoms, strong association with MDD scores. Loneliness, anxiety, and parental anxiety were associated with an increased likelihood of MDD. Baseline CRP positivity did not predict MDD in adolescent COVID-19 survivors. This study indicates that anxiety, loneliness, and parental anxiety play an important role in adolescents' experience of depressive symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Thus, screening parental psychopathology and loneliness in COVID-19 survivors seems to be preventive for adolescent mental health problems.","Akcay, Ãƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶p, DinÃƒÂ§, GÃƒÂ¶ker, Parlakay, Demirel, Mutlu, KÃ„Â±rmÃ„Â±zÃ„Â±","https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.13043","20220810","Adolescent; COVID-19; COVID-19 survivors; Inflammation; Internalizing symptoms; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35926,""
"Network analysis of internet addiction and depression among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study","There has been growing evidence of comorbidity between internet addiction and depression in youth during the COVID-19 period. According to the network theory, this may arise from the interplay of symptoms shared by these two mental disorders. Therefore, we examined this underlying process by measuring the changes in the central and bridge symptoms of the co-occurrence networks across time. A total of 852 Chinese college students were recruited during two waves (T1: August 2020; T2: November 2020), and reported their internet addiction symptoms and depressive symptoms. Network analysis was utilized for the statistical analysis. The internet addiction symptoms ""escape"" and ""irritable,"" and depression symptoms ""energy"" and ""guilty"" were the central symptoms for both waves. At the same time, ""guilty"" and ""escape"" were identified as bridge symptoms. Notably, the correlation between ""anhedonia"" and ""withdrawal"" significantly increased, and that between ""guilty"" and ""escape"" significantly decreased over time. This study provides novel insights into the central features of internet addiction and depression during the two stages. Interestingly, ""guilty"" and ""escape,"" two functions of the defense mechanism, are identified as bridge symptoms. These two symptoms are suggested to activate the negative feedback loop and further contribute to the comorbidity between internet addiction and depression. Thus, targeting interventions on these internalized symptoms may contribute to alleviating the level of comorbidity among college students.","Zhao, Qu, Chen, Chi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107424","20220810","Bridge symptoms; Central symptoms; Depression; Internet addiction; Longitudinal data; Network analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35927,""
"Pandemic stressors and depressive symptoms: Examining within- and between-person effects of neuroticism","Experiencing stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic such as health-related concern, social isolation, occupational disruption, financial insecurity, and resource scarcity can adversely impact mental health; however, the extent of the impact varies greatly between individuals. In this study, we examined the role of neuroticism as an individual-level risk factor that exacerbates the association between pandemic stressors and depressive symptoms. With repeated assessments of pandemic stressors and depressive symptoms collected from 3181 participants over the course of the pandemic, we used multilevel modeling to test if neuroticism moderated the association between pandemic stressors and depressive symptoms at both between- and within-person levels. At the between-person level, we found that participants who reported more pandemic stressors on average had higher levels of depressive symptoms and that this association was stronger among those high in neuroticism. At the within-person level, reporting more pandemic stressors relative to one's average on any given occasion was also associated with heightened depressive symptoms and this effect was similarly exacerbated by neuroticism. The findings point to pandemic stressor exposure and neuroticism as risk factors for depressive symptoms and, in demonstrating their synergistic impact, may help identify individuals at greatest risk for adverse psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Morstead, Zheng, Sin, Rights, DeLongis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2022.111827","20220810","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Multilevel modeling; Neuroticism; Pandemic; Stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35928,""
"Caste and COVID-19: Psychosocial disparities amongst rural Indian women during the coronavirus pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated preexisting mental health disparities. In India, marginalization based on caste membership, gender, and rural residence are critical determinants of inequity across the lifespan. Guided by the theoretical frameworks of minority stress and intersectionality, this study examined caste-based disparities in fear of coronavirus (FOC), mental health symptoms, and perceived loneliness amongst rural women in north India during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (<i>N</i> = 316) completed self-report measures and were classified into three groups based on their responses: General caste (GC, <i>n</i> = 124), other backward castes (OBC, <i>n</i> = 122), and scheduled caste or tribe (SC/ST, <i>n</i> = 71). Using a three-way ANOVA and Tukey <i>t</i>-tests, women in SC/ST and OBC groups reported greater FOC (OBC <i>d</i> = .37; SC/ST <i>d</i> = .40) and greater mental health symptoms (OBC <i>d</i> = .58; SC/ST <i>d</i> = .43) relative to the GC group.

We conducted a secondary analysis of encounter data extracted from electronic health records from 12 SBHCs that remained open despite school closures, including patient demographics and diagnostic and billing codes. We used the Clinical Classifications Software Refined to group encounters for common primary care conditions. Utilization before and during pandemic-related school closures was compared using logistic regression with cluster-robust standard errors to account for clustering within clinics, after adjusting for month of encounter. During the pandemic, study SBHCs conducted 52,530 encounters and maintained Ã¢Ë†Â¼4040 encounters/month. The frequency of encounters for annual preventative health exams increased for school-aged patients but decreased for other age groups while the frequency of encounters for mental health problems increased for all age groups. Despite pandemic-related school closures, SBHCs appeared play a critical role in providing primary care to vulnerable communities.

"Determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among older adults living with HIV","Since the emergency approval of several therapeutic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in the United States, &gt;500 million doses have been administered. However, there have been disparities in vaccine acceptability and uptake. We examined demographic, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, and psychosocial factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in older adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥50 years) living with HIV in the Coachella Valley, California. Participants completed a 1-time anonymous online questionnaire assessing their demographic (i.e., age, race, education, etc), HIV disease (i.e., viral suppression, years living with HIV, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome diagnosis), psychosocial (i.e., HIV-related stigma, personal mastery, depression, etc) characteristics, and COVID-19 vaccine acceptability. Respondents were offered an electronic $20 United States dollar (USD) gift card for survey completion. Descriptive, univariable, and multivariable tests were conducted to analyze the data. Between September 2020 and February 2021, 114 surveys were completed. Eighty-six (75%) agreed/strongly agreed with the COVID-19 vaccine acceptability statement that they saw no problem with receiving a COVID-19 vaccine if one became available. Among those who agreed/strongly agreed, the mean age was 62.2 years (standard deviation = 7.20); 86% self-identified as White; 95% male; 91% with more than high school education; and 31% with annual income &lt;$20,000 USD. Among respondents who disagreed/strongly disagreed, the mean age was 59.9 years (standard deviation = 4.85); 50% self-identified as White; 50% male; 64% with more than high school education; and 4% with annual income &lt;$20,000 USD. In the univariable analyses, those who disagreed/strongly disagreed with the COVID-19 vaccine acceptability statement were significantly more likely to be living with HIV for fewer years, experiencing higher levels of HIV-related stigma and depression, and with lower levels of personal mastery. In the multivariable logistic regression model, self-identification as female vs male and unemployed vs employed was significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 vaccine acceptability (odds ratio = 0.09, 95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.71 and odds ratio = 0.08, 95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.70 respectively), adjusting for ethnicity, marital status, education, disability, years living with HIV, HIV-related stigma, and depression. Additional studies are needed to understand vaccine-related decision-making among older adults living with HIV. Programmatic efforts may also be necessary to disseminate accurate information/resources about COVID-19 vaccines to those with more recent HIV diagnoses, experiencing HIV-related stigma and depression, with lower levels of personal mastery, and facing socioeconomic disparities.","Davtyan, Frederick, Taylor, Christensen, Brown, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000029907","20220810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35931,""

"Assessing acceptance and commitment therapy for adolescent mental health: Single-case A-B design with high temporal density assessments","Using a single-case A-B design with high temporal density assessments, the present study examined the impact of a ten-session group-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention on adolescentsâ€™ distress, psychological inflexibility, cognitive fusion, generalized pliance, and perceived ply workability. Six participants aged 16 to 19 years were invited to (i) attend a weekly ACT group, (ii) submit ecological momentary assessments daily for 69-days, and (iii) complete standardized questionnaires pre- and post-intervention. Data were analyzed using Husseyâ€™s (2019) R Package for Robust Visualization, Analysis, and Meta Analysis of A-B Designs. In terms of the ecological momentary assessments, avoidance and pliance ratings significantly decreased across time for most participants. Findings regarding perceived ply workability were less consistent (i.e., although ply workability ratings significantly decreased for three participants, the overall effect was not statistically significant). In terms of the standardized questionnaires, across participants, there were overall negligible changes in distress and pliance, while avoidance and fusion ratings decreased from pre- to post-intervention. Results are discussed with explicit reference to the need for future research that identifies the key mechanisms/processes of change underlying intervention effectiveness.","Alison Stapleton et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0116-907-47D","20220810","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; pliance; adolescents; acceptance and commitment therapy; single case design; avoidance; high temporal density measures","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-11","",35935,""
