"Feasibility and Acceptability of a Community-Based Modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program for the Under- and Unemployed","Background: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) often improves health outcomes, though literature primarily focuses on middle-class, employed individuals  With an estimated average of six million unemployed over the past year, and the recent uptick in unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to identify methods to mitigate and reduce the negative health outcomes often associated with under- and unemployment  Objectives: We aimed to 1) outline the process of partnering with a community organization to implement a modified MBSR program for under- and unemployed individuals, and 2) present pilot data on preliminary results  Methods: The modified MBSR program was implemented in two phases within a job training program for under- and unemployed individuals  In Phase I, group one received an eight-week program  Based on feedback, the MBSR program was reduced to six weeks and implemented for groups two and three (Phase II)  Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated utilizing a mixed-methods approach  Changes in mindfulness, perceived stress, pain interference, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance were assessed pre-post the modified MBSR program  Results: Thirty-three participants completed the program with twenty-nine post-survey responses  The modified MBSR program was feasible and acceptable as evidenced by the enrollment rate (96%), retention rate (72%), and qualitative feedback  Fifty-percent of participants self-reported weekly home practice compliance  Perceived stress and mindfulness demonstrated significant moderate improvements (d = 69, p = 005;d = 46, p = 001)  Depression, anxiety, and pain interference results suggested small non-significant effect size improvements (d = 27, p = 19;d = 23, p = 31;d = 25, p = 07)  Effects on fatigue and sleep disturbance were negligible  Conclusion: The modified MBSR program was feasible and acceptable to the organization and participants  Small to moderate improvements in mental health and pain interference outcomes were observed  Research using larger sample sizes and randomized designs is warranted","Wasson, R.

"Bidirectional associations between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorder: retrospective cohort studies of 62Ã¢<U+0080><U+0088>354 COVID-19 cases in the USA","BACKGROUND: Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. In this electronic health record network cohort study using data from 69 million individuals, 62Ã¢<U+0080><U+0088>354 of whom had a diagnosis of COVID-19, we assessed whether a diagnosis of COVID-19 (compared with other health events) was associated with increased rates of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, and whether patients with a history of psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: We used the TriNetX Analytics Network, a global federated network that captures anonymised data from electronic health records in 54 health-care organisations in the USA, totalling 69Â·8 million patients. TriNetX included 62Ã¢<U+0080><U+0088>354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between Jan 20, and Aug 1, 2020. We created cohorts of patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or a range of other health events. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for severity of illness. We measured the incidence of and hazard ratios (HRs) for psychiatric disorders, dementia, and insomnia, during the first 14 to 90 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19. FINDINGS: In patients with no previous psychiatric history, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with increased incidence of a first psychiatric diagnosis in the following 14 to 90 days compared with six other health events (HR 2Â·1, 95% CI 1Â·8-2Â·5 vs influenza; 1Â·7, 1Â·5-1Â·9 vs other respiratory tract infections; 1Â·6, 1Â·4-1Â·9 vs skin infection; 1Â·6, 1Â·3-1Â·9 vs cholelithiasis; 2Â·2, 1Â·9-2Â·6 vs urolithiasis, and 2Â·1, 1Â·9-2Â·5 vs fracture of a large bone; all p<0Â·0001). The HR was greatest for anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia. We observed similar findings, although with smaller HRs, when relapses and new diagnoses were measured. The incidence of any psychiatric diagnosis in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 18Â·1% (95% CI 17Â·6-18Â·6), including 5Â·8% (5Â·2-6Â·4) that were a first diagnosis. The incidence of a first diagnosis of dementia in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 1Â·6% (95% CI 1Â·2-2Â·1) in people older than 65 years. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (relative risk 1Â·65, 95% CI 1Â·59-1Â·71; p<0Â·0001). This risk was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but we cannot exclude possible residual confounding by socioeconomic factors. INTERPRETATION: Survivors of COVID-19 appear to be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, and a psychiatric diagnosis might be an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Although preliminary, our findings have implications for clinical services, and prospective cohort studies are warranted.

"Clinical, regional, and genetic characteristics of Covid-19 patients from UK Biobank","Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has rapidly infected millions of people worldwide. Recent studies suggest that racial minorities and patients with comorbidities are at higher risk of Covid-19. In this study, we analyzed the effects of clinical, regional, and genetic factors on Covid-19 positive status. The UK Biobank is a longitudinal cohort study that recruited participants from 2006 to 2010 from throughout the United Kingdom. Covid-19 test results were provided to UK Biobank starting on March 16, 2020. The main outcome measure in this study was Covid-19 positive status, determined by the presence of any positive test for a single individual. Clinical risk factors were derived from UK Biobank at baseline, and regional risk factors were imputed using census features local to each participant's home zone. We used robust adjusted Poisson regression with clustering by testing laboratory to estimate relative risk. Blood types were derived using genetic variants rs8176719 and rs8176746, and genomewide tests of association were conducted using logistic-Firth hybrid regression. This prospective cohort study included 397,064 UK Biobank participants, of whom 968 tested positive for Covid-19. The unadjusted relative risk of Covid-19 for Black participants was 3.66 (95% CI 2.83-4.74), compared to White participants. Adjusting for Townsend deprivation index alone reduced the relative risk to 2.44 (95% CI 1.86-3.20). Comorbidities that significantly increased Covid-19 risk included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 1.64, 95% CI 1.18-2.27), ischemic heart disease (ARR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16-1.89), and depression (ARR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.70). There was some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ARR 1.48, 95% CI 1.13-1.93) were associated with increased risk of Covid-19. Each standard deviation increase in the number of total individuals living in a participant's locality was associated with increased risk of Covid-19 (ARR 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.20). Analyses of genetically inferred blood types confirmed that participants with type A blood had increased odds of Covid-19 compared to participants with type O blood (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33). A meta-analysis of genomewide association studies across ancestry groups did not reveal any significant loci. Study limitations include confounding by indication, bias due to limited information on early Covid-19 test results, and inability to accurately gauge disease severity. When assessing the association of Black race with Covid-19, adjusting for deprivation reduced the relative risk of Covid-19 by 33%. In the context of sociological research, these findings suggest that discrimination in the labor market may play a role in the high relative risk of Covid-19 for Black individuals. In this study, we also confirmed the association of blood type A with Covid-19, among other clinical and regional factors.","Kolin, Kulm, Christos, Elemento","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241264","20201117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7242,""

The parents or other family members who come to our paediatric clinic inevitably experience panic, tension and anxiety. The generation of these emotions has seriously affected the normal order of outpatient treatment and has led to many children not receiving an accurate diagnosis or proper treatment. This situation is not conducive to the control of the epidemic or the children's physical and mental health.

"COVID-19 Quarantine-Related Mental Health Symptoms and their Correlates among Mothers: A Cross Sectional Study","One of the strictest quarantines worldwide to limit the spread of coronavirus was enforced in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated reported mental health and changes in lifestyle practices among Jordanian mothers during COVID-19 quarantine. The specific objectives included studying the level of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and their potential statistical associations with demographic and lifestyle variables. Furthermore, the study aimed to investigate differences in mental health between different demographic and socio-economic groups and to examine the major lifestyle changes that occurred on mothers during the quarantine. An online survey was developed and administered to 2103 mothers. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and a lifestyle section comparing the life of mothers before and during the quarantine. Reported scores of depression, anxiety, and stress were calculated and compared across different levels of demographics including income, education level, employment status, and city of residence. This study found that mothers with lower income, lower education, not employed, or living in cities outside the capital of Jordan reported having more depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (p &lt; .005). Changes in their lifestyle practices included weight gain, increased time allocated for teaching children at home, increased familial violence at home, and increased time allocated for caring for their family members (average increase of 5 hours daily). The unprecedented times of quarantine have put mothers in unprecedented reported mental health problems. Providing psychological support to this group might be a priority.","Malkawi, Almhdawi, Jaber, Alqatarneh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-020-03034-x","20201117","COVID-19 quarantine; Lifestyle changes; Mental health; Mothers; Psychological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7244,""

These changes included an increase in reliance on telemedicine modalities, a reduction in services or hours of operation, and prohibiting guests and nonessential personnel from healthcare settings. We describe a rapid environmental assessment with senior emergency department (ED) practitioners in Rhode Island to understand how COVID-related procedural changes impact the provision of post-overdose care in ED. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 senior healthcare practitioners in EDs across Rhode Island from June to July 2020. Interviews were part of a larger, ongoing study examining the implementation and effectiveness of post-opioid overdose care in EDs and sought to understand how COVID-19 had impacted the provision of services for people who use drugs (PWUD). COVID-related policy changes challenged the provision of services to PWUD in the ED, and extended challenges in connecting people with OUD to services in the community. Specifically, challenges included transitions to telehealth modalities, required COVID tests for treatment services, and gaps in community resources. This study underscores opportunities to improve the delivery of services amid overlapping public health crises for PWUD, including bolstering the use of telemedicine in EDs and across the care continuum.","Collins, Beaudoin, Samuels, Wightman, Baird","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000779","20201117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7246,""
"Implementation and Evaluation of a Text Message-Based Addiction Counseling Program (Text4Hope-Addiction Support): Protocol for a Questionnaire Study","With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing counseling to people with drug or alcohol addiction while maintaining physical distance has been challenging. This protocol describes the use of text messaging (as used in the Text4Hope-Addiction Support program) as a convenient, evidence-based, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention with high user satisfaction proven in prior research. The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive text messaging (Text4Hope-Addiction Support) to reduce drug or alcohol cravings as well as anxiety and depression, typically associated with alcohol and substance use disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope-Addiction Support intervention in mitigating cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess cravings for the primary substance of addiction (Brief Substance Craving Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of receiving text messages), program midpoint (6 weeks), and program end (12 weeks). As of October 2020, data collection is in progress; and it is expected to be completed by fall 2021. Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. This Text4Hope-Addiction Support project will provide key information regarding the prevalence rates of cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among persons with alcohol and substance use disorders; demographic correlates of cravings, anxiety, and depression; and outcome data related to this scalable population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for addiction care practitioners; it will inform the policy and decision making regarding population-level addiction treatment and support during emergencies.

"Suicide in the Time of COVID-19: Review and Recommendations","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presents us with unusual challenges to the global health system and economics. The pandemic may not have an immediate impact on suicide rates, however, given that it is likely to result in a confluence of risk factors for suicide and economic crisis, it is highly possibly that it will lead to increases in suicide rates in the long-run. Elderly persons are more likely to live alone, be socially isolated during COVID-19 and have physical health problems, which are risk factors for suicide. Young children and health professionals may also be population at risk. Isolation, quarantine and the economic crisis that follows may impact mental health significantly. The International Academy of Suicide Research (IASR) is an organization dedicated to promote high standards of research and scholarship in the field of suicidal behaviour to support efforts to prevent suicide globally. This IASR's board position paper gives recommendations for suicide research during the COVID-10 pandemic.

"Psychomorbidity, Resilience, and Exacerbating and Protective Factors During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused mental stress in a number of ways: overstrain of the health care system, lockdown of the economy, restricted opportunities for interpersonal contact and excursions outside the home and workplace, and quarantine measures where necessary. In this article, we provide an overview of psychological distress in the current pandemic, identifying protective factors and risk factors. The PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for relevant publications (1 January 2019 - 16 April 2020). This study was registered in OSF Registries (osf.io/34j8g). Data on mental stress and resilience in Germany were obtained from three surveys carried out on more than 1000 participants each in the framework of the COSMO study (24 March, 31 March, and 21 April 2020). 18 studies from China and India, with a total of 79 664 participants, revealed increased stress in the general population, with manifestations of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and sleep disturbances. Stress was more marked among persons working in the health care sector. Risk factors for stress included patient contact, female sex, impaired health status, worry about family members and significant others, and poor sleep quality. Protective factors included being informed about the increasing number of persons who have recovered from COVID, social support, and a lower perceived infectious risk. The COSMO study, though based on an insufficiently representative population sample because of a low questionnaire return rate (&lt;20%), revealed increased rates of despondency, loneliness, and hopelessness in the German population as compared to norm data, with no change in estimated resilience. Stress factors associated with the current pandemic probably increase stress by causing anxiety and depression. Once the protective factors and risk factors have been identified, these can be used to develop psychosocial interventions. The informativeness of the results reported here is limited by the wide variety of instruments used to acquire data and by the insufficiently representative nature of the population samples.","Gilan, RÃƒÂ¶thke, Blessin, Kunzler, Stoffers-Winterling, MÃƒÂ¼ssig, Yuen, TÃƒÂ¼scher, Thrul, Kreuter, Sprengholz, Betsch, Stieglitz, Lieb","https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2020.0625","20201117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7249,""

"Profiles of sleep changes during the COVID-19 pandemic: Demographic, behavioural and psychological factors","This study aimed to evaluate changes in sleep during the COVID-19 outbreak, and used data-driven approaches to identify distinct profiles of changes in sleep-related behaviours. Demographic, behavioural and psychological factors associated with sleep changes were also investigated. An online population survey assessing sleep and mental health was distributed between 3 April and 24 June 2020. Retrospective questions were used to estimate temporal changes from before to during the outbreak. In 5,525 Canadian respondents (67.1% females, 16-95Ã‚Â years old: MeanÃ‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â SDÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦55.6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 16.3 years), wake-up times were significantly delayed relative to pre-outbreak estimates (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msubsup> <mml:mi>ÃŽÂ·</mml:mi> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:msubsup> </mml:math> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04).

The &quot;Reduced Time in Bed&quot; and &quot;Delayed Sleep&quot; subgroups had more adverse sleep outcomes and psychological changes during the outbreak. The emergence of new sleep difficulties was independently associated with female sex, chronic illnesses, being employed, family responsibilities, earlier wake-up times, higher stress levels, as well as heavier alcohol use and television exposure. The heterogeneity of sleep changes in response to the pandemic highlights the need for tailored interventions to address sleep problems.","Robillard, Dion, Pennestri, Solomonova, Lee, Saad, Murkar, Godbout, Edwards, Quilty, Daros, Bhatla, Kendzerska","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13231","20201117","COVID-19; chronotype; mental health; pandemic; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7251,""
"COVID-19: psychological effects on a COVID-19 quarantined population in Bangladesh","It had been seven months since the first confirmed case (8<sup>th</sup> March, 2020) of COVID-19 in Bangladesh and people have now got a more complete picture of the extent of the pandemic. Therefore, it is time to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on mental health. The current population-based study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression and PTSD of the quarantined people in Bangladesh during COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 5792 individuals comprised the population of this study. Subjects were respondents to an online questionnaire that was administered through social media. The questionnaire included questions on personal information, quarantine related knowledge, items of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Data were collected and analyzed by regression utilizing a using IBM SPSS-22 (Statistical Package for Social Science, Chicago, IL, USA). The most post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms had on the male (n = 1392, 75.7%) who had institutional quarantine. The most depression symptoms were on the female (n = 920, 72.8%) whose income was more than 75000 takas in Bangladeshi currency. 81.8% of respondents had PTSD and their scores Ã¢â€°Â¥24 in the IES-R scale. On the other hand, the respondent's income was 40000-74999 takas in Bangladesh currency had more PTSD symptoms and the odd ratio 19.3 (95% CI: 12.5-27.3), adjusted odds ratio 22.9 (95% CI: 15.6-32.4), after adjusting all personal variables. 85.9% respondents scored 16 Ã¢â€°Â¤ in the CES-D scale, meaning they were depressed.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical activity levels of individuals and assess the effects of physical activity on quality of life, depression and anxiety levels during COVID-19 outbreak. This cross-sectional study were included 2301 participants aged 20-75 years. The data were collected through the Google Forms web survey platform by the virtual snowball sampling method. In the multivariate analysis, the independent predictors were analyzed using possible factors identified in previous analyses by multinomial logistic regression analysis. Hosmer-Lemeshow and Omnibus tests were used to evaluate the logistic regression model and coefficients. The mean weekly energy consumption of the participants was 875Ã‚Â±1588 MET-min, and only 6.9% were physically active enough to maintain their health.

"Recovery, Restoration and Risk: A Cross Sectional Survey of the Impact of COVID-19 on General Practitioners in the First UK City to Lockdown","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted General Practitioners (GPs) immensely. Work patterns have changed, risk stratification has been proposed and clinicians' mental health have been adversely affected. The COVID-19 prevalence amongst GPs is unknown. This study focuses on assessing the impact of COVID-19 on GPs in Leicestershire, the first UK city to lockdown locally. Aim This survey assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 in GPs and explored GP work patterns in comparison to national guidance. It evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on GP stress perception, using a validated perceived stress tool. Design and Setting The cross-sectional retrospective survey was sent to all the GPs in Leicestershire. Methodology 111 GPs in Leicestershire took part voluntarily in an anonymised questionnaire-based study. A 29-item survey using SMARTsurvey software was designed with multiple choice and Linkert response scale questions. Ethical approval was not applicable. Results The COVID-19 prevalence in GPs was 8.1%. 70.3% of GPs were of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) origin. 91.9% of GPs had undergone risk stratification. 79.3% of GPs felt supported by their practice but only 59.5% felt supported with mental health. GPs described feeling more stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic than they had been previously. Conclusion This is the first study evaluating COVID-19 prevalence amongst GPs in Leicestershire. Despite government interventions, GPs felt less supported with their mental health. Thus, the National Health Service England should focus on GP stress and wellbeing as they work towards the restoration and recovery of primary care and prepare for a second peak.","Trivedi, Trivedi, Moorthy, Trivedi","https://doi.org/10.3399/BJGPO.2020.0151","20201117","COVID-19; General Practice; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7255,""

"Effectiveness of laptop-based versus smartphone-based videoconferencing interaction on loneliness, depression and social support in nursing home residents: A secondary data analysis","The worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic re-emphasises the importance of Internet videoconferencing in supporting interactions between nursing home residents and their family and friends. However, there is a scarcity of comparative studies on how modalities of conferencing programs impact health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare laptop-based with smartphone-based videoconferencing programs on nursing home residents' perceptions of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support. This retrospective secondary analysis used data from two previous studies on the effectiveness of videoconferencing programs (laptop-based and smartphone-based) to improve outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support (type and source) among nursing home residents. Generalised estimating equations compared differences from baseline measures with measures at 1 and 3 months between the two groups with and without adjusting for the effects of confounding variables. With the exception of age, there were no differences in demographics between participants in the laptop and smartphone groups. Neither changes from baseline in mean scores for loneliness nor depressive symptoms differed between groups. However, changes in mean scores from baseline between groups were significantly greater in the smartphone-based group compared with the laptop-based group for three types of social support: informational and appraisal at 1 and 3 months; and emotional at 3 months. Changes from baseline in mean scores for social support from friends (at 1 and 3 months) and other sources (at 3 months) were also significantly greater for the smartphone group compared with the laptop group. The two modalities of videoconferencing did not differ in effects on depressive symptoms or loneliness. However, smartphones had a greater effect on the type and source of social support compared with laptops. Whether the small screen of a smartphone reduces users' anxiety and allows them to talk more on screen is worth studying.","Tsai, Cheng, Shieh","https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X20972004","20201116","Videoconference; depression; elderly; loneliness, telehealth, aged care; nursing home; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7258,""

"Measuring COVID-19 Related Anxiety in Parents: Psychometric Comparison of Four Different Inventories","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and measures to contain the global pandemic can have an impact on individual's well-being and mental health status. Parents of young children are particularly at risk for high levels of parental stress due to the current public health crisis, which can impact parenting behaviors and children's well-being. Although different initial scales have been developed to measure COVID-19 related anxiety, they have not yet been tested sufficiently in parent samples. A brief measure of COVID-19-related anxiety is necessary for both quick assessment in practice and in larger epidemiological studies of parents. To compare the distributions, validities and reliabilities of four different COVID-19 anxiety scales: Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV19-S), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), Pandemic Anxiety Scale (PAS) and one subscale of the COVID-19 Stress Scale (CSS). Based on the psychometric properties, the purpose of this study is to provide recommendations for a brief unidimensional inventory to assess Covid-19 related anxiety among parents. A cross-sectional online survey on 515 German-speaking parents (90.3% mothers) with a child aged 0 to 6 years was conducted during a six-week period (June 29 to August 9, 2020). Half of the parents were recruited via Facebook parenting groups while the other half were recruited through childcare centers. Twenty-five items on Covid-19 related anxiety were psychometrically tested with the framework of Classical Test Theory (CTT), including item analysis, correlational analysis with family variables and explorative factor analysis (EFA). Moreover, an Item Response Theory (IRT) approach was applied to estimate item discriminations, item difficulties and test information functions. Based on the psychometric properties, three items of the Pandemic Anxiety Scale (PAS) were identified as a single unidimensional factor. The adapted scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (ÃŽÂ± = .79), moderate to high item discrimination, strong positive inter-correlation with two other COVID-19 anxiety scales, and a small positive association with parenting stress. Mothers and fathers did not differ in total scores, t(513)= -.79, p = .42. Factor analysis suggests that existing COVID-19 related anxiety scales are measuring different latent constructs of anxiety. Furthermore, all scales showed only small to moderate correlations with trait health anxiety, suggesting COVID-19 related anxiety is distinct from general health anxiety. The adapted subscale &quot;disease anxiety&quot; of den Pandemic Anxiety Scale is an economical measure for assessing COVID-19 anxiety in parents. Directions for future research are outlined.","Kubb, Foran","https://doi.org/10.2196/24507","20201116","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7260,""
"Identifying post-COVID vulnerable groups: A cross-sectional survey among different professions in China during the final stage of lockdown","COVID-19 resulted in considerable mental health burden in the Chinese general population and health care workers at the beginning and peak of the pandemic. However, little is known about potentially vulnerable groups during the final stage of the lockdown. The aim of this survey study was to assess the mental health burden of different professions in China in order to find vulnerable groups, possible influencing factors, and the successful ways of coping during the last four weeks of the lockdown in Hubei province. A cross-sectional online survey asked participants about current residence, daily working hours, exposure to COVID-19 at work and media preferences. We used Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scales (DASS-21) for the assessment of mental health. Further assessments included perceived stress (CPSS-14), coping strategies for all participants and specific stressors for health care workers. We followed the reporting guidelines of the STROBE statements for observational studies. The sample (N=687) consisted of 158 doctors, 221 nurses, 24 other medical staff, 43 students, 60 teachers/government staff, 135 economy staff, 26 workers/farmers and 20 others. We found 17.9% cases of increased depression, 30.3% anxiety and 13.7% stress. Other medical staff and students were vulnerable to depression while doctors, nurses and students were vulnerable to anxiety. Other medical staff, students and economy staff were vulnerable to stress. Coping strategies were reduced to three factors: active, mental and emotional. Being female and emotional coping were independently associated with depression, anxiety or stress. Applying active coping strategies showed lower odds for anxiety while mental coping strategies showed lower odds for depression, anxiety and stress. Age, being inside a lockdown area, exposure to COVID-19 at work and having a high workload (8-12h per day) was not associated with any symptoms. WeChat was the preferred way of staying informed in all groups. By the end of the lockdown a considerable part of the Chinese population showed increased levels of depression and anxiety. Students and other medical staff were the most affected, while economy staff were highly stressed. Doctors and nurses need support regarding potential anxiety disorders. Future work should focus on longitudinal results of the pandemic and develop targeted preventive measures.","Du, Mayer, Hummel, Oetjen, Gronewold, Zafar, Schultz","https://doi.org/10.2196/24240","20201116","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7261,""
"Impacts of the COVID2019 pandemic on functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome: A population-based survey","Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are a group of stress-sensitive gut-brain disorders. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused immense stress and anxiety among the general public. Strict measures to counter COVID-19 emergency, including physical distancing have also taken a toll on physical and mental health. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms of functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). An online survey was conducted in Japan for a group of randomly assigned panelists from May 26 to 27, 2020. Each respondent answered a questionnaire on stress, physical distancing, and worries about COVID-19. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed to diagnose FD and IBS (Rome III), and psychological symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A total of 5157 subjects were finally enrolled, with FD in 8.5%, IBS in 16.6%, and FD-IBS overlap in 4.0%. For both gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms, respondents with FD-IBS overlap showed the worst scores, followed by IBS-alone, then FD-alone respondents. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 11.9% of respondents reported deterioration and 2.8% reported improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms. FD-IBS overlap, psychological disease comorbidity, and stress at work/school were significantly associated with symptom deterioration. Younger age, commuting by public transport, and work/study from home were associated with symptom improvement. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected FD/IBS subjects, with respondents showing FD-IBS overlap syndrome as the most important independent factor associated with deterioration in gastrointestinal symptoms. Physicians need to take extra care of FD/IBS patients in the post-COVID period.","Oshima, Siah, Yoshimoto, Miura, Tomita, Fukui, Miwa","https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15346","20201116","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; functional dyspepsia; functional gastrointestinal disorders; irritable bowel syndrome; psychological disease","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7262,""
"Continuing care for patients affected by urologic chronic pelvic pain in the era of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses a challenge to treatment of patients with urologic chronic pelvic pain (UCPP), who are at risk to be postponed in the priority of care. We investigated pain, catastrophizing, and psychological status in UCPP patients during SARS-CoV-2 by means of Skype telephone calls. A total of 28 UCPP patients underwent Skype video consultations. Pain intensity was assessed with Pain Numerical Rating Scale (PNRS). Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) were used to assess catastrophizing and psychological status. During SARS-CoV-2, UCPP patients showed higher intensity of pain than before (meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD PNRS score: 7.25Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.9 vs. 5.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.7; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001), with pain exacerbation in 75%; they showed higher PCS and DASS-21 scores as compared to before the pandemic (meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD PCS total score: 32.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.2 vs. 23.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.5; meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD DASS-21 total score: 42.03Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.5 vs. 34.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.2; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001 and pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, respectively). During SARS-CoV-2 pandemic UCPP patients presented with high intensity of pain, marked catastrophizing thoughts and severe alteration of the psychological status. These observations impose the need not to postpone assessment and treatment of these patients during the pandemic. Remote visits with video telephone calls are a simple way of continuing care in UCPP patients.","Giannantoni, Rubilotta, Balzarro, Gubbiotti","https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.24574","20201116","COVID-19; anxiety; catastrophizing; chronic pelvic pain; depression; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7263,""
"Physical activity for cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic: a call to action","Self-isolation is strongly recommended for cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, but may lead to physical inactivity and prolonged sitting time. The benefits of physical activity for cancer patients are manifold, such as reduced anxiety, fewer depressive symptoms, less fatigue, better quality of life, and improved physical function. In the last decade, several oncology-related organizations have provided guidance and summarized the evidence on the role of physical activity for cancer survivors. In this comment, we provide a brief summary of these recommendations and benefits of physical activity for cancer patients; and we recommend that oncologists and health practitioners should promote an active lifestyle for these patients during the pandemic and thereafter. Suggestions for implementing these actions in the clinical settings are also provided.","Rezende, Lee, Ferrari, Eluf-Neto, Giovannucci","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10552-020-01367-0","20201116","Cancer patients; Cancer survivors; Covid-19; Exercise; Physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-18","",7264,""

"A Self-Administered Multicomponent Web-Based Mental Health Intervention for the Mexican Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","The COVID-19 pandemic has become a public health emergency of international concern; it has not only threatened people's physical health but has also affected their mental health and psychological well-being. It is necessary to develop and offer strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the outbreak and promote adaptive coping. This study protocol aims to describe a self-administered web-based intervention (Mental Health COVID-19) based on the principles of positive psychology supported by elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation therapy to reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression and increase positive emotions and sleep quality during and after the COVID-19 outbreak through a telepsychology system. A randomized controlled clinical superiority trial with two independent groups will be performed, with intrasubject measures at four evaluation periods: pretest, posttest, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: self-administered intervention with assistance via chat or self-administered intervention without assistance via chat. The total required sample size will be 166 participants (83 per group). The clinical trial is ongoing. This protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Free School of Psychology-University of Behavioral Sciences (Escuela libre de PsicologÃƒÂ­a-Universidad de Ciencias del Comportamiento). The aim is to publish the preliminary results in December 2020. A conservative approach will be adopted, and the size effect will be estimated using the Cohen d index with a significance level (ÃŽÂ±) of .05 (95% reliability) and a conventional 80% power statistic. The central mechanism of action will be to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention based on positive psychology through a web platform that can be delivered through computers and tablets, with content that has been rigorously contextualized to the Mexican culture to provide functional strategies to help the target users cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Can Mental Health Apps Be Effective for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress During a Pandemic?","Covid-19 is poised to exacerbate the global mental health crisis as social isolation, unemployment, and economic recession are risk factors for negative mental health consequences. Since the need for social distancing can make face-to-face services less accessible, people may turn to mental health apps as an accessible and inexpensive solution. But are the claims about the efficacy of these apps supported by evidence? We identified 19 published articles on PubMed of peer-reviewed randomized clinical trials of mental health apps focused on stress, anxiety, and depression. Despite some evidence for the effectiveness of mental health apps, it remains unclear how effective these apps are compared to standard of care. Populations studied so far also lack diversity, making it difficult to generalize any benefits to racial minorities and low-income individualsâ€”the very people who have been most negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and traditionally have higher barriers to mental health services. While apps are not a substitute for face-to-face therapy, further evidence is warranted given their potential for delivering scalable, low-cost care to patients. We call for regulatory oversight as a means to ensure mental health apps demonstrate safety and effectiveness prior to marketing.","Robert L.
