"Emotional disturbance and risk factors among COVID-19 confirmed cases in isolation hotels","Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been isolated in hospital-managed isolation hotels under a policy of the Taiwan government. Centrally isolation patients are more likely to experience psychological symptoms. The purpose of the study was to investigate emotional disturbance during their isolation period and then pinpoint the factors during their isolation period associated with the emotional disturbance. We retrospectively analysed the medical charts of the patients confined to a Banqiao isolation hotel between May 28 and July 3, 2021. The 5-item brief symptom rating scale (BSRS-5) was used to evaluate emotional disturbance levels. Descriptive and logistic regression was used for the data analysis. In total, 197 complete medical records were reviewed, and of these 84 (42.6%) showed emotional disturbance. The majority of them reported only minor disturbance (n = 49, 58.3%). After controlling for confounding factors, being satisfied about medical information was the only protective factor associated with emotional disturbance (OR = 0.2, P = 0.018). Being a male patient (OR = 3.0, P = 0.005), worrying about stigmatization (OR = 2.2, P = 0.041) and being unable to contact family members (OR = 2.9, P = 0.018) increased the risk of experiencing emotional disturbance. Patients with clinical symptoms, namely sore throat (OR = 3.4, P = 0.013) and muscle aches (OR = 6.3, P = 0.005), were also found to be more likely to report emotional disturbance. Mental disturbance commonly occurs among patient with COVID-19 who are isolated in a hospital-managed hotel. Being a male patient, having symptoms, namely a sore throat and muscle pain, being unable to contact family and/or a failure to receive sufficient medical information were found to be associated with emotional disturbance. In order to help isolated patients, government officials should provide a clear rationale for isolation and recognize the patients' efforts to follow the government's policy, which will help to minimize social stigma.

"Predictors of burnout and distress in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder during COVID-19 home confinement","The studyâ€™s purpose was to investigate the mental health and related variables of parents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) child during COVID-19 home confinement. The study data is based on the evaluation of online self-report questionnaires that assess parental distress, burnout, and coping levels, as well as parent-proxy reports of autism severity and related behavioral issues, as described by the parents of 79 children with ASD and their 83 typically developing age- and sex-matched opponents. The burnout and adaptive coping levels of the parents with ASD children were greater than those of the controls. However, there was no significant difference in terms of general distress levels. Increased irritability was the most commonly reported symptom among children with ASD. However, behavioral issues in children were the strongest predictor of parental burnout, whereas maladaptive coping skills were linked to general distress. This study emphasizes the significance of treating the behavioral issues of children with ASD and the coping strategies of their parents for the mental well-being of this vulnerable population and their parents during home confinement.

"Relationship Between Moral Intelligence and Occupational Burnout in Mazandaran Pre-Hospital Emergency Staff During COVID-19 Pandemic","Background and purpose: COVID-19 pandemic caused high workload and led to high levels of burnout in medical staff including emergency medical personnel. Identifying and preventing occupational burnout can efficiently improve mental health in workplace and enhance the quality of services delivered. This research aimed to investigate the relationship between occupational burnout and moral intelligence in emergency medical staff. Materials and methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 250 prehospital emergency staff in Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, 2021. The participants were selected from emergency bases using stratified sampling. Data were collected using demographic characteristics checklist, Moral Intelligence Scale (Lennick & Kiel), and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Structural equation and maximum likelihood model were applied. Data analyses were carried out in SPSS 23 and Amos 24. Results: The mean scores for moral intelligence and burnout were 81.10Â±8.30 and 44.41Â±13.73, respectively. Every one point increase in moral intelligence score decreased burnout score by 1.55 (P=0.054). Significant relationships were seen between all dimensions of Moral Intelligence Scale and moral intelligence (P&lt;0.001). Keeping promises (r=0.82, P&lt;0.001) and the ability to let go of oneâ€™s own mistakes (r=0.79, P&lt;0.001) were found to be highly correlated with moral intelligence. In MBI, only personal accomplishment showed a significant positive correlation coefficient with burnout (r=0.41, P=0.026). Conclusion: In this study, improvements in moral intelligence score decreased the burnout score. Therefore, improving moral intelligence, as an acquired ability, in emergency medical personnel can reduce the levels of burnout experienced.

"Pseudomembranous Conjunctivitis following Exposure to Arisaema ringens Sap: A Case Report","Plants of the Araceae family exude a sap containing calcium oxalate, a toxic substance that causes dermatitis. However, ocular injury due to exposure to Araceae sap has rarely been reported. Herein, we present a case of severe pseudomembranous conjunctivitis following exposure to Arisaema ringens, an Araceae species and popular houseplant in Japan. A 67-year-old man presented with pain in his right eye after exposure to the sap of A. ringens. At presentation, the best corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure in the right eye were 20/800 and 15 mm Hg. Slit-lamp examination showed strong hyperemia, conjunctival chemosis, and corneal edema with many pseudomembranes, and fluorescein staining revealed corneal epithelial defects in the central area of the cornea. We washed the ocular surface with saline and initiated treatment with topical instillations of 1.5% levofloxacin and 0.1% betamethasone, combined with ofloxacin eye ointment. After repeatedly removing the pseudomembranes and increasing the frequency of the topical instillations, pseudomembranous conjunctivitis and corneal erosion gradually improved. One week following the injury, the corneal epithelial defects were no longer detectable, and the patientâ€™s best corrected visual acuity recovered to 20/25. It is important for ophthalmologists and primary care physicians to be aware of the ocular toxicity of A. ringens and should counsel their patients accordingly. Moreover, preventative measures, such as the use of protective eyewear, should be taken when cutting this houseplant.","Ono, Takashi, Nejima, Ryohei, Kinoshita, Katsuhito, Mori, Yosai, Iwasaki, Takuya, Miyata, Kazunori","https://www.google.com/search?q=Pseudomembranous+Conjunctivitis+following+Exposure+to+Arisaema+ringens+Sap:+A+Case+Report","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Case Reports in Ophthalmology; 13(2):350-354, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38170,""
"Impact of Long COVID on health and quality of life [version 1;peer review: 2 approved]","Background: The aim of this study was to measure the impact of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) on quality of life, mental health, ability to work and return to baseline health in an Irish cohort. Methods:Â We invited individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 lasting more than 14 days to participate in an anonymous online questionnaire. Basic demographic data and self-reported symptoms were recorded. Internationally validated instruments including the patient health questionnaire somatic, anxiety and depressive symptom scales (PHQ-SADS), the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) and Chadler fatigue scale (CFQ) were used. Results: We analysed responses from 988 participants with self-reported confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive;81%) or suspected (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested;9%) COVID-19.Â The majority of respondents were female (88%), white (98%), with a median age of 43.0 (range 15 â€“ 88 years old) and a median BMI of 26.0 (range 16 â€“ 60). At the time of completing this survey, 89% of respondents reported that they have not returned to their pre-COVID-19 level of health.Â The median number of symptoms reported was 8 (range 0 to 33 symptoms), with a median duration of 12 months (range 1 to 20 months) since time of acute infection. A high proportion of PASC patients reported that they have a moderate or severe limitation in their ability to carry out their usual activities, 38% report their ability to work is severely limited and 33% report a moderate, or higher, level of anxiety or depression. Conclusion: The results of this survey of an Irish cohort with PASC are in line with reports from other settings, and we confirm that patients with PASC reported prolonged, multi-system symptoms which can significantly impact quality of life, affect ability to work and cause significant disability.

"Gender Effects on Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Regarding the Fear of COVID-19","The fear of the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with negative effects on mental health. The study investigates depression, anxiety, and stress and their relationship to gender among hospitality sector employees in the USA during COVID-19. Fear has been one of the most common psychological responses in the population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to examine its relationship with depression, anxiety, and stress to combat the fear of COVID-19 between the gender. The study was conducted using an online questionnaire. A sociodemographic data form, the Fear of COVID-19 scale, and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used for data collection. In total, 341 valid questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS version 24. The results showed that the fear of COVID-19 positively and significantly impacted stress (Coeff = .4992, 95% confidence interval (CI): .4409â€“.5575), anxiety (Coeff = .4825, 95% CI: .4245â€“.5405), and depression (Coeff = . 4601, 95% CI: .3992â€“.5210), and these effects differed according to gender. The effects of the fear of COVID-19 on stress and anxiety were higher in women compared with men. This cross-sectional study shows that the psychological effects of the fear of COVID-19 are more significant in women than in men. The study makes significant contributions to the literature in terms of showing the gender differences related to COVID-19 within the hospitality sector. Therefore, women should be prioritized in future psychiatric recovery plans.","MaslakÃ§i, Ahmet, SÃ¼rÃ¼cÃ¼, LÃ¼tfi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Gender+Effects+on+Depression,+Anxiety,+and+Stress+Regarding+the+Fear+of+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Trends in Psychology;: 1-13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38172,""
"Working Condition On Employee Quality Of Life Outcome: Perspectives From Pandemic COVID-19","During the COVID-19 Pandemic, there were changes in work patterns such as work from home. The impact of the change in work from home patterns needs to be of concern to the organization. Working conditions that are not conducive to overcoming these changes in work patterns can lead to deviance in employee behavior due to mental health. This study investigates the effect of working conditions on the quality of life of employees. The research method used a survey approach with non-parametric analysis techniques. It is testing using a sample of 201 employees of respondents with a simple random sampling technique in local governments that handle transportation problems in West Bandung regency. The results indicated a significant influence of the work environment on the quality of life of employees. This result indicates that the presence of a work environment that is less conducive has a significant impact on the quality of life of employees, as indicated by the presence of anxiety and depression. The research implication shows that it is necessary to minimize existing work-related mental health by managing an efficient work environment.","Machmud, Senen, Sidharta, Iwan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Working+Condition+On+Employee+Quality+Of+Life+Outcome:+Perspectives+From+Pandemic+COVID-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Applied Business Research; 37(6):217-224, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38173,""
"We Canâ€™t Just Wait This Out: Burnout and Fulfillment among SGO Members over the First Two Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic (051)","Objectives: To assess the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of SGO members during the first wave (W1) and second wave (W2) of the pandemic. Methods: During W1 and W2 of the COVID-19 pandemic (June 15 to July 1, 2020 and January 15 to 31, 2021), SGO members received an anonymous survey consisting of validated measures to assess for professional fulfillment and burnout (PFI), generalized anxiety (GAD-2), depression (PHQ-2), PTSD (IES-6), and novel questions regarding COVID-19 stressors. Univariate and multivariable analyses were utilized to determine associations between W1 and W2. Results: A total of 478 responses were recorded (23.3% response rate). Ninety-nine W2 responders who took both W1 and W2 surveys were excluded, leaving 379 total responses (W1: 254, W2: 125). The majority of responders were female (68.3%), aged =45 (55.7%), and non-Hispanic White ethnicity (69.9%). Overall, 16.1% and 14.0% reported a history of anxiety and depression, respectively. Personal COVID infections and institutional COVID burden were higher in W2 (p=0.01, p=&lt;.0001), with 7.1% versus 15.2% infections and 31.1% versus 11.2% reporting low burden compared to 23.2% versus 42.4% reporting high burden. Positive screening for anxiety, depression, and PTSD was reported in 25%, 17%, and 61% of responders in W1, compared to 19.7%, 5%, and 31.4% in W2, respectively. In both W1 and W2, after adjusting for demographic covariates, low professional fulfillment was associated with anxiety (p-values &lt;0.01), while burnout remained associated with anxiety, depression, and PTSD (p-values &lt;0.04). No difference in overall burnout or professional fulfillment was found on a multivariable analysis comparing W1 and W2. With respect to low professional fulfillment, history of anxiety was found to be an independent modifier between W1 and W2 (p=0.03), as those with no preexisting anxiety (n=318) were 1.72 times more likely to have lower fulfillment in W1 versus W2 (95% CI: 1.02-2.92). Similarly, age was an identified modifier related to burnout between W1 and W2 (p=0.04), where those aged = 56 years were 2.7 times more likely to endorse burnout in W1 versus W2 (95% CI: 0.84-8.63). Multivariable analysis of novel COVID-19 stressors (Table 1) demonstrated significantly higher levels of reported stress in W1 versus W2 due to change in work quality/deployment, current/potential PPE shortage, and significantly lower levels of stress regarding finances. Conclusions: Among 379 SGO members surveyed during W1 and W2 of the pandemic, burnout and low professional fulfillment remained prevalent in over 40% of members. Proportionately higher numbers of respondents endorsed low professional fulfillment, anxiety, depression, and PTSD in W1 versus W2, while the rate of burnout remained unchanged between the waves. Although no overall association was found between burnout and fulfillment in W1 and W2 on primary analysis, results of this study found that as the pandemic progressed into W2, older respondents (=56) and those without a history of anxiety were more likely to have less burnout and higher professional fulfillment, raising important questions regarding potential determinants of resilience among healthcare workers. The trend towards improvement of professional fulfillment levels and stability in burnout levels between W1 and W2 may also provide important insight on SGO member wellness and its temporal associations in response to external stressors, while also highlighting the associations of burnout with pan positive screening for anxiety, depression, and PTSD, further adding to the ongoing need to address these mental health issues for our healthcare providers.","Carr, Caitlin, Layne, Tracy, Tomita, Shannon, Wang, Kelly, Saleh, Mona, Zeligs, Kristen, Papatla, Katya, Prasad-Hayes, Monica, Blank, Stephanie","https://www.google.com/search?q=We+Canâ€™t+Just+Wait+This+Out:+Burnout+and+Fulfillment+among+SGO+Members+over+the+First+Two+Waves+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(051)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Gynecologic oncology; 166(2):S34-S35, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38174,""
"Identifying risk factors for compassion fatigue in psychologists in Aotearoa, New Zealand (preprint)","Psychologists work extensively with people experiencing personal and mental health difficulties, providing psychological support and therapeutic interventions. While past research has established that psychologists are at risk of secondary traumatic stress and burnout (together comprising Compassion Fatigue), little is known about the professional and personal circumstances that mitigate their risk. The current study surveyed mental health symptoms and professional quality of life among 149 registered psychologists in Aotearoa, New Zealand (4.1% of the workforce). A broad range of experiences were considered, including psychologistsâ€™ symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, Burnout, Secondary Traumatic Stress, Compassion Satisfaction and resilience, along with contextual factors including caseload, professional support, and personal circumstances, in the second year of the pandemic. LASSO regression was used to identify variables that predicted Compassion Fatigue and Compassion Satisfaction. Although psychologists find their work rewarding and satisfying, our results indicate a high rate of psychological distress and risk of compassion fatigue in our cohort of psychologists, partly associated with increased stress from COVID-19. This study identifies risk factors including COVID related stress, working with clients at risk, and symptoms of stress and anxiety, accounting for 59% of the variance in compassion fatigue. Additional informal supervision support, resilience and increased employer support were predictive of increased Compassion Satisfaction. It is imperative to focus on professional support, personal well-being and manageable caseloads, to ensure a future sustainable psychology workforce.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/52uxh","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38175,""
"Aerial roots elevate indoor plant health: physiological and morphological responses of three high-humidity adapted Araceae species to indoor humidity levels (preprint)","Heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a global increase in urban greenspace appreciation. Indoor plants are equally important for improving mental health and air quality but despite evolving in humid (sub)tropical environments with aerial root types, planting systems ignore aerial resource supply. This study directly compared nutrient uptake preferences of aerial and soil-formed roots of three common houseplant species under high and ambient relative humidities. Growth and physiology parameters were measured weekly for Anthurium andreanum, Epipremnum aureum and Philodendron scandens grown in custom made growth chambers. Both aerial and soil-formed roots were then fed mixtures of nitrate, ammonium and glycine, with one source labelled with N to determine uptake rates and maximum capacities.Aerial roots were consistently better at nitrogen uptake than soil roots but no species, root type or humidity condition showed a preference for a particular nitrogen source. All three species grew more in high humidity, with aerial roots demonstrating the greatest biomass increase. Higher humidities for indoor niches, together with fertiliser application to aerial roots will support indoor plant growth. We discuss how these conditions and growth outcomes will further improve air pollution reductions and human comfort, mental and physical health.","","https://doi.org/10.22541/au.166244405.50380147/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38176,""
"The Impact of Perceived Social Support on Mental Health Stigma and Professional Help-Seeking Behavior among College Teachers in Kerala,India (preprint)","Teaching is a profession, and teachers play numerous responsibilities in shaping generations. The traditional teaching environment was altered during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the new learning and evaluation methods and the new way of interacting with others led to a slew of mental health issues. The present study investigates the impact of perceived social support and mental health stigma on the professional help-seeking behavior of college-level teachers in Kerala, India. Participants (N = 130) were chosen through purposive sampling from various colleges throughout Kerala. The Attitude towards Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale, Stigmatizing Attitude Believability Scale, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were administered to participants to assess professional help-seeking behavior, mental health stigma, and perceived social support. Spearman rank correlation coefficient, linear regression, and moderation analysis were used to analyze the relationship between variables. The findings obtained in the present study depicted a strong positive relationship between perceived social support and professional help-seeking behavior. Furthermore, perceived social support is a positive predictor of professional help-seeking behavior, while mental health stigma is found to be a negative predictor of professional help-seeking activity. The association between mental health stigma and professional help-seeking behavior is also moderated by perceived social support. The present study's findings contribute to understanding the significance of teachers' emotional and mental health well-being in the covid era. The findings shed light on the role of perceived social support as a facilitator that improves teachers' mental health.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2053256/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38177,""
"Perceived Stress and Psychological Impact among practicing dentist in Bengaluru city during the COVID 19 pandemic (preprint)","Introduction:  Public health emergencies like the current pandemic Covid-19 affect the health, safety, and well-being of both individuals and communities with psychological implications. Hence this study intends to evaluate the patterns of perceived psychological stress as well as explore the factors associated with it using the validated Covid- 19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) among practicing dentists in Bengaluru city. Method:  ology The survey used a pretested, self-reported COVID-19 Peritraumatic Stress Index (CPDI) questionnaire. It captures the details concerning anxiety, depression, phobias, cognitive change, avoidance and compulsive behaviour, physical symptoms, and loss of social functioning and collectively quantifies the stress on a scale of 0â€“100. A CPDI score of = 27 indicated low or no stress, 28â€“51 indicated mild to moderate stress, and = 52 indicated severe stress. A sample size of 300 was obtained and descriptive and inferential statistics were done using SSP software version 24. Results: A logistic regression analysis showed that the general practitioners had higher CPDI scores which indicated significantly increased stress (p = 0.000). Similarly, practitioners with work experience between 6-10years showed significantly increased signs of stress. Conclusion:  Every practicing dentist had some form of stress as measured according to CPDI. This is an easy tool that can be used for screening for distress during the pandemic. The risk of contagion, fear or uncertainty of education, financial implications and future practice avenues may be the cause of acute stress.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2047432/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38178,""
"Health Related Quality of Life and its predictors among Postpartum Mother in Southeast Ethiopia: A Cross sectional study (preprint)","Background:  Impaired Health related quality of life (HRQOL) after women's childbirth affects women in a wide range of ways including limiting their daily activity, reducing self-care capacity, impairing childcare including effective breastfeeding and baby weaning, and increasing the cost of medical care, both for women and for their newborn babies. This study aimed to assess the HRQOL and its predictors among postpartum women in Southeast Ethiopia. Methods:  Between March and May 2022, an institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a simply randomly selected sample of 794 postpartum women who were attending immunization services in public health facilities in Southeast Ethiopia. The pretested interviewer-administered structured, Short Form 36 (SF-36), validated questionnaire was used to collect data and to assess the HRQOL. This Descriptive statistics were computed and the bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to predictors of HRQOL. Odds ratio (OR), along with a 95% confidence interval (CI), were used to estimate the strength of the associations. Results: : The mean scores (mean Â± SD) of overall HRQOL, physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) of quality of life were 43.80 Â± 27.88, 45.39 Â± 28.58 and 42.20 Â± 28.15) respectively. Walking to the health facility [(AOR = 2.09;95% CI: (1.31,3.31)], using public transport (AOR=2.58;95% CI=1.69â€“3.93), giving birth to = 3 deliveries (AOR = 1.81;95% CI: 1.36 â€“2.65), having health facility admission history during the recent babyâ€™s pregnancy (AOR=1.62;95% CI=1.08â€“2.44), having postpartum depression (PPD) (AOR=2.13;95% CI=1.57â€“2.89) and having the fear of COVID-19 (AOR=1.46;95% CI=1.08â€“1.99) were predictors of a lower level of HRQOL among postpartum women. Conclusion:  This study revealed that nearly half of the postpartum women had a lower HRQOL. Means of transport used, the number of total deliveries they had, admission history during the recent baby pregnancy, PPD and Fear of COVID 19 ( FCV 19) showed a statistically significant association with the lower overall HRQOL. To improve the HRQOL among postpartum women in Ethiopia, programs should be implemented by applying appropriate strategies that address the identified factors.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2037336/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38179,""
"Childhood trauma and suicide risk in schizophrenia inpatients: the sequential mediating roles of COVID-19 related psychological impact, sleep quality, and emotional distress (preprint)","Purpose:  The stressful global situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on mental health in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. The mediating roles of psychological impacts related to COVID-19 sleep quality and emotional distress were investigated in the association between childhood trauma and suicide risk in inpatients with schizophrenia. Methods A total of 270 participants, including 125 in-patients with schizophrenia and 145 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. Childhood trauma, psychological impact related to COVID-19, global sleep quality, and psychological distress were measured using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaires (CTQ), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. Results The total score and subtype scores of CTQ and the mean scores of the IES-R, PSQI, and DASS-21 in patients with schizophrenia were higher than those in HCs (all p &lt; 0.001). Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that a history of childhood trauma or schizophrenia was a good predictor of psychological impact, global sleep quality, and emotional distress (all p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the chain mediation model showed that the effect of childhood trauma on suicide risk in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia was totally sequentially mediated by thepsychological impact of COVID-19, sleep quality, and emotional distress. Conclusions It is important for clinicians to recognize the increased suicide risk associated with COVID-19-related psychological distress in patients with schizophrenia with a history of childhood trauma.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2036485/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38180,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, life satisfaction, anxiety, stress perception and coping strategies in student-athletes: a comparison between Belarus and Poland - countries with a different approach of anti-pandemic measures (preprint)","Background:  Two years and more of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the lives of people around the world and has had a profound impact on the field of sports. This has resulted in decreased physical activity (PA) and changes in mental health. The goal was to assess self-reported physical activity, life satisfaction, perceived stress, choice of coping strategies and their correlation among student athletes from neighboring countries in the context of various anti-pandemic strategies. Methods Standardized questionnaires: The International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF), The Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Mini-COPE) were used to compare the self-assessment of 600 students from the Physical Education and Sports departments of universities in Belarus (n = 333), where restrictions were found to be less stringent than in neighboring Poland (n = 267). Results The minor differences in PA between the two countries indicate that student athletes have adapted fairly quickly and found ways to keep PA at a fairly high level. Nevertheless, higher PA was recorded in the group of student athletes from Belarus. PA levels correlated with life satisfaction, anxiety and stress levels. Female students from Poland reported lower satisfaction with their lives. Their perception of stress was twice as high as that of their Belarusian counterparts. The most common coping strategy in both groups was active coping. The strategies of avoiding the problem and seeking outside support were used to a lesser extent by Polish respondents. Conclusion The level of physical activity, well-being of student athletes, is associated with increased mental health and coping with stress and contributed to the prevention of affective disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it is dependent on the country's anti-pandemic policies.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2034823/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38181,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care and people with mental health conditions in Ethiopia: the MASC mixed-methods study (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching effects on the mental health of populations around the world, but there has been limited focus on the impact on people with existing mental health conditions. The aim of this study was to examine impact of the pandemic on mental health care and people with mental health conditions in Ethiopia. Methods A convergent mixed methods study was conducted. We systematically mapped information from publicly available reports on impacts of the pandemic on mental health care. Monthly service utilisation data were obtained for the main psychiatric hospital and analysed using segmented linear regression (2019 vs. 2020). In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 purposively selected key informants. Framework analysis was used for qualitative data. Findings from each data source were integrated. Results Despite national level recognition of mental health as a key aspect of pandemic response, this was not translated into action on the ground initially. Mental health-related stigma and discrimination was evident. Scarce mental health service settings were diverted to become COVID-19 treatment centres. Mental health care became narrowly biomedical with poorer quality of care due to infrequent follow-up. Households of people with pre-existing mental health conditions in the community reported worsening poverty and decreased access to care due to restricted movement, decreased availability and fear. Lack of reliable medication supplies increased relapse and the chance of becoming chained at home, abandoned or homeless. Caregiver burden was exacerbated. Within mental health facilities, prisons and residential units, infection control procedures did not adequately safeguard those with mental health conditions. Meanwhile, the needs of people with mental health conditions in COVID-19 quarantine and treatment facilities were systematically neglected. Only late in the day were integrated services developed to address both physical and mental health needs. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic had substantial negative impacts on the lives of people with mental health conditions in Ethiopia. Future emergency response should prioritise the human rights, health, social and economic needs of people with mental health conditions. Integration of mental and physical health care would both expand access to care and increase resilience of the mental health system.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2026109/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38182,""
"Anxiety and depression levels and their influencing factors in community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia in China during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Purpose:  To (1) assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia in China during the epidemic;(2) explore possible influencing factors. Methods Using a cross-sectional survey, we collected 15165 questionnaires. Assessments included demographic information, concern about COVID-19-related information, sleep status, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and accompanying illnesses. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to evaluate depression and anxiety levels. Group comparison was conducted by t-test, ANOVA, or chi-square test wherever suitable with Bonferroni pairwise correction. Multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify predictors for anxiety and depression. Results 16.9% patients had at least moderate anxiety, and 34.9% had at least moderate depression. T-test showed that females scored higher on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 than males, and patients without accompanying long-standing diseases, who were not concerned about the COVID-19 had lower GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores. ANOVA showed that participants aged from 30 to 39, with higher education scored higher on GAD-7, and patients with better sleep, having less concern about the COVID-19 had lower GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores. Regression analysis indicated that participants aged 30â€“39 and 40â€“49 positively predicted anxiety, whereas patients aged 30â€“39 years positively predicted depression. Poor sleep, accompanying diseases, and concerning the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to experience anxiety and depression. Conclusion Chinese community-dwelling schizophrenia patients had high anxiety and depression rates during the pandemic. These patients warrant clinical attention and psychological intervention, especially those with risk factors.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2026091/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38183,""
"Risk of postpartum depressive symptoms is influenced by psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic and dependent from individual stress coping (preprint)","Purpose:  There are different studies worldwide, which have shown a higher risk of mental disorders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One aim of this study was to characterize factors influencing the psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on postpartum depressive symptoms. Further, the role of individual stress and coping strategies was analyzed in this context. Material and Methods 131 women, who were in obstetric care at the LMU Clinic Munich, between March and October 2020, were questioned by different self-report questionnaires, before birth, one month, two months and 6 months after birth. A designed questionnaire to evaluate the psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic, a modified version of the Stress and coping inventory (SCI) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were utilized Results We could show that the psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the EPDS score one, two and 6 months after birth. In addition, the prenatal stress and individual coping strategies affected the EPDS and the burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic before and after birth significantly. Conclusion An association of the psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic with the risk of developing postpartum depressive symptoms could be shown in this study. In this context, the separation of the partner and the family were recognized as important factors. Furthermore, the SCI was identified as effective screening instrument for mothers before delivery to possibly avoid the development of postpartum depression by early diagnosis and intervention.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2025627/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38184,""
"Trend of pediatric trauma during a six-year period in a Level-1 Trauma Center in Northern Italy: epidemiological analysis of trauma mechanisms and the effects of Covid-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Trauma is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. During the Covid-19 pandemic (C-19), different trends for Pediatric Trauma (PT) were described. This study aims to explore the trend over time of PT in our center, also considering the effects of C-19, focusing on trauma mechanisms, violence-related trauma (VRT) and intentionality, especially suicide attempts (SA). Methods: : All PT patients accepted at Niguarda Trauma Center (NTC) in Milan from January 2015 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. We considered demographics and clinical variables and performed descriptive and year comparison analyzes. Results: : 684 PT were accepted at NTC: 84 in 2015, 98 in 2016, 125 in 2017, 119 in 2018, 114 in 2019 and 144 in 2020 (p&lt;0.001);66.2% male, mean age 9.88 (Â± 5.17). We observed a higher number of traffic-related, fall-related injuries and an increasing trend for VRT and SA, peaking in 2020. We report an increasing trend over time for head trauma (p=0.002). The Injury Severity Score did not significantly change. During C-19 we recorded a higher number of self-presenting patients with low priority codes. Conclusions: : NTC is the adult level I referral trauma center for the Milan urban area, with pediatric commitment. During C-19, every traumatic emergency was centralized to NCT. In 2020 we observed an increasing trend of SA and VRT among PTs. The psychological impact of the C-19 restriction could explain this evidence. The long-term effects of C-19 on the mental health of the pediatric population should not be underestimated. Focused interventions on psychological support and prevention of SA and VRT should be implemented, especially during socio-demographic storms like the last pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2021114/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38185,""
"Following the COVID19 playbook and battling another infodemic: Conspiracy beliefs around human Monkeypox among the Lebanese population (preprint)","Introduction:  The non-endemic multicountry outbreak of monkeypox (MPX) has emphasized the issue of conspiracy theories that go viral in times of societal crisis. Now, it is the turn of MPX to join COVID19 in the conspiracy theory realm. Social media outlets were flooded by a scourge of misinformation as soon as MPX cases began to appear with an evident cross-pollination between diverse conspiracy theories. Given the adverse consequences of conspiracy beliefs, this study aimed to assess the extent of endorsement of MPX conspiracy beliefs among the Lebanese population and to identify its associated factors. Methods Using a convenience sampling technique, a web-based cross-sectional was conducted among Lebanese adults. Data was collected using an Arabic self-reported questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with the MPX conspiracy beliefs scale. Results Conspiracy beliefs regarding emerging viruses including MPX were detected among 59.1% of Lebanese adults. Participants endorsed particularly the conspiracy theories linking the virus to a deliberate attempt to reduce the size of the global population (59.6%), gain political control (56.6%) or pharmaceutical companies' financial gain (39.3%), in addition to the manmade origin of MPX (47.5%). Remarkably, the majority of surveyed adults exhibited a negative attitude toward the government's preparedness for a potential MPX outbreak. However, a positive attitude was revealed toward the effectiveness of precautionary measures (69.6%). Female participants and those having a good health status were less likely to exhibit a higher level of conspiracy beliefs. On the contrary, divorced or widowed adults, those having a low economic situation, poor knowledge level, and negative attitude either toward the government or precautionary measures were more prone to disclose a higher level of conspiracy beliefs. Notably, participants relying on social media to get information about MPX were also more likely to have a higher level of conspiracy beliefs compared to their counterparts. Conclusion The widespread extent of conspiracy beliefs endorsement regarding MPX among the Lebanese population urged the policymakers to find ways to reduce peopleâ€™s reliance on these theories. Future studies exploring the harmful impacts of conspiracy beliefs on health behaviors are recommended.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2020448/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38186,""
"The effect of depression on compliance with physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  This study aimed to investigate the possible factors associated with compliance with physical distancing during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on depression. Methods: Korea Community Health Survey data of 2020 were investigated. The group with depression was subdivided according to whether or not they were concerned about COVID-19. The association between depression and compliance was analyzed using multivariate Poisson regression analysis with robust variance estimates. Results: The number of participants was 132,595, and the proportion of compliance with physical distancing was 86.1% in men and 89.1% in women. The prevalence of compliance was 0.939 times lower in men (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.915â€“0.963) and 0.953 times lower in women (95% CI, 0.938â€“0.969) living with depression than in participants who were not depressed. Despite its positive association with compliance, participants who were depressed and had concerns about COVID-19 were not statistically significantly different from those who were not depressed and had no concerns. Conclusions: Depression was associated with poor compliance, and the positive effect of concern about COVID-19 was canceled out by depression. Preparing interventions for depression is necessary in the early stages of a pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2009618/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38187,""
"Long-term effectsÂ of the COVID-19 pandemic on five mental and psychological disorders: in terms of the number of disease visits, drugÂ consumption, and scale scores (preprint)","Background:  COVID-19 caused mild to severe infections in humans. The long-term epidemic environment harms people's mental health. To explore the impact of the epidemic on people's mental and psychological conditions, we surveyed in Wenzhou. Methods: : We collected the data of people who visited the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University for five types of mental and psychological diseases from January 2018 to December 2021. Then, taking December 2019 as the cut-off point, the 48-month data were divided into the pre-epidemic group and the dur-epidemic group. Based on the above data, statistical analysis was done. Results: : From 2018 to 2021, the number of initial diagnoses, the number of disease visits, and drug consumption for these five types of mental and psychological diseases were all on the rise. Compared with the number of disease visits for all disorders in both psychiatry and neurology departments, it was found that the growth rate of these five diseases was higher than the growth rate of all disorders. We found that the number of disease visits, drug consumption, and scale scores after the COVID-19 outbreak were significantly different from those before the outbreak (P&lt;0.05). And the number of disease visits positively correlated with drug consumption (P&lt;0.0001, r=0.9503), which verified the stability of the data. Conclusion:  The epidemic environment has had a long-term and negative impact on people's mental and psychological conditions. Therefore, whether or not the epidemic is receding, we still need to be concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on mental and psychological health.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2005870/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38188,""

"Factors associated with mental health symptoms among UK autistic children and young people and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Objective:  The current study examined the mental health symptoms of autistic children and young people and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic in two pre-existing well-characterised cohorts. We explored whether child, family or environmental factors were associated with child and parental mental health symptoms during the pandemic. Method:  Participants were parents/carers of autistic children in the ASTAR ( N =67, M age 9 years) and QUEST ( N =112, M age 17 years) cohorts. Early in the UK pandemic, parents completed a brief online survey developed specifically to measure the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that asked about child and parental mental health, infection experience, and changes to education arrangements, family life, housing and finances. Results: : More engagement and enjoyment in education provision and going outside was associated with better child and parental mental health. Multivariate multiple linear regression models were used to test the associations between child, family and environmental factors and pandemic-time mental health symptoms. Amongst pre-adolescent autistic children, pre-existing ADHD was a key factor associated with more behavioural/ADHD symptoms during the pandemic. Higher pre-existing parental mental health problems was also associated with more parental mental health symptoms during the pandemic. Financial concerns were also a risk factor for worse parental mental health during the pandemic. Conclusions: : Knowledge of pre-existing mental health and pandemic-related stressors may help care planning. Encouraging engagement and enjoyment in education and promoting physical exercise are important intervention targets. Ensuring access to ADHD medication and support is important, especially if this is managed jointly across school and home.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1993442/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38190,""
"Healthcare- Seeking Behaviours and the Impact of Covid-19 preventive Measures on Anxiety and Depression among Survivors of Covid-19 at the Buea Regional Hospital Cameroon: A Case Control Study (preprint)","Background:  The outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic led to the implementation of preventive measures to curb the spread of the virus. The fear of contracting the virus and some infection prevention and control measures have been associated with poor mental and brain health outcomes . We therefore assessed the health care- seeking behaviours and the impact of COVID-19 preventive measures on depression and anxiety among survivors of COVID-19 at the Buea Regional Hospital. Materials:  and Methods The study design was an unmatched case control study. Cases were identified from health facility records and the controls were patients who are inhabitants of same community. Data was collected using an online google questionnaire and a physical questionnaire which was self-administered .We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess anxiety and depression. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25.0 and a P-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant . Results:  We recruited 245 participants with the mean age for our participants being 32.89Â±13.17years. With regards to Health care -seeking behaviours 78.9 vs 75.1% (OR 1.24, CI: 0.65-2.38) sought care from the hospital among the cases and controls respectively. Survivors of COVID-19 were about 12 times more likely to seek for conventional medication as a treatment for their disease (OR 11.96, 95% CI: 6.25-22.90, p=0.000) compared to the controls. Survivors of COVID-19 presented with higher mean scores for depression and anxiety compared to the controls respectively (7.74Â±3.93 vs. 4.01Â±4.48, p=0.000), (6.84Â±3.87 vs. 3.10Â±3.75, p=0.000). Participants who wore face mask were 3 times more likely to be anxious and depressed than those who did not. Factors associated with adverse mental health outcomes were losing a love one due to COVID-19, quarantine and social isolation among the cases Conclusions:  Health care seeking behaviour was more appropriate in the cases than the controls. COVID-19 preventive measures were associated with a negative psychosocial impact among COVID-19 survivors;thus public health officials should implement measures targeting psychosocial support of the population","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1990751/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38191,""
"Gender Differences in the Relationships between Meaning in Life, Mental Health Status and Digital Media Use during Covid-19 (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on individualsâ€™ social lives, mental health status, and meaning in life (MIL). Globally, the use of different types of digital media has become a proxy for pre-COVID social lives for many people. This study investigated gender differences in the relationship between use of digital media, mental health status and MIL, during COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Methods This cross-sectional study surveyed 1,488 young people recruited via city-wide random sampling in 2021. Respondents completed a phone survey on digital media use, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2), COVID-19 impact, meaning in life, and demographics. Gender differences in MIL were tested with an independent sample t-test. Gender-specific multiple linear regression models tested associations between MIL and explanatory variables of age, educational level, history of diagnosis, digital media use, and mental health status. Results There was a significant gender difference in MIL (males (M = 12.90, SD = 4.12);females (M = 13.45, SD = 3.96);t (1485) = -2.656, p  = .008). For males, all predictor variables significantly contributed to MIL ( F (9, 759) = 15.731, p  &lt; .000, R 2  = .157). However, for females, while the overall model for MIL was significant ( F (9, 709) = 12.105, p  &lt; .001, R 2  = .133), the only significant predictor variable was mental health status. Conclusion Females had significantly better MIL under COVID-19 than males. Digital media use contributed to MIL in males but not females, and there were gender-specific predictors of MIL.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1988396/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38192,""
"Psychopathological risk stability and change in a sample of mothers and preschool children before, during and after the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Numerous studies have found that the COVID-19 epidemic and the measures to stop it have had a substantial impact on the mental health of the general population. Nevertheless, the majority of this research only looked at the variations in the degree of psychopathological symptoms in individuals before and after the first wave of the pandemic. In a sample of N = 380 preschoolers and their mothers assessed through the Symptom Check-List/90-R and of the Child Behavior Check-List, the present study aimed at exploring psychopathological risk in mothers and their offspringâ€™s dysregulation levels before (T1), during (T2) and after (T3) the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Our main results showed that mothersâ€™ relational distress increased from T1 to T2 and then increased again from T2 to T3. Moreover, maternal aggressiveness, hostility, and anxiety scores significantly decreased from T1 to T2 but slightly increased from T2 to T3. In children, dysregulation levels increased from T1 to T2 but decreased from T2 to T3. Children of mothers with clinical scores at the SCL-90/R showed significantly higher dysregulation problems at T1, T2 and T3 than children of mothers with scores below the clinical threshold. This study adds to previous literature in that it evaluates stability or change in maternal and offspring scores not only in the pre-pandemic period and during the first wave of the pandemic, but it also considers the subsequent months, focusing on a broad range of maternal symptoms, rather than assessing depressive and anxiety symptoms as most of previous research did.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1987856/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38193,""
"Consistent Comparison of Symptom-based Methods for COVID-19 Infection Detection (preprint)","Multiple COVID-19 diagnosis methods based on information collected from patients have been proposed during the global pandemic crisis, with the aim of providing medical staff with quick diagnosis tools to efficiently plan and manage the limited healthcare resources. In general, these methods have been developed to detect COVID-19 positive cases from a particular combination of reported symptoms, and have been evaluated using datasets extracted from different studies with different characteristics. On the other hand, the University of Maryland, in partnership with Facebook, launched the Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (UMD-CTIS), the largest health surveillance tool to date that has collected information from 114 countries/territories since April 2020. This survey captured various individual features including gender, age groups, self-reported symptoms, isolation measures, and mental health status, among others. In this paper, we compare the performance of different proposed COVID-19 diagnosis methods using the information collected by UMD-CTIS, for the years 2020 and 2021, in five countries: Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan, and South Africa. The evaluation of these methods with homogeneous data across countries and years provides a solid and consistent comparison among them.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1987156/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38194,""
"Covid-19 pandemic induced traumatizing medical job contents and mental health distortions of physicians working in private practices and in hospitals (preprint)","Background:  The traumatic burden of the Covid-19 pandemic during its early phases posed significant psychological threats particularly for medical frontline personal. It is unclear whether the medical workforce with the passage of time has adapted to these threats or whether emotional perturbations have generalized to wider medical settings. Participants and Methods: An online survey was conducted among 1,476 physicians. Valid data were achieved from 1,327 participants. A pandemic induced job context score was built by nine items. Depression and anxiety were screened with the PHQ-2 and the GAD-2. Results:  Among a subtotal of 1,139 (86.6%) physicians with personal treatment experiences with Covid-19 patients, 553 (84.8%) worked in a private practice (PP) and 586 (88.3%) in a hospital (HP). Covid-19 provoked profound conflicts between professional and ethical values: more physicians in PPs than HPs reported external constraints on their medical care being in conflict with the code of medical ethics (39.1% vs. 34.4%, p&lt;0.002). However, significantly more HPs failed to maintain the dignity of their patients during the pandemic (48% vs. 27%, p&lt; 0.0001). Prevalence of depression was 23.0% and 24.16% for anxiety. Comparison with mean PHQ-2 and GAD-2 data from reference groups among physicians with comparable size and settings during the first wave of Covid-19 revealed a significant increase in mental health distortions. A total of 63.3% HPs and 53.4% PPs reported feelings of helplessness associated with female sex, minor years of medical experience, being weakened by sleeping problems (OR= 2.5) and being encountered to unsettling events (OR=3.4). The association between exposure to unsettling events and helplessness was significantly mediated by sleep disturbances (Indirect path: ÃŸ= 0.29, S E= 0.03, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: : Major Covid-19 induced stress job content issues have broadened to more medical disciplines beyond frontline workers. Mental health deteriorations and feelings of helplessness among physicians have become frequent.

"Addressing social determinants of health is a priority for managing COVID-19 in Arctic Indigenous communities: results of a scoping review (preprint)","Background:  Arctic Indigenous communities are unique, geographically remote and/or isolated, and currently among the most susceptible populations in the world to the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since colonization, Indigenous communities have been particularly susceptible to infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: . This study reviewed current knowledge regarding social determinants of health (SDH) and pandemics in Arctic Canada and highlighted the implications of the current COVID-19 pandemic on individuals, families, and communities in Arctic Canada.Studies published in English and French pertaining to SDH or pandemics in the Canadian Arctic were located using key search words in three databases (PubMed, Medline, and CINAHL) as well as reference tracking of relevant articles up to September 2021. Studies were categorized according to infectious disease (COVID-19, H1N1 influenza, and tuberculosis) or SDH (healthcare access, food security, mental health, socioeconomic status, cultural continuity, housing, and community infrastructure). NVivo was used to theme and sub-theme findings of selected studies. Results: . One hundred studies were included in this scoping review. Two articles related to COVID-19, five to influenza, and five to TB;27 healthcare access, 19 to food security, 17 to mental health, nine to SES, seven to cultural continuity, six to housing, and three to community infrastructure. Documented lessons learned from previous pandemics in Arctic communities provides evidence to inform public health policies and culturally safe programs for the current COVID-19 pandemic where many SDH exist as challenges for Indigenous communities. The SDH included limited healthcare access, food insecurity, mental health challenges, low socioeconomic status, limited cultural considerations in healthcare, and suboptimal housing. These findings are also relevant to Indigenous communities in other Arctic regions facing similar challenges due to the pandemic. Conclusions: .: It is essential to understand how SDH underlie the health and wellbeing of Indigenous communities in the Arctic and to utilize this information to inform critical policy and practice decisions for COVID-19 prevention, management, and treatment. This review indicated that many SDH are unique to Canadian Arctic settings and pose specific challenges for the prevention and management of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1972219/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38196,""

"Study of knowledge, attitude and anxiety in Kurdistan-region of Iraqi population during the monkeypox outbreak in 2022: An online cross-sectional study (preprint)","Background:  On July 23, the WHO declared the rapidly spreading monkeypox (MPX) epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). This study attempted to assess the knowledge, attitude, and anxiety levels of the general population during the MPX outbreak. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted during the period July 27 and July 30, 2022, using a convenience sampling method. The questionnaire was adapted and developed after an in-depth review of the previous studies. Results A total of 510 respondents participated in this study. 277 (54.3%) were male, 233 (45.7%) were female. Participants had insufficient knowledge of MPX with a mean and SD deviation 2.096 Â± 1.359, 2.576 Â± 1.466, having a normal attitude toward MPX 4.031 Â± 1.645. Moreover, they had anxiety problems 32.382 Â± 10.094. There were significant differences in the mean rank scores of the knowledge of respondents about MPX according to their gender, marital status, religion, level of education, and place of residence, with p-values of 0.009, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000, and 0.000, respectively. Also, there were significant differences in the mean rank scores of attitudes of respondents toward MPX according to their gender, level of education, place of residence, and age, with p-values of 0.011, 0.020, and 0.000, 0,029, respectively. Lastly, there were significant differences in the mean rank score of anxiety of respondents toward MPX according to their gender, marital status, religion, level of education, and place of residence, with p-values of 0.000, 0.009, 0.000, 0.000, and 0.000 respectively. Conclusion There is an urgent need to raise public awareness and manage people's emotional wellbeing. Taking into account the alarming scenario of rapid rise in MPX cases in many countries, any feasible pandemic probability of this disease amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, proactive control measures, necessary preventive strategies and preparedness plans need to be executed on priority to counteract this global health emergency as well as safeguard the mental health of the general public. Appropriate policies and effectively prevent and control strategies along with disseminating correct information would explicitly help in counteracting MPX outbreaks and avoiding the infodemic's misinformation and disinformations which could pose unwarranted high fears and panic, and ultimately aid in safeguarding the mental health of the people.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1961934/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38198,""

The informants of this study were pregnant women (n=20). Data analysis used content analysis with software (Nvivo Release 1.5). Results:  The results of the study are four themes namely increasing worries for pregnant women due to lack of knowledge about the impact of COVID-19;the efforts to reduce anxiety through spiritual, positive thoughts, and the role of the family;the efforts to prevent the pandemic exposure through reducing direct social relations, changing social life online, meeting nutritional, and strict health protocols;and the expectancy of pregnant women to the impact of the pandemic is the change in the health care system in health facilities. Conclusion:  The COVID-19 pandemic impacts the lives of pregnant women in a complex manner, mainly on anxiety. The efforts and expectations of pregnant women can be a reference in developing health service innovations in health facilities, especially pregnant women, to create a sense of physical and psychological security and comfort for pregnant women from the threat of COVID-19.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1954497/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38199,""

"Online Education Trajectory during the COVID-19 Pandemic Among the Bangladeshi Adolescent Children (preprint)","Bangladesh adopted both cutting-edge technology and the pandemic almost simultaneously. Because of this, the government and other groups were able to respond quickly to the evolving situation. Although many sectors, including education, went through a difficult adjustment, the process of adapting was relatively swift. There was an attempt to implement the ""New Normal"". Teachers and educational institutions modified their methods of instruction. But because of a shortage of resources, it wasn't always advantageous for the students. It may be possible to reduce the vulnerabilities of the online learning that started during the pandemic through strategic ways, including introducing a new policy for a defined amount of time and involving community members. The cooperation of multiple stakeholders will make it easier to identify any potential flaws and difficulties in Bangladesh's online education system.

Participants were 229 Italian adolescent high school students (48.9% males, mean age = 16.64). The research design was based on an exploratory, parallel, mixed-method approach. A multi-method, student-centered, computer-assisted, semi-structured online interview was used as the data gathering tool, including both a standardized quantitative questionnaire on perceived well-being and an open-ended question about how adolescents were taking charge of their well-being during the COVID-19 health emergency. Main findings reveal general low levels of perceived well-being during the syndemic, especially in girls and in older adolescents. Higher levels of well-being are associated with more affiliative strategies (we-ness/togetherness) whereas low levels of well-being are linked with more individualistic strategies (I-ness/separatedness) in facing the health emergency. These findings identify access to social support as a strategy for coping with situational stress and raise reflection on the importance of balancing the need for physical distancing to protect from infection, and the need for social closeness to maintain good mental health.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1937451/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38202,""
"Reshaping mental health care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic: service response and telepsychiatry in a catchment area of 10 million people (preprint)","Background:  Detailed information on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on large public health systems is lacking. Here we describe the overall functioning of a regional network comprising 58 community mental health centres (CMHCs), which covers a catchment area of approximately 10 million people. Methods:  We employed a registryâ€“based approach to summarize descriptive information on demographic and clinical data retrieved from all CMHCs over a twoâ€“year period, grouped according to the provinces of Lombardy in Italy. We then described the progression of all subtypes of remote vs. in-person consultations across provinces after the onset of the pandemic, and calculated remote/faceâ€“toâ€“face service delivery ratios according to gender, age and main diagnosis. Results:  Compared to the previous year, the largest drop of outpatient contacts was recorded in provinces that were most affected by the early impact of the viral outbreak, peaking in March and May 2020 (-21.89% and -16.86% respectively). A progressive increase of telepsychiatry interventions was observed diffusely, reaching a peak of almost one every four consultations. Remote/faceâ€“toâ€“face ratios were significantly higher in females across all age and diagnostic subgroups, in patients from lower age groups and with diagnoses of Eating and Obsessiveâ€“Compulsive disorders. Conclusions:  Our study is the first to describe the impact of the pandemic on a large public mental health system. Future research on service uptake and costâ€“effectiveness of blended remote delivery should be tailored to service users of different age groups and clinical diagnoses to optimize organization of services.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1929643/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38203,""
"Exploring the impact of Covid-19 on those living with an eating disorder in the UK (preprint)","Introduction:  During the early stages of the pandemic there was concern raised regarding the impact of Covid-19 on those with eating disorders due to the loss of eating and social routines, disrupted access to food and the increased societal prominence. The primary aim of this study was to establish how individuals with eating disorders in the UK have been affected by the covid-19 pandemic. Method:  Using an online mixed methods survey, a total of 1121 participants completed the survey to explore the impact that covid-19 restrictions had on their eating disorder and access to services. Findings:  Findings of this survey showed that there were a considerable number of individuals reporting negative impacts on their mental health and well-being, with many reporting the detrimental impact that they felt that this time had on their recovery (87%, n=785). Over a quarter of participants reported that covid-19 had stopped them from accessing help and 80% of participants reported changes to their delivery of care. Of those who receive physical health monitoring as part of their care prior to the pandemic, almost half reported considerable changes to their care. Conclusions: : Lessons from this growing evidence should be learned to ensure that we are able to better protect people with eating disorders in future pandemics as well as using these findings to plan service for future demand where individualsâ€™ recovery has been considerably impacted.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1920819/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38204,""
"Fatigue, sleep quality and mental health symptoms in Brazilian women during the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ longitudinal study (preprint)","Purposes:  To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the variables of sleep quality, fatigue, anxiety, and depression in healthy Brazilian women. Methods:  Longitudinal observational study conducted through an online questionnaire with women in 2020 and 2021. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Fatigue Severity Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used. The data were analyzed descriptively and the comparison between the data obtained in the first and second evaluation was performed using the McNemar test. A logistic regression was applied to test the association between the variables that showed a significant difference. Results:  A total of 235 women responded to the questionnaires. There was a significant increase in fatigue between the two moments (p &lt; 0.05). In the first assessment, depression (OR: 2.39;95% CI: 1.14â€“4.99), anxiety (OR: 2.68;95% CI: 1.37â€“5.22) and sleep quality (OR: 4.01;95% CI: 1.71â€“9.67) were associated with fatigue.

"Assessing safe and personalised maternity and neonatal care through a pandemic: a case study of outcomes and experiences in two Trusts in England using the ASPIRE COVID-19 framework (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound and far-reaching impacts on maternal and newborn care and outcomes. As part of the ASPIRE COVID-19 project, we describe processes and outcome measures relating to safe and personalised maternity care in England. Methods: : We undertook a mixed-methods system-wide case study using quantitative routinely collected data and qualitative data from two Trusts and their service users. We mapped findings to our prior conceptual framework that explains pathways for the impact of COVID-19 on safe and personalised care. Results: : The ASPIRE framework enabled us to develop a comprehensive, systems-level understanding of the impact of the pandemic on service delivery, user experience and staff wellbeing, and place it within the context of pre-existing challenges. However, timely routine clinical and staffing data were not always available. Personalised care and user and staff experiences were poorly captured by routine data. Maternity services experienced some impacts on core service coverage, though not on Trust level clinical health outcomes (with the possible exception of readmissions in one Trust). Both users and staff found some pandemic-driven changes challenging such as remote or reduced antenatal and community postnatal contacts, and restrictions on companionship. Other key changes included an increased need for mental health support, changes in the availability and uptake of home birth services and changes in induction procedures. Many emergency adaptations persisted at the end of data collection. Differences between the Trusts indicate complex change pathways. Staff reported some removal of bureaucracy, which allowed greater flexibility. During the first wave of COVID-19 staffing numbers increased, resolving some pre-pandemic shortages: however, by October 2021 they declined markedly. Trying to maintain the quality and availability of services had marked negative consequences for personnel. Conclusions: : The COVID-19 crisis magnified pre-pandemic problems, in particular, poor staffing levels. Maintaining services took a significant toll on staff wellbeing. There is some evidence that these pressures are continuing. There was marked variation in Trust responses. Lack of accessible and timely data at Trust and national levels hampered rapid insights. The ASPIRE COVID-19 framework could be useful for modelling the impact of future crises on routine care.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1908970/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38206,""
"A randomised control trial to compare clinical and cost-effectiveness of an on-line parent-led treatment for child anxiety problems with usual care in the context of COVID-19 delivered in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in the UK (Co-CAT): A study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (preprint)","â€¢ Background In the context of COVID-19, NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and other childrenâ€™s mental health services have faced major challenges in providing psychological treatments that (i) work when delivered remotely, and (ii) can be delivered efficiently to manage increases in referrals as social distancing measures have been relaxed. Anxiety problems are a common reason for referral to CAMHS, children with pre-existing anxiety problems are particularly vulnerable in the context of COVID-19, and there were concerns about increases in childhood anxiety as schools reopened. The proposed research will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a brief online parent-led cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) delivered by the OSI (Online Support and Intervention for child anxiety) platform with remote support from a CAMHS therapist compared to 'COVID-19 treatment as usualâ€™ (C-TAU) in CAMHS and other childrenâ€™s mental health services throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. â€¢ Methods We will conduct a two arm, multi-site, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of OSI with therapist support compared to CAMHS and other child mental health services 'COVID-19 treatment as usual' (C-TAU) during the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore parent and therapists' experiences. â€¢ Discussion If non-inferiority is shown, the research will provide:1) a solution for efficient psychological treatment for child anxiety disorders while social distancing (for the COVID-19 context and future pandemics);2) an efficient means of treatment delivery as â€˜normal serviceâ€™ resumes to enable CAMHS to cope with the anticipated increase in referrals;as well as 3) a demonstration of rapid, high quality evaluation and application of online interventions within NHS CAMHS to drive forward much-needed further digital innovation and evaluation in CAMHS settings. The primary beneficiaries will be children with anxiety disorders and their families, NHS CAMHS teams, and commissioners who will access a potentially effective, cost-effective, and efficient treatment for child anxiety problems. â€¢ Trial registration This trial was registered prospectively on the ISRCTN: ISRCTN12890382 (date of registration 23/10/2020). https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN12890382","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1895178/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38207,""
"International Recruitment of Mental Health Nurses to the National Health Service: A Challenge for the UK (preprint)","The UKâ€™s National Health Service (NHS) has been dealing with a shortage in the nursing workforce for the past few decades. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and post-Brexit effects, it is important now more than ever to concentrate on recruiting new staff and retaining current staff in the National Health Service. The increasing demand for mental health services stresses the importance of prioritising recruitment of mental health nurses. One of the main strategies being implemented to combat this shortage is the recruitment of internationally trained mental health nurses. Whilst this is a favourable solution, the multiple challenges this proposal brings makes it hard for the National Health Service to practically implement this to increase staff numbers. In this discursive position paper, we consider the difficulties the National Health Service is currently facing in terms of recruiting mental health nurses and then discuss the importance of and need for international recruitment including the strategies that are currently being implemented. The challenges and obstacles associated with this proposed resolution will also be addressed.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1862214/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38208,""
"Psychotropic Consumption Before and During Covid-19 in Asturias, Spain (preprint)","BACKGROUND: Spain as multiple other countries, has been experiencing an increasing and sustained trend in the use of psychotropic medications since the mid 90s. Recent studies show public health measures implemented to control SARS-Cov2, such as mobility restrictions and the shutdown of nonessential activities increased mental suffering, even contributing to a higher number of anxiety, depression and insomnia disorders that could lead to an increase in the consumption of psychotropics. The aims were: 1) Evaluate the temporal trend in psychotropic consumption by therapeutic subgroup, sex, and age group 2) Estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in the use of psychotropic drugs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study, retrieving all prescriptions of anxiolytics, hypnotics/sedatives, and antidepressants dispensed in pharmacies of Asturias (Northern Spain) for Primary Care patients for the period 2018-2021.We presented the data expressed in Daily Defined Doses (DDDs) for 1000 persons/day (DHD). To estimate changes in DHDs by year and age group we conducted 2 multiple linear regressions (one for males and one for females) for every therapeutic subgroup studied. Changes were considered statistically significant when the regression coefficient was p&lt;0.05. We used the Software R 4.1.0. RESULTS: For the studied period, the highest DHDs are for antidepressants, although all of the subgroups experienced an increase in consumption rates.Women consumed more psychotropic drugs than men. In 2021, 372 out of every 1,000 women were taking daily 1 DDD of these drugs versus 184 out of every 1,000 men. Consumption rates for all psychotropic drugs progressively increases with age. Conversely, the biggest increases in consumption were among the youngest age groups (0-14 years, 43.2% increase and 15-29 years, 35.1% increase).The regression models suggest an upward trend in psychotropic consumption during all the period, especially remarkable from 2020, for both genders and all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: -The growing and sustained trend in consumption of psychotropic drugs for the recent years has increased since the start of the SARS-COV2 pandemic for both sexes, especially from 2020 onwards. This trend is consistent with the observed national one.-The increase observed on children and adolescents is a matter of concern.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1859526/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38209,""
"The COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s impact on mental health care use among Norwegian students in higher education: a nation-wide register-based pre-post cohort study (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic, and its associated social distancing measures, gave profound changes to the everyday and academic life of students in higher education. The current study is the first to use nation-wide data to evaluate the long-term effect of the pandemic and its countermeasures on university studentsâ€™ mental health care use. Methods: : Using nation-wide individual-level data, we studied mental health consultations in primary care (data available from January 2017 to February 2022) and dispensed prescription drugs used to treat anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances (data available from October 2018 to February 2021) for first-year undergraduate university students. We compared changes over time in mental health care use in a pandemic cohort (12,501 first-year students enrolled in 2019) to the same change in a pre-pandemic cohort (25,990 first-year students enrolled in 2017 and 2018). Event study and difference-in-difference models allowed us to separate the impact of the pandemic, experienced by the pandemic cohort only, from secular and seasonal changes experienced by all cohorts. Results: : The percentage of students with a mental health consultation temporarily decreased during the first pandemic lockdown in March 2020. At the end of the second lockdown in April 2021, the level of mental health consultations increased by 73 % (95 % CI 40-106.3). There was also a 42,6 % (95 % CI 5.7-79.5) increase in mental health consultations in fall 2021. No similar increases were observed for dispensed prescription drugs between March 2020 and February 2021. Conclusions: : Longer periods of strict lockdown measures were temporally associated with increases in mental health consultations in primary care among students. The benefits of social distancing measures in future pandemic preparedness should be weighed against the cost of potentially worsening mental health in vulnerable groups.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1838986/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38210,""
"Negative representations of night-shift work and mental health of public hospital healthcare workers in the COVID-19 era (Aladdin survey) (preprint)","Background:  Many risk factors impact the health of hospital night workers, which can lead to physical and mental health disorders. During the recent period, night hospital workers have been particularly stressed. This study therefore aims to: (i) To document the prevalence of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and symptoms suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder in NSHW working in Parisian public hospitals after Franceâ€™s first COVID-19 wave ended;(ii) To estimate the effect of negative representations and perceptions of night shift work on these mental health outcomes. Methods An observational cross-sectional online survey of NSHW (June to September 2020) in 39 public hospitals in Paris, France. Standard scales were used to measure mental health outcomes. Weighted multinomial logistic regression helped identify predictors of depression (score&gt;10 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS, for depression), anxiety (score&gt;10 on the HADS for anxiety), severe insomnia (score&gt;21 on the Insomnia Severity Index, ISI) and symptoms suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder (score&gt;36 on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R). Results The weighted prevalence rates [95% confidence interval] of depression, anxiety, severe insomnia, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder were, respectively, 18.9% [16.5-21.2], 7.6% [6.0-9.1], 8.6% [6.9-10.2] and 11.7% [9.7-13.6]. After multiple adjustment, organizational changes in NSHW professional lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic (such as moving to another hospital department and modified schedules) and NSHW-perceived negative representations of night work were significantly associated with all studied mental health outcomes. Conclusion Findings confirm the importance of monitoring mental health and sleep quality among NSHW in Parisian public hospitals, even more during health crises. Multilevel interventions aiming at reducing negative representations and improving work organization are urgently needed to improve overall health of this frontline healthcare providers group.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1807323/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38211,""
"Reading comprehension in undergraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic Associations with executive function difficulties, reading habits and screen times (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic and its concomitant restriction measures drastically altered the routines and learning formats of students from all levels. In addition, it has been shown that pandemic-related stress negatively impacted their mental health and cognitive functioning. Undergraduates have been signaled out as one of the populations most vulnerable to pandemic-related stressors. The following work examined the link between executive functions, perceived stress and reading comprehension among Argentinean university students during lockdown measures. In addition, potential effects of reading habits and screen exposure were considred. An executive function behavioral rating scale (ADEXI), a reading comprehension test and the PSS-10 stress questionnaire were administered to two-hundred social science students through an online survey. Executive difficulties increased with perceived stress, while lower inhibition was associated with longer TV times and being male. Stress and executive function associations can be interpreted as a detrimental effect, reverse or bidirectional causation. In turn, working memory issues led to worse comprehension (mediating the impact of perceived stress) while distal factors such as print exposure and mother education were positive predictors of reading outcomes (as expected). This finding suggests that undergraduatesâ€™ difficulties to manipulate online information interfered with expository text processing, resulting in poorer comprehension performance.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1804651/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38212,""
"Online Yoga Instruction Improves Resilience in Athletes During the COVID -19 Pandemic (preprint)","The mental and emotional health of an athlete is crucial for their performance and well-being. Sports-related stress can significantly impair that mental health. Yoga of Immortals (YOI) is a unique combination of specific yogic postures, breathing exercises, sound therapy &amp;amp;meditation, which has demonstrated benefit in improving measures of mental health. This study used the Sports Mind Inventory (SMI) to examine whether YOI can improve the resilience of athletes to sports-related stress. Participants were a diverse set of athletes based in Mauritius who routinely engage in a wide range of athletic activities. Participants were randomly assigned to receive four weeks of YOI or no intervention. Both groups completed the SMI questionarie at baseline and again after four weeks. The YOI intervention significantly increased the total mean SMI scores by 14%, indicating improved sports resilience and psychological health. No improvement was observed in the control group.

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in nursing homes â€“ the experience of care workers in Poland (preprint)","Background:  Nursing homes in Poland are the most common formal care institutions for dependent people. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, nursing homes had particularly high infection rates. In this context, it is important to ask about the experiences of the care workers working in these institutions. Methods: : This research was conducted using the computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) technique in five provinces in Poland. The field research was carried out in April 2021. The research sample included, among others, nurses, care workers, therapists, social workers and the management staff of institutions whose representatives worked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were asked to assess the care provided to residents. Results: : It turned out that the vast majority of respondents positively assessed the fulfillment of the basic living needs of residents and the availability of care. The assessment of the organization of residentsâ€™ leisure time, the fulfillment of their religious and cultural needs, and the issue of maintaining contacts with the social environment was less satisfactory. The article also describes the results of care institution employeesâ€™ self-assessment of their mental health. For the majority, the most stressful factor was the need to work in a health-threatening environment and the sense of responsibility for the residents. Regarding the availability of the forms of support offered to workers experiencing deteriorating mental health due to working in the pandemic situation, more than a third said that their institution did not offer any form of assistance. Conclusions: : The article lists a number of recommendations. In the light of the data obtained, it is necessary to increase the intensity of services provided to residents of nursing homes in terms of organizing their free time, meeting their religious and cultural needs and maintaining contact with the social environment.","","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.124984.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38214,""
"Assessing the Impacts of COVID-19 and Social Isolation on Mental Health in the United States of America (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the world at large with over 500 million cases and over 6 million deaths reported thus far. Of those, over 85 million cases and 1 million deaths have occurred in the United States of America (USA). The mental health of the general population has been impacted by several aspects of the pandemic including lockdowns, media sensationalism, social isolation, and spread of the disease. In this paper, we examine the effect that social isolation and COVID-19 infection and related death had on the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the general population of the USA in a state-by-state multiple time-series analysis. Vector Error Correction Models are estimated and we subsequently evaluated the coefficients of the estimated models and calculated their impulse response functions for further interpretation. We found that variables related to COVID-19 overall led to an increase both anxiety and depression across the studied period, while variables related to social isolation had a varied effect depending on the state being considered. Both conclusions have important implications for future pandemics.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.09.22277383","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38215,""
"A cross-sectional study of low birth satisfaction among Iranian postpartum women during COVID-19 epidemicsâ€™ fifth wave (preprint)","Background Birth dissatisfaction may increase the risk for postpartum depression and requests for an elective cesarean for the next birth. The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on the healthcare systems and their users in many aspects. We investigated predictors of birth satisfaction in a sample of Iranian postpartum women during the COVID-19 epidemicsâ€™ fifth wave. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted on 601 postpartum women admitted to postpartum wards of Mobini maternity hospital using a convenience sampling method between 2 Aug and 18 September 2021. We collected data on socio-demographic, obstetric, labor and birth, and psychological variables. We used the general linear model and multiple linear regression analyses to determine predictors of birth satisfaction. Results The mean birth satisfaction score was 28.6Â±7.3. The percentages of mothers who gave birth by elective and emergency cesarean were 19.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Overall predictors of birth satisfaction were emergency cesarean [-7.463(-9.310, -5.616), instrumental birth [-3.571(-6.907, -0.235)], episiotomy [-2.227 (-3.591, -0.862)], Entonox analgesia [-1.548(-2.726, -0.371)], Well-being score &lt; 50 [-1.812(-3.146, -0.478)], fear of COVID-19 [-1.216(-2.288,, -0.144)], low satisfaction with pregnancy -2.539(-3.952, -1.127) and low satisfaction with spouseâ€™s support [-2.419(-4.598, -0.240)]. Conclusions During the pandemic, fear of COVID-19, low level of well-being, low satisfaction with pregnancy and low satisfaction with spouseâ€™s support as well as womenâ€™s experience of emergency cesarean, instrumental birth, episiotomy, and Entonox analgesia, are exerting negative influences on birth satisfaction. To improve birth satisfaction and thus maternal mental health interventions to lower fear of contracting COVID-19 and reduce rates of episiotomy, emergency cesarean, and instrumental birth are recommended.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.08.22279714","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38216,""
"Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) study on COVID-19 among the general population of Nepal (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the global health challenges in the current context. In Nepal, the first confirmed case was reported on 23 January 2020, and since then it has resulted in several negative impacts including economic disruption and deterioration of physical and mental health. In such a pandemic, it is indispensable to understand the knowledge and behavioral patterns of the general population regarding COVID-19. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice on COVID-19, among the general population and its relationship with socio-demographic conditions. The questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from eight districts of Nepal which included Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Morang, Sunsari, Rupandehi, Chitwan, and Kaski. Descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, and a logistic regression model were used for analysis. The study showed that 93.3% of respondents had knowledge of overall preventive practice whereas only 32% had knowledge of overall symptoms of COVID-19. Regarding attitude, only 14.3% believed that they will get rid of COVID-19 soon. The preventive practice was reduced after lockdown compared to that during lockdown. The respondents with white-collar occupations, high-income, and unmarried were good at KAP. Similarly, highly educated and those residing in urban areas had good knowledge and practice. The study findings will help in the development of targeted programs to improve the knowledge, attitude, practice of the general population on COVID-19, which is of paramount importance to deal with the existing pandemic and also such possible future waves of the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.07.22279527","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38217,""

Identifying factors that contribute to resilience in postpartum women is urgently needed to decrease risks of poor physical and psychological functioning. Studies have linked variations in the intestinal microbiota to depression in clinical samples, but the impacts in postpartum women in a Japanese population are unknown. We conducted two studies to examine the links between intestinal microbiota, physical condition, and psychological state in nonclinical, postpartum Japanese women. Our results show that decreasing Lachnospira and alpha diversity of microbiome is related to high mental health risk (i.e., parenting stress and/or depression).

"Racism and Racial Injustice During COVID-19: Impact on University Student Mental Health (preprint)","The purpose of the study is to understand how undergraduate, graduate, and professional students were affected by the events of racial injustice and the COVID-19 pandemic. Data gathered from an online campus-wide survey administered during July and August 2020 indicated high levels of stress and rates of depression across all stages of training. A majority of these students also indicated that, while events around racism negatively impacted their mental health, such events did not affect studentsâ€™ academic success as COVID-19 did. Although previous studies have demonstrated that student mental health has been negatively affected during COVID-19, this study shows that student mental health is also impacted by events driven by racism and racial injustice concurrent to the pandemic. In light of these findings, it is recommended that institutions adopt an intersectional approach toward addressing such contemporaneous stressors with initiatives that can adapt to multiple events simultaneously.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.30.22279409","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38219,""
"Design and Analysis of Outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Veterans (preprint)","A bstract  Background Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts long-term patient outcomes requires identification of comparable persons with and without infection. We report the design and implementation of a matching strategy employed by the Department of Veterans Affairsâ€™ (VA) COVID-19 Observational Research Collaboratory (CORC) to develop comparable cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected persons for the purpose of inferring potential causative long-term adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Veteran population. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, we identified VA health care system patients who were and were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 on a rolling monthly basis. We generated matched cohorts utilizing a combination of exact and time-varying propensity score matching based on electronic health record (EHR)-derived covariates that can be confounders or risk factors across a range of outcomes. Results From an initial pool of 126,689,864 person-months of observation, we generated final matched cohorts of 208,536 Veterans infected between March 2020-April 2021 and 3,014,091 uninfected Veterans. Matched cohorts were well-balanced on all 38 covariates used in matching after excluding patients for: no VA health care utilization;implausible age, weight, or height;living outside of the 50 states or Washington, D.C.;prior SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis per Medicare claims;or lack of a suitable match. Most Veterans in the matched cohort were male (88.3%), non-Hispanic (87.1%), white (67.2%), and living in urban areas (71.5%), with a mean age of 60.6, BMI of 31.3, Gagne comorbidity score of 1.4 and a mean of 2.3 CDC high-risk conditions. The most common diagnoses were hypertension (61.4%), diabetes (34.3%), major depression (32.2%), coronary heart disease (28.5%), PTSD (25.5%), anxiety (22.5%), and chronic kidney disease (22.5%). Conclusions This successful creation of matched SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected patient cohorts from the largest integrated health system in the United States will support cohort studies of outcomes derived from EHRs and sample selection for qualitative interviews and patient surveys. These studies will increase our understanding of the long-term outcomes of Veterans who were infected with SARS-CoV-2.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.23.22279120","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38220,""
"Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from Three Representative Surveys on Use, Attitudes and Barriers Among Adults Affected by Depression (preprint)","Introduction: With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face consultations had to be reduced, leading to substantial limitations in healthcare for people suffering from depression. To safely provide adequate but remote and thus safe care, e-health services such as telemedicine gained a more important role. Governments eased restrictions on the use of telemedicine, allowing healthcare professionals to increasingly offer video and telephone consultations. Objective: This study examines, 1) possible changes over the course of the pandemic in reported use of video and telephone consultations and intended future use of video consultations with healthcare professionals among adults with diagnosed depression;2) their attitudes towards video and telephone consultations and perceived barriers towards using e-health after prolonged time of the pandemic;and 3) differences in results between subgroups based on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Methods: Three population-representative online surveys were conducted in Germany at different timepoints (t) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents aged 18Â­â€“69 years with a professionally diagnosed depression were included in the present analyses (t1: June/July 2020 with n=1094;t2: February 2021 with n=1038;t3: September 2021 with n=1255). Results: The overall proportion of adults with depression who used video or telephone consultations did not change significantly in the time surveyed (t1: 16.51%, n=179;t2: 20.23%, n=210;t3: 18.47%, n=230). However, among users, reported use of video consultations with a psychotherapist increased significantly from t1 (34.83%, n=62) to t3 (44.98%, n=102, p =.023). Intended future use of video consultations was highest at t2 during lockdown in Germany and varied depending on the purpose of the consultation. At t3, the majority of adults with depression felt that video and telephone consultations were too impersonal and considered them more as a helpful support rather than an alternative to face-to-face psychotherapy. Key barriers to using e-health were found within the societal context, as a majority perceived promotion and support as insufficient and did not believe that their significant others would approve of them using e-health. Conclusion: Despite ambivalent attitudes towards video and telephone consultations among adults with depression, reported use of video consultations with a psychotherapist increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Telemedicine+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+Results+from+Three+Representative+Surveys+on+Use,+Attitudes+and+Barriers+Among+Adults+Affected+by+Depression+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38221,""
"Comparative Effectiveness of Two Versions of a Caring Contacts Intervention in Healthcare Providers, Staff, and Patients for Reducing Loneliness and Mental Distress: A Randomized Controlled Trial (preprint)","Background: Caring Contacts can effectively reduce suicide ideation, attempts, and death. In published clinical trials, messages were sent by specialists who knew the recipient. At scale, Caring Contacts programs rarely introduce the recipient and sender. It is not known whether receiving Caring Contacts from someone unknown is as effective as messages from someone the recipient knows. Methods: Pragmatic single masked randomized controlled trial with 1:1 allocation to Caring Contacts with (CC+) versus without an introductory phone call (CC). Recruitment occurred January-July 2021, with outcomes assessed at 6 months. Participants were healthcare providers/staff and primary care patients at a not-for-profit health system in Idaho, United States reporting adverse mental health outcomes on a qualifying survey. CC+ calls focused on connection and were semi-structured. All participants were sent 11 standardized caring text messages over 6 months;when participants replied, they received personalized unscripted responses. The primary outcome was loneliness (NIH Toolkit). Findings: Among patients, 165 were randomized to CC+ (mean (SD) age: 46.7 (15.7), 79.4% female), and 166 were randomized to CC (mean (SD) age: 44.3 (17), 78.3% female). Among providers/staff, 167 were randomized to CC+ (mean (SD) age: 40.1 (11.4), 89.8% female), and 168 were randomized to CC (mean (SD) age: 41.6 (12.2), 83.3% female). There were no significant differences in loneliness at 6 months by treatment arm in either stratum. In patients, mean (SD) loneliness was 61.9 (10.7) in CC, and 60.8 (10.3) in CC+, adjusted mean difference of -1.0 (95% CI: -3.0, 1.0);p-value=0.31. In providers/staff, mean (SD) loneliness was 61.2 (11) in CC, and 61.3 (11.1) in CC+, adjusted mean difference of 0.2 (95% CI: -1.8, 2.2);p-value=0.83. Interpretation: Including an initial phone call added operational complexity and cost without significantly improving the effectiveness of a Caring Contacts program.

"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) for Post-COVID Fatigue: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Pilot Study (preprint)","Background: Fatigue is one of the most frequent and disabling symptoms of post-COVID syndrome.ObjectiveTo assess the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on fatigue severity in a group of patients with post-COVID syndrome and long-lasting fatigue. Methods: Double-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled study to evaluate the short-term effects of anodal tDCS (2 mA, 20 min/day) on the left prefrontal dorsolateral cortex. The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale score was used as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included cognition (Stroop test), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory), and quality of life (EuroQol-5D). Patients received eight sessions of tDCS and were evaluated at baseline, immediately after the last session, and one month later. Results: Forty-seven patients were enrolled (23 in the active treatment group and 24 in the sham treatment group);mean age was 45.66 Â± 9.49 years, and 37 (78.72%) were women. The mean progression time since acute infection was 20.68 Â± 6.34 months. Active tDCS was associated with a statistically significant improvement in physical fatigue at the end of treatment and at one month as compared with sham stimulation. No significant effect was detected for cognitive fatigue. In terms of secondary outcomes, active tDCS was associated with an improvement in depressive symptoms at the end of treatment. The treatment had no effects on quality of life. All the adverse events reported were mild and transient, with no differences between the active stimulation and sham stimulation groups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that tDCS on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may improve physical fatigue. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and optimize stimulation protocols.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Transcranial+Direct+Current+Stimulation+(tDCS)+for+Post-COVID+Fatigue:+A+Randomized,+Double-Blind,+Controlled+Pilot+Study+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38223,""
"The Relationship between Transmission Misinformation, COVID-19 Stress and Satisfaction with Life among Adults (preprint)","The perplexing evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the spiritual lives of Vietnamese people in general, and particularly adults. The objective of this study was to ascertain the link between adult satisfaction with life and COVID-19 stress in Vietnam and investigate if COVID-19 transmission disinformation modifies the effect of COVID-19 stress on adult satisfaction with life. A total of 435 Vietnamese adults were enrolled online to finish answering, including the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SL), the COVID-19 Stress Scale (CS), and the COVID-19 Transmission Misinformation Scale (CTMS), consisting of 350 females and 85 males from 0 to 19 years old accounts for 40.7% and 20 to 44 years old accounts for 52.9%. Relationship, regression, and basic mediation analyses were used to dissociate the data. According to the findings of our study, there is a difference in gender in satisfaction with life. Females have a greater degree of satisfaction with life than males. Significant differences exist between relatives of direct and indirect COVID-19 transmission misinformation workers. People who had relatives who were frontline medical staff had higher COVID-19 Transmission Misinformation than others. There is a positive correlation between satisfaction with life and COVID-19 spreading disinformation, but it can have adverse effects on persons' physical health. Additionally, COVID-19 transmission misinformation has a role in the relationship between COVID-19 stress and adult life satisfaction. Individuals are more likely to access misinformation about COVID-19 transmission, which results in enhanced life satisfaction. During the COVID-19 epidemic, adults in Vietnam should be aware of the damaging consequences of COVID-19 transmission misinformation on their stress levels. Stress may significantly influence not just one's mental health but also other aspects of one's life. Clinicians should be aware of COVID-19 transmission misinformation and stress, which could affect psychological treatment.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Relationship+between+Transmission+Misinformation,+COVID-19+Stress+and+Satisfaction+with+Life+among+Adults+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38224,""
"Factors Affecting Older Adultsâ€™ Experience of Unmet Healthcare Needs in Korea Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Unmet healthcare need is a critical indicator, showing a plausible picture of how the healthcare system works in the unprecedented pandemic situation. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with unmet healthcare needs among the older Korean population amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data were used from the Experience Survey on Healthcare Use of Older Adults during the COVID-19 (COVID-19 Survey) in Korea (n=1917). Our main outcome, unmet healthcare need, was measured based on self-reported experience of overall, regular, and irregular outpatient care services-related unmet healthcare needs. Using multiple logistic regression models, we identified a good understanding of the nationâ€™s health system was associated with a lower likelihood of all types of unmet healthcare needs among older Korean adults (OR: 0.390, p&lt;0.001;OR: 0.360, p&lt;0.001;OR: 0.413, p&lt;0.01) in addition to the lowest educational attainment. Decreased social activities (i.e., shopping and visiting family members) and worsen psychological health issues (i.e., more anxious & nervous, more sad & depressed, and more sleep difficulty) were also factors affecting overall and irregular outpatient services-related unmet healthcare needs. Moreover, decreased household income after the pandemic was related to older adultsâ€™ experience of overall unmet healthcare need (OR:1.659, p&lt;0.05). To ensure timely access to necessary healthcare services in the era of the COVID-19 outbreak, eliminating the identified barriers to healthcare services among older adults needs to be prioritized for national health policies.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Factors+Affecting+Older+Adultsâ€™+Experience+of+Unmet+Healthcare+Needs+in+Korea+Amid+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38225,""
"Intolerance to Uncertainty and Self-Efficacy as Mediators between Personality Traits and Adjustment Disorder in the Face of the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Objective: In April 2020, at the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, governments prohibited public gatherings and demanded social distancing. These demands led to challenging adaptations, which, in some cases resulted in mental health issues, including adjustment disorder. Guided by the transactional stress model, the current study aimed to examine the relations between personality traits and adjustment disorder in crisis situations and vagueness and the role of intolerance to uncertainty and self-efficacy in these relations. Methods: During Israel's first lockdown, 673 Israeli adults completed self-reported e-version questionnaires regarding Big Five personality traits, adjustment disorder, intolerance to uncertainty, self-efficacy, and background variables. The study was designed to examine the association between personality traits and adjustment disorder and the potential mediation of intolerance to uncertainty and self-efficacy in associations. Results: The findings revealed that intolerance to uncertainty and self-efficacy mediated the association between personality traits and adjustment disorder. Conclusion and Implications: The findings are consistent with the transactional stress model. They shed light on the role of intolerance to uncertainty and self-efficacy as cognitive mechanisms that promote the development of adjustment disorder. Recommendations for future studies and practice are discussed.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Intolerance+to+Uncertainty+and+Self-Efficacy+as+Mediators+between+Personality+Traits+and+Adjustment+Disorder+in+the+Face+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38226,""
"The Mental Cost of Job Loss: Assessing the Impact on Young Adults in Vietnam (preprint)","We exploit the extensive job loss associated with the devastating fourth wave of COVID-19 in Vietnam to examine the impact of unemployment on young people's experiences of anxiety and depression. Using data from a longitudinal study with individual and survey-wave fixed effects, we show that job loss significantly increases levels of anxiety, but not depression. Specifically, job loss leads to a 5.9 percentage point increase in the probability of experiencing symptoms consistent with either mild or severe anxiety, almost doubling the pre-wave baseline. This effect is driven by individuals in the top earnings tercile who no longer live in their natal household - suggesting that the impact of job loss on anxiety is most acute among young people who are under pressure as the primary earners in their household. Perceived financial strain and food insecurity explain up to 22% of the estimated increase in anxiety. Our results support expanding mental health programmes to explicitly target young adults who have lost their job.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Mental+Cost+of+Job+Loss:+Assessing+the+Impact+on+Young+Adults+in+Vietnam+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38227,""

"Trajectories of psychological distress over multiple COVID-19 lockdowns in Australia (preprint)","The impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, including the indirect effect of policy responses, on psychological distress has been the subject of much research. However, there has been little consideration of how levels of population distress rise and fall with the duration and repetition of lockdowns, or the rate of resolution of distress once lockdowns ended. This study describes the trajectories of psychological distress over multiple lockdowns during the first two years of the pandemic across five Australian states for the period May 2020 to December 2021 and examined whether distress trajectories varied as a function of time spent in lockdown, or time since lockdown ended. A total of N = 574,306 Australian adults completed Facebook surveys over 611 days (on average 940 participants per day). Trajectories of psychological distress (depression and anxiety) were regressed on lockdown duration and time since lockdown ended. Random effects reflecting the duration of each lockdown were included to account for varying effects on distress associated with lockdown length. The prevalence of distress was higher during periods of lockdown, more so for longer lockdowns relative to shorter lockdowns. Distress increased rapidly over the first weeks of lockdown, though less rapidly for short lockdowns. Distress levels tended to stabilise, or even decrease, after ten consecutive weeks of lockdown. After lockdown restrictions were lifted, distress rapidly subsided but did not return to pre-lockdown levels within four weeks, although continued to decline afterwards. In Australia short pre-signaled duration lockdowns were associated with slower rises in distress. Lockdowns may have left some temporary residual population effect, but we cannot discern whether this reflects longer term trends in increasing distress.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Trajectories+of+psychological+distress+over+multiple+COVID-19+lockdowns+in+Australia+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38229,""
"Student nurses' educational experiences during COVID-19: A qualitative study","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many unexpected changes occurred in healthcare. With the abrupt change to online education in 2020, nursing students experienced challenges with virtual learning which impacted their perception of preparedness to practice. There were few qualitative studies completed in the U.S. that investigated the nursing students' experiences. The aim of this study was to explore pre-licensure nursing students' experiences with the transition to virtual learning and their perception of nursing amidst a pandemic. This study investigated nursing students' experiences and perceptions of the nursing profession amidst a pandemic and explored whether students would continue pursuing a career in nursing. A descriptive exploratory qualitative study utilizing focus group interviews and questions using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework. A university in Northern Illinois educating baccalaureate degree pre-licensure nursing students. Twenty-four pre-licensure nursing students first through fifth semesters. Ten focus groups were established and consisted of two to three students. A descriptive qualitative study design using the Theory of Planned Behavior to construct 9 semi-structured questions. These questions were utilized in the focus groups (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 24) and Framework Analysis was utilized to analyze data. Five themes and three sub-themes emerged from the study. Themes included: inspiration to become nurses with sub-themes-students' own inspiration and inspired by family; relationship strain with friend/family due to poor adherence to isolation guidelines; transition to online learning with sub-theme mental health strain; unprepared to begin nursing practice; and ambiguity regarding how to impact government health policy. This study found that the students' perceptions of the nursing profession did not waiver, and their desire to pursue a nursing career was resolute. This study demonstrated the challenges students experienced with a transition to virtual learning. Students expressed having insufficient in-person experiences and felt unprepared to begin practice.","Rood, Tanzillo, Madsen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2022.105562","20220923","COVID-19; Nursing education; Nursing student mental health; Nursing student perceptions; Online learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38230,""
"A Cognitive Behavior Therapy Chatbot (Otis) for Health Anxiety Management: A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study","An increase in health anxiety was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to physical distancing restrictions and a strained mental health system, people were unable to access support to manage health anxiety. Chatbots are emerging as an interactive means to deliver psychological interventions in a scalable manner and provide an opportunity for novel therapy delivery to large groups of people including those who might struggle to access traditional therapies. The aim of this mixed-methods pilot study was to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, engagement and effectiveness of a cognitive behavior therapy-based chatbot (Otis) as an early health anxiety management intervention for adults in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Users were asked to complete a 14-day program run by Otis, a primarily decision-tree based chatbot on Facebook Messenger. Health anxiety, general anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, personal well being and quality of life were measured pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at a 12-week follow-up. Paired samples t-tests and one-way ANOVAs were conducted to investigate the associated changes in the outcomes over time. Semi-structured interviews and written responses in the self-report questionnaires and Facebook Messenger were thematically analysed. 29 participants completed the trial by providing outcomes measures at both post-intervention and follow-up. Although an average decrease in health anxiety did not reach significance at post-intervention (P=.55) or follow-up (P =.08), qualitative analysis demonstrated that participants perceived benefiting from the intervention. Significant improvement in general anxiety, personal well being, and quality of life was associated with the use of Otis at post-intervention and follow-up. Anthropomorphism, Otis' appearance and delivery of content facilitated the use of Otis. Technical difficulties and high performance and effort expectancy were in contrast, barriers to acceptance and engagement of Otis. Otis may be a feasible, acceptable, and engaging means of delivering CBT to improve anxiety management, quality of life and personal well being but not a significant reduction in health anxiety.","Goonesekera, Donkin","https://doi.org/10.2196/37877","20220923","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38231,""

"A Web-Delivered, Clinician-Led Group Exercise Intervention for Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: Single-Arm Pre-Post Intervention","The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented shifts in the way health programs and services are delivered. A national lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Australia was introduced in March 2020. This lockdown included the closure of exercise clinics, fitness centers, and other community spaces, which, before the pandemic, were used to deliver Beat It. Beat It is an 8-week in-person, community-based, and clinician-led group exercise and education program for adults self-managing diabetes. To continue offering Beat It, it was adapted from an in-person program to a fully web-based supervised group exercise program for adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This study aims to assess whether the Beat It Online program produced comparable health outcomes to the Beat It in-person program in terms of improving physical fitness (muscular strength and power, aerobic endurance, balance, and flexibility) and waist circumference in older adults with T2DM. Australians with T2DM who were aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years were included. They were enrolled in Beat It Online, a twice-weekly supervised group exercise and education program conducted via videoconference over 8 weeks. Anthropometric measurements and physical fitness parameters were assessed at baseline and completion. The adaptations to Beat It are reported using the Model for Adaptation, Design, and Impact, including the type of changes (what, where, when, and for whom), the criteria for making those changes (why and how), and the intended and unintended outcomes. The intended outcomes were comparable functional fitness as well as physical and mental health improvements across demographics and socioeconomic status. A total of 171 adults (mean 71, SD 5.6 years; n=54, 31.6% male) with T2DM were included in the study, with 40.4% (n=69) residing in lower socioeconomic areas. On the completion of the 8-week program, significant improvements in waist circumference, aerobic capacity, muscular strength, flexibility, and balance were observed in both male and female participants (all P&lt;.001). The Model for Adaptation, Design, and Impact reports on 9 clinical, practical, and technical aspects of Beat It that were adapted for web-based delivery. This study found that Beat It Online was just as effective as the in-person program. This adapted program produced comparable health benefits across demographics and socioeconomic status. This study offers important findings for practitioners and policy makers seeking to maintain independence of older people with T2DM, reversing frailty and maximizing functional and physical fitness, while improving overall quality of life. Beat It Online offers a flexible and inclusive solution with significant physical and mental health benefits to individuals. Further evaluation of Beat It (both in-person and Online) adapted for culturally and linguistically diverse communities will provide greater insights into the efficacy of this promising program.","Kirwan, Chiu, Laing, Chowdhury, Gwynne","https://doi.org/10.2196/39800","20220923","balance; community-based; diabetes; diabetic; digital health; eHealth; elder; exercise; fitness; functional fitness; geriatric; gerontology; internet-based; movement; older adult; online; patient education; physical activity; translational; videoconference; web-based; weight","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38233,""
"Comparing Professional and Consumer Ratings of Mental Health Apps: Mixed Methods Study","As the number of mental health apps has grown, increasing efforts have been focused on establishing quality tailored reviews. These reviews prioritize clinician and academic views rather than the views of those who use them, particularly those with lived experiences of mental health problems. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased reliance on web-based and mobile mental health support, understanding the views of those with mental health conditions is of increasing importance. This study aimed to understand the opinions of people with mental health problems on mental health apps and how they differ from established ratings by professionals. A mixed methods study was conducted using a web-based survey administered between December 2020 and April 2021, assessing 11 mental health apps. We recruited individuals who had experienced mental health problems to download and use 3 apps for 3 days and complete a survey. The survey consisted of the One Mind PsyberGuide Consumer Review Questionnaire and 2 items from the Mobile App Rating Scale (star and recommendation ratings from 1 to 5). The consumer review questionnaire contained a series of open-ended questions, which were thematically analyzed and using a predefined protocol, converted into binary (positive or negative) ratings, and compared with app ratings by professionals and star ratings from app stores. We found low agreement between the participants' and professionals' ratings. More than half of the app ratings showed disagreement between participants and professionals (198/372, 53.2%). Compared with participants, professionals gave the apps higher star ratings (3.58 vs 4.56) and were more likely to recommend the apps to others (3.44 vs 4.39). Participants' star ratings were weakly positively correlated with app store ratings (r=0.32, P=.01). Thematic analysis found 11 themes, including issues of user experience, ease of use and interactivity, privacy concerns, customization, and integration with daily life. Participants particularly valued certain aspects of mental health apps, which appear to be overlooked by professional reviewers. These included functions such as the ability to track and measure mental health and providing general mental health education. The cost of apps was among the most important factors for participants. Although this is already considered by professionals, this information is not always easily accessible. As reviews on app stores and by professionals differ from those by people with lived experiences of mental health problems, these alone are not sufficient to provide people with mental health problems with the information they desire when choosing a mental health app. App rating measures must include the perspectives of mental health service users to ensure ratings represent their priorities. Additional work should be done to incorporate the features most important to mental health service users into mental health apps.","Hudson, Negbenose, Neary, Jansli, Schueller, Wykes, Jilka","https://doi.org/10.2196/39813","20220923","apps; coproduction; digital; mHealth; mental health; mobile health; mobile phone; patient and public involvement; service user; technology; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38234,""
"The relationship of probable clinical anxiety with attitude-behaviour, coping styles and social support in healthy pregnant women during the late period COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence of state and trait probable clinical anxiety and their relationship with socio-demographic factors, attitude-behaviour, coping styles and social support level in high-risk pregnant women in the late period of COVID-19 pandemic. The pregnant women followed up in the gynaecological outpatient clinic were evaluated during their admissions. About 191 healthy pregnant women were included in the study. Data were collected using the socio-demographic and pregnancy attitude-behaviour data form, STAI (Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), the Coping Styles Scale Brief Form (Brief-COPE) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Our study found that pregnant women had high anxiety levels (STAI-S:37.90Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.88; STAI-T:42.46Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.80) and probable clinical anxiety prevalences (STAI-S:81(42.4%); STAI-T:123(64.4%)) in the late period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that COVID-19 determined the preference of the birth method and the level of knowledge about COVID-19 predicted state probable clinical anxiety. Educational status, concern for COVID-19 transmission to the baby during pregnancy/birth, behavioural disengagement, focussing on and venting emotions predicted trait probable clinical anxiety. Our results have emphasised the factors that should be taken into account and coping styles that may be functional to protect the mental well-being of healthy pregnants.IMPACT STATEMENT<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to increase the symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression of the general population and healthcare workers. There is limited studies about pregnant women.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> According to our study, we can say that approximately half of the pregnant women in a pandemic need psychiatric evaluation due to probable clinical anxiety. The relationship between anxiety in the pandemic process and birth preference has been shown and coping styles in healthy pregnant women have been investigated for the first time, effective and ineffective coping styles have been shown. In addition, it has been found that the social support of pregnant women is effective in managing the pandemic process.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> According to our current findings, a multidisciplinary approach in which pregnant women are screened with self-report psychiatry tests and appropriate pregnant women are consulted to psychiatry during pandemic processes will make it easier for obstetricians to manage the patient. Especially strengthening effective coping styles and social support will have a great effect in mental rehabilitation. In this respect, further studies on pregnant women are needed.","KÃ„Â±lÃ„Â±ÃƒÂ§, GÃƒÂ¶k, KÃƒÂ¶krek, Kapudere, TÃƒÂ¼ten, BostancÃ„Â±, Ãƒâ€“zden","https://doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2022.2124850","20220923","Anxiety; COVID-19; coping styles; healthy pregnant women; outbreak","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38235,""
"The relationship between university students' depression, anxiety, and stress with positivity attitudes and the COVID-19 pandemic","The physical activity of university students is restricted during the pandemic, changes in education and training, and uncertainties during the pandemic caused their social lives to change completely. This study aims to determine the relationship between the depression, anxiety, and stress, and positivity attitudes of university students during the Covid-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) outbreak and their attitudes and behaviors toward the pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted online among university students, n = 2153 from April 30, 2020 to May 10, 2020. Data were collected with the Positivity Scale and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. The proportion of those with moderate and above depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in the study group, respectively, were 40.6%, 24.6%, and 22.5%.

"The comparison of anxiety and depression levels of resident doctors treating and not treating COVID-19 patients","Healthcare professionals are exposed to the stress of the pandemic in the highest level and try to cope with the long-term psychological consequences. This study mainly aimed to compare the anxiety and depression levels of resident doctors (RDs) who cared and did not care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients at the University Hospital, which has been serving as a pandemic hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. To proceed with this study, 100 RDs were included this study between March 15 and June 1, 2020. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to measure the depression levels and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was used to measure the anxiety levels of the RDs who participated in the study. The analysis of the responses showed that there were 49 RDs treating COVID-19 patients and 51 RDs not treating COVID-19 patients. The proportions of the RDs who had higher PHQ-9 and BAI scores were significantly greater in the RDs treating COVID-19 patients than in those not treating.

"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among adults in India: A longitudinal study","A longitudinal follow-up design was used to study the psychological distress and coping among 168 individuals immediately after the national lockdown and after 6 months of the pandemic. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The coping strategies used were measured by the Brief-COPE, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) was employed to measure response to uncertainty. On follow-up, the prevalence rates for severe/very severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress had increased substantially from time 1 to time 2. The stepwise multivariate regression analyses revealed that the change in the three DASS-21 scores over time was primarily predicted by intolerance of uncertainty as measured by the IUS-12 and dysfunctional style as assessed by the coping Brief-COPE.

"Perceived vulnerability to immigration policies among postpartum Hispanic/Latina women in the MADRES pregnancy cohort before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Research suggests that perceived immigration policy vulnerability has important health implications. Coupled with the mental and physical stressors accompanying the postpartum period and a growing awareness of the discrimination and structural racism experienced by marginalized communities globally, the coronavirus disease 2019 period may have exacerbated stress among vulnerable populations, specifically postpartum Hispanic/Latina women. This study evaluated perceived immigration policy vulnerability (i.e. discrimination, social isolation, and family threats) in early postpartum Hispanic/Latina women in Los Angeles before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The Perceived Immigration Policy Effects Scale (PIPES) was administered cross-sectionally at 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month postpartum to 187 Hispanic/Latina women in the MADRES cohort. Respondents between September 2018 and March 2020 were classified as ""pre-pandemic"" (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°128), between March 2020 and July 2020 as ""early pandemic"" (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38), and between August 2020 and November 2021 as ""later pandemic"" (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21). Average PIPES subscale scores were dichotomized into ""higher"" and ""lower"" groups (Ã¢Â©Â½median, &gt;median) and logistic regression models were performed. Approximately half of participants had incomes of &lt;$50,000 (50.3%) and were Latin American born (54.6%). After adjusting for age, nativity, education, income, postpartum distress, and employment status, early pandemic respondents had 5.05 times the odds of a higher score on the perceived discrimination subscale (95% CI: 1.81, 14.11), 6.47 times the odds of a higher score on the social isolation subscale (95% CI: 2.23, 18.74), 2.66 times the odds of a higher score on the family threats subscale (95% CI: 0.97, 7.32), and 3.36 times the odds of a higher total score (95% CI: 1.19, 9.51) when compared to pre-pandemic respondents. There were no significant subscale score differences between later pandemic and pre-pandemic periods. Higher perceived immigration policy vulnerability was reported among postpartum women during the early coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic versus pre-pandemic periods. This suggests greater social inequities during the early pandemic period.","Hernandez-Castro, Toledo-Corral, Chavez, Habre, Grubbs, Al-Marayati, Lerner, Lurvey, Lagomasino, Eckel, Dunton, Farzan, Breton, Bastain","https://doi.org/10.1177/17455057221125103","20220923","COVID-19; immigration policy concerns; postpartum mental health; public health; womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38239,""
"The Effect of the New Type Coronavirus Outbreak on Quality of Life and Suicidal Thoughts in Psychiatric Patients","The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of perceptions on the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life and suicidal ideation in both healthy controls and individuals with psychiatric disorders. The study was conducted on 4 different groups with 83 depressive disorders, 90 anxiety disorders and 61 schizophrenia patients who have been followed in Gazi University Medical Faculty Hospital Mental Health and Diseases outpatient clinic since before the COVID-19 pandemic period and another group of 93 healthy volunteers. Participants were evaluated with Sociodemographic Data Form, Suicide Probability Scale (SPS), SF-36 Quality of Life Scale (SF- 36), Perception of COVID-19 Scale (P-COVID-19), and Perception of Causes of COVID-19 Scale (PCa-COVID-19). The perception on the danger and contaigiousness of P-COVID-19 scored lowest in the schizophrenia group, compared to other groups and PCa-COVID-19's Conspiracy and Belief subdimension scores were highest. In all groups, a significant negative correlation was found between the P-COVID-19's dangerousness subdimension score and the SF-36 scale's Mental Health sub-dimension. Again, in all groups, significant positive correlations were found between the Dangerousness sub-dimension score of P-COVID-19 and the anger/impulsivity, hopelessness/loneliness and suicidal thoughts sub-dimensions of the SPS. The negative effects of perceptions associated with COVID-19 on mental health were observed both in groups with a psychiatric disorder and in healthy controls. The higher number of participants and longitudinal research will provide a better understanding of the effects of perceptions associated with COVID-19 and will guide the necessary treatment interventions.","Aksu, GeniÃ…Å¸, GeniÃ…Å¸, CoÃ…Å¸ar","https://doi.org/10.5080/u26525","20220923","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; suicide quality of life.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38240,""
"Neurological post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)","The novel corona virus infectious disease, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, can have two phases: acute (generally 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks after onset) and chronic (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks after onset). Both phases include a wide variety of signs and symptoms including neurological and psychiatric symptoms. The signs and symptoms that are considered sequelae of COVID-19 are termed post-COVID condition, long COVID-19, and post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). PASC symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea, palpitation, dysosmia, sub-fever, hypertension, alopecia, sleep problems, loss of concentration, amnesia, numbness, pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Because the specific pathophysiology of PASC has not yet been clarified, there are no definite criteria of the condition, hence the World Health Organization's definition is quite broad. Consequently, it is difficult to correctly diagnose PASC. Approximately 50% of patients may show at least one PASC symptom up to 12 months after COVID-19 infection; however, the exact prevalence of PASC has not been determined. Despite extensive research in progress worldwide, there are currently no clear diagnostic methodologies or treatments for PASC. In this review, we discuss the currently available information on PASC and highlight the neurological sequelae of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, we provide clinical suggestions for diagnosing and caring for PASC patients based on our outpatient clinic experience. This article is protected by copyright.

"Exploring mental health clients' current medication knowledge, beliefs and experience with healthcare providers in the community in South Australia","In Australia, mental illness has been recognised as a National Health Priority area, with the coronavirus pandemic adding a layer of urgency to the need to address the multiple health problems faced by clients with mental illnesses. Whilst much has been done in efforts to support these clients, little is known about their medication knowledge and experience with health professionals. The aim of the study was to explore the knowledge and beliefs of clients on the use of psychotropic medications and study their experiences with healthcare providers. Adult participants at a not-for-profit community-managed specialist mental health service provider in Adelaide, South Australia were recruited. Four focus group sessions were conducted between February 2020 and March 2021. All sessions were co-facilitated by a peer practitioner with lived experience. Sessions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°27) reported that provision of medication education was inadequate and, in some cases, non-existent. There was an apparent lack of support for monitoring and managing common side effects, such as weight gain. Participants described not being involved in any decision-making processes and that establishing and maintaining a therapeutic relationship with their healthcare providers was challenging. Perceived stigma remains a barrier in accessing healthcare. Despite participants regularly interacting with a range of healthcare providers, findings highlight key gaps in care, particularly medication education and establishing a therapeutic relationship with their healthcare providers. Future mental health reforms should consider the provision of additional medication education in community settings, such as at not-for-profit organisations. Moreover, healthcare providers should take a proactive approach in establishing therapeutic relationships.","Bui, Hotham, Loughhead, McMillan, Procter, Poole, Suppiah","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.14029","20220923","community health; medication counselling; medication knowledge; mental disorders; mental health; shared decision making; therapeutic relationship","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38242,""
"The relationship between the high-risk disordered eating and social network navigation among Saudi college females during the COVID pandemic","Disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) are complex health issues that may lead to negative physical and mental health outcomes among college students. More studies should be directed toward the screening of DEBs. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of DEBs among Saudi female university students and their association with social networking site (SNSs) usage and composite lifestyle behaviors during the unprecedented period of COVID-19. This cross-sectional study included 445 females recruited using stratified random sampling. The participants self-reported demographic, social, medical, and lifestyle data and completed the validated Arabic version of the Eating Attitudes Test-26, Social Networking Sites (SNSs) Usage Questionnaire, Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, and Body Shape Questionnaire. The prevalence of DEBs was 27.2% among the female students at Taif University. From the pre-pandemic period until the current time, the DEBs-risk group had a significantly higher SNS navigation rate (36.4%) than the normal group (20.4%) (<i>X</i> <sup>2</sup> = 30.015, <i>p</i> = 0.001). The regression analysis revealed that females with a significant body image concern, higher number of SNSs friends, and frequent visits to SNSs, and those seeking social-dependent information in relation to weight loss/dieting were more likely to develop DEBs (Overall Model: Chi-Square <i>X</i> <sup>2</sup> = 158.071, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.000<sup>**</sup>). SNSs usage and DEBs were associated during the COVID-pandemic. However, the composite lifestyle score did not demonstrate a significant association with DEBs among the female students at Taif University. Investigating the magnitude of DEBs and understanding the role of SNS are essential for preventing disordered eating among young females.","Raja N, Osman, Alqethami, Abd El-Fatah","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.949051","20220923","COVID pandemic; Saudi Arabia; college; female; high-risk disordered eating; social media; social network navigation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38243,""
"Family economic hardship and adolescent mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study examined whether pandemic related family economic hardships influenced adolescents' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea. Data were collected from 54,948 adolescents who participated in the 2020 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey. We performed a multiple logistic regression analysis to examine the association between family economic hardship and mental health (anxiety, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation). Among the adolescents, 39.7, 24.7, and 5.9% reported slight, moderate, and severe economic hardship, respectively. COVID-19 related family economic hardship was significantly associated with higher odds of adolescents reporting anxiety, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. This association was stronger among adolescents with low to middle family economic status.

"Evaluation of the immunomodulatory effects of interleukin-10 on peripheral blood immune cells of COVID-19 patients: Implication for COVID-19 therapy","Several therapies with immune-modulatory functions have been proposed to reduce the overwhelmed inflammation associated with COVID-19. Here we investigated the impact of IL-10 in COVID-19, through the <i>ex-vivo</i> assessment of the effects of exogenous IL-10 on SARS-CoV-2-specific-response using a whole-blood platform. Two cohorts were evaluated: in ""study population A"", plasma levels of 27 immune factors were measured by a multiplex (Luminex) assay in 39 hospitalized ""COVID-19 patients"" and 29 ""NO COVID-19 controls"" all unvaccinated. In ""study population B"", 29 COVID-19 patients and 30 NO COVID-19-Vaccinated Controls (NO COVID-19-VCs) were prospectively enrolled for the IL-10 study. Whole-blood was stimulated overnight with SARS-COV-2 antigens and then treated with IL-10. Plasma was collected and used for ELISA and multiplex assay. In parallel, whole-blood was stimulated and used for flow cytometry analysis. Baseline levels of several immune factors, including IL-10, were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients compared with NO COVID-19 subjects in ""study population A"". Among them, IL-2, FGF, IFN-ÃŽÂ³, and MCP-1 reached their highest levels within the second week of infection and then decreased. To note that, MCP-1 levels remained significantly elevated compared with controls. IL-10, GM-CSF, and IL-6 increased later and showed an increasing trend over time. Moreover, exogenous addition of IL-10 significantly downregulated IFN-ÃŽÂ³ response and several other immune factors in both COVID-19 patients and NO COVID-19-VCs evaluated by ELISA and a multiplex analysis (Luminex) in ""study population B"". Importantly, IL-10 did not affect cell survival, but decreased the frequencies of T-cells producing IFN-ÃŽÂ³, TNF-ÃŽÂ±, and IL-2 (p&lt;0.05) and down-modulated HLA-DR expression on CD8<sup>+</sup> and NK cells.

"The impacts of COVID-19 on eating disorders and disordered eating: A mixed studies systematic review and implications","The unique constraints to everyday life brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have been suggested to negatively impact those with pre-existing mental health issues such as eating disorders. While individuals with eating disorders or disordered eating behaviors likely represent a vulnerable group to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the pandemic is yet to be fully established. We systematically examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors. We searched electronic databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE for literature published until October 2021. Eligible studies were required to report on individuals with or without a diagnosed eating disorder or disordered eating behaviors who were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy-two studies met eligibility criteria with the majority reporting an increase in eating disorder or disordered eating behaviors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it appears children and adolescents and individuals with a diagnosed eating disorder may present vulnerable groups to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This mixed systematic review provides a timely insight into COVID-19 eating disorder literature and will assist in understanding possible future long-term impacts of the pandemic on eating disorder behaviors. It appears that the role of stress in the development and maintenance of eating disorders may have been intensified to cope with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research is needed among understudied and minority groups and to examine the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=284749, PROSPERO [CRD42021284749].","McLean, Utpala, Sharp","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.926709","20220923","COVID-19; disordered eating; eating behavior and eating disorder; eating disorder; pandemic (COVID-19); systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38246,""

"Moderating role of compassion in the link between fear of Coronavirus disease and mental health among undergraduate students","The societal challenges presented by fear related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic may present unique challenges for an individual's mental health. However, the moderating role of compassion in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and mental health has not been well-studied. The present study aimed to explore the association between fear of COVID-19 and mental health, as well as test the buffering role of compassion in this relationship. The participants in this study were 325 Iranian undergraduate students (228 females), aged 18-25 years, who completed questionnaires posted on social networks via a web-based platform. The results showed that fear of COVID-19 was positively related with physical symptoms, social function, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. The results also showed that compassion was negatively associated with physical symptoms, social function, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms.

"Reductions in anxiety, depression and insomnia in health care workers using a non-pharmaceutical intervention","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant medical and psychological challenges worldwide, and not only exceeded the capacity of hospitals and intensive care units but also an individuals' ability to cope with life. Health-care workers have continued to provide care for patients despite exhaustion, fear of transmission to themselves and their family, illness or death of friends and colleagues, and losing many patients. They have also faced additional stress and anxiety due to long shifts combined with unprecedented population restrictions, including personal isolation. In this study, we study the effect of an app-based Yoga of Immortals (YOI) intervention on mental health of healthcare workers. In this study, the health care workers were digitally recruited, and their psychological parameters were measured using validated questionaries. The participants were randomly grouped into control and test groups. The validated psychological measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scales. The digital YOI intervention significantly reduced the anxiety, depression symptoms, and insomnia in healthcare workers of all age groups. In contrast, there was no improvement in the control group. This study details the effectiveness of an app-based YOI intervention in healthcare workers.","Currie, Gupta, Shivanand, Desai, Bhatt, Tunuguntla, Verma","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.983165","20220923","anxiety; depression; healthcare workers; insomnia; mental health; mindfulness; yoga","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38249,""
"E-cigarettes and non-suicidal self-injury: Prevalence of risk behavior and variation by substance inhaled","Nicotine and cannabis inhalation through vaping or electronic delivery systems has surged among young adults in the United States, particularly during the coronavirus disease pandemic. Tobacco and marijuana use are associated with select adverse mental health outcomes, including symptoms of major depressive disorder and suicidal behaviors. Given the need for addiction specialists to treat problematic substance use with an integrated approach, the association between non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and use of e-cigarettes, tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol was examined among a diverse sample of college students. Healthy Minds Study data from 47,016 weighted observations, collected from college students in the 2018-2019 academic year, was used to explore associations between NSSI-related behaviors and past 30-day use of a vaping product (nicotine or marijuana). These relationships were assessed among those using vaping products only, and then among individuals using vaping products and alcohol, conventional cigarettes, and/or marijuana. Hierarchical logistic regression models estimating the relationship between vaping and NSSI were computed to adjust for the effects of demographic factors, symptomatology of psychiatric disorders, and concurrent use of other substances. A fifth (22.9%) of respondents disclosed past 12-month NSSI; they were significantly more likely to screen positive for depression or anxiety compared to young adults without NSSI. Rates of using vaping products, conventional cigarettes, marijuana, or other substances were higher among students with NSSI even after controlling for potential cofounders. Additionally, students who used a THC-based liquid in their e-cigarettes were more likely to endorse NSSI in comparison to those who used ""just flavoring."" However, young adults who vaped were less likely to disclose frequent NSSI-related behaviors than their peers who did not vape. These findings revealed an association between past 12-month NSSI and past 30-day vaping in a sample of young adults. Further surveillance among college populations and examination of potential sociodemographic confounders is necessary to confirm these findings and advance the substance use and addiction field.","Striley, Nutley, Hoeflich","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.911136","20220923","conventional cigarette; e-cigarette; marijuana; non-suicidal and suicidal self-injurious thoughts and behaviors; substance use (drugs, vaping, alcohol)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38250,""

"The Impact of Outpatient Prenatal Care Visitor Restrictions on Pregnant Patients and Partners During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, several health care facilities enacted visitor restrictions to help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among patients, front-line workers in health care systems, and communities. The impact and burden of policy updates on visitor restrictions put forth by the COVID-19 pandemic can be seen on patients and families, most often in the acute care setting and skilled nursing facilities. Yet, the effects of visitor restrictions in the prenatal care setting were unknown. We conducted a study to investigate the impact of these policies on pregnant patients who received outpatient prenatal care. We conducted a qualitative study to explore pregnant patients' experiences with prenatal health care delivery between May and July 2020. In-depth interviews were conducted with pregnant patients in the first and second trimester of pregnancy, who received their prenatal care at the onset of the pandemic in the United States. Participants noted increased maternal concern, anxiety, and mental health concerns stemming from the lack of in-person partner support. They noted disappointment and lost experiences for the patient during pregnancy, seeking support from her partner during pregnancy, experiences felt to be critical for postpartum health and wellbeing. There was also concern about the negative impact of restrictions on prenatal care quality and experience. This study demonstrates the impact of visitor restrictions on patients' prenatal care experience and perception of health care quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future public health strategies should be individualized to different patient populations addressing knowledge, health literacy, and socioeconomic status, and developed in conjunction with pregnant patients as key stakeholders in the delivery of prenatal health care.","Collart, Craighead, Rose, Frankel, Tucker Edmonds, Perni, Chien, Coleridge, Ranzini, Farrell","https://doi.org/10.1089/whr.2022.0031","20220923","COVID-19; mental health; patient experience; prenatal care; shared decision-making; visitor restriction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38252,""
"Loneliness and Pain Catastrophizing Among Individuals with Chronic Pain: The Mediating Role of Depression","Loneliness increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing guidelines, potentially exacerbating negative cognitions about pain. The present study investigated the longitudinal relationship between loneliness, assessed during the early weeks of the pandemic, and pain catastrophizing, assessed after living in the pandemic for approximately 1 year, among chronic pain patients. We also examined whether severity of depressive symptoms mediated this association. This prospective longitudinal study recruited individuals with chronic pain (N=93) from Massachusetts using an online convenience sampling method via the platform Rally. Participants completed an initial survey early after the onset of social distancing (4/28/20-6/17/20; Time 1) and a follow-up survey 1 year later (5/21/21-6/7/21; Time 2). Participants completed validated assessments of loneliness (T1), pain catastrophizing (T2), and depression (T2). Spearman correlations and Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>-tests were used to explore associations among psychosocial, pain, and participant characteristics. A mediation analysis was conducted to test whether the association between loneliness and pain catastrophizing was mediated by depression. Participants had a mean age of 40.6 years and were majority female (80%) and White (82%). Greater loneliness was associated with subsequent higher pain catastrophizing (<i>b</i>=1.23, 95% CI [0.03, 2.44]). Mediation analysis showed a significant indirect effect (<i>b</i>=0.57, 95% CI [0.10, 1.18) of loneliness (T1) on catastrophizing (T2) through depression (T2) while accounting for several important covariates. The direct effect of loneliness on catastrophizing was no longer significant when depression was included in the model (<i>b</i>=0.66, 95% CI [-0.54, 1.87]). Findings suggest that greater loneliness during the pandemic was associated with higher pain catastrophizing 1 year later, and severity of depression after living in the pandemic mediated this association. As loneliness, depression, and catastrophizing can all be modified with behavioral interventions, understanding the temporal associations among these variables is important for the employment of future empirically supported treatments.","Wilson, Colebaugh, Meints, Flowers, Edwards, Schreiber","https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S377789","20220923","COVID-19; chronic pain; depression; loneliness; pain catastrophizing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38253,""
"Jian-Ti-Kang-Yi decoction alleviates poly(I:C)-induced pneumonia by inhibiting inflammatory response, reducing oxidative stress, and modulating host metabolism","Jian-Ti-Kang-Yi decoction (JTKY) is widely used in the treatment of COVID-19. However, the protective mechanisms of JTKY against pneumonia remain unknown. In this study, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a mimic of viral dsRNA, was used to induce pneumonia in mice; the therapeutic effects of JTKY on poly(I:C)-induced pneumonia model mice were evaluated. In addition, the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative potentials of JTKY were also investigated. Lastly, the metabolic regulatory effects of JTKY in poly(I:C)-induced pneumonia model mice were studied using untargeted metabolomics. Our results showed that JTKY treatment decreased the wet-to-dry ratio in the lung tissue, total protein concentration, and total cell count of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) and Masson staining indicated that the JTKY treatment alleviated the pathological changes and decreased the fibrotic contents in the lungs. JTKY treatment also decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1ÃŽÂ², IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-ÃŽÂ±)] and increased the levels of immunomodulatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the BALF and serum. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the JTKY treatment lowered the ratio of CD86<sup>+</sup>/CD206<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the BALF, decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) level, and increased arginase 1 (Arg-1) level in lung. JTKY also lowered CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils in BALF and decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung. Moreover, it also elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and decreased methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) level in lung. Untargeted metabolomic analysis showed that the JTKY treatment could affect 19 metabolites in lung, such as L-adrenaline, L-asparagine, ornithine, and alpha-ketoglutaric acid. These metabolites are associated with the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, butanoate, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle processes. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that treatment with JTKY ameliorated poly(I:C)-induced pneumonia. The mechanism of action of JTKY may be associated with the inhibition of the inflammatory response, the reduction of oxidative stress, and the regulation of the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, TCA cycle, and metabolism of alanine, aspartate, glutamate, and butanoate processes in lung.","Cui, Wang, Yu, Wu, Zhang, Guo, Luo, Li, Li, He, Wen, Liao, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.979400","20220923","Jian-Ti-Kang-Yi decoction; anti-oxidative effect; antiinflammatory effect; poly(I:C)-induced pneumonia; untargeted metabolomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38254,""
"Response to NIOSH Request for Information on Interventions to Prevent Work-Related Stress and Support Health Worker Mental Health","The root causes of health care worker strain and depression include excessive job demands, extended work schedules, little decision-making opportunity, assault, bullying, and fear of injury. Potential links between working conditions and opioid overuse have also been discussed, beginning with psychological job strain or with physical pain leading to medication use. Promising solutions have been identified and many would be cost-effective, as enhanced working conditions could improve workers' mental health, job satisfaction, retention, and patient outcomes. Considering the number of health care workers leaving work during the global COVID-19 pandemic, it is urgent to address preventable root causes.

"Decline of Admission for Acute Coronary Syndromes and Acute Cardiovascular Conditions during COVID-19 Pandemic in Veneto Region","The present study aimed to examine longitudinal trends in hospitalizations for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, by reviewing the data from 13 hospitals of the Veneto Region, in the north-east of Italy. We performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis including all the consecutive patients presenting with ACS and other acute cardiovascular (CV) conditions (defined as heart failure, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and venous thromboembolism) hospitalized in 13 different hospitals of the Veneto Region covering a population of 2,554,818 inhabitants, during the first (between 15 March 2020 and 30 April 2020) and second (between 15 November 2020 and 30 December 2020) COVID-19 pandemic waves (the 2020 cohort). Data were compared with those obtained at the same time-windows of years 2018 and 2019 (the historical cohorts). Compared to the historical cohorts, a significant decrease in the number of ACS cases was observed in 2020 (-27.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.01 and -32%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001, comparing 2018 versus 2020 and 2019 and 2020, respectively).

"Factors Associated with Vaccination Intention against the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global Population-Based Study","Several vaccines have been developed for COVID-19 since the pandemic began. This study aimed to evaluate the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intention. A global survey was conducted across 26 countries from October, 2020 to December, 2021 using an online self-administered questionnaire. Demographic information, socio-economic status, and clinical information were collected. A logistic regression examined the associations between vaccine intention and factors such as perceptions and the presence of chronic physical and mental conditions. The sample included 2459 participants, with 384 participants (15.7%) expressing lower COVID-19 vaccination intent. Individuals who identified as female; belonged to an older age group; had a higher level of education; were students; had full health insurance coverage; or had a previous history of influenza vaccination were more willing to receive vaccination. Conversely, those who were working part-time, were self-employed, or were receiving social welfare were less likely to report an intention to get vaccinated. Participants with mental or physical health conditions were more unwilling to receive vaccination, especially those with sickle cell disease, cancer history within the past five years, or mental illness. Stronger vaccination intent was associated with recommendations from the government or family doctors. The presence of chronic conditions was associated with lower vaccine intention. Individuals with health conditions are especially vulnerable to health complications and may experience an increased severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting the vaccine perceptions and behaviours of at-risk groups. As such, public awareness campaigns conducted by the government and proactive endorsement from health physicians may help improve COVID-19 vaccination intention.","Huang, Chan, Ko, Wang, Yuan, Xu, Zheng, Xue, Zhang, Jiang, Huang, Chen, Palaganas, Viwattanakulvanid, Somrongthong, Caicedo, Medina-Arellano, Murphy, Paredes, Withers, Wong","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10091539","20220923","COVID-19; chronic conditions; mental health; vaccination intention; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38257,""
"A Review of Non-Invasive Drug Delivery through Respiratory Routes","With rapid and non-invasive characteristics, the respiratory route of administration has drawn significant attention compared with the limitations of conventional routes. Respiratory delivery can bypass the physiological barrier to achieve local and systemic disease treatment. A scientometric analysis and review were used to analyze how respiratory delivery can contribute to local and systemic therapy. The literature data obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database showed an increasing worldwide tendency toward respiratory delivery from 1998 to 2020. Keywords analysis suggested that nasal and pulmonary drug delivery are the leading research topics in respiratory delivery. Based on the results of scientometric analysis, the research hotspots mainly included therapy for central nervous systems (CNS) disorders (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, glioblastoma, and epilepsy), tracheal and bronchial or lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, acute lung injury or respiratory distress syndrome, lung cancer, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), and systemic diseases (diabetes and COVID-19). The study of advanced preparations contained nano drug delivery systems of the respiratory route, drug delivery barriers investigation (blood-brain barrier, BBB), and chitosan-based biomaterials for respiratory delivery.

"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthy Components of Diet and Factors Associated with Unfavorable Changes among University Students in France","The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns have affected many aspects of university students' daily lives, including their dietary habits. This study aimed to evaluate the change of diet quality of university students before and during the COVID-19 period, and the factors associated with unfavorable changes in diet quality. An online cross-sectional study was performed in May 2021 among Rouen (France) university students. Socio-demographic characteristics, body mass index, depression, academic stress, risk of eating disorders and food security were collected. The French ""Programme National Nutrition SantÃƒÂ©-Guidelines Score 2"" (PNNS-GS2) was used to access diet quality. A total of 3508 students were included, 74.4% were female, the mean age was 20.7 (SD = 2.3), and 7.0% were in a situation of food insecurity. The PNNS-GS2 score decreased between the pre- and the COVID-19 pandemic period for 33.1% of university students. The associated factors with the decrease in the PNNS-GS2 score were food insecurity, financial insecurity, not living with parents, depression, academic stress, eating disorders, being in the two first years of study and having been infected by COVID-19. Diets with healthy components decreased for one-third of university students since the COVID-19 pandemic, and this was shown to be associated with food insecurity, poor mental health and eating disorder.

"Comparing the Evidence from Observational Studies and Randomized Controlled Trials for Nonskeletal Health Effects of Vitamin D","Although observational studies of health outcomes generally suggest beneficial effects with, or following, higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have generally not supported those findings. Here we review results from observational studies and RCTs regarding how vitamin D status affects several nonskeletal health outcomes, including Alzheimer's disease and dementia, autoimmune diseases, cancers, cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, major depressive disorder, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, all-cause mortality, respiratory tract infections, and pregnancy outcomes. We also consider relevant findings from ecological, Mendelian randomization, and mechanistic studies. Although clear discrepancies exist between findings of observational studies and RCTs on vitamin D and human health benefits these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Bias and confounding are seen in observational studies and vitamin D RCTs have several limitations, largely due to being designed like RCTs of therapeutic drugs, thereby neglecting vitamin D's being a nutrient with a unique metabolism that requires specific consideration in trial design. Thus, RCTs of vitamin D can fail for several reasons: few participants' having low baseline 25(OH)D concentrations, relatively small vitamin D doses, participants' having other sources of vitamin D, and results being analyzed without consideration of achieved 25(OH)D concentrations. Vitamin D status and its relevance for health outcomes can usefully be examined using Hill's criteria for causality in a biological system from results of observational and other types of studies before further RCTs are considered and those findings would be useful in developing medical and public health policy, as they were for nonsmoking policies. A promising approach for future RCT design is adjustable vitamin D supplementation based on interval serum 25(OH)D concentrations to achieve target 25(OH)D levels suggested by findings from observational studies.","Grant, Boucher, Al Anouti, Pilz","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14183811","20220923","breast cancer; colorectal cancer; gestational diabetes; preeclampsia; preterm birth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38260,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns in a Sample of Outpatients in a Mental Health Department of a Metropolitan Hospital in Milan","<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Italy was the first country in Europe to face the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its consequences, which led to two phases of severe restrictions for its population. This study aims to estimate the connections between the trauma of the COVID-19 emergency and the clinical features of a sample of outpatients in a Milan Community Mental Health setting, comparing the first (April 2020) and second lockdowns (November 2020). <i>Materials and Methods</i>: The sample included 116 consecutive outpatients recruited in April 2020 and 116 in November 2020. The subjects were evaluated with Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-18), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). <i>Results</i>: The IES-R identified 47.4% participants in April and 50% in November with clinical scores over the cut-off. The network analysis of BPRS-18 and IES-R depicted the connection among different symptoms; in April, Unusual Thought Content, Anxiety, and Somatic Concern represented the most central items, and the strongest connections were found between Uncooperativeness and Hostility, Blunted Affect and Emotional Withdrawal, and IES-Intrusion and IES-Arousal. In the November group, the most central items were represented by Conceptual Disorganization and Emotional Withdrawal, whereas the strongest connections were found between IES-Arousal and IES-Intrusion, Excitement and Grandiosity, and Unusual Thought Content and Conceptual Disorganization. <i>Conclusions</i>: Our findings show continued high distress levels and increased psychological burdens during the second phase of restrictions; this could be described as ""pandemic fatigue"", a general psychological weariness due to pandemic-related restrictions, as well as a lack of motivation to comply with them. As mental health professionals, our mission during these difficult times has been to keep community psychiatry services accessible, with particular regard to vulnerable and marginalized populations.","Percudani, Porcellana, Di Bernardo, Limosani, Negri, Zerbinati, Morganti","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58091274","20220923","coronavirus disease 2019; pandemic; psychiatric disorders; quarantine; trauma spectrum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38262,""
"Neuromuscular Blockade in the Pre- and COVID-19 ARDS Patients","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts for a quarter of mechanically ventilated patients, while during the pandemic, it overwhelmed the capacity of intensive care units (ICUs). Lung protective ventilation (low tidal volume, positive-end expiratory pressure titrated to lung mechanics and oxygenation, permissive hypercapnia) is a non-pharmacological approach that is the gold standard of management. Among the pharmacological treatments, the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), although extensively studied, has not yet been well clarified. The rationale is to minimize the risk for lung damage progression, in the already-injured pulmonary parenchyma. By abolishing rigorous spontaneous efforts, NMBAs may decrease the generation of high transpulmonary pressures that could aggravate patients' self-inflicted lung injury. Moreover, NMBAs can harmonize the patient-ventilator interaction. Recent randomized controlled trials reported contradictory results and changed the clinical practice in a bidirectional way. NMBAs have not been documented to improve long-term survival; thus, the current guidance suggests their use only in patients in whom a lung protective ventilation protocol cannot be applied, due to asynchrony or increased respiratory efforts. In the present review, we discuss the published data and additionally the clinical practice in the ""war"" conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerning NMBA use in the management of patients with ARDS.","Tsolaki, Zakynthinos, Papadonta, Bardaka, Fotakopoulos, Pantazopoulos, Makris, Zakynthinos","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12091538","20220923","ARDS; COVID-19 ARDS; lung injury; muscular relaxants; neuromuscular blocking agents; survival","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38263,""
"Correlation between Type I Interferon Associated Factors and COVID-19 Severity","Antiviral type I interferons (IFN) produced in the early phase of viral infections effectively inhibit viral replication, prevent virus-mediated tissue damages and promote innate and adaptive immune responses that are all essential to the successful elimination of viruses. As professional type I IFN producing cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) have the ability to rapidly produce waste amounts of type I IFNs. Therefore, their low frequency, dysfunction or decreased capacity to produce type I IFNs might increase the risk of severe viral infections. In accordance with that, declined pDC numbers and delayed or inadequate type I IFN responses could be observed in patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as compared to individuals with mild or no symptoms. Thus, besides chronic diseases, all those conditions, which negatively affect the antiviral IFN responses lengthen the list of risk factors for severe COVID-19. In the current review, we would like to briefly discuss the role and dysregulation of pDC/type I IFN axis in COVID-19, and introduce those type I IFN-dependent factors, which account for an increased risk of COVID-19 severity and thus are responsible for the different magnitude of individual immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.","Bencze, Fekete, PÃƒÂ¡zmÃƒÂ¡ndi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms231810968","20220923","COVID-19; IFN signature; SARS-CoV-2; antiviral response; plasmacytoid dendritic cell 1; risk factor; type I interferon","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38264,""
"The Complexity and Multiplicity of the Specific cAMP Phosphodiesterase Family: PDE4, Open New Adapted Therapeutic Approaches","Cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cGMP) play a major role in normal and pathologic signaling. Beyond receptors, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases; (PDEs) rapidly convert the cyclic nucleotide in its respective 5'-nucleotide to control intracellular cAMP and/or cGMP levels to maintain a normal physiological state. However, in many pathologies, dysregulations of various PDEs (PDE1-PDE11) contribute mainly to organs and tissue failures related to uncontrolled phosphorylation cascade. Among these, PDE4 represents the greatest family, since it is constituted by 4 genes with multiple variants differently distributed at tissue, cellular and subcellular levels, allowing different fine-tuned regulations. Since the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies have developed PDE4 inhibitors (PDE4-I) to overcome cardiovascular diseases. Since, they have encountered many undesired problems, (emesis), they focused their research on other PDEs. Today, increases in the knowledge of complex PDE4 regulations in various tissues and pathologies, and the evolution in drug design, resulted in a renewal of PDE4-I development. The present review describes the recent PDE4-I development targeting cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease, malignancies, fatty liver disease, osteoporosis, depression, as well as COVID-19. Today, the direct therapeutic approach of PDE4 is extended by developing allosteric inhibitors and protein/protein interactions allowing to act on the PDE interactome.","Lugnier","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms231810616","20220923","COVID-19; cAMP; cGMP; cancer; cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE); inflammation; interactome; selective PDE4 inhibitor (PDE4-I)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38265,""
"Burnout among Health Care Professionals during COVID-19","The present study examined organizational, situational (i.e., COVID-19-related), and psychological factors associated with burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic among 268 health care professionals in Norway. A total burnout score based on the Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT), the four core BAT subscales (i.e., Exhaustion, Mental Distance, Cognitive Impairment, and Emotional Impairment), and the COVID-19 Burnout Scale served as the dependent variable. Among the results, organizational factors such as work-home conflict, workload, and role conflict were positively related to burnout. Although autonomy and colleague support were negatively related to burnout, support from leaders was positively related to it, which might suggest a suppressive effect. Organizational factors explained most of the variance in general burnout (i.e., BAT Total), whereas situational (i.e., COVID-19-related) factors (e.g., involvement with COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19-induced stress) seemed to better explain COVID-19 burnout. COVID-19-oriented actions were related only to Mental Distance. Psychological factors such as meaning were negatively related to BAT Total, Exhaustion, and Mental Distance, whereas a breach of the psychological contract was related to all subscales. Such results suggest that organizational and situational factors contribute differently to general and COVID-19 burnout and that administering pandemic-specific assessment tools can clarify how the pandemic has affected mental health.","Innstrand","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811807","20220923","COVID-19; burnout; health care professionals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38266,""
"Health and Care Dependency of Older Adults in Dresden, Germany: Results from the LAB60+ Study","As the population in Europe ages, an increased focus on the health of older adults is necessary. The purpose of the population-based LAB60+ study was to examine the current health and care situation of the population of older adults in Dresden, Germany, and to assess the effect of age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES) on health outcomes. In the first half of 2021, 2399 out of 6004 randomly sampled residents of Dresden aged 60 years or older answered questions on their chronic conditions, care dependency, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and well-being, among others. Of the participants, 91.6% were afflicted with at least one chronic condition, and 73.1% had multimorbidities. More than one-tenth (11.3%) of participants were care dependent. Lower levels of HRQoL and well-being were observed compared to a published German reference population, perhaps because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Gender differences were observed for some chronic health conditions, and women had a higher risk for lower HRQoL, well-being, and depressivity compared to men. A low SES was associated with a higher risk of the vast majority of health outcomes. Particularly, socioeconomic factors and gender-related inequalities should be considered for the development of prevention and health-promoting measures during late life.","Romero Starke, Hegewald, Schmauder, Kaboth, Uhlmann, Reissig, Kaufmann, Wegge, Marquardt, Seidler","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811777","20220923","health-related quality of life; healthy ageing; mental health; multimorbidity; need for care; older adults; physical health; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38267,""
"The Potential Impact of a Public Health Approach to Improving the Physical Health of People Living with Mental Illness","With already wide disparities in physical health and life expectancy, COVID-19 presents people with mental illness with additional threats to their health: decreased access to health services, increased social isolation, and increased socio-economic disadvantage. Each of these factors has exacerbated the risk of poor health and early death for people with mental illness post-COVID-19. Unless effective primary care and preventative health responses are implemented, the physical illness epidemic for this group will increase post the COVID-19 pandemic. This perspective paper briefly reviews the literature on the impact of COVID-19 on service access, social isolation, and social disadvantage and their combined impact on physical health, particularly cancer, respiratory diseases, heart disease, smoking, and infectious diseases. The much-overlooked role of poor physical health on suicidality is also discussed. The potential impact of public health interventions is modelled based on Australian incidence data and current research on the percentage of early deaths of people living with mental illnesses that are preventable. Building on the lessons arising from services' response to COVID-19, such as the importance of ensuring access to preventive, screening, and primary care services, priority recommendations for consideration by public health practitioners and policymakers are presented.","Roberts, Johnson, Hopwood, Firth, Jackson, Sara, Allan, Calder, Manger","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811746","20220923","COVID-19; CVD; cancer; comorbidity; mental health; physical health; respiratory disease; smoking; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38268,""
"E-Cigarette Use Is Associated with Increased Psychological Distress among Youth: A Pooled Cross-Sectional Analysis of State-Level Data from 2019 and 2021","A crisis of worsening youth mental health in recent years across the United States has created alarm among health professionals. As a result, health professionals have sought to improve methods of identifying youth in need of treatment services. Cigarette, cannabis, and alcohol use each consistently serve as behavioral markers of risk for youth mental health problems. Despite the recent growth of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use among youth, few studies have examined whether e-cigarettes follow the same associational pattern with mental health problems in the context of other substance use. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may have altered the associations between youth substance use and mental health problems due to both reduced overall use and increased mental health problems after the onset of the pandemic. The current study examined associations between youth substance use and psychological distress before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic using two state-representative samples of youth in grades 8, 10, and 12 from 2019 (N = 58,689) and 2021 (N = 46,823) from Utah. Pooled cross-sectional linear and negative binomial regression models clustered by grade, stratified by school district, and weighted to represent population characteristics estimated associations between recent e-cigarette, combustible cigarette, cannabis, and heavy alcohol use and two measures of psychological distress-depressive symptoms and mental health treatment needs. After controlling for sociodemographic factors and recent uses of other substances, results indicated that psychological distress increased from 2019 to 2021 and that recent e-cigarette, combustible cigarette, cannabis, and heavy alcohol use were each significantly associated with increased levels on both measures of psychological distress. Compared to other substances, e-cigarette use showed the strongest standardized associations. The association of e-cigarette use with depressive symptoms strengthened significantly from 2019 to 2021. Given the youth mental health crisis paired with the widespread adoption of e-cigarettes, health professionals should consider recent e-cigarette use an increasingly important behavioral marker for risks of mental health problems among youth. Results suggest that future research studies examining the temporal ordering of substance use and mental health among youth should include e-cigarettes.","Cambron","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811726","20220923","e-cigarettes; psychological distress; youth mental health; youth substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38269,""
"Teachers' Health: How General, Mental and Functional Health Indicators Compare to Other Employees? A Large French Population-Based Study","Teachers' health is a key factor of any successful education system, but available data are conflicting. To evaluate to what extent teachers' health could be at risk, we used pre-pandemic data from the CONSTANCES population-based French cohort (inclusion phase: 2012-2019) and compared teachers (n = 12,839) included in the cohort with a random subsample selected among all other employees (n = 32,837) on four self-reported health indicators: perceived general health, depressive symptoms (CES-D scale), functional limitations in the last six months, and persistent neck/back troubles (Nordic questionnaire). We further restricted our comparison group to the State employees (n = 3583), who share more occupational similarities with teachers. Lastly, we focused on teachers and evaluated how their health status might differ across teaching levels (primary, secondary, and higher education). As compared to non-teacher employees, and even after adjusting for important demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and occupational confounders, teachers were less likely to report bad perceived health and depressive symptoms but were more likely to present functional limitations. Trends were similar in the analyses restricted to State employees. Within the teaching population, secondary school teachers were more likely to report depressive symptoms but less frequently declared persistent neck/back troubles than primary school teachers. Our descriptive cross-sectional study based on a probability sampling procedure (secondary use of CONSTANCES inclusion data) did not support the idea that teachers' health in France was particularly at risk in the pre-pandemic period. Both cross-cultural and longitudinal studies are needed to further gain information on the topic of teachers' health around the world and to monitor its evolution over time, particularly during crises impacting the education system such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","SaÃƒÂ¯d, Temam, Alexander, Billaudeau, Zins, Kab, Vercambre","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811724","20220923","MSD; employees; functional health; mental health; occupational health; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38270,""
"Consequences of COVID-19 on Employees in Remote Working: Challenges, Risks and Opportunities An Evidence-Based Literature Review","The COVID-19 pandemic forced organizations across all sectors and sizes to undertake crucial changes in order to remain productive during the emergency. Among these, the shift towards remote working arrangements is still present in our workplaces, impacting employees' well-being and productivity. This systematic review aims to describe the pandemic's consequences on work organization by analyzing whether and how the shift towards remote or home-working impacted employees' productivity, performance, and well-being. Furthermore, it describes the role of individual and organizational factors in determining employees' adjustment to remote work. Sixty-seven peer-reviewed papers published from 2020 to 2022, written in English, were selected through the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Findings describe how remote working arrangements, the workplace and organizational factors, and the employees' individual traits and skills impacted employees' productivity and well-being. Furthermore, they provide a description of the organizational enforcement actions reported in the literature.

"The Fatigue-Related Symptoms Post-Acute SARS-CoV-2: A Preliminary Comparative Study","A sizeable sub-group of individuals continue to experience persistent debilitating symptoms post-acute SARS-CoV-2. Although these can vary from person to person, fatigue appears to be the most common symptom. Post-viral fatigue has been documented in conditions such as influenza, infectious mononucleosis and more recently chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The current study uses measures that successfully describe the fatigue-related symptoms associated with CFS to investigate the fatigue experienced post-acute SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-six volunteers were recruited from Long COVID support groups active on social media. Data were collected anonymously using an online survey platform. These data were compared to pre-pandemic data from non-fatigued and CFS groups. The post-acute SARS-CoV-2 volunteers reported significantly higher levels of fatigue and cognitive difficulties than the non-fatigued controls. They also report more individual symptoms (such as lack of concentration) and problems with sleep quality. There was a similarity between the post-acute SARS-CoV-2 volunteers and the CFS group in terms of levels of depression, perceived stress, emotional distress and cognitive difficulties. Although this was a small-scale study, it demonstrates the range of symptoms experienced post-acute SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the similarities between this group and CFS suggests the need for further research into the mechanisms at play here, the need to identify those at risk of long-term symptoms and the development of possible interventions.","Thomas","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811662","20220923","chronic fatigue syndrome; fatigue-related symptoms; non-fatigued controls; post-acute SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38272,""

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed at T1, and confirmatory analysis (CFA) at T2. The second-order two-factor structure demonstrated the best fit and very good discriminant and convergent validation. The general factor of the FoCVVS included two subscales assessing the emotional and physiological symptoms of fear of vaccination. Unvaccinated people showed higher levels of fear of vaccination than those vaccinated. A vaccination status, fear of vaccination T1, and fear of COVID-19 T1 were significant predictors of fear of vaccination T2.

"The Impact of Working from Home on Mental Health: A Cross-Sectional Study of Canadian Worker's Mental Health during the Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a considerable expansion in the way work settings are structured, with a continuum emerging between working fully in-person and from home. The pandemic has also exacerbated many risk factors for poor mental health in the workplace, especially in public-facing jobs. Therefore, we sought to test the potential relationship between work setting and self-rated mental health. To do so, we modeled the association of work setting (only working from home, only in-person, hybrid) on self-rated mental health (Excellent/Very Good/Good vs. Fair/Poor) in an online survey of Canadian workers during the third wave of COVID-19. The mediating effects of vaccination, masking, and distancing were explored due to the potential effect of COVID-19-related stress on mental health among those working in-person. Among 1576 workers, most reported hybrid work (77.2%). Most also reported good self-rated mental health (80.7%). Exclusive work from home (aOR: 2.79, 95%CI: 1.90, 4.07) and exclusive in-person work (aOR: 2.79, 95%CI: 1.83, 4.26) were associated with poorer self-rated mental health than hybrid work. Vaccine status mediated only a small proportion of this relationship (7%), while masking and physical distancing were not mediators. We conclude that hybrid work arrangements were associated with positive self-rated mental health. Compliance with vaccination, masking, and distancing recommendations did not meaningfully mediate this relationship.","Bodner, Ruhl, Barr, Shridhar, Skakoon-Sparling, Card","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811588","20220923","COVID-19; masking; mental health; occupational health; physical distancing; telecommuting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38275,""
"Resilience and Depressive Symptoms among Medical Staff in a Military Hospital Dedicated to the Treatment of COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is prevalent around the world, and many studies suggest that depression among medical staff is on the rise during the pandemic. This study aims to assess the relationship between depressive symptoms and individual resilience among military hospital personnel responsible for treating patients with COVID-19. Individuals from the Armed Forces Daejeon Hospital who responded to the questionnaires from 8 February to 15 February 2022 participated in this study. Resilience and depressive symptoms were measured via the Korean Resilience Quotient Test-53 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. We employed multivariable logistic regression analysis to estimate Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) of depressive symptoms. Among 181 participants, the individuals with depressive symptoms and high resilience accounted for 8.8% and 61.9%, respectively. Significant correlations between depressive symptoms and both the low resilience and low resilience positivity groups were found (adjusted OR 10.30 [95% CI 1.74-61.01] and OR 13.90 [95% CI 1.93-100.02], respectively).

We conducted bivariate and multivariate regression analyses to assess changes between the two time points among LGBTQ+ and cisgender, straight students. We found LGBTQ+ students experienced more peer victimization, anxiety, and suicide attempts at both points, before and during the pandemic, than cisgender, straight youth. However, LGBTQ+ students reported increased anxiety, decreased peer victimization, and decreased suicide attempts in 2021, during the pandemic, compared to pre-pandemic 2018 reports. These findings suggest pandemic-related school disruptions may have provided LGBTQ+ students some relief from the harmful effects of poor, in-person school climates.","Gill, McQuillan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811537","20220923","COVID-19; LGBTQ+; adolescence; anxiety; gender; school climate; sexual orientation; suicide; victimization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38278,""
"The Relationship between Social Mentality and Health in Promoting Well-Being and Sustainable City","In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people's social mentality and mental health have been severely affected, which has hindered or even reversed the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, there is a lack of investigation into the potential relationship between social mentality and health, as well as of the comparison between different databases worldwide and in China, in the current context of COVID-19. Hence, the aim of this paper is to explore the research hotspots and development trends of social mentality and health in China and worldwide, while improving people's health, building a sustainable society, and facilitating the achieving of the SDGs. A bibliometric method is employed in this paper from a macro-quantitative and micro-qualitative perspective to explore the research hotspots and trends of social mentality and health in the world and China from the two databases, namely the English-language Web of Science (WOS) and the Chinese-language China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The results indicate that: (1) By using keyword co-occurrence and clustering analysis via the CiteSpace software bibliometric tool, 11 current research hotspots have been identified and studies are increasing in terms of using the Chinese language and the English language. (2) The current studies in the CNKI database mainly focus on the macro social environmental factors affecting social mentality and population research, while the studies in the WOS database pay more attention to social mentality and health in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic situation and a variety of professions. Hence, future research could explore the influencing factors and cultivation methods toward a healthy social mentality from the perspective of methodology and toward achieving SDG 3, providing healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, and SDG 11, building sustainable cities and communities in the post-pandemic COVID-19 era.","Liu, Han, Yan, Liu, Osmani","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811529","20220923","COVID-19; bibliometric; city; comparative study; mental health; social mentality; sustainable development; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38279,""
"Possible Stress-Neuroendocrine System-Psychological Symptoms Relationship in Pregnant Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic induced long-term damages that weigh on the national health systems of various countries in terms of support and care. This review aimed to highlight the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant women. We first report data on the immune system physiopathology and the main viral infections in pregnancy, including COVID-19. Then, the attention is focused on the main factors that affect the mental health of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as (1) the fear of being infected and transmitting the infection to the fetus, (2) the cancellation of checkups and pre-child courses, and (3) confinement and the inability to have close friends or a partner at the time of delivery or in the first days after delivery, as well as family tensions. Because of all this, pregnant women find themselves in a stressful condition independent of the pregnancy, and thus experience anxiety, depression, insomnia, hostility, delirium, and an alteration of the mother-baby relationship. Several studies have shown an involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in response to the pandemic. We propose a possible involvement of the neuroendocrine system as a mediator of the psychological symptoms of pregnant women induced by COVID-19-related stress.","Gizzi, Mazzeschi, Delvecchio, Beccari, Albi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811497","20220923","COVID-19; anxiety; confinement; depression; mental disorders; pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38280,""
"Short- and Long-Term Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Suicide-Related Mental Health in Korean Adolescents","This study investigated the short-term (in 2020) and long-term (in 2021) impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide-related characteristics in Korean adolescents in comparison with the pre-pandemic period (in 2019) and examined the factors associated with those impacts. Secondary data of the cross-sectional 15th-17th (2019-2021) Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey targeting adolescents in school were utilized. The proportions of adolescents with depression, suicidal ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts were 26.5%, 12.2%, 3.7%, and 2.4%, respectively. Following an adjustment, depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts significantly improved in the short term and depression and suicide attempts improved significantly in the long term (i.e., 2021), albeit to a lesser degree. The associated variables in the short-term analysis (i.e., 2020) reflected the socioeconomic vulnerabilities (e.g., lower household socioeconomic status [SES], unhealthy status, and unhealthy behaviors), as well as the socioeconomically favorable indicators (e.g., high household SES and high academic achievement). In the long-term, suicidal ideation was no longer associated with a lack of engagement in hand washing, and suicide attempts were no longer associated with the amount of internet time used for studying. For a successful suicide prevention, it is necessary to develop in-school interventions that address the relevant factors identified in this study and the community-based interventions that target out-of-school adolescents.","Lee, Hong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811491","20220923","COVID-19; Korea; adolescents; depression; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38281,""
"The Mental Health of Older Adults in the Densely Populated Areas of Tacna Region-Peru, 2021: Implications of the COVID-19 Information","The purpose of this research was to analyze the implications of exposure to various news channels that broadcast information on COVID-19 and their impact on the mental health of older adults in the sparsely populated area of the Tacna Region during the year 2021. The present study used a descriptive correlational type of quantitative approach on a sample of 389 older adults aged 60 years and over, who were recruited by non-probabilistic convenience sampling. For the application of the survey technique, the instrument used was a questionnaire modified by the authors. In terms of research ethics for the development of the study, the respondents provided informed consent, and other ethical considerations were addressed. In relation to sociodemographic variables of mental health, it was found that women had a greater incidence of anxiety (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) and that people with fewer years of study had a greater incidence of depression (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) and anxiety in sparsely populated areas. Exposure to news through television was associated with depression, and news obtained from other people was associated with depression (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). An association was also found between the number of hours of television news and stress (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), and radio news was associated with anxiety (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). In terms of psychological consequences, the highest mean for television exposure was fear, while the greatest psychological consequence of radio news was fear, followed by stress and awareness. Finally, negative, inverse, and significant relationships were found that indicate protective factors, such as depression with awareness and indignation, and anxiety was inversely related to awareness.","Cachicatari-Vargas, Mutter Cuellar, Condori Chipana, Miranda Socasaire, Acevedo-Duque, Arpasi-Quispe","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811470","20220923","COVID-19; exposition; mental health; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38282,""
"Mindfulness-Based Intervention for the Reduction of Compassion Fatigue and Burnout in Nurse Caregivers of Institutionalized Older Persons with Dementia: A Randomized Controlled Trial","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the mental health of nurses caring for institutionalized older people. Caring in this environment can be complex, with higher levels of burnout and compassion fatigue in staff. It is therefore important to find interventions to increase the well-being of staff. Mindfulness training is known to be effective in treating a variety of physical and mental health conditions. This study sought to conduct a direct evaluation of the effectiveness of a combined online training in two types of mindfulness-based therapies for the reduction of compassion fatigue and burnout in geriatric nurses caring for institutionalized elderly people with dementia. In a randomized controlled trial (<i>n</i> = 39 experimental group, <i>n</i> = 35 control group), we explored whether individuals with high levels of burnout and compassion fatigue would benefit more from an online mindfulness training program. The outcome variable was the ProQoL professional quality of life scale, which was collected at baseline, at six weeks, and at three months after completion of the intervention. Significant differences were found between both groups for the subscales Compassion Fatigue and Burnout (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05), with a significant improvement in the experimental group (significant effect size). These findings were maintained at three months after the end of the intervention for both compassion fatigue (F1,28 = 18.14, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and burnout (F1,28 = 7.25, <i>p</i> = 0.040). However, there were no differences between groups for the satisfaction subscale. The effect of time and the effects of comparing the two groups after controlling for time were statistically significant for all three subscales of the questionnaire (all <i>p</i> values &amp;lt; 0.001), with effect sizes ranging from small to large (R<sup>2</sup> change 0.10-0.47). These data indicate that the experimental condition was more effective, explaining between 10 and 18% more of the variance. A short, online intervention based on mindfulness training appears to be effective for reducing compassion fatigue and burnout in geriatric nurses, with sustained effects over time.","PÃƒÂ©rez, MenÃƒÂ©ndez-CrispÃƒÂ­n, Sarabia-Cobo, de Lorena, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Vaca","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811441","20220923","burnout; compassion fatigue; dementia; mindfulness-based intervention; nurse; occupational stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38283,""
"Psychological Distress in Breast Cancer Patients during the Italian COVID-19 Pandemic","The emergency caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic exacerbated psychological distress. Our aim was to investigate the impact of breast cancer on patients' lives during the Italian lockdown. Sixty-five female breast cancer patients were studied, assessing the level of psychological distress with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the impact of the cancer diagnosis (Impact of Event Scale-Revised-IES-R). In addition, we compared these data with a matched group of breast cancer patients enrolled in 2019. Patients enrolled in 2020 had statistically higher levels of anxious symptomatology and higher levels of traumatic symptomatology due to the cancer diagnosis. A mediation analysis was performed to determine how the experience of distress due to COVID-19 negatively impacted the level of anxiety and amplified the impact of the diagnosis with a significant increase in traumatic symptoms. Considering the vulnerability of these patients and the serious and novel situation that the healthcare system is currently facing, we would like to point out the importance of structured and organised psychological support for these patients.","Stanizzo, Castelli, Di Nardo, Brunetti, De Sanctis, Ghiggia","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811433","20220923","COVID-19; breast cancer; post-traumatic stress symptoms; psycho-oncology; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38284,""
"Home Office, Health Behavior and Workplace Health Promotion of Employees in the Telecommunications Sector during the Pandemic","Our study aims to present the perception and experiences of employees at a large multinational telecommunications company in Hungary working in home offices, as well as their health behavior and the workplace health promotion during the SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 outbreak. The sample consisted of the full sample of highly skilled employees at a large telecommunication multinational company (N = 46). Throughout the analysis, tests for homogeneity of variance were followed by a MANOVA test to compare the groups' means by gender, age, and job classification. The results clearly show that in the short term, workers' mental health did not deteriorate, they do not argue or fight more with their partners and are no more depressed or irritable than before. Workers are less likely to think of ways to be more effective at work than in a home office. Similarly, they do not think that employers have more expectations than before the pandemic. Our research shows the assumption about home workers being less efficient or less diligent in their daily work to be false. A supportive and flexible employer approach to health-conscious employees will be an essential aspect in the future.","TÃƒÂ¡nczos, Zala, SzakÃƒÂ¡ly, TÃƒÂ³th, BognÃƒÂ¡r","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811424","20220923","fitness; mental health and wellness in home office; multinational companies; work health promotion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38285,""
"The Level of COVID-19 Anxiety among Oncology Patients in Poland","Cancer patients tend to have a high psychological burden. Half of cancer patients suffer from severe affective disorders and anxiety disorders, while one-third struggle with mild forms of these. The COVID-19 pandemic is damaging the mental health of the population due to social restrictions. A growing number of studies note the role of COVID-19 anxiety in the health and quality of life of cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to estimate the level of COVID-19 anxiety among oncology patients and to test the utility of the FCV-19S scale in a population study of cancer patients. The study included 600 respondents (300 oncology patients and 300 control subjects not undergoing oncological treatment). The FCV-19S scale and the GAD-7 scale were used in the study. The results were interpreted according to the following verbal scale: 76-100%, high anxiety; 56-75%, moderate anxiety; 26-55%, low COVID-19 anxiety; &amp;lt;25%, no COVID-19 anxiety. In the analysis of the GAD-7 questionnaire results, the mean score obtained was 8.21 (min. 0; max. 21; SD 5.32). For 81% of respondents in the group of oncology patients, the total score indicated the presence of anxiety symptoms with varying degrees of severity; in the control group, this proportion was 55% of respondents. The FCV-19S scale score as a percentage was 57.4% for oncology patients, indicating a moderate level of fear of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and 30.3% for the control group, indicating a low level of fear of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One-fifth of oncology patients were afraid of losing their lives due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus; in the control group, this proportion was 13% of respondents. Oncology patients were characterized by a higher prevalence of sleep disturbance than control group respondents, which was associated with greater anxiety. The study, therefore, shows that oncology patients have moderate levels of anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and non-oncology patients show lower levels of anxiety.","Grajek, Krupa-Kotara, Rozmiarek, Sobczyk, DziaÃ…â€šach, GÃƒÂ³rski, Kobza","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811418","20220923","COVID-19; FCV-19S; GAD-7; Poland; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; oncology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38286,""
"Factors Affecting Fatigue among Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study identified clinical nurses' fatigue and related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a cross-sectional study. Data were collected from South Korean hospitals on 234 nurses' general characteristics, fatigue, depression, occupational stress, insomnia, and perceived daytime sleepiness using a structured questionnaire. The prevalence of fatigue was 62.0%, depression 52.1%, insomnia 20.7%, and daytime sleepiness 36.1%. Insomnia, sleepiness, depression, and occupational stress were significantly associated with fatigue. Ward nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients within the past month had significantly higher occupational stress related to organizational climate than those who had not provided care, and ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients had significantly higher job insecurity-related occupational stress. Nurses have a high prevalence of fatigue and depression during the pandemic. Thus, insomnia, sleepiness, depression, and occupational stress must be reduced to lower nurses' fatigue. Caring for COVID-19 patients was not significantly associated with fatigue, but there were significant differences in occupational stress between nurses who provided such care and those who did not. Work environment-specific strategies are needed to reduce nurses' occupational stress during the pandemic.","Lee, Choi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811380","20220923","COVID-19; depression; fatigue; nurses; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38287,""
"Evaluation of the Impact of the First Wave of COVID-19 and Associated Lockdown Restrictions on Persons with Disabilities in 14 States of India","There is a paucity of data to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons with disabilities (PwDs) in India. About 27.4 million cases were reported as of 27 May 2021. The continuing pandemic in the form of subsequent waves is expected to have negative repercussions for the disabled globally, particularly in India, where access to health, rehabilitation, and social care services is very limited. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown restrictions on PwDs in India. To determine the level of disruption due to COVID-19 and the associated countrywide lockdown restrictions on PwD in India during the first wave. Using a cross-sectional, mixed-methods approach, data were collected from a representative sample of 403 persons with disabilities in 14 states in India during the COVID-19 first wave at two different points in time (Lockdown and post-lockdown phase). Factors associated with the negative impact were examined using the Chi-square test for associations. The paired comparisons between 'lockdown' with the 'post-lockdown' phase are presented using McNemar's test and the marginal homogeneity test to compare the proportions. Additionally, a subsample of the participants in the survey was identified to participate in in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to gain in-depth insights on the study question and substantiate the quantitative findings. The framework approach was used to conduct a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. About 60% of the PwDs found it difficult to access emergency medical services during the lockdown, and 4.6% post lockdown (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Likewise, 12% found it difficult to access rehabilitation services during the lockdown, and 5% post lockdown (<i>p</i> = 0.03). About 76% of respondents were apprehensive of the risk of infection during the lockdown, and this increased to 92% post lockdown (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Parents with children were significantly impacted due to lockdown in the areas of Medical (<i>p</i> = 0.007), Rehabilitation (<i>p</i> = 0.001), and Mental health services (<i>p</i> = 0.001). The results from the qualitative study supported these quantitative findings. PWDs felt that the lockdown restrictions had negatively impacted their productivity, social participation, and overall engagement in everyday activities. Access to medicines and rehabilitation services was felt to be extremely difficult and detrimental to the therapeutic benefits that were gained by them during the pre-pandemic time. None of the pandemic mitigation plans and services was specific or inclusive of PWDs. COVID-19 and the associated lockdown restrictions have negatively impacted persons with disabilities during the first wave in India. It is critical to mainstream disability within the agenda for health and development with pragmatic, context-specific strategies and programs in the country.","Tetali, Kamalakannan, Sadanand, Lewis, Varughese, Hans, Murthy","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811373","20220923","COVID-19; India; disabled persons; lockdown restrictions; public health; vulnerable population","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38288,""

Were there any changes in self-assessed mental and physical health? Were there any changes in self-assessed mental and physical health symptoms? The study is based on an online survey conducted in 2019 and 2021. A total of 920 primary school teachers answered the questionnaire in part or in full, after three reminders. The main findings show increased stress, worsening mental and physical health, and increasing mental and physical symptoms in 2021 compared to 2019. The results also show a higher percentage of women than men reporting high stress, with women scoring higher on the PSS scale, but the gender patterns for mental and physical health are less clear. The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic had negative consequences on the health and well-being of the teachers.

This study adopted a cross-sectional design, and 160 outpatients with RDs in one university hospital in South Korea were sampled using the convenience sampling method. Data were collected from May to July 2021 using a structured questionnaire. The risk factors of depression were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analyses. The prevalence rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insomnia, and depression were 37.5%, 20.0%, and 24.4%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analyses confirmed that employment status, monthly income, perceived health, PTSD, and insomnia were significant risk factors of depression. The findings highlight the urgent need to assist patients with RDs who are at risk of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially individuals who are unemployed or have low incomes and poor perceived health, individuals with high PTSD, and individuals with severe insomnia.

"It's What We Do: Experiences of UK Nurses Working during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact on Practice, Identity and Resilience","The COVID-19 pandemic increased pressure on a nursing workforce already facing high levels of stress, burnout, and fatigue in the United Kingdom (UK) and internationally. The contribution of nurses to keeping the public safe was widely recognised as they met the challenges of delivering complex patient care during the healthcare crisis. However, the psychological impact of this on nurses' health and wellbeing has been substantial, and the number of nurses leaving the profession in the UK is rising. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of this on their psychological health, wellbeing and resilience. The study is part of a wider project to develop and pilot an online resilience intervention for nurses during COVID-19. Five focus groups with 22 nurses were carried out online.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on School-Aged Children with Fragile X Syndrome","The pandemic caused by the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), beginning in early 2020, had an impact beyond anything experienced in recent history. People with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the leading known heritable cause of ASD and intellectual disability, were uniquely vulnerable to pandemic-related changes. This study surveyed parent perspectives of the impact on 33 school-aged children with FXS across daily living skills, education, therapies, behaviors, health visits, and mask wearing. Academic performance was perceived to have decreased in most of the children (58%). Students in online school had the most reports of decline and those in person had the most reported improvement. Parents were significantly more satisfied with services that remained in person compared to those delivered online or in hybrid settings. Additionally, depression (75%), sleep problems (80%), attention problems (73%), and social skills (61%) were reported to have worsened the most. Parents reported that in addition to continuing with a structured schedule, the most helpful strategies were increasing face-to-face social interactions and outdoor activities. Future research should explore strategies to help online interventions and education to be more successful with individuals with FXS, given this may become a resource for families not geographically able to access in-person resources.","Silver, Rosselot, Shaffer, Lozano","https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13091666","20220923","COVID-19 pandemic; Fragile X Syndrome; caregiver perspectives","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38294,""
"Usefulness of a Mobile Application (Mentali) for Anxiety and Depression Screening in Medical Students and Description of the Associated Triggering Factors","The impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on the mental health of the population requires the implementation of new primary screening strategies of mental health disorders to intervene in a timelier manner, and technology may provide solutions. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the mobile app Mentali (version 1.1.2; creators: Jorge Alfonso SolÃƒÂ­s GalvÃƒÂ¡n Sodel VÃƒÂ¡zquez Reyes, Margarita de la Luz MartÃƒÂ­nez Fierro, Perla Velasco Elizondo, Idalia Garza Veloz, Alejandro Mauricio GonzÃƒÂ¡lez and Claudia Caldera Villalobos, Zacatecas, MÃƒÂ©xico) as a primary screening tool for anxiety and depression disorders in medical students and to assess the triggering risk factors. This was a descriptive and longitudinal study and included 155 Mexican medical students. Participants interacted with Mentali for 6 months. The mobile app integrated the Beck anxiety and depression inventories together with a mood module. At the end of the interaction, the students received psychological and psychiatric interventions to confirm their primary diagnoses. Symptoms of moderate/severe anxiety and depression were present in 62.6% and 54.6% of the studied population. When corroborating the diagnoses, Mentali obtained a sensitivity of 100%, 95%, and 43% to classify a mental health disorder, anxiety, and depression, respectively. The most important triggers found were as follows: belonging to a dysfunctional family, being introverted, and having suffered from bullying. The proportion of users with excellent/good mood decreased from 78.7% to 34.4% at the end of the semester, and the proportion of users who claimed to have bad/very bad mood increased from 7.4% to 34.4% at the end of the semester (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). Mentali was useful for identifying users with anxiety and/or depression, and as an auxiliary tool to coordinate the provision of specialized interventions, allowing us to increase the proportion of patients who needed psychological care and received it by 30%. The efficacy of Mentali in identifying activities through time with an impact on the mood and mental health of the users was confirmed. Our results support the use of Mentali for the primary screening of mental health disorders in young adults, including medical students.","Martinez-Fierro, Ayala-Haro, Pinedo-Hurtado, Solis-Galvan, Garza-Veloz, Velazquez-Lopez, Camacho-Martinez, Avila-Carrasco, Vazquez-Reyes, Velasco-Elizondo, Mauricio-Gonzalez, Ortiz-Castro","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12091223","20220923","Beck inventories; affective disorders; anxiety; depression; psychiatry; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38295,""
"Perceived Psychological Impact on Children and Parents of Experiencing COVID-19 Infection in One or More Family Members","SARS-CoV-2 infection may impair behavior and mental health; we explored the psychological impact on parents and children who experienced COVID-19 within their families. A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted on families attending the COVID-19 Follow-up Clinic at the Department for Women's and Children's Health, Padua (Italy). From April 2020 to August 2021, 75 surveys were collected from 66 families (97 parents and 129 children); almost 70% of participants had COVID-19, mostly asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic, and the median time from infection to survey compilation was 164.7 days (SD 56). Most parents (&amp;gt;87%) reported positive relationships with family members either before, during, or after COVID-19. More than one-third of children and adolescents were unable to adapt to isolation. Among 31 pre-school children with a median age of 3 (SD 1.7), a change of one or more functions was reported for 74.2% of cases irrespective of COVID-19 status, particularly a change in circadian rhythm (25%), in relationship with parents (42.8%), and poor emotional control (36%). Among 74 children with a median age of 10.9 years (SD 2.7), 8.1% had a score indicating a disease; however, significant impairment in attention was reported for 16.7%, along with anxiety/depression and problems with conduct in 5.6% and 6.5% of cases, respectively.","Costenaro, Di Chiara, Boscolo, Barbieri, Tomasello, Cantarutti, Cozzani, Liberati, Oletto, Giaquinto, DonÃƒÂ ","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9091370","20220923","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; adolescents; children; family cluster; psychological; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38296,""
"Cognitive appraisals and coping strategies of registered nurses in the emergency department combating COVID-19: A scoping review","Explore the relevant evidence about stress-related cognitive appraisal and coping strategies among registered nurses in the emergency department (EDRNs) coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. This scoping review followed the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley to map relevant evidence and synthesize the findings. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases for related studies from inception through February 2, 2022. This review further conducted study selection based on the PRISMA flow diagram and applied Lazarus and Folkman's Psychological Stress and Coping Theory to systematically organize, summarize, and report the findings. Sixteen studies were included for synthesis. Most of the studies showed that the majority of EDRNs were overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression, triaging distress, physical exhaustion, and intention to leave ED nursing were cited as major threats to their wellness. Additionally, comprehensive training, a modified triage system, a safe workplace, psychological support, promotion of resilience, and accepting responsibility may help EDRNs cope with pandemic-related challenges effectively. The long-lasting pandemic has affected the physical and mental health of EDRNs because they have increased their effort to respond to the outbreak with dynamically adjusted strategies. Future research should address a modified triage system, prolonged psychological issues, emergency healthcare quality, and solutions facing EDRNs during the COVID-19 or related future pandemics. EDRNs have experienced physical and psychological challenges during the pandemic. The ED administrators need to take action to ensure EDRNs' safety in the workplace, an up-to-date triage system, and mental health of frontline nurses to provide high-quality emergency care for combating COVID-19.","Lin, Siao, Lin, Hsin, Shelley, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12815","20220923","COVID-19 pandemic; emergency triage; registered nurses in the emergency department (EDRNs); stress and coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38297,""
"COVID-19 impact on mental health, healthcare access and social wellbeing - a black community needs assessment","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on the Black/African American population. In addition to the higher infection rates and the worse outcomes, there were other unintended consequences of the pandemic. The study objective was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the Black/African American community. A needs assessment was conducted using a mixed-methods approach. To address this specific study objective, an item included in the survey questionnaire asked respondents (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°183) about their greatest worry related to CODID-19. Interviews and focus group discussions were conducted to further explore individual and community perceptions. The areas of greatest concern were Health (41.0%), Family (25.1%), Finances (8.2%), and Education (4.9%). The needs assessment revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the mental health and wellness, healthcare access and utilization, and social aspects of life the Black community. Emerging themes revealed that there was worsening mental health for many, limited healthcare access and under-utilization, and profound disruption of the social cohesive identity of the Black/African American community. Pre-existing structural inequities are implicated in the mental health impact, as well as the under-utilization of and limited access to healthcare services in the Black/African American population. The impact on social well-being emphasizes the important role of culture in the population health of communities of color, further supporting the need for culturally-responsive public health interventions when targeting these communities.","Okoro, Vosen, Allen, Kennedy, Roberts, Aremu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-022-01743-z","20220922","COVID-19, black/African American; Healthcare access; Mental health; Social well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38298,""
"Sleep and sleep-modifying factors in chronic migraine patients during the COVID-19 lockdown","The objective of the present study was to evaluate sleep features and sleep-modifying factors in patients with chronic migraine (CM) during the first Italian COVID-19 lockdown. The study was based on an e-mail survey addressed to CM patients of our headache center. The survey investigated demographic, life-style, sleep, psychological, and migraine features during the first COVID-19 lockdown period and the month before. The outcomes were sleep quality (measured using PSQI) and variation in sleep quality, duration, and latency. Ninety-two patients were included. The mean PSQI was 11.96. Sleep quality was improved in 14.1%, stable in 47.8%, and worsened in 38.0%. Sleep latency was reduced in 5.4%, stable in 46.7%, and increased in 47.8%. Sleep duration was reduced in 29.3%, stable in 34.8%, and increased in 35.9%. Significant associations were found with age, work/study, remote working, job loss, meal quality change, smoking variation, COVID-19 province prevalence, home-inhabitant relationship, ratio of house size/number of people, stress, state anxiety, anxiety/depression variation, future concern variation, computer hours, internet hours, and television hours. The study described sleep features of chronic migraineurs during COVID-19 lockdown, pinpointing the main factors involved in sleep quality and sleep changes. Our findings revealed that migraineurs' sleep was closely linked with life-style and psychological features. Several modifiable factors came to light and they should be considered in order to develop an optimal management of CM. An appropriate and more aware treatment of sleep problems could be a way to improve migraineurs' life.","CurrÃƒÂ², Ciacciarelli, Vitale, La Spina, Toscano, Vita, Trimarchi, Silvestri, Autunno","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-022-06378-0","20220922","COVID-19; Chronic migraine; Headache; Life style; Lockdown; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38299,""
"Long-term neurologic outcomes of COVID-19","The neurologic manifestations of acute COVID-19 are well characterized, but a comprehensive evaluation of postacute neurologic sequelae at 1 year has not been undertaken. Here we use the national healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to build a cohort of 154,068 individuals with COVID-19, 5,638,795 contemporary controls and 5,859,621 historical controls; we use inverse probability weighting to balance the cohorts, and estimate risks and burdens of incident neurologic disorders at 12 months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results show that in the postacute phase of COVID-19, there was increased risk of an array of incident neurologic sequelae including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cognition and memory disorders, peripheral nervous system disorders, episodic disorders (for example, migraine and seizures), extrapyramidal and movement disorders, mental health disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, sensory disorders, Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome, and encephalitis or encephalopathy. We estimated that the hazard ratio of any neurologic sequela was 1.42 (95% confidence intervals 1.38, 1.47) and burden 70.69 (95% confidence intervals 63.54, 78.01) per 1,000 persons at 12 months. The risks and burdens were elevated even in people who did not require hospitalization during acute COVID-19. Limitations include a cohort comprising mostly White males. Taken together, our results provide evidence of increased risk of long-term neurologic disorders in people who had COVID-19.","Xu, Xie, Al-Aly","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-02001-z","20220922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38300,""
"Adolescence and COVID-19: Traumatic Stress and Social Distancing in the Italian Epicenter of Pandemic","The spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic led the Italian government to impose restrictive measures. Schools were closed and the organization of Distance Learning (DL) made adolescents face the psychological impact of the pandemic and the loss of their social life. This research aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and DL on students, attending two high schools in the Lodi area (Lombardy, Italy). A questionnaire, composed of PSYCHO-COVID 19 and EMOTION THERMOMETER applied to DL, was administered anonymously through the Google Drive School platform, from May 5th to June 5th 2020. Analysis of the protocols revealed stress reactions in 35% of students (12% High, 7% Moderate, 16% Mild). Principal Components Analysis also revealed the presence of a ""distress entity"" characterized by anxiety, depressive and somatic symptoms (comparable to those of post-traumatic stress syndrome), with a greater impact on females. The analysis of data on DL showed that online teaching was experienced negatively, in an almost linear correlation, by those subjects who had expressed distress. The results suggest that the pandemic had a traumatic impact on adolescents, especially on girls; psychological distress negatively influenced individual experiences with DL. Appropriate psychotherapeutic interventions are needed to prevent the chronicization of stress reactions and to facilitate the adaptation of adolescents to possible rapid changes in educational management.","Maiorani, Fernandez, Tummino, Verdi, Gallina, Pagani","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jin2105143","20220922","COVID-19; adolescents; distance learning (DL); mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38301,""
"Addressing challenges at the intersection of early intervention and child welfare","The Keep Children and Families Safe Act amendment to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) of 2003 mandated children under age three who are involved with Child Welfare (CW) to receive a referral to the system for early intervention (EI). While there is strong rationale for providing developmental services to young children and families impacted by maltreatment, the early implementation of this policy brought about many challenges related to interagency coordination and readiness of providers to provide cross-systems care. Currently, as the system and providers within the system recover from the effects of Covid-19, a predicted increase in need of services may exacerbate historical gaps in the provision of services to families involved with CW. This policy-focused paper explores issues impacting CW and EI providers who coordinate care between CW and EI services. This paper provides a historical examination of these challenges and proposes an approach for improving developmental services for families referred from CW, specifically through the lens of addressing resources and supports available to providers. The proposed approach includes an increase and reprioritization of resources to support provider readiness and well-being. By focusing on support for providers, the authors propose a reduction of stress and improvement of services at each level of the ""well-being"" system.","Munger, Stegenga, Storie, Wennerstrom","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105852","20220922","Child welfare; Early intervention; Educator mental health; Educator stress; Infant mental health; Trauma-informed","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-24","",38302,""
"Abstracts of Presentations at the Association of Clinical Scientists 143<sup>rd</sup> Meeting Louisville, KY May 11-14,2022","[1] Abraham J. Gitlitz Memorial Lecture: Development of a BroadSpectrum Antiviral-based Intranasal Spray as a Pandemic Preparedness Strategy. Kenneth E. Palmer, Ph.D, Center for Predictive Medicine for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases and Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY In early 2020, the public health emergency prompted many researchers to contemplate how they might contribute to control of the COVID-19 pandemic. This presentation will detail the research steps taken to bring a novel broad spectrum antiviral protein into a first in humans clinical trial. We had been developing a broad spectrum antiviral protein, the lectin Q-Griffithsin (Q-GRFT), as a topical microbicide for HIV-1 prevention. We knew that Q-GRFT also inhibited replication of many members of the Coronavirus family of pathogens, so initiated a rapid preclinical and clinical development program of a Q-GRFT intranasal spray as a prophylaxis modality against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. We finalized a suitable formulation to deliver Q-GRFT to the nasopharynx, the initial site of replication of SARS-CoV-2. Non-clinical toxicology studies supported first-in-human clinical studies. Efficacy studies in mice and hamsters provided proof of concept that Q-GRFT can protect animals against challenge. We filed an investigational new drug (IND) application, and received study may proceed authorization from the FDA. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled single dose safety and pharmacokinetics clinical study in 18 volunteers, all of whom had been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The product was safe, and enhanced the levels of SARS-CoV-2 as well as MERS-CoV inhibitory activity present in the nasal and naso-pharyngeal swabs. The safety and pharmacokinetics profile of our Q-GRFT intranasal spray supports a multi-dose Phase 1b clinical study, and further development as a general pandemic preparedness strategy. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: describe the preclinical and clinical strategies employed to support a first in humans clinical trial of a novel broad-spectrum antiviral protein containing nasal spray; discuss planning, design and execution of a first-in-humans Phase 1a clinical trial for evaluation of safety, and selection of a dosing strategy for a Phase 1b multiple dose safety and pharmacokinetics study. [2] Acetylation pharmacogenomics: paradigm for informed individual risk assessment following environmental carcinogen exposure. David W. Hein, Ph.D, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Human epidemiological studies associating chemical exposures to cancer risk often are inconsistently validated across studies. Examples include the effect of smoking on cancer etiology other than the lung, such as urinary bladder and breast. Research findings from the laboratory have improved the understanding of arylamine carcinogen metabolism leading to improved design and interpretation of human molecular epidemiology investigations. Laboratory studies that infer and test biological plausibility, including cancer risks modified by differential metabolism of arylamine carcinogens in rapid and slow arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) acetylators, have been critical for investigating the role of smoking in the etiology of human cancers. This chapter will illustrate these concepts with an example of a cancer in which the role of smoking has largely been validated (urinary bladder cancer) and examples where a consensus has yet to be achieved. Portions of this work were funded by the following NIH grants: R01-CA034627; T32-ES011564; P42-ES023716; P20-GM113226; R25-CA134283; and P30-ES030283. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Assess the role of genetic polymorphisms in individual risk assessments following exposures to environmental carcinogens. 2. Recognize the importance of laboratory-based data in the biological plausibility of individual risk assessments. 3. Recognize the genetic complexity inherent in human epidemiological studies. [3] Rolling with the punches: A biosafety program at a research university addresses COVID-19. Allen Helm, PhD, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL This presentation describes the biosafety program at a research university and medical center, demonstrating how the program was modified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Biosafety professionals are tasked with facilitating biomedical research by enacting coordinated efforts to protect research staff and students, the larger research community, and the environment and ecosystem from biological hazards used in the laboratory. These hazards include recombinant organisms ranging from microorganisms to animals, microbial pathogens, human-derived material, and biological toxins. The University of Chicago (UChicago) is an academic research institution affiliated with an urban medical center. There are approximately 300 biomedical principal investigator-led laboratories conducting investigations in basic, translational, and clinical science. The biosafety program at UChicago is part of the Office of Research Safety and consists of a director and four biosafety officers who perform a variety of duties, including: 1) Assisting researchers in planning experiments that utilize biohazards; 2) Developing and delivering biosafety training courses; 3) Performing annual inspections of laboratories; 4) Working with the university's Institutional Biosafety Committee; 5) Ensuring compliance with local, state, and federal agencies. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the biosafety program in several ways, as follows: 1) Altering administrative operations; 2) Developing biosafety standards for investigators working with SARS-CoV-2; 3) Establishing a ""COVID Core"" to handle influx of said researchers; 4) Enhanced biosafety interactions with clinical laboratories due to a demand for vaccines and treatments. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Identify the role of biosafety professionals in basic, translational, and clinical research. 2. Recognize how a pandemic can alter the way biosafety services are delivered to research programs. 3. Recognize the need for flexibility in a successful biosafety program.

In a cohort of orthopedic surgery patients, we interrogated the associations between genetic, intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors, plasma concentrations of hydrocodone and metabolites, common side effects, and pain score. Data for each patient was collected by the review of the electronic medical record and a patient interview at the time of sample collection. Patients with trauma or undergoing scheduled elective surgery for total knee or total hip replacement at the University of Louisville, Baptist East, and Jewish Hospitals, Louisville, KY. Plasma opiate concentrations and a targeted genotyping panel were performed. We observed statistically significant correlations for daily (p&lt;0.001) and total dose (p=0.002) of hydrocodone. Duration of in-hospital and duration of opioid therapy for patients were also significantly different based on their genotypes. The length of opioid administration was significantly shorter in CYP2D6 EM/UM compared to patients with CYP2D6 PM/IM genotypes (p=0.018). Subjects with the OPRM1 c.118G polymorphism were also on opioids for a longer period of time (p=0.022). Co-administration of medications with CYP2D6 inhibitor activity had a significant effect on the length of opioid therapy (P&lt;0.001). Both the hospital stay period and days of opioid use post hospital discharge were greater in patients with the inhibitor-adjusted CYP2D6 phenotype (p&lt;0.001). This trial showed that patients should be evaluated for the use of inhibitors of CYP2D6. Interaction with these therapeutics while administering hydrocodone therapy can alter the phenotype of the patient (phenocopy) and result in longer opioid therapy duration. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. to discuss various sources of variability to response and toxicity of analgesics. 2. to present the post-operative pain management trial in a cohort of women just undergone Cesarean Section. 3. to present the post-operative pain management trial in a cohort of lower extremity orthopedic patients. [6] Claude P. Brown Memorial Lecture: The Many Roads to Steatohepatitis and its Treatment. Craig J. McClain, MD, University of Louisville School of Medicine,Louisville, KY Hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis are common histologic findings that can be caused by multiple etiologies. The three most frequent causes for steatosis/ steatohepatitis are alcohol (alcohol-associated steatohepatitis, ASH), obesity/metabolic syndrome (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), and environmental toxicants (toxicant-associated steatohepatitis, TASH). Hepatic steatosis is an early occurrence in all three forms of liver disease, and they often share common pathways to disease progression/severity. Disease progression is a result of both direct effects on the liver as well as indirect alterations in other organs/tissues such as intestine, adipose tissue, and the immune system. Although the three liver diseases (ASH, NASH, and TASH) sharemany common pathogenic mechanisms, they also exhibit distinct differences. Both shared and divergent mechanisms can be potential therapeutic targets. I will provide an overview of selected important mechanistic similarities and differences in ASH, NASH, and TASH, and discuss the importance of a multidisciplinary and personalized approach. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. understand the mechanisms including similarities and differences between ASH, NASH and TASH. 2. understand targets to treat ASH, NASH and TASH. 3. recognize tests to help distinguish between ASH, NASH and TASH. [7] Bioactive lipid metabolites: biomarkers and therapeutic targets in alcohol-associated liver disease. Dennis Warner, Josiah Hardesty, Jeff Warner, Craig McClain, Irina Kirpich, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a spectrum of liver disorders ranging from steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. The mechanisms and mediators of ALD progression are not well understood and effective therapeutic options are limited. Various bioactive oxidized lipid mediators (oxylipins) have recently emerged as important factors in ALD pathogenesis. The current study aimed to examine plasma linoleic acid (LA)-derived lipid metabolites in heavy drinking individuals and to evaluate associations between these molecules and markers of liver injury. Analysis of plasma LA-derived metabolites was performed by HPLC/MS on 66 heavy drinking individuals and 29 socially drinking but otherwise healthy volunteers. Based on plasma ALT levels, 15 patients had no liver injury (ALT Ã¢â€°Â¤ 40 U/L), 33 patients had mild liver injury (ALT &gt; 40 U/L), and 18 were diagnosed with moderate Alcohol-associated Hepatitis (mAH). Statistically significant differences (set at p&lt;0.05) were determined by One-way ANOVA. Lipoxygenase-derived LA metabolites, 13-HODE and 13-oxoODE, were markedly elevated only in mAH patients. The CYP450-derived LA epoxides, 9,10-EpOME and 12.13-EpOME were decreased in all patients regardless of the presence or the absence of liver injury. LA-derived diols, 9,10-DiHOME and 12.13-DiHOME, were elevated only in the mAH group. The current study provides evidence that specific changes in LA-metabolites in heavy drinking individuals can distinguish individuals with mAH from those with mild ALD. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. identify effects of alcohol consumption on circulating oxylipins; 2. determine the role of oxylipins in ALD pathogenesis; 3. associate severity of ALD with the specific changes in oxylipins [8] Hepatic protein and phosphoprotein signatures of alcohol-associated hepatitis. Josiah Hardesty, Jeffrey Warner, Dennis Warner, Craig McClain, and Irina Kirpich, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY The objective of the current study was to identify hepatic proteome and phosphoproteome signatures of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). AH is a clinical manifestation of ALD characterized by compromised liver function contributing to a 6-month mortality rate as high as 50%. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses were conducted on explant liver tissue from AH patients (n=6) and non-AH controls (n=12). Data were statistically compared by an unpaired Student's t-test and a p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Alterations the expression of multiple proteins involved in various biological processes were observed in AH. Among significant findings in AH included elevated expression of pro-fibrotic transcription factors, reduced albumin (ALBU) phosphorylation, and diminished expression of functional mitochondria proteins. One transcription factor involved in fibrogenesis, yes1-associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1) was elevated in AH (p=0.003), along with increased phosphorylation at pS105 (p=0.01). In addition, expression of hepatic ALBU was elevated in AH (p=0.04) concomitant with diminished ALBU phosphorylation (p=0.02), which may prevent ALBU release leading to hypoalbuminemia. Lastly, we found a loss in the expression of mitochondria proteins in AH, including enzymes essential for mitochondria function and biogenesis (e.g., hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit alpha, [ECHA] p=0.04). This study identified hepatic protein and phosphoprotein signatures of AH which may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. understand the hepatic proteomic changes that occur in AH, 2. recognize hepatic protein and phosphoprotein signatures of AH and 3. identify novel mechanisms and pathways implicated in AH. [9] Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibition in alcohol-associated liver disease: liver-specific drug delivery. Jeffrey Warner, Josiah Hardesty, Ying Song, Philip Bauer, Chirag Soni, Claudio Maldonado, Craig McClain, Dennis Warner, Irina Kirpich, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a prevalent condition resulting from excessive alcohol consumption. Advanced stages of ALD, such as alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), cause significant mortality and lack effective therapies. Previous data established that soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH, an enzyme which degrades beneficial lipid epoxides) is induced in clinical/ experimental ALD, and that sEH inhibition may be an effective treatment for this disease. This study aimed to improve this approach by using liverspecific drug delivery via fusogenic lipid vesicles (FLVs) to increase efficacy and avoid extra-hepatic side effects. We prepared fluorescent-labeled FLVs loaded with the sEH inhibitor t-TUCB (t-TUCB-FLVs) at various doses. t-TUCB-FLV preparations had an appropriate size and charge and were confirmed to target the liver by fluorescent microscopy. Flow cytometry demonstrated that hepatocytes and macrophages were most responsible for t-TUCB-FLV uptake. In a dose response experiment using a chronic-binge ethanol feeding model mimicking AH, mice receiving ethanol+3.0 mg/kg t-TUCB-FLVs had the greatest reduction in liver injury by plasma ALT. This treatment was more efficacious than systemically delivered (non-FLV-encapsulated) t-TUCB at the same dose. t-TUCB-FLVs also decreased liver cell death and ER stress but had no effect on steatosis or neutrophil infiltration. These data demonstrated that liver-specific delivery of t-TUCB was more efficacious than systemic delivery. This drug delivery platform may help increase the efficacy of sEH inhibition in ALD while reducing extra-hepatic side effects, improving translation to humans. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1.recognize the pathogenic role of sEH in ALD; 2. Describe basic concepts in liver-specific drug delivery by nanoparticle systems; and 3. Evaluate the beneficial effects of a liver-targeted sEH inhibitor in experimental ALD in mice. [10] COVID-19 and early post-primary TB: commonalities of pathobiology in pneumonitis and therapies. Robert L. Hunter and Robert E.Brown, UTHealth McGovern Medical School Houston, TX Concurrent infection with COVID-19 and M. tuberculosis has been reported to be more severe than either alone, resulting in increased mortality. Our objective was to define the shared pathobiology of COVID-19 and the developmental stage of TB in the lung and explore adjunctive therapies to treat such commonalities. We used similar morphoproteomic analyses to study lung tissues of patients with early postprimary tuberculosis or COVID-19 infection.These studies showed colocalization of the COVID-19 virus and M. tuberculosis antigens with cyclo-oxygenase-2 and fatty acid synthase in the reactive alveolar pneumocytes and with programmed death-ligand 1 expression on the alveolar interstitium and alveolar pneumocytes.This was associated with accumulation of pro-infectious M2 polarized macrophages in the alveolar spaces.The commonalities in these pathways suggest that they might be susceptible to adjunctive therapies with metformin and vitamin D3. This is supported by published studies that metformin and vitamin D3 could reduce the severity of both COVID-19 and early post-primary TB infections. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to identify and define the commonalities in the pathobiology of COVID-19 and early post-primary TB pneumonitis and describe the potential targets for therapy with metformin and vitamin D3. [11] Plasma ctDNA for Monitoring Response to Immune Check Point Inhibitors. Mark W. Linder PhD, DABCC, FAACC. Professor Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) measurements from a variety of malignancies are aggressively being investigated in the context of a ""liquid biopsy"" to provide for a minimally invasive means of monitoring tumor status and therapeutic response. This session will discuss what is known about the biologic and physiological characteristics of plasma ctDNA. We will then describe the what is known regarding the relationship between plasma ctDNA and tumor characteristics such as tumor burden, proliferative activity and therapeutic response . Understanding of these relationships is central to developing a fundamental framework for interpretation longitudinal plasma ctDNA measurements in light of other routine measurements such as radiographic assessments and other blood based biomarkers. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Explain the sources and methods of measurement of ctDNA. 2. Describe the relationships between plasma ctDNA, disease burden and therapeutic response. 3. Discuss how these relationships influence the clinical utility of routine plasma ctDNA testing. [12] Quantitative Methods of Monitoring Circulating Tumor DNA. Evan M. Alexander, PhD, Roland Valdes Jr., PhD, DABCC, Mark Linder, PhD, DABCC, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is emerging as a new, robust biomarker that can be used for early cancer diagnosis, disease prognosis and even guiding treatment through precision medicine. This non-invasive tumor monitoring tool can be performed on the scale of a single gene mutation to an entire sequenced genome. Quantitation of ctDNA is complicated by two factors: wide ranges and low concentrations (0.003%-95% mutant allele frequency (MAF); 5-1500 ng/mL). Currently, the field of monitoring ctDNA is dominated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technologies. Understandably, these different monitoring techniques require specialized analytical instrumentation. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are not universal. There are many considerations a clinician needs to be mindful of when utilizing these technologies to monitor ctDNA (known vs unknown mutation, absolute quantitation vs MAF). Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of ct DNA quantification methods in a given clinical situation is paramount in utilizing this biomarker to its fullest and most appropriate potential. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Identify which quantitation technique for ctDNA is most appropriate to use in a given clinical scenario 2. Recognize the difference between quantitation of mutant allele frequency and absolute quantitation of ctDNA 3. Recognize the importance of assay sensitivity when serially monitoring patient cancer progression. [13] The Value of Next Generation Sequencing in Myeloid Neoplasia. Mustafa Al-Kawaaz, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY This presentation will demonstrate some of the most important utilities of next generation sequencing (NGS) in a spectrum of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and overlap syndromes. Interrogation of nucleic acid (DNA and/or RNA) to look for certain genomic alterations is essential for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. Classification of myeloid neoplasms continues to evolve by including entities defined by specific genomic alterations. NGS is an essential utility to guide management decisions. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Recognize changes to classification of myeloid neoplasms and some categories definite by genetic alterations. 2. Identify the utility of different vendors/ platforms offering certain advantages in next generation sequencing. 3. Recommend testing utility by evaluating the targeted genetic alteration as well as clinical scenario. [14] Forecasting clinical behavior and therapeutic response of breast carcinoma using gene expression. James L. Wittliff and Michael W. Daniels, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Our goal is to associate expression of nuclear and peptide hormone receptor genes with biomarker status of breast carcinoma and risk of recurrence, to advance clinical management. Cellular heterogeneity of tissue specimens is a complicating factor in determining analyte (protein or gene) levels of specific cell types. A unique deidentified database was analyzed that contained microarray results of 22,000 genes derived only from total RNA extracted from breast carcinoma cells procured by laser capture microdissection (Pixcell IIe:ArcturusÃ‚Â®/ Thermo Fisher) of 247 de-identified primary tissue biopsies. Relative expression levels of each gene candidate for 49 nuclear receptors as well as 61 peptide/protein hormones and 81 of their cognate receptor proteins were selected for this retrospective investigation. Assessment of a patient's risk of recurrence primarily utilizes estrogen (ER) and progestin receptor proteins (PR), quantified by radio-ligand binding (NEN/DuPont) and/or enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Labs). Parameters and clinical outcomes were analyzed by univariable and multivariable Cox regressions, Fisher's Exact Test, Kaplan Meier plots and with R software v4.0.0. Examples of multivariable Cox regression models of candidates of nuclear receptor genes, fit to predict disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), revealed that only NR4A2, PGR, PPARA and THRB were required to predict DFS and NR3C2, PGR and THRB were necessary to predict OS. Of 142 candidate genes for peptide hormones and their cognate receptors, 30 exhibited expression levels that individually predicted DFS and/or OS. When pairs of genes for a peptide hormone and its receptor were evaluated by multivariable Cox Regression with interaction, complexes were identified that predicted DFS and OS (EDN1-ENDRA, GHRL-GHSR, INHBB-ACVR2B, NPY-NPY1R, INHBB-ACVR1B, RLN2-RXFP3 and NPY-NPY6R) based on unadjusted p-value for the interaction term. These investigations also revealed numerous over-expressed genes in carcinomas with poor clinical outcomes suggesting candidates for development of novel therapeutics. Collectively, use of small molecular signatures (gene subsets) with quantified ER/PR protein or ESR1/ PGR expression in a breast carcinoma with clinical outcomes enhanced prediction of risk of recurrence and identification drug development candidates. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. recognize the power of LCM to non-disruptively capture populations of specific cell types for genomics testing, 2. differentiate gene expression patterns based upon protein tumor marker status groups and 3. predict risk of recurrence for patients based upon expression of gene molecular sign. [15] Imaging Mass Spectrometry: Applications in Biomedical Research and Clinical Diagnosis. Yusheng Zhu, PhD; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA Mass spectrometry tissue imaging is a technology used in mass spectrometry to visualize the spatial distribution of molecules in tissues by their molecular masses. Compared to traditional tissue imaging methods such as immunohistochemistry, mass spectrometry imaging does not need any antibodies and tracers; it can detect and map multiple analytes including proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, metabolites, drugs, toxins, and even elements simultaneously; researchers do not need prior knowledge of molecules in the samples; the analysis can be qualitative and/or quantitative. Therefore, mass spectrometry imaging has become a powerful technology for biomedical research and biomarker discovery. It is widely used in proteomic, peptidomic, lipidomic, glycomic, metabolomic, pharmacological and toxicological studies. This session will introduce common mass spectrometry imaging techniques including matrix assistant laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) imaging, time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) imaging, and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)-mass spectrometry imaging. In addition, the basic principle, procedure, and application of these methods in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis will be discussed. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Define tissue imaging mass spectrometry. 2. Explain basic principle of common types of imaging mass spectrometry. 3. Describe application of tissue imaging mass spectrometry in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. [16] Immune Landscape in Sentinel Lymph Nodes from Melanoma Patients by Single-Cell Mass Cytometry (CyTOF) Analysis. Kavitha Yaddanapudi, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY We describe the development of a multiscale immune profiling strategy to map the immune landscape of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in our search for tumor-driven immune changes that can guide the design of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for patients with early-stage melanoma. We used mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), flow cytometry, and T cell receptor immunosequencing to conduct simultaneous single-cell analyses of immune cells in the SLNs of melanoma patients. We identified unique tumordriven T, NK, and innate immune cell signatures that are present in stage III melanoma-bearing SLNs, but absent in stage I/II non-melanoma-bearing SLNs. We found increased effector-memory T cells and TCR clonality selectively in the melanoma-bearing SLNs relative to non-melanoma-bearing SLNs, consistent with possible activation of an anti-tumor immune response. However, we also observed a markedly immunotolerant environment in the melanoma-bearing SLNs indicated by reduced and impaired NK cells and increased levels of CD8+CD57+PD-1+ cells which are known to display low melanoma killing capabilities. Other changes observed in melanoma-bearing SLNs when compared to non-melanoma bearing SLNs include reduced CD8+CD69+ T cells/T regulatory cells ratio and high PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Our data suggests that these immunological changes compromise anti-melanoma immunity and contribute to a high relapse rate. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to describe mass cytometry analysis of melanoma patient sentinel lymph node samples, identify new immunologic and therapeutic targets for preventing melanoma recurrence and identify unique melanoma-driven immune cell signatures. [17] Application of MassARRAY System in Molecular Diagnostics - Pharmacogenomics and Oncology. Shuko Harada and Alexander C. Mackinnon, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL In molecular diagnostic laboratories, multiplex genetic analysis, for example Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), is increasingly utilized. NGS is expensive, laborious, and requires complicated bioinformatics analysis. The MassARRAY system provides accurate, low cost, facile, multiplexed analysis of hundreds of clinically relevant mutations with relatively simple analytics. In this study, we evaluated the utility of this system for two multiplex, molecular diagnostic applications: detection of somatic variants found in brain (CNS) tumors and germline variants (SNPs) found in metabolic enzymes as part of a pharmacogenomics (PGDX) assay. The CNS assay utilizes a custom design to identify deletions involving chromosomes 1p and 19q and somatic variants in IDH1, IDH2 and TERT. The PGDX panel targets 68 SNPs and several copy number variants (CNV) in 20 metabolic genes implicated in drug metabolisms. Genetic targets are PCR amplified followed by primer extension using allele-specific, specialized primers. Allotypes are detected by the MassARRAY system and results are generated using the MassArray software. Thirty CNS tumor samples with known 1p19q and IDH1/IDH2 mutation status were analyzed using the CNS panel. The results were &gt;95% concordant to orthogonal test results. 48 samples with known various genotypes were analyzed using the PGDX assay. The results were &gt;99% concordant; intra- and inter-run reproducibility was 100% (n=7). Overall, the MassARRAY system is reliable, cost effective and easy to operate. Performance is consistent and analysis is streamlined. The MassARRAY platform has broad application across multiple indications for molecular diagnostic testing. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to understand the utility of MassARRAY system in molecular diagnostics. [18] Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers in clinical practice: analytical and clinical considerations. Alicia Algeciras-Schimnich, Susan Ashrafzadeh-Kian, Wentao Li, Michelle R. Campbell, Ronald Petersen, and Joshua Bornhorst, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN This presentation will describe analytical and clinical considerations for the appropriate use of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers: amyloid beta 1-42 (AÃŽÂ²4 2), total Tau (t-Tau), and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau). Changes in these biomarkers reflect key changes in AD pathophysiology and are being incorporated into clinical practice. One of the challenges with the interpretation of CSF biomarkers has been the lack of standardized procedures for sample collection and handling as well as the lack of robust assays to measure these biomarkers. The analytical characteristics of the Roche Elecsys immunoassays for the quantitation of AÃŽÂ²42, t-Tau, and p-Tau in CSF were established. All assays demonstrated robust analytical performance suitable for clinical laboratory utilization. To evaluate clinical performance, these biomarkers were measured in a cohort of clinically characterized samples (n=161). Using a p-Tau/AÃŽÂ²42 ratio cutoff of &gt;0.023, 20% of cognitively unimpaired, 41% of mild cognitive impairment, and 100% of AD dementia patients were classified as positive. The use of the p-Tau/AÃŽÂ²42 ratio showed optimal concordance with amyloid PET exhibiting 100% negative and 86% positive concordance. Finally, the pattern of these biomarkers was evaluated in 535 Mayo Clinic patients that underwent testing as part of a cognitive evaluation over a 1-year period. In 27% of patients all biomarkers were normal and not consistent with AD; in 25% of patients all biomarkers were consistent with AD. A normal p-Tau/ AÃŽÂ²42 ratio with low/abnormal AÃŽÂ²42 was observed in 19% of patients and was most often associated with the clinical presentation of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). An abnormal p-Tau/AÃŽÂ²42 ratio displayed the strongest relationship with AD. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. identify the role of AÃŽÂ²42, t-Tau, and p-Tau in the differential diagnosis of AD and 2 discuss how various biomarker patterns are associated with other non-AD cognitive disorders. [19] Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2viral RNA detection, using Massarray, RT-qPCR and UltraFast RT-PCR assays. Bene Ekene-Afolabi1, John Patrick Alao1, Solomon Rotimi1,2, and John Bolodeoku1,3, 1ZEAB Therapeutic Ltd. Discovery Park, Ramsgate Road, Sandwich, Kent CF13 9FF, United Kingdom, 2Department of Biochemistry, Covenant University, Ota, Nigeria, and 3JB Consulting MDP Ltd, 1 Bell Street, Maidenhead, Berkshire, SL6 1 BU, United Kingdom The Covid-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus revealed short comings in the global ability to effectively deal with such crises. In particular, the molecular diagnostics market was flooded with a diverse array of RT-PCR kits. These kits target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the United States Centres for Disease Control (CDC) recommended nucleocapsid N1 and N2 genes being the most common. In addition, these kits use various cycling parameters and cut-offs despite being approved for diagnostic testing in various countries. Detailed information on the suitability of these tests for the clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 and their performance under laboratory conditions remain scarce. In this study, three assays evaluated viral genes in synthetic RNA and RNA extracted from SARS-CoV-2 samples stored in viral transport medium (VTM) (30 panel certified reference materials), UK NEQAS samples and 100 patient samples: 1) Agilent SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit for detecting the N1 and N2; 2) Agena Bioscience MassArray (MALDI-ToF) SARS-CoV-2 for detecting N1, N2, N3, ORF1 &amp; ORF1ab, variant SARS detection, and 3) Molecular Biology System UltraFast RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit for detecting N1, N2, and ORF1ab These assays showed good performance, sensitivity and specificity with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 1 copy/ ÃŽÂ¼L. The specificity and sensitivity are 100% and 98% respectively. These kits thus provide a robust assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. Conclusion: These assays are suitable for routine diagnostic. The UltraFast NextGenPCR is the fastest with average time (30mins), followed by Agilent (2 hrs) and MassArray (6hrs). Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to examine, measure and compare results from different assays for SARS detection, evaluate and diagnose accurately, as well as being able to plan, organize and recommend a diagnostic procedure for diagnostic laboratory. Key words: SARS-CoV-2, RNA extraction, RT-PCR, limit of detection, quantification cycle, COVID-19, in vitro diagnostic tests, Agilent, Massarray, Ultrafast. [20] From the Microbiology Lab to the Operating Room: Advanced Development of the MasSpec Pen for Broad Clinical Use. Livia Eberlin, PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX Ambient ionization mass spectrometry techniques that enable direct, gentle, and rapid analysis of samples offer exciting opportunities to provide clinicians with rich molecular data to enhance decision-making. Here, an overview of several ongoing clinical projects in the Eberlin laboratory related to the development of a handheld MSbased device, the MasSpec Pen technology, for improving patient care will be discussed. In particular, I will describe results centered around our efforts in employing the MasSpec Pen for intraoperative tissue analysis and cancer detection, identification of infectious microorganisms, and detection of drugs of abuse. Current challenges and opportunities towards incorporating this technology into clinical practice will also be addressed. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. describe operating principles of direct mass spectrometry techniques for rapid molecular analysis that are being explored for clinical use; 2. evaluate analytical and diagnostic performance metrics of direct mass spectrometry techniques to address unmet clinical needs. [21] Triggered MRM for Urine Drug Testing: Finding What You Aren't Looking For. Joshua Hayden, Norton Healthcare, Louisville, KY This work aimed to develop a triggered multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method for urine drug testing that allows simultaneous targeted quantitation of commonly used/abused drugs and qualitative detection of a larger array of uncommonly used drugs. Targeted quantitation is most often accomplished with triple quadruple mass spectrometers but these instruments suffer in their ability to do untargeted analysis. This limitation is especially challenging given the ever increasing number of drugs that are produced and abused-including fentanyl analogues, bath salts, and a broad group of drugs known as spice. Ideally, clinical laboratories would be able to perform both targeted quantitation and some level of qualitative detection of infrequently encountered drugs. Towards this end, we developed a method that allows us to utilize our triple quadruple mass spectrometer to do targeted quantitation of commonly used/ abused drugs and qualitative detection of a larger range of drugs. This qualitative detection is accomplished using a triggered MRM method and a spectral database. To validate this method, deidentified, remnant urine samples were spiked with a variety of uncommonly encountered illicit drugs including various spice derivatives, bath salts, and fentanyl derivatives. The performance of the method was evaluated based on its ability to perform accurate quantitation of targeted compounds and its ability to qualitatively detect the presence of the spiked drugs. The method demonstrated excellence performance. The success of this method suggests such an approach could find widespread use in clinical laboratories; however, questions remain with regards to the regulatory requirements (quality control, proficiency testing, etc). Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1 .Describe the advantages and limitations of triple quadruple mass spectrometers, 2. Discuss the advantage of screening for a wide array of illicit drugs, 3.Summarize how a triggered MRM method might add value to a urine drug assay. [22] Advances in the assessment of Orexin-A (hypocretin-1) deficiency in the diagnosis of Type 1 Narcolepsy. Joshua Bornhorst, Bethany Larson, and Alicia Algeciras-Schimnich, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN This presentation will describe the clinical performance s of an assay for orexin-A (also known as hypocretin-1), which is a neuropeptide involved in the sleep/wake cycle. Impairment of orexin-A production and orexin-A modulated neurotransmission is associated with narcolepsy with cataplexy (episodes of muscle weakness in response to emotional stimuli), and deficiency of orexin-A in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a hallmark of type 1 narcolepsy. The diagnostic criteria for type 1 narcolepsy in the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (2014) includes the presence of cataplexy and/ or measured CSF orexin concentrations less than or equal to 110 pg/mL. However, clinical testing for orexin-A in CSF had been unavailable in the United States. A competitive radioimmunoassay for orexin-A quantitation in CSF was characterized for clinical use in the diagnosis of type 1 narcolepsy. This assay demonstrates acceptable analytical precision, accuracy, and stability. To evaluate clinical performance, 100 residual CSF specimens from individuals without suspicion of type 1 narcolepsy all exhibited orexin-A concentrations of &gt;200 pg/mL (mean: 531pg/mL). Additionally, samples from 20 patients with clinical suspicion of type 1 narcolepsy were evaluated. All nine confirmed 9 type 1 narcolepsy patients exhibited orexin concentrations of &lt;50 pg/mL. All 11 patients that were subsequently deemed to have hypersomnias other than type 1 narcolepsy had orexin concentrations of &gt;200pg/mL (range 352-600 pg/mL). Clinical introduction of this test fulfilled a pressing diagnostic need for differentiation of type 1 narcolepsy from other causes of hypersomnolence. Emerging information on how this assay compares to other methods of patient assessment for potential type 1 narcolepsy will also be discussed. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to identify the role of orexin deficiency in type 1 narcolepsy as well as recommend appropriate testing for the evaluation of individuals who potential have this disorder. [23] Zika outbreak in Dominican Republic 2016: A review. Frederick L. Kiechle1, Angelica Freddo1, and Henry Quezada2. 1Pompano Beach, FL and 2Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic We mined the data in the Biorepository at Boca Biolistics obtained during the Zika outbreak for symptomatic pregnant (PG) and non-pregnant (NP) women in the Dominican Republic in 2016. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a Flavivirus transmitted in humans by Aedes mosquitoes. There was a biphasic distribution of 305 symptomatic (NP) and 65 (PG) women (266 NAAT positive by Hologic, Aptima ZIKV assay) in April and late May/June 2016. To determine previous exposure to dengue (DENV) infection, anti-DENV IgG was measured in serum or plasma by ELISA (Euroimmun). (Science 2019; 363: 307). In 65 symptomatic PG women the outcome was 4.6 % spontaneous abortion, 2 % fetal demise and 4.6 % other. We evaluated the presence of 6 presenting symptoms and 3 lab tests (Aptima ZIKA assay; EUROIMMUN ELISA IgG; CDC MAC-ELISA ZiKV IgM - performed by FL Dept of Health) over 8 time intervals (12 - 36 repeat PG or NP patients per interval; total PR 131, total NP 171). The prevalence of 4 symptoms were less frequent in PG women vs NP, including fever, severe eye pain, head pain and joint and muscle pain. Conjunctivitis occurred more frequently in PG vs NP and rash had an equal occurrence. ZIKV IgG and MAC-ELISA-IgM were positive with similar frequency in both groups 1 through 8. NAAT ZIKV results were positive for all 8 intervals (87.5% to 72.2%) in PG patients and in NP (52% in interval 1 and 0.0 to 4.0% in intervals 2 to 8). PG patients with rash were 98% positive for DENV IgG. In conclusion, NP and PG women exhibited a biphasic spike of ZIKV positive infections; from 0 to 86 days post symptoms, PG exhibited a lower prevalence of fever, head pain, severe eye pain and joint and muscle pain compared to NP ZIKV symptomatic patients. The results suggest that PG provides protection from clinical symptoms compared to NP during infection cycle in spite of persistent viremia in PG vs NP. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to describe the clinical and laboratory findings in Zika infection and differences in PG and NP patient presentation. [24] Rapidly evolving and fatal miliary tuberculosis and COVID-19 infection inan infant.Anindita Ghosh1,Amanda Tchakarov1, Norma Perez1, Nina Tatevian2, Meenakshi Bhattacharjee1. 1University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, and 2Women and Infant Hospital of Rhode Island, Providence, RI Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are two important infectious diseases causing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Active TB infection can stimulate host immune responses and together with COVID-19, may lead to cytokine storm and immune dysregulation leading to multi-organ failure. Studies have reported flare up of pulmonary TB after SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults. We present a unique case of both miliary tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in an infant, indicating that children can acquire both infections concurrently, and have rapid progression with fatal outcome. Case: Our patient was a 6-month-old previously healthy term boy. He had persistent cough and congestion, became severely ill, and was brought to emergency department. Chest X-ray showed diffuse alveolar and interstitial airspace opacities. He was found to be COVID-19 positive by PCR test. Laboratory studies showed pancytopenia with left shift, elevated transaminases (ALT 77, AST 313), low albumin, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 103, IL-6 19000), and abnormal coagulation profile with coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation. He developed strokes, severe sepsis and electrolyte abnormalities, and declined rapidly with death within 6 days. Autopsy examination showed hepatosplenomegaly. His lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen showed multifocal micro-abscesses, which on microscopic examination showed necrotic foci teeming with mycobacteria, and were culture positive for M. tuberculosis, i.e. miliary tuberculosis. Neuropathological examination showed infarction in the right middle and posterior cerebral artery territories. Conclusions: This patient helps illuminate some immunological and pathological aspects of two co-occurring infectious diseases and the susceptibility for development of fatal complications with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric population. Upon completion this activity the learner will be able to: 1. recognition of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection cooccurrence with another infectious disease in children. 2. challenges in treatment of COVID-19 infection with other/associated infectious disease. 3. recognition of the complexity of pathological processes in childhood infectious disease. [25] A Postulated Cross Talk between Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and IGFBP-7 May Suggest a Critical Role in Carcinogenesis. Fan Shen1 and Consolato M. Sergi1,2. 1Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada and 2Anatomic Pathology Division, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada Objective: The insulin/insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have crucial tasks in the growth, differentiation, and proliferation of healthy and pernicious cells. They are involved in coordinated complexes, including receptors, ligands, binding proteins, and proteases. However, the systems can become dysregulated in tumorigenesis. Insulinlike growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) is a protein belonging to the IGFBP superfamily. We intended to explore the cross-talk between IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-7. Methods: Analysis of text/ data mining tools using the NCBI platform was used. Results: Numerous studies have provided evidence that IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-7 are involved in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), breast cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, among many others. Still, very few suggest an interaction between these two molecules. We found that both proteins share some crucial signaling pathways. P53, and growth inhibitory agents, including retinoic acid (RA), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ÃŽÂ²), and anti-estrogens, can give rise to increased expression of IGFBP-3. IGFBP-7 can regulate the growth-suppressing effects of the TGF-ÃŽÂ² superfamily, and similarly the expression of IGFBP-7 can be upregulated by cellular treatment with TGF-ÃŽÂ²1 and RA. Conclusions: A comprehensive overview of the relationship between IGFBP-3, IGFBP-7, and cancer highlighted the IGFBP-3 crosstalk with IGFBP-7, which may suggest a promotion other than initiation in carcinogenesis. Upon completion of this learning activity participants should be able to: 1. to define to role of Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein superfamily in carcinogenesis 2. to compare the respective role of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP7 in cancer 3. to determine the relevance of a cross talk between IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-7 for carcinogenesis [26] Measure Directly, Treat Efficiently. Critical Bleeding Management at the Speed of Sound. Oksana Volod, Cedars Sinai, Los Angeles, CA, USA Viscoelastic Testing (VET) is a category of functional whole blood tests used to assay hemostatic competence and optimize blood product transfusions in patients during or after surgical procedures where acute bleeding may occur. Efficient use of these tests has become an elevated need for a comprehensive patient blood management program. Cup and pin legacy systems and those that display the traditional interpretation ""curves"", such as with thromboelastography (TEGÃ‚Â®) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEMÃ‚Â®), require varying levels of oversight to maintain compliance and optimal efficient clinical use. Over the last decade, advances have been made with the integration of cartridge-based VET systems to improve upon those legacy systems. During this presentation, the legacy and new generation VETs available in the US are compared based on their unique hemostatic parameters that define contributions of coagulation factors, fibrinogen/fibrin, platelets, and clot lysis as related to the lifespan of a clot. The balance between the needs to act on relevant critical data in near real-time and compliance with the laboratory that must ensure quality is also discussed. The QuantraÃ‚Â® system is the newest VET. It is a fully sealed, cartridgebased, automated, four-channel device that provides the fastest hemostasis assessment (12 minutes on average). The Quantra is based on a new ultrasound technology termed sonic estimation of elasticity via resonance (SEER). The important differences between Quantra and other VETs are its ease of interpretation, optimizations for use at the point of patient need, and its ability to directly measure blood viscoelastic properties. Through real case examples, this talk will also focus on Quantra specific hemostasis alterations and optimal management strategies for bleeding patients. Upon completion of this learning activity participants should be able to: 1. Describe Viscoelastic Testing as part of a Patient Blood Management initiative. 2. Categorize various viscoelastic assay methods and classify clinical and operational needs related to implementation and accessibility (i.e., speed, ease of use and location) 3. Interpret and explain the results of Quantra via participation in real-world case example. [27] Managing the challenges of running a transfusion service during the COVID-19 pandemic Claire Meena-Leist, Amanda Riggs and Mohamed Elkady, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY Hospitals have developed systems to adjust to periodic blood product shortages. Apheresis platelets and group O Rh(D) negative red blood cell shortages are common during summer months and holidays and can be managed well by having a strong blood management program and obtaining contracts with secondary blood suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, caused historic blood product shortages that resulted in red blood cell rationing and requests from our primary blood supplier for hospitals to consider canceling non-urgent surgical procedures. With virtually no lead time, in December 2021, our blood supplier began rationing all group O red blood cells to their customers. For the first time blood was allotted to customers based on blood center supply, not patient need. The rationing quickly expanded to include all group A and B red blood cells, with no information about how long the shortage would last. Hospitals were forced to develop more creative blood management methods, and to develop criteria for surgery cancellations. We discuss our experience with providing patient care in a hospital system that includes the region's only American College of Surgeons (ACS) Verified Level 1 Trauma centers for adults in the Commonwealth of KY. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. Describe how one hospital system approached blood management during a historic blood shortage 2. Explain why hospital blood management is not the sole answer to providing patient care during extreme blood shortages 3. Identify ways that blood centers can improve strategic planning for the next pandemic. [28] Cells,wells, &amp; spells: the evolution of HLA testing methods. Tiffany K Bratton, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Organ transplantation is a life-saving treatment modality for patients with end stage organ failure. However, allograft rejection remains an obstacle for long term outcomes. An evolution in the understanding of transplant immunology over the past fifty years has led to continuous development and improvement of methods for detecting, not only HLA antibodies, but also other markers of the overall immune status of transplant patients. HLA testing began in the 1960's with donor cells; the cytotoxic crossmatch caused a paradigm shift in transplantation with immediate improvements in short term outcomes. In the early 2000's the organ allocation system was radically changed by the development of solid phase technology. This presentation will cover the evolution of HLA testing methods from the very beginning to current state as well as speculation on new technologies that could be developed and used to continue to improve long term outcomes for transplant patients. Upon completion of this learning activity participants should be able to: 1. Describe the different testing methods used for detection of HLA sensitization. 2. Identify the current HLA testing methods. 3. Evaluate new technologies that may be developed for both HLA and overall transplant testing. [29] The CNS-penetrating taxane drug TPI 287 potentiates the antiglioma activity of the AURKA inhibitor alisertib in vivo. MÃƒÂ¼ge Sak, Brian J. Williams, Cory T. Zumbar, Mustafa N. G. Al-Kawaaz, Aastha Kakar, Andrew J. Hey, Leslie M. Scheir, Landon Teer, Joseph Chen and Norman L. Lehman. University of Louisville, Louisville KY Glioblastoma, IDH wildtype (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults and has a poor prognosis. We previously found cytotoxic synergy between the AURKA inhibitor alisertib and the novel CNS-penetrating taxane TPI 287 against GBM tumor stem-like cells in vitro. Here we used an orthotopic human GBM xenograft mouse model to test the ability of TPI 287 to potentiate alisertib's antitumor activity in vivo. At two weeks, animal tumor volume was significantly decreased by alisertib, TPI 287, and combination treatments compared to controls. At four weeks both alisertib and TPI 287 groups had reduced tumor volume and a statistically significant decrease was again observed in the combination therapy group. Alisertib monotherapy improved animal survival, which was further improved with the addition of TPI 287 (p=0.0058). TPI 287 alone did not significantly improve animal survival. We also investigated the mechanism of apoptotic synergy between alisertib and TPI 287. Alisertib + TPI 287 combination treatment decreased Bcl-2 levels in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, this treatment increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Bak in synchronized GBM cells. Bim knockdown by siRNA inhibited synergistic cytotoxicity caused by alisertib + TPI 287 (p=0.0042). These results suggest that these drugs cause synergistic apoptosis in GBM cells partially through effects on Bcl-2 family proteins. Additionally, both alisertib and TPI 287 significantly reduced GBM cell invasion (p&lt;0.0001). However, this effect was greater with TPI 287, and the drug combination was no more effective at inhibiting invasion than TPI 287 alone. These findings support the potential use of this combination therapy against GBM in clinical trials. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to understand the Bcl-2 family protein apoptotic cascade, the mechanism of action of taxanes and AURKA inhibitors and the rationale for combination treatment for GBM. [30] SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in the post-vaccine era: comparing assays for standardization. Sarrah Lahorewala and Xin Yi, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX The interpretation of results of various SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is challenging due to non-standardization among assays. The aims of this study were: to compare three commonly used semi-quantitative/quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests with our institutional Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA assay; and, to validate the ELISA assay against known National Standard (CRM-NIBSC21/234), thus correlating calculated ELISA concentrations (U/ mL) and the international standard units for binding assay formats, i.e. Binding Antibody Units/mL (BAU/ mL). The Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA assay detects IgG antibodies against the viral anti-S Ectodomain. The three commercial tests compared to the ELISA assay were the Roche ElecsysÃ‚Â® Anti-SARS-CoV-2S (U/mL), Siemens Atellica COV2G (Index) and VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quantitative (BAU/mL). The Roche and Siemens test comparisons included 95 patient samples, with 51 samples evaluated for the VITROS assay. Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism9 software. We mapped the antibody concentrations obtained on the ELISA assay against that of CRM-NIBSC21/234 and validated their linear relationship. The commercial assays evaluated showed good correlation with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA, across all ELISA titers. The corresponding assay result ranges (lower and upper 95% CI of mean) for each titer group is as follows: &lt;1:50: Roche: &lt;0.4-&lt;0.4; Siemens: 0.0070.020; Vitros: 1.854-4.606; 1:50: Roche: 26.01-88.39; Siemens: 0.585-0.966; Vitros: 33.47-50.83; 1:150: Roche: 622.9-1095; Siemens: 6.82-214.38; Vitros: 52.35-141.4; 1:450: Roche: 1321-2091; Siemens: 16.74-19.55; Vitros: 112.4-192.2; 1:1350: Roche: 2067-&gt;2500; Siemens: &gt;20-&gt;20; Vitros: &gt;200-&gt;200. The calculated concentration (U/mL) obtained by the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA and the expected concentration of CRM were strongly correlated and results were found to be linear in the range from 3.25-832 BAU/mL covering titers ranging from &lt;1:50 to &gt;1:1350. The calibration of our ELISA assay to the International Standard, and its correlation with commercial assays, allows for standardization between assays and a better understanding of the various antibody titers in the context of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Describe the clinical utility of antibody testing in SARS-CoV-2 2. Understand the various kinds of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests commonly utilized 3. Interpret results of commonly used semi-quantitative/quantitative assays and correlate assay titers with the International Standard Units (BAU/ mL). [31] How to be a better surgical pathology consultant. Neda Zarrin-Khameh, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX Consultation on surgical pathology specimens is part of the daily professional practice of every pathologist. We evaluated the characteristics of a good consultant and the habits that should be avoided. A 1-page questionnaire was prepared to evaluate how pathologists select their consultants. The questionnaire was emailed to 106 pathologists. Fifty-eight pathologists completed the questionnaire (55% response rate). The most important criteria for a consultant were knowledge and expertise. Accessibility, turnaround time, and teaching (providing explanation about the case) were selected next for choosing a consultant. The 2 factors that contributed to avoiding a consultant were expensive workup and changing the diagnosis. Open questions about ""definition of best/worst consultant,"" ""when to change the consultant,"" and ""if the criteria for consultant have changed over time"" provided additional valuable information. Accessibility, short turnaround time, and teaching are the most important reasons for selecting a consultant. Performing an expensive workup and being in the habit of changing the diagnosis are the factors that make a consultant less favorable. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. recognize three characteristics of a consultant that are important for requesting consultation, 2. identify three characteristics that are not recommended for a consultant and 3. determine when a pathologists may decide to change their consultant. [32] The Diagnostic Role of Fusion-Gene Analysis in Ambiguous Soft Tissue Sarcomas. Haider A. Mejbel, Alexander C. Mackinnon, and Shuko Harada, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Pathology, Birmingham, The diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma often requires adequate clinicopathologic correlation as well as the appropriate application of immunohistochemical studies. However, certain ambiguous/undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas can pose a diagnostic challenge. We retrospectively reviewed the cases submitted for RNA-based fusion panel (Archer FusionPlex assay) to evaluate the diagnostic utility of fusion gene analysis in soft tissue sarcomas. Herein we present the clinicopathologic and molecular alterations of three challenging soft tissue sarcomas, on which, the application of fusion-gene analysis has entirely altered the initial diagnosis. These cases include Ewing sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma with melanocytic differentiation, and MEIS1::NOCA1 sarcoma that were initially diagnosed as carcinoid tumor of the lung, melanoma, and low grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, respectively. In addition to providing the valuable prognostic information, the application of fusion-gene analysis has resulted in the reclassification of these neoplasms and altered the type of therapy. Currently, all patients are alive at the 6-, 26-, and 4-month of their final diagnosis. In conclusion, although adequate histopathologic examination and extensive immunohistochemical study were performed, the final diagnoses and classification of these sarcomas were only rendered after the application of the appropriate molecular testing. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to understand the role of molecular fusiongene analysis in further classifying ambiguous soft tissue sarcomas that can help arrive at the accurate diagnosis, alter disease stage, and inform therapy. [33] Distinct lesions of host defense and bacterial offense in tuberculosis. Robert L. Hunter and Robert E. Brown, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX The continued existence of M. tuberculosis depends on production of two distinct disease processes in humans. Primary tuberculosis (TB), the host's defense, protects against disseminated infection. Post-primary TB, in contrast, is the bacteria's offense. It facilitates transmission of infection to new hosts. Host defense is mediated by granulomas as are widely studied in human TB and animal models. People may succumb to lack of defense with disseminated infection, but this does not benefit the organism since it also dies. Bacterial offense, the lesions that mediate transmission of infection to new hosts, is mediated by post-primary TB. It begins as a subclinical obstructive lobular pneumonia that slowly accumulates materials for a sudden massive necrotizing pneumonia that can be coughed out to produce a cavity from which the organism can escape to infect new people. The early lesions of post-primary TB were well known to investigators in the preantibiotic era when autopsies were cutting edge science, but are unknown to the majority of current investigators who study only animal models. While modern technologies are making unprecedented progress in understanding tuberculous granulomas, they are making very little in understanding post-primary TB that does not exist in most animal models. Fortunately, new multiplex technologies make it possible to study human FFPE slides with great depth and precision. Such studies are necessary to gain a better understanding to the key developmental stage of TB. Upon completion of the activity, participants should be able to recognize and describe the differences between primary and post-primary TB. [34] Agonal-stress vesicles in critically ill children confused with microvesicular steatosis. John Hicks, Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine Houston, TX Background: Acute or prolonged systemic organ failure, perinatal demise, or unexpected death in the neonates and children raises a concern for metabolic, lysosomal storage or mitochondrial diseases and infectious etiologies. A potential pitfall is the presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles particularly within hepatocytes that appear as microvesicular steatosis on routine staining. Microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis may indicate lipid metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. Ultrastructural examination (EM) is useful in identifying abnormal lipid accumulation, mitochondrial structural abnormalities, and metabolic and lysosomal storage diseases. Particular structures indicative of post-mortem agonal or pre-mortem stress have been termed agonal-stress vesicles. It has not been shown, that these agonal-stress vesicles contain acute phase reactants in response to cellular ischemic or asphyxia. Design: EM laboratory archives were searched for cases with vesicles fitting the ultrastructural features of agonal-stress vesicles. 40 cases (20 males; 20 females) were identified with liver tissue submitted for routine processing (paraffin-embedded formalin fixed) and EM. Study population had variety of medical conditions associated with ischemic and asphyxial stress. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) with acute phase reactant antibodies was performed (c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-chymotrypsin). Results: All routinely stained liver tissue sections shows variably-sized vacuoles within hepatocyte cytoplasm, mimicking microvesicular steatosis. IHC for acute phase reactants highlighted the vacuoles with all antibodies (c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-chymotrypsin), with greatest intensity with alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-1-chymotrypsin. EM showed frequent vesicles with limiting membranes, containing finely granular, homogeneous content. Conclusion: Agonal-stress vesicles are under recognized structure and may be interpreted as microvesicular steatosis, leading to a workup for metabolic or mitochondrial disease. EM assists in identifying these structures as agonal-stress vesicles. Also, residual formalin-fixed, frozen tissue and tissue recovered from paraffin tissue blocks may be utilized for EM. IHC for acute phase reactants in this study confirms the contents of agonal-stress vacuoles being acute phase reactants. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to describe the histopathologic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features of agonal-stress vacuoles. [35] Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): A Tool often Underused for Pediatric Small Round Blue Cell Tumors opening New Venues for Single-Cell Technologies. Consolato M. Sergi1,2, 1Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, and 2Anatomic Pathology Division, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada Aims: Pediatric small round blue cell tumors (PSRBCT) are an intriguing and challenging collection of neoplasms. Light microscopy of small round blue cell tumors identifies small round cells. Pediatric small round blue cell tumors include several entities, such as nephroblastoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma, malignant lymphoma, and small cell osteosarcoma among others. The differential diagnosis of these neoplasms may be controversial at a light microscopy level, even using immunohistochemistry. A faint staining or an ambiguous background can deter pathologists from making the proper diagnostic decision. Methods: A review of the personal experience at four centers is considered here. In addition, single cell technologies are added to renew the interest of TEM. Results: Molecular biology may provide an overwhelming amount of data challenging to distinguish them, and some translocations may be seen in more than one category. Thus, TEM can be extremely valuable. In particular, tumor cells associated with tangles of cytoplasmic processes containing neurosecretory granules can diagnose neuroblastoma. Conversely, a marked variation in size, shape and cytoplasmic differentiation with most tumor cells containing prominent dilated cisterns of rough endoplasmic reticulum and bundles of thick and thin filaments with well-formed Z-bands may infer the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. The presence of an intracytoplasmic deposit of glycogen may suggest Ewing's sarcoma. At the same time, a cellular arrangement in a tubular configuration with a well-formed basal lamina may advocate the diagnosis of nephroblastoma. Single-cell sequencing are booming. Conclusion: Single-cell sequencing technologies are useful to discover the genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and epigenome of single cells. These techniques can show the differences and evolutionary relationships of innumerable cells. Here, we speculate that TEM may have an intriguing role for single-cell sequencing technologies and their applications in oncology, microbiology, reproductive and environmental sciences emphasizing the essential role that single-cell sequencing methods play in these areas. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. To define to general role of TEM in pathology. 2. To identify the role of TEM for PSRBCTs. 3. To determine the relevance in applying new technologies to TEM studies. [36] Chondroid Chordoma Presenting as Oropharyngeal Mass in Pediatrics. John Hicks, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX Introduction: Chordoma is a low to intermediate grade malignancy, resembling embryonal notochord. This tumor occurs in sacrococcygeal (60%), craniocervical (25%, clivus most common) and vertebral (15%) sites. Chordoma is a rare tumor (incidence 5/10,000,000; 2% of bone tumors). Peak incidence is in 4th decade. Clinical Presentation and Pathology Findings: 8 year-old girl with asthma history presented with 6-12 months of progressively worsening snoring, muffled voice and saliva pooling, attributed to seasonal allergies. Upon oral examination, a firm, protruding right tonsillar bed (oropharyngeal) mass with intact overlying vascularized mucosa was noted. Limited CT imaging identified an oropharyngeal mass with bony destruction. Biopsy was performed which showed a hyalinized chondroid to cartilaginous mass. Tumor cells immunoreacted with brachyury, EMA, S100 and SOX9, while negative for D2-40, with retained nuclear INI-1. Low-grade chondroid chordoma diagnosis was rendered. Molecular tumor testing identified p53 mutation, and KMT2B and ROS1 mutations of unknown significance. Conventional tumor karyotype was 46,XX. Germline testing was negative for p53 mutation. Additional imaging identified an 8.5 cm clivus origin tumor. The patient underwent additional surgery for tumor debulking, followed by oncologic (radiationtherapy) management. Conclusion: Chondroid chordoma involving oro/nasopharyngeal region is rare (0.2% of oro/nasopharyngeal tumors). Differential diagnosis includes chondrosarcoma, chordoid meningioma, myoepithelioma/myoepithelial carcinoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and chordoid meningioma. Treatment is surgical, with complete resection difficult due to anatomic location. Although the tumor tends to be radioresistant, high-dose radiation therapy is usuallyemployed. Overall survival with aggressive surgery is up to 75% at 5yrs and up to 65% at 10yrs. Recurrence is common (up to 90% at 10 years). Chondroid variant has somewhat better prognosis. Sonic hedgehog homolog protein gene (7q33), T (brachyury) gene duplication (6q27), and TSC1 or TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis) gene inactivation are associated with chordoma. Autosomal dominant familial tumors associated with T gene duplication are rare. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to describe the clinical, radiologic histopathologic, immunohistochemistry and molecular features in the diagnosis of chordoma. [37] Deciduosis adjacent an ileouterine fistula in the setting of Crohn's disease: Case report and literature review. Lance Truong1, Yigit Baykara1, and Nina Tatevian2. 1Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI and 2Women &amp; Infants Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI Deciduosis is a rare diagnosis which refers to extrauterine decidual tissue, found usually in adjacent gynecological structures including the cervix and ovaries, and more rarely in the peritoneum and in other abdominal organs. Fistulas are a known and frequent complication of Crohn's disease, commonly involving adjacent bowel and rarely involving gynecological structures. Here, we report a case of deciduosis of the distal ileum occurring in the setting of long-standing Crohn's disease in a 34-year-old patient at 31 5/7 weeks of gestation, admitted to our hospital with acute right lower quadrant pain. Imaging was suggestive of complex fistulae and abscess formation. She underwent a cesarean delivery followed by hysterectomy and ileocolectomy with an ileouterine fistula tract leading to a complex subserosal uterine abscess on intraoperative and pathological gross examination. On histological examination, a focus of ectopic decidua adjacent the fistula was incidentally found on H&amp;E section. Review of the current literature on gastrointestinal deciduosis identified nine publications reporting cases primarily involving the appendix and only a single previously reported case involving the ileum. Crohn's disease cases with reported ileouterine fistulas are extremely rare, with only four previously reported cases in the literature. The utility in recognizing this extremely rare presentation is in avoiding misinterpreting this entity as a neoplastic process. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. define deciduosis, 2. recognize complications associated with Crohn's disease, 3. compare neoplastic mimickers of ectopic decidual tissue [38] Modern implementation of Digital Pathology with Artificial Intelligence in an Academic Medical Center. Dibson Dibe Gondim, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at University of Louisville, KY Digital pathology refers to the digital transformation of histopathology - turning histologic tissue sections into multi-gigabyte whole slide images. These images can be evaluated by quantitative and reproducible computational techniques, including artificial intelligence-based algorithms. While the value of this technology has been increasingly recognized, clinical adoption has been limited in most of the world, including in the United States. Our academic center and health care system have embraced the concept of digital pathology and artificial intelligence. My goal is to present the digital pathology implementation proposal and discuss our progress. Overall, digital pathology implementation tends to be a slow process occurring over years. However, we decided that the technology was mature enough for an accelerated adoption plan. From the beginning, we focused on 100% prospective glass slide scanning 100%, in contrast with most institutions which start with limited retrospective scanning. To achieve this, we created a multidisciplinary team with expertise in pathology, histotechnology, project management, software engineering, and data science. We integrated scanning in the histology laboratory using LEAN principles and updated our staining equipment to allow compatibility with the slide scanners. We installed high-throughput slide scanners that require minimal user experience or training. We adopted cloud-based software as the platform product from a vendor with expertise in artificial intelligence. This software platform provides image viewer, worklist, storage, and artificial intelligence-based algorithms. Cloud storage allowed us to scale our operation without major overhead. We started scanning 100% of slides in less than 9 months after the beginning of the project. We deployed the integration interface and the first FDA-approved artificial intelligence-based tool in the testing environment within months. Our experience shows that the current technologies allow for an accelerated adoption of digital pathology. However, advanced understanding of digital pathology technologies and assembling a multidisciplinary task force have been instrumental in determining how to best put together all the pieces and to overcome multiple challenges that emerged during the implementation period. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. understand how digital pathology fits in the clinical workflow, 2. describe digital pathology implementation strategies, and 3. explain how integration of multiple hospital and laboratory information systems for a productive user experience.

AI in Healthcare Workshop during the 2021 VISN 8 Improvement and Innovation Forum. 2022 VISN 8 AI Conference Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to familiarize themselves with the formal process of promoting AI throughout their institutions. [40] Artificial Intelligence in Radiology: Hype, Hope, or Hysteria.Narayan Viswanadhan, Chief of Radiology at the Tampa VA, and is a clinical faculty at USF Health Morsani College of Medicine. Tampa, FL There is particularly increasing application of AI tools within Diagnostic Imaging and Pathology. Clinical applications of AI in imaging will be discussed, with focus on current uses, and future directions. Additional areas covered will be utilization of AI in Neuroimaging, population health, Breast Imaging, and Precision Medicine. Utilization of AI in the face of the pandemic will also be discussed.. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. develop an understanding of Artificial Intelligence as it relates to imaging 2.understand current clinical use cases and future directions, and 3. appreciate challenges of AI in Radiology. [41] Data literacy in healthcare: a vital component of precision medicine. Joyce J. Ou, Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI The accelerating volume of heterogenous, multimodal data that is generated in modern healthcare highlights an urgent need for data literacy across a broad range of stakeholders. As information sources, analytics, and use cases rapidly evolve, data-powered augmented intelligence is becoming a major driver of precision medicine. The growing influence of machine generated insights on decisionmaking underscores the importance of ensuring that health data producers and consumers have the skills to critically evaluate, interpret, communicate, and act on these insights. Data literacy has, at times, been equated with specific data science tools and processes. However, fluency with data in the current era requires additional knowledge of its value and limitations with respect to data life cycles and governance, along with technical, social, and ethical implications. To achieve this breadth of understanding, a practical framework can be developed to identify and address gaps in data literacy. This framework focuses on identifying core categories of data skills, assessing stakeholder roles and needs relative to these categories, and developing processes for continuous learning. Implementation of such a model can promote systemic innovation by enabling individuals to stay current with the pace of technological changes that impact all stages of precision medicine discovery and delivery. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. Identify core competencies needed to achieve healthcare data literacy 2. Evaluate the impact of a data literacy framework on promoting collaborations between data producers and consumers in precision medicine 3. Describe a data education model that supports continuous learning for healthcare stakeholders. [42] Digital health applications and key characteristics related to at-home testing outcomes. Lee B. Springer, Brio Systems, Bellevue, OH Digital health technology applications (DHT) have been minimally utilized to support at-home rapid testing in the past. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, their use has increased significantly. One of the primary contributors to this growth is the widespread adoption of at-home testing throughout the progression of the pandemic to increase the publics access to testing. Given the increased need for at-home testing, digital health technology applications have been utilized to aid users throughout all testing processes and efficiently document results. These applications are considered to play a vital role in ensuring optimal accuracy of the test device and facilitate public health reporting. A step-by-step systematic analysis of digital health technology supporting at-home point-of-care testing was performed to identify key areas of task related dependence to predicted outcome in relation to technological support. The aim of the analysis was to assess the quality and features in relation to engagement during testing phases utilizing the mobile application rating scale (MARS). This analysis included 27 digital health applications designed to complement at-home testing for glucose, creatinine, coagulation, hemoglobin A1c, and SARS-CoV-2 with more than 5,000 downloads or registered users. A nonparametric rank sum test was used to determine correlating performance between sections of the mobile application rating scale and aligned testing phases. High scores in pre-analytical and post-analytical sections of the mobile application rating scale correlated to an overall high level of satisfaction and desired outcome. Additional correlations were seen between sections related to overall functionality, and applications viewed to support pre-analytical processes effectively, these were deemed as being able to consistently produce better patient and result outcomes. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to identify digital health technology that would optimize accurate results, predict overall patient engagement in clinical application and design clinical practices around digital health technology to optimize patient outcomes. [43] Validation of Artificial Intelligence-Based System for Prostate Cancer Detection and Grading. TarymÃƒÂ© LÃƒÂ³pez DÃƒÂ­az and Dibson Dibe Gondim, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at University of Louisville, KY Paige Prostate Detect (Paige.AI Inc., New York, USA) is the first FDA-approved artificial intelligence (AI)-based system created to assist pathologists to detect and grade prostate cancer. Our goal is to present the results of a validation study of this system in an academic center. 40 prostate biopsy cases were randomly selected from a list of 60 consecutive cases. All HE-stained slides (619) were scanned in a Leica Aperio GT450 (400x magnification). Paige Prostate Detect was applied to each slide and results were compared with the original diagnoses. Diagnostic discrepancies were evaluated by pathologists. AI output was recorded for each whole slide image. On the other hand, pathologists provided results based on the evaluation of two or more glass slides per biopsy location. 36 disagreements were identified (5.8%) in all slides. Agreement on the case level required that all slides of a case had concordant diagnosis between AI-system and pathologist. 16/40 cases had disagreements. The AI-system helped to detect focal cancer in a case with no prior definitive cancer diagnosis. Multiple discrepancies related to atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) were identified. Since the system was not trained to make a diagnosis of ASAP, these cases were either diagnosed as carcinoma or benign. Validation of pathology AI-systems is essential before clinical adoption. This system shows potential to locate low-volume cancer in cases with no definitive diagnosis of malignancy. In the case of ASAP, pathologists should use well-defined criteria to render this diagnosis and should not rely on AI impression. [44] Respiratory Pathology of Acute Respiratory distress Syndrome (ARDS). Henry Oh, PhD, FACSc, FRSB, FAPSR, RRT, MT, CSci, Health Occupations Department, Idaho State University, Pocatello, ID The body's immune system response to infection is primarily an inflammation. Cytokines cause inflammation of tissue by making the cell walls of blood vessels become more permeable, thus allowing leakage of blood with immune cells into the surrounding tissue to start the healing process of the damaged tissue. The inflammation is triggered by the release of cytokines from interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Cells that release cytokines include leucocytes or interleukins, neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and many other cells. When the inflammatory response go out of control, it can cause more harm to the lungs in COVID-19 infection where cytokines can destroy normal, healthy alveoli. Cytokine storm occurs when there is an overwhelming inflammatory response due to the increase release of cytokines. The inflammatory cytokines ""storms"" the lungs which is the leading cause of mortality rates in patients with COVID-19 infection in ICU. Accumulated dead cells and other debris in the lungs can set the stage for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The effects of cytokine storm amplify the severity and extent of ARDS. In ARDS, the alveoli become filled with dead cells, debris and leaked fluids from damaged interstitial cells. The lungs become stiff because of very low compliance. Oxygen saturation levels fall below 90% and the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) fall below 60 mmHg which can lead to severe hypoxemia. Patients with ARDS develop refractory hypoxemia which is unresponsive to oxygen therapy. Patient needs to be intubated and connected to a ventilator. The positive pressure effects of mechanical ventilation may not be adequate to improve the oxygenation status of the patient. Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) would need to be added to keep the oxygen saturation at 90%. However, caution must be observed when ventilating patients with high positive pressure since this can cause detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system.
