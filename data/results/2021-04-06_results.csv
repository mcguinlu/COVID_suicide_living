"Which traits predict elevated distress during the Covid-19 pandemic? Results from a large, longitudinal cohort study with psychiatric patients and healthy controls","Background: The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in repeated, prolonged restrictions in daily life. Social distancing policies as well as health anxiety are thought to lead to mental health impairment. However, there is lack of longitudinal data identifying at-risk populations particularly vulnerable for elevated Covid-19-related distress. Methods: We collected data of N=1268 participants (n=622 healthy controls (HC), and n=646 patients with major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) at baseline (2014-2018) and during the first lockdown in Germany (April-May 2020). We obtained information on Covid-19 restrictions (number and subjective impact of Covid-19 events), and Covid-19-related distress (i.e., subjective fear and isolation). Using multiple linear regression models including trait variables and individual Covid-19 impact, we sought to predict Covid-19-related distress. Results: HC and patients reported similar numbers of Covid-19-related events, and similar subjective impact rating. They did not differ in Covid-19-related subjective fear. Patients reported significantly higher subjective isolation. 30.5% of patients reported worsened self-rated symptoms since the pandemic. Subjective fear in all participants was predicted by four variables: trait anxiety (STAI-T), conscientiousness (NEO-FFI), Covid-19 impact, and sex. Subjective isolation in HC was predicted by social support (FSozu), Covid-19 impact, age, and sex; in patients, it was predicted by social support and Covid-19 impact. Conclusion: Our data shed light on differential effects of the pandemic in psychiatric patients and HC. They identify relevant, easy-to-obtain variables for risk profiles related to interindividual differences in Covid-19-related distress for direct translation into clinical practice.

"Intragroup differences in COVID-19 vaccine attitudes among Black Americans","COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Black Americans threatens to further magnify racial inequities in COVID-19 related health outcomes that emerged in the earliest stages of the pandemic. Here we shed new light on attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines by considering intragroup variation. Rather than analyzing Blacks as a homogenous group, we examine the relationship between COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and the extent to which participants are aligned with African American versus White culture (i.e., level of â€œacculturationâ€). In a sample of N=997 Black Americans, we find that stronger alignment with African American culture predicts substantially more negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination, above and beyond variation explained by age, gender, education, and socioeconomic status. This relationship was substantially attenuated when controlling for suspicion of the healthcare system, but not perceptions that healthcare system treats Blacks unfairly, science knowledge, or cognitive reflection. The intragroup differences among Blacks in COVID-19 vaccine perceptions uncovered here provide insights into designing interventions that provide health information that targets the relevant factors for vaccine hesitancy in differing subgroups.","Charles R.
