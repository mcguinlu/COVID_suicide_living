"OVERENIE PSYCHOMETRICKÃCH VLASTNOSTÃ SLOVENSKEJ VERZIE Å KÃLY FCV-19S (FEAR OF COVID-19 SCALE)","Ciele. Strach z novÃ©ho koronavÃ­rusu ako emocionÃ¡lna reakcia na pandemickÃº situÃ¡ciu, ktorÃ¡ suÅ¾uje svet uÅ¾ od zaciatku roka 2020, mÃ¡ mnoho sÃºvislostÃ­ so sprÃ¡vanÃ­m a preÅ¾Ã­vanÃ­m obyvatelstva. Na jeho zaznamenÃ¡vanie bola odbornÃ­kmi vyvinutÃ¡ 7-poloÅ¾kovÃ¡ Å¡kÃ¡la Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), ktorÃ¡ je ÃºspeÅ¡ne vyuÅ¾Ã­vanÃ¡ vo viac ako dvadsiatich krajinÃ¡ch sveta. TÃ¡to Å¡tÃºdia sa venuje overeniu psychometrickÃ½ch charakteristÃ­k slovenskej verzie FCV-19S, pricom sa zameriava na overenie jej faktorovej Å¡truktÃºry, invariancie merania vzhladom na pohlavie, reliability v zmysle vnÃºtornej konzistencie, konvergentnej validity v zmysle Å¡trukturÃ¡lneho modelovania (SEM) a na zÃ¡klade vztahu s prÃ­buznÃ½mi premennÃ½mi Ãºzkostou, depresivitou a stresom.

Fear of the new coronavirus, as an emotional response to a pandemic situation that has plagued the world since early 2020, has many implications for the behaviour and psychological experiences of the population. To measure the fear of coronavirus a 7-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was developed, now successfully used in more than 20 countries around the world. This study deals with the verification of psychometric characteristics of the Slovak version of FCV-19S, focusing on its factor structure, measurement invariance with respect to gender, reliability in terms of internal consistency, and convergent validity based on structural equation modeling (SEM) and based on the relationship to related constructs of anxiety, depression, and stress. Sample and settings. Data were collected online (N=744;aged 17-78) during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in Slovakia. Along with FCV-19S, World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index, Perceived Stress Scale, and Coronavirus Anxiety Scale were administered to the respondents. Results. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis supported the two-factor structure of the instrument with two subscales, Emotional and Physiological Symptoms. The FCV-19S has proven to be a gender-invariant tool, so it can be used to compare fear experiences in men and women. The results further indicate good internal consistency and convergent validity of the Slovak version of the scale. Limitations. Measurement invariance of FCV-19S across age, education or ethnic groups was not tested in the present study. Stability of the scores over time was also not examined due to cross-sectional design. The study is limited by online data collection and convenience sampling method.","RajcÃ¡niovÃ¡, Eva, PekÃ¡rovÃ¡, Veronika, TomÅ¡ik, Robert","https://doi.org/10.51561/cspsych.66.3.298","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ceskoslovenska Psychologie; 66(3):298-314, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36742,""
"La actividad fÃ­sica como moderador en la ansiedad asociada al COVID-19 en estudiantes universitarios (Physical activity as a moderator in anxiety associated to COVID-19 in university students)","The COVID-19 pandemic had a great impact on the mental health of the university population, so managing alternatives to adapt is essential. Objective. The purpose of the study was to analyze the moderating effect of physical activity (PA) on the anxiety levels generated by the experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in university students. Method. A cross-sectional, correlational-explanatory study was carried out in university students (n = 922;36.66% men and 63.34% women;19.97 Â± 2.92 years). An ad hoc questionnaire was applied to measure fear to COVID-19, as well as the CUXOS-D for anxiety levels and the IPAQ-s to assess PA. Descriptive, inferential and moderation analyzes were performed, in addition to the exploratory and confirmatory factorial for the CUXOS-D. Results. The influence of fear to COVID-19 on anxiety levels is observed, which is moderated by high PA levels (F [3,918] = 21.58;p &lt;.001). Likewise, it is observed that women perceive greater anxiety and perform less PA than men. The factor analysis of the CUXOS-D was satisfactory. Conclusion. Physical activity can have positive effects that moderate the impact generated by COVID-19 over anxiety in the university community.

"Acciones para una universidad saludable: Impacto sobre la salud mental y fÃ­sica de los jÃ³venes (Actions for a healthy university: Impact on mental and physical health in young people)","University students frequently show high levels of physical inactivity as well as a sedentary lifestyle. This fact has been increased after the recent health crisis caused by the COVID-19. Physical exercise, as part of the programs of the Healthy Universities, could be a strategy to face this problem. The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze the effects of an exercise program on the level of physical activity, mental health, and body composition in sedentary university students. A longitudinal study with repeated measures was designed. 14 students were evaluated at three different moments: at the beginning of the exercise program, after program completion, and two weeks after the end of the program. The followings instruments were used: International Physical Activity Questionnaire (level of physical activity), DASS-21 questionnaire (level of stress, depression, and anxiety), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (quality of sleep), a body tape measure (perimeters), and a body composition monitor (weight, BMI, % fat mass and % muscle mass). After five weeks of intervention and two weeks post-intervention, the levels of physical activity, mental health and quality of sleep were improved (p &lt; 0.05). Regarding body composition, muscle mass was the only variable that improved after five weeks of exercise program (p = 0.04).

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a widely used instrument in the general population to assess the severity of depression in primary care. Objective: To validate the factorial structure of the PHQ-9 questionnaire in human medicine interns at a reference university in Peru. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional and instrumental design was used. We worked with a sample of 343 human medicine interns. From the responses to the questionnaire, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated, as well as the factorial analysis to determine the construct validity of this instrument in the target population. Results: Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 88.2%, the item/test conversion coefficients presented values greater than 0.5. A value greater than 0.05 was obtained for the chi2 goodness-of-fit test for the model, as well as results greater than 0.9 for the model's goodness-of-fit coefficients.

Participants with increasing age showed higher levels depression, anxiety, and stress scores but significant association was seen only with mean anxiety scores with increasing age (p&lt;0.05). A significant association was seen between mean scores of stress and education status (p&lt;0.05). A significant association was also seen between mean scores of anxiety and stress scores and nuptial status (p&lt;0.05). No significant associations were seen between gender of caregivers, employment status, religion, family type, and mean depression, anxiety, and stress scores (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of family caregivers of COVID-19 cases is significant.","Arora, R.; Singh, K.; Kaur, M.; Sidhu, R.","https://doi.org/10.22159/ajpcr.2022.v15i8.44994","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research; 15(8):155-160, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36749,""
"PRACTICE OF SELF-MEDICATION AND QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT AMONG HEALTHCARE WORKERS OF A TERTIARY HOSPITAL IN ASSAM DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Objectives: The aims of this study were to collect sociodemographic, clinical data regarding practice of self-medication and to assess quality of life in healthcare workers involved taking care of COVID-19 patients. Methods: The study population consisted of 104 healthcare workers from Gauhati Medical College and Hospital directly involved in management and control of COVID-19 Pandemic. It was a cross-sectional observational study using non-probability sampling. Data were collected in a questionnaire developed by the investigators which included age, sex, and occupation, COVID-19 such as symptoms, medicines used, contraction and confirmation of COVID-19 positive, and self-medication when COVID positive, symptomatic relief, and adverse effects and usefulness of self-medication. The data for mental health were obtained in a questionnaire based on the Professional Quality of Life Scale (Compassion Satisfaction and Compassion Fatigue Version 5) with responses rated on a five-point Likert scale. Results: The study consisted of 104 participants. Males were n=42 (40%) and females were n=62 (60%). Doctors n=20 (19%), Laboratory Technicians n=22 (21%), Nurses n=44 (42%), Pharmacists n=13 (13%), Ward boys n=3 (3%), and Ward girls n=2 (2%) took part. Eighty-four (97.7%) respondents took paracetamol, 39 (45.3%) took cough syrup, 30 (34.9%) used nasal decongestants, 25 (29.1%) utilized throat gargle, 24 (27.9%) used azithromycin, 22 (25.6%) used cefixime, 13 (15.1%) took amoxyclav, 27 (31.4%) took ORS, 3 (3.5%) took Doxycycline, 4 (4.8%) used Ivermectin, 1 (1.2%) took Dexamethasone, and 1 (1.2%) used Multivitamin. About 68% (n=51) of COVID Positive respondents self-medicated with Azithromycin, 24% (n=18) with Ivermectin, 41.3% (n=31) with Doxycycline, 20% (n=15) with Dexamethasone, and 4% (n=3) with Levocetrizine and Paracetamol. The Mental Health Assessment Scores were obtained as the sum total of scores of answers to the 30 questions provided per respondent. About 7% (n=7) respondents with total score between 60 and 69, 12% (n=13) from 70 to 79, 29% (n=30) from 80 to 89, 22% (n=23) from 90 to 99, 16% (n=17) from 100 to 109, 13% (n=13) from 110 to 119, and 1% (n=1) between 120 and 129. This indicates that some participants had mild burnout, most had moderate burnout, and a few had severe burnout. Conclusion: Self-medication practices common among healthcare workers, increased during the COVID-19 Pandemic which must be appropriately managed to stay away from the ill effects. Providing adequate mental health resources and education to the affected health workers will motivate them increasing their productivity during the pandemic.","Borah, L.; Sarmah, R.","https://doi.org/10.22159/ajpcr.2022.v15i8.44928","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research; 15(8):184-189, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36750,""
"REPERCUSSIONS OF HOME QUARANTINED TOWARDS CHILDRENâ€™S SOCIAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AMIDST COVID-19: A NARRATIVE REVIEW WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTERVENTIONS FROM ISLAMIC APPROACH","SARS-CoV-2, the newly identified coronavirus causing human infections, has spread rapidly across the globe as of late December 2019. This pandemic outbreak caused the death of over 50,000 people in a short span of time, and the worldwide health systems were significantly challenged. From a health standpoint, studies show that Covid-19 mostly affects older age groups, whereas children are generally more resilient and less affected than adults. As Covid-19 cases soared in Malaysia, authorities in Malaysia imposed containment measures or Movement Control Orders (MCO) in March 2020. As part of the effort to prevent the spread of the virus, the Malaysian Ministry of Education has also closed all schools nationwide. Researchers realized that such quarantine could adversely affect children who were being quarantined throughout the outbreak. This study is conducted in order to examine the repercussions of the prevalence of emotional, mental health, and social problems among children who have been quarantined in the home. In addition, appropriate mechanisms and interventions are considered to deal with these issues. This research is qualitative in nature. The relevant priory articles, guidelines, and informative official websites related to children's mental-health issues with the COVID-19 pandemic were also narratively reviewed and thematically organized. A systematic search was also conducted in various text documents, including primary sources of Islamic guidelines and principles for children's mental and emotional health, using content analysis to analyse the data. It is further recommended that a comprehensive approach be taken in dealing with the mental, social, and emotional health of children who were affected by this pandemic. To achieve this holistic approach, the proposed constructive plan and intervention must be formulated with due consideration for an Islamic point of view. In response to the current pandemic, it is hoped that a comprehensive and integrated approach to intervention would serve as an effective measure to ensure children's mental health throughout and after the pandemic.","Samori, Z.; Saidin, N.; Rahman, F.

"Tracking the Impact of Diseases of Despair in Appalachiaâ€”2015 to 2018","Introduction: This study provides an update on mortality due to diseases of despair within the Appalachian Region, comparing 2015 to 2018. Methods: Diseases of despair include: alcohol, prescription drug and illegal drug overdose, suicide, and alcoholic liver disease/cirrhosis of the liver. Analyses are based on National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) mortality data for individuals aged 15-64. Results: Between 2015 and 2017, the diseases of despair mortality rate increased in both Appalachia and the non-Appalachian U.S., and the disparity grew between Appalachia and the rest of the county. In 2018, the disease of despair mortality rate declined by 8 percent in Appalachia, marking the first decline for the Region since 2012. Diseases of despair continue to impact the working-age population, and while males experience a higher burden of mortality due to diseases of despair, the disparity between Appalachia and the rest of the United States is greater for females. Overdose mortality rates in Appalachia increased between 2015 and 2017, followed by a decline in 2018. During this same time frame, suicide also increased notably within the Appalachian region, and the disparity between Appalachia and the non-Appalachian U.S. increased by 50 percent. Implications: These findings document that the diseases of despair continue to have a greater impact in the Appalachian Region than in the rest of the United States. While the declining trends between 2017 and 2018 are promising, data has shown that these rates are likely to increase again, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Heffernan, Megan, Meit, Michael, Cherney, Margaret, Hallman, Victoria A.","https://doi.org/10.13023/jah.0302.06","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Appalachian Health; 3(2), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36752,""
"MOULDING THE EXCELLENCE OF HUMAN RESOURCES - 'TEACHERS AND STUDENTS' THROUGH RESILIENCE IN THIS POST-PANDEMIC ERA","Human Resource excellence throughmanagement paradigms and passion is the latest footstep in the organization. ""Each individual creature on this beautiful planet is created by God to fulfil a particular Role"" (Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam). Taking this uniqueness into consideration, this study creates and makes a new path, and welcomes all individuals to their passion zone. Human resource excellence through resilience is a recent area of research in the organization to overcome all pitfalls of the work. A contemporary field of research in the organisation is human resource excellence through resilience to overcome all difficulties at work. All institutions are closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic wave in order to lower the disease's prevalence. It spread quickly throughout the entire world and peaked in February and March. Thus, it has an impact on the entire education sector. The traditional lecture method of instruction has been replaced with a virtual classroom system due to the spread of the virus and the lockdown system. Even though the abrupt change had an impact across the board, instructors and kids were the most troubled by the situation's repercussions. Therefore, the teachers who taught the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth graders who take the public exams are the main subject of this study. This study aims to reduce the stress, worries, and technological issues that teachers and the students are experiencing. The study is conducted on 60 teachers who are working in a college. The result shows that resilience has prevented negative mental health, and stress in work and increased the well-being of employees, and has created signature strength in their work.","Francis, C.

"Evaluation of Psychiatric Counseling for Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 in a University-Affiliated General Hospital in Tehran, Iran","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a number of psychiatric problems in patients;however, mental healthcare in these patients does not appear to be adequate. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the extent of psychological care provided to COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital and the most common reasons for psychiatric counseling. Methods: This study examined the electronic medical records of all COVID-19-positive patients admitted to Rasoul-e-Akram hospital in Tehran, Iran, within April 1 and September 30, 2020 (approximately 2200 cases). Results: Psychiatric consultation was requested for 5.45% of admitted patients with COVID-19 diagnosis based on a positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. More than half of those who received psychiatric counseling had a previous psychiatric disorder. The most common reason for requesting psychiatric counseling in patients with a previous psychiatric disorder was the patientâ€™s evaluation and management;the most common reason in patients without a psychiatric disorder was agitation and lack of cooperation. The most common diagnosis in patients with a positive history of psychiatric disorder was bipolar disorders (33.9%), followed by opioid use disorder (29%). Adjustment disorder (54%) and delirium (26%) were the most common diagnoses in patients without a history of psychiatric disease. Conclusions: The current study showed that psychiatric counseling in COVID-19 patients was limited to a small number, including those with a positive history of psychiatric illnesses and prominent psychiatric symptoms.","Salehian, R.; Esfahani, M.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Suicidal and Self-Harming Behavior of Young People","The unprecedented use of lockdown and quarantine to combat the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severely disrupted young people's social worlds. Both short- and long-term negative consequences were widely predicted for adolescent mental health, which was, however, reported to be deteriorating before the COVID-19 pandemic. By taking a microperspective, exploring in depth the experiences of therapeutic work with young people with suicidal thoughts or behavior, including two composite case examples, this article provides a nuanced understanding of the pandemic's effects. The discussion links the accounts of these cases, firstly, with evidence to date about the patterns that are emerging regarding the effects of the pandemic and, secondly, with theories of the relationship between suicidal thoughts and behavior and the impasse/breakdown in the adolescent developmental processes. In conclusion, it is suggested that the capacity to negotiate loss and change are crucial for sustaining development despite the COVID-19 pandemic and often in the face of overwhelming anxieties.

"The Effect of COVID-19 Restrictions on Changes in Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity Was 'A Double-Edged Sword';: It Improved for Some and Worsened for Others","The objective was to determine the contributions to changes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the COVID-19 restrictions by age, gender, education, place of residence, type of work, type of sport, Body Mass Index (BMI), subjective health status, smoking, alcohol consumption, overeating, impulsivity, depression symptoms, stress level, sleep duration and emotional intelligence (EI). We interviewed 6369 people in Lithuania before the COVID-19 pandemic and 2392 during the COVID-19 restrictions, and they were 18&ndash;4 years old. The initial COVID-19 restrictions reduced MVPA. This decrease was greater in individuals with lower education levels, higher BMI, higher stress levels and higher self-rated health status. MVPA decreased among those whose self-rated health status was the poorest but increased among those whose self-rated health status was the best. MVPA decreased among young women, women whose work was mostly sedentary and smoking women, and it decreased among overeating men.

"An Emerging Solution for Medical Waste: Reuse of COVID-19 Protective Suit in Concrete","With the continuous spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), a large number of medical protective suits (PS) have been used and discarded, causing great damage to the ecological environment. The main component of PS is polypropylene plastic, which will enter the oceans, rivers, and animals with groundwater and will not decompose for hundreds of years. Therefore, this global health crisis not only affects the health and economy of the world's population now but will also continue to disrupt our daily lives after the pandemic ends. The main objective of this study is to explore an effective method to reduce the biological and environmental hazards of medical waste by combining PS with concrete. Due to the excessive size of the PS, protective suit fibers (PSF) were obtained from PS by cutting. To investigate the possibility of using PS in concrete, a series of experiments were conducted, including a physical parameter test, compression test, split tensile test, ultrasonic pulse velocity test, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and finite element simulation. The results indicated that the introduction of PSF significantly enhanced the mechanical properties of concrete, and the maximum compressive strength and splitting tensile strength increased by 7.3% and 43.6%, respectively. The ultrasonic pulse velocity and density of concrete containing PSF decreased compared with the control group. The images of SEM show that PSF binds tightly to the cement matrix and hinders the propagation of micro-cracks. The introduction of PS into the concrete material leads to the improvement of the mechanical properties of concrete and the improvement of the overall quality of the concrete, which is of great significance for reducing the damage of medical waste to the environment. The originality of this work is that polypropylene fibers acquired from PS were put into concrete for the first time for performance testing.","Ran, Tao, Pang, Jianyong, Zou, Jiuqun","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141610045","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(16):10045, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36760,""
"The Role of Religious Coping in Understanding the Suicide Risk of Older Adults during COVID-19","In the United States, racially diverse, homebound older adults have been among those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During times of disaster, persons impacted tend to turn to their faith to make sense of suffering. COVID-19 has been an unusual disaster, as physical distancing was required to keep those most susceptible safe. Due to the resulting social isolation and loneliness, suicidal behaviors and ideation (e.g., desire to die) have increased during the pandemic. Suicide desire is encapsulated by two states: thwarted belongingness (T.B., chronic loneliness and lack of reciprocal care) and perceived burdensomeness (P.B., belief that one is a burden to others and society) and has historically been inversely correlated with religiosity. Therefore, understanding how religious coping can contribute to the relationship between the impact of COVID-19 on T.B. and P.B. in homebound older adults is important in understanding their suicide risk. Our participants (ages 62&ndash;101) varied in suicidality. Increases in suicide desire over time were associated with higher levels of negative religious coping. Implications for treatment are provided, particularly the importance of fostering belongingness, buffering perceived burdensomeness with older adults, and promoting positive religious coping and support. Suggestions for future research are also provided.","Pulgar, Camila A.; Shaikh, Afroze N.; Shannonhouse, Laura, Davis, Don","https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13080731","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Religions; 13(8):731, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36761,""
"Anxious Temperament Predicts Poor Acceptance of Self and Life in Bipolar Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the social distancing resulting thereof are having a great impact on psychological well-being. Studies investigating resilience found that it impacts mental health during crises. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of pre-crisis temperament on resilience in individuals with bipolar disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted in Austria between April and June 2020, including 36 individuals with bipolar disorder and 39 healthy controls. Resilience was assessed with the 13-item resilience scale, and temperament was measured with the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A). The bipolar disorder group showed lower resilience than the control group, and scored higher on the TEMPS-A for depressive, cyclothymic, and anxious temperaments. Resilience could be predicted by anxious temperament in individuals with bipolar disorder, and correlated negatively with depressive symptoms in both groups. The results suggest that anxious temperament influences the resilience of individuals with bipolar disorder, likely more than temporary hardships, such as the first months of the COVID-19 crisis. It is therefore important to improve the resilience of individuals with bipolar disorder not only by short-term interventions, but by strengthening resilience and reducing anxious temperament in the long term.","Fleischmann, Eva, Fellendorf, Frederike T.; Ortner, Jennifer, Bengesser, Susanne A.; Ratzenhofer, Michaela, Pilz, RenÃ©, Lenger, Melanie, Birner, Armin, Queissner, Robert, Platzer, Martina, Tmava-Berisha, Adelina, Hamm, Carlo, Maget, Alexander, Wagner-Skacel, Jolana, Reininghaus, Eva Z.; Dalkner, Nina","https://doi.org/10.3390/psychiatryint3030019","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry International; 3(3):236-247, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36762,""

Se realizÃ³ el estudio en 157 cuidadores mediante la encuesta de caracterizaciÃ³n de la diada, escala HADS, escala UCLA y escala adopciÃ³n del cuidador. El anÃ¡lisis fue con estadÃ­stica descriptiva e inferencial. Resultados: la mayorÃ­a de los participantes fueron mujeres, con un tiempo medio de cuidados de siete meses. Los cuidadores en su mayorÃ­a tienen ansiedad como problema clÃ­nico en un 27 %, depresiÃ³n dudosa con un 14,9 %, soledad severa con un 66,2 % y adopciÃ³n satisfactoria del rol en el 71,2 %. Se encontrÃ³ que a mayor adopciÃ³n del rol, menor ansiedad, depresiÃ³n y soledad (p < 0,05). Los factores psicosociales, la edad de la persona receptora de cuidado, la edad del cuidador informal y el tiempo de cuidado explicaron un 36 % de la varianza de la adopciÃ³n del rol (F = 13,12; p < 0,01), siendo variable predictora la soledad. ConclusiÃ³n: la pandemia de la covid-19 ha ocasionado un impacto en la salud mental y la soledad severa de los cuidadores, siendo esta Ãºltima un predictor de la adopciÃ³n del cuidador.; Objetivo: determinar o efeito da solidÃ£o, ansiedade e depressÃ£o na adoÃ§Ã£o do papel de cuidador de idosos com doenÃ§a crÃ´nica em uma amostra de cuidadores mexicanos durante a pandemia de COVID-19.

"Mental health status of healthcare workers assisted in Hubei during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and their influencing factors: a prospective cohort study","The COVID-19 outbreak beginning in late 2019 has resulted in negative emotions among the public. However, many healthcare workers risked their lives by voluntarily travelling to the worst-hit area, Hubei Province, to support antipandemic work. This study explored the mental health changes in these healthcare workers and tried to discover the influencing factors. A longitudinal online survey was begun on 8 February 2020, using the snowball sampling method, and this first phase ended on 22 February 2020 (T1). The follow-up survey was conducted from 8 February to 22 February 2021 (T2). Healthcare workers from outside of the Hubei area who went to the province to provide medical assistance. 963 healthcare workers who completed both surveys. Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS), Generalised Anxiety Scale (GAD-7) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). There were no significant differences in the SRSS scores or in the GAD-7 scores between T1 and T2 (t=0.994, 0.288; p&gt;0.05). However, the PHQ-9 score at T2 was significantly higher than the score at T1 (t=-10.812, p&lt;0.001). Through multiple linear regression analysis, we found that the following traits could predict higher GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores at T2: male sex, single marital status, occupation of nurse, lower professional technical titles, healthcare workers having a history of psychosis, treating seriously ill patients, having relatively poor self-perceived health, caring for patients who died and having family members who had been infected with COVID-19. The results indicate that the depression levels of these special healthcare workers increased in the long term, and the initial demographics and experiences related to the pandemic played an important role in predicting their long-term poor mental health. In the future, more appropriate psychological decompression training should be provided for these special healthcare workers.","Zhou, Du, Xiao, Li, Li, Geng","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062664","20220829","COVID-19; MENTAL HEALTH; OCCUPATIONAL &amp; INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36772,""

"Hopelessness during and after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown among Chinese college students:Ã‚Â A longitudinal network analysis","In China, recurrent pandemics require frequent city-wide lockdowns and quarantine actions to contain the impact of COVID-19, exposing college students to psychological problems, including hopelessness. Hence, the purpose of helping problematic college students alleviate hopelessness symptoms motivates us to carry out the present study to explore their interrelationship. Hopelessness (i.e., a complex phenomenon with important clinical consequences, such as depression and suicidality) was investigated in a large longitudinal sample of college students (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2787; 58.59% female; age <sub>mean</sub> <sub>Ã‚Â±</sub> <sub>SD</sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18.34Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.92) who were recruited during and after the COVID-19 lockdown using the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). Applying the novel approach (i.e., symptom network analysis), the results indicated that the edge ofÃ‚Â #BHS1Ã‚Â (i.e., [NOT] hope-enthusiasm)-#BHS15 (i.e., [NOT] faith-in-the-future) showed the strongest association both in Wave 1 and Wave 2. Similarly, #BHS20 (i.e., not-trying) had the highest node expectedinfluence (centrality) in the hopelessness symptoms network both among Wave 1 and Wave 2. The Network Comparison Test indicated that the global network strength significantly differed between the twoÃ‚Â time points. As expected, college students' hopelessness will gradually dissipate with the end of segregation control. The stability and accuracy indicated that the network analysis results were trustworthy. The study findings provide evidence that central nodes and edges connecting symptoms should be addressed. Further interventions and treatments that may target these symptoms are essential to effectively alleviate the overall hopelessness level among college students. Theoretical and clinical potential consequences were discussed in detail.","Tao, Niu, Hou, Zhang, Ying","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23439","20220829","child and adolescent mental health; depression; depressive symptoms; measurement; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36774,""
"Association of the COVID-19 Pandemic With Medical School Diversity Pathway Programs","Medical school pathway programs are a strategy to increase the diversity of the physician workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic may have negatively affected pathway programs, further challenging efforts to increase diversity. To describe the changes in medical school pathway programs during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify methods for sustaining and supporting these programs during and after the pandemic. A survey study using an exploratory sequential mixed-method design was conducted from January 4 to August 3, 2021. Semistructured interviews with a sample of medical school pathway program administrators and academic leaders of US allopathic and osteopathic medical school diversity pathway programs identified themes and patterns of change to pathway programs since the onset of the pandemic compared with previous years. These themes were used to develop a survey that was sent to medical schools to assess the association between COVID-19 and their programs. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and medical school diversity pathway programs was explored using interview and survey data assessing respondent characteristics; changes in the scope, size, and funding of programs in 2020 compared with previous years; and respondents' perceptions of future needs for pathway programs. Twelve program administrators and academic leaders were interviewed. Interviews revealed challenges and benefits of virtual programming in engaging and reaching students and speakers, the value of community partnerships to sustaining programming, and the importance of psychosocial support to mediating students' mental health challenges due to COVID-19 and remote learning. Of 198 schools surveyed in the quantitative phase, 112 responded (56.6%), 106 (94.6%) of which had been sponsoring or assisting with pathway programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Forty-two respondents (39.6%) had reduced pathway programs since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous year. Program cancellations were more likely to be noted in elementary school-aged (50.0% decrease in programming; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and middle school-aged (32.6%; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02) students compared with older groups. In this survey study, schools indicated that pathway programs were disrupted by COVID-19. Ongoing and flexible supports may be needed to sustain these programs. These findings are timely given recent investments in equity-focused programs to diversify the health workforce.","Batra, Orban, Raichur, Jennings, Trivedi, Naik, Bogucki, Haywood","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.29086","20220829","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36775,""
"Changes in Health and Quality of Life in US Skilled Nursing Facilities by COVID-19 Exposure Status in 2020","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the US federal government required that skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) close to visitors and eliminate communal activities. Although these policies were intended to protect residents, they may have had unintended negative effects. To assess health outcomes among SNFs with and without known COVID-19 cases. This retrospective observational study used US Medicare claims and Minimum Data Set 3.0 for January through November in each year beginning in 2018 and ending in 2020 including 15Ã¢â‚¬Â¯477 US SNFs with 2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯985Ã¢â‚¬Â¯864 resident-years. January through November of calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2020. COVID-19 diagnoses were used to assign SNFs into 2 mutually exclusive groups with varying membership by month in 2020: active COVID-19 (Ã¢â€°Â¥1 COVID-19 diagnosis in the current or past month) or no-known COVID-19 (no observed diagnosis by that month). Monthly rates of mortality, hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and monthly changes in activities of daily living (ADLs), body weight, and depressive symptoms. Each SNF in 2018 and 2019 served as its own control for 2020. In 2018-2019, mean monthly mortality was 2.2%, hospitalization 3.0%, and ED visit rate 2.9% overall. In 2020, among active COVID-19 SNFs compared with their own 2018-2019 baseline, mortality increased by 1.60% (95% CI, 1.58% to 1.62%), hospitalizations decreased by 0.10% (95% CI, -0.12% to -0.09%), and ED visit rates decreased by 0.57% (95% CI, -0.59% to -0.55%). Among no-known COVID-19 SNFs, mortality decreased by 0.15% (95% CI, -0.16% to -0.13%), hospitalizations by 0.83% (95% CI, -0.85% to -0.81%), and ED visits by 0.79% (95% CI, -0.81% to -0.77%). All changes were statistically significant. In 2018-2019, across all SNFs, residents required assistance with an additional 0.89 ADLs between January and November, and lost 1.9 lb; 27.1% had worsened depressive symptoms. In 2020, residents in active COVID-19 SNFs required assistance with an additional 0.36 ADLs (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.38), lost 3.1 lb (95% CI, -3.2 to -3.0 lb) more weight, and were 4.4% (95% CI, 4.1% to 4.7%) more likely to have worsened depressive symptoms, all statistically significant changes. In 2020, residents in no-known COVID-19 SNFs had no significant change in ADLs (-0.06 [95% CI, -0.12 to 0.01]), but lost 1.8 lb (95% CI, -2.1 to -1.5 lb) more weight and were 3.2% more likely (95% CI, 2.3% to 4.1%) to have worsened depressive symptoms, both statistically significant changes. Among skilled nursing facilities in the US during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and prior to the availability of COVID-19 vaccination, mortality and functional decline significantly increased at facilities with active COVID-19 cases compared with the prepandemic period, while a modest statistically significant decrease in mortality was observed at facilities that had never had a known COVID-19 case. Weight loss and depressive symptoms significantly increased in skilled nursing facilities in the first year of the pandemic, regardless of COVID-19 status.","Barnett, Waken, Zheng, Orav, Epstein, Grabowski, Joynt Maddox","https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2022.15071","20220829","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36776,""
"Rethinking how health care professionals cope with stress: A process model for COVID-19 and beyond","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was evidence of challenges surrounding the psychological well-being of health care professionals (HCPs). HCPs already frayed psychological ability to cope risks being further compromised by COVID-19-related stresses. Most research on stress, psychological distress, and coping among HCPs is done in a piecemeal manner without a theoretical model connecting these different but related phenomena. This critical advancement article aims to apply and extend Wheaton and Montazer's model of stressors, stress, and distress to the literature on HCPs, generally, and COVID-19, specifically, to summarize past and guide future research on HCPs' mental health, resilience, and coping. Our model describes how different sources of support buffer the effect of stressors on stress and how coping strategies moderate the effect of stress on psychological distress. We extended the model by (a) distinguishing context from the support in HCPs' environment; (b) distinguishing adaptive from maladaptive coping strategies and their relationships with antecedents and outcomes; (c) describing the adverse impacts that psychological distress has on patients, HCPs, and health services; and (d) describing how such outcomes can become stressors, in turn, further contributing to HCPs' stress in a vicious cycle. Our model provides a broader perspective of HCPs' work-related mental health and helps guide the creation, implementation, and evaluation of different sources of support and promote adaptive coping strategies. This model helps HCPs, researchers, and health services managers better understand and respond to the well-being crisis HCPs are facing, especially during the pandemic.","Harley, Montreuil, Lou, Feldman, Fried, Lavoie-Tremblay, Bhanji, Kennedy","https://doi.org/10.1097/HMR.0000000000000345","20220829","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36777,""
"Overload and Emotional Wellbeing in a Sample of Spanish Caregivers of Alzheimer's Patients during COVID-19 pandemic","Carers of Alzheimer's suffer from caregiver overload, anxiety and depression. Changes in caregiving brought about by pandemic restrictions (COVID-19) may play a role. The aim was to explore the caregiver profile and assess the influence of the pandemic on informal and formal caregivers in a Spanish sample. Sixty caregivers participated. An ad hoc questionnaire, ZBI, STAI and BDI were administered. Informal caregivers were more overloaded, anxious and depressed than professional caregivers. Both groups perceived themselves to be more sad, worried and stressed than in the pre-pandemic situation. The pandemic-generated variables associated with caregiving did not influence caregiver overload in both groups. In informal caregivers, worsening of the patient with stress and changes in perceived social support with anxiety and depression. In professional caregivers, changes in routine were associated with stress and lower depression and changes in perceived social support with higher caregiver strain. Changes in caregiving routine and changes in perceived social support were predictors of overload and emotional distress in both caregivers. Overload was not influenced by the pandemic situation. Changes in caregiving routine and lack of social support were found to be predictors of overload and emotional distress in both types of caregivers.","RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Mora, Mateo Guirola, Mestre","https://doi.org/10.1080/0361073X.2022.2115739","20220829","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36778,""
"Brief adjunctive mindfulness-based cognitive therapy via Telehealth for anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic","While cognitive-behavioral therapy is a highly efficacious treatment for anxiety, additional research is needed to identify adjunctive interventions that may augment treatment outcome. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an open feasibility trial of brief (i.e., four 75- to 90-minute sessions) mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for anxiety via telehealth for patients (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°23) receiving individual CBT at an outpatient specialty clinic. Self-report measures of home practice compliance (weekly), intervention acceptability (post-intervention), mindfulness and self-compassion, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and transdiagnostic processes (pre- and post-intervention) were administered as part of routine clinical practice. Results indicated good retention and attendance rates, few technical difficulties, good home practice compliance, and high levels of perceived importance. Participants indicated that they would highly recommend the group to others and also recommended extending the group beyond four sessions. There were significant improvements in mindfulness and self-compassion and reductions in intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety sensitivity, distress intolerance, emotion dysregulation, and anxiety symptoms from pre- to post-intervention. Brief MBCT as an adjunctive treatment for anxiety via telehealth is feasible and acceptable, and shows promise in terms of engaging treatment targets and transdiagnostic processes and reducing anxiety symptoms.","O'Bryan, Davis, Beadel, Tolin","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2022.2117305","20220829","CognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œbehavioral therapy; anxiety; mindfulness; mindfulness-based cognitive therapy; telehealth; transdiagnostic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36779,""
"[Effectiveness of the anxiolytic Anvifen in the treatment of post-COVID brain fog]","To determine the significance of anxiety disorder and comorbid disorders in patients with post-covid brain fog, to determine the effectiveness of the GABAergic nootropic drug with an anxiolytic effect - Anvifen. 92 post-COVID-19 patients with no organic brain damage who complain of brain fog 12 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Group 1 (<i>n</i>=40; 43.4Ã‚Â±4.5 years) were treated at home; group 2 (<i>n</i>=32; 44.9Ã‚Â±5.5 years) were treated in a hospital without oxygen support; group 3 (<i>n</i>=20; 45.1Ã‚Â±4.8 years) were treated in a hospital with oxygen support. Assessment scales: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA); Trail Making Test part B (TMT-B); a scoring questionnaire for the subjective characteristics of sleep; Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). According to the indicated scales, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups, therefore, the data of all patients were combined into one group, the indicators were compared before and after treatment (Anvifen 500 mg three times a day for 21 days). Results before/after treatment: HADS anxiety 10.5 [8.5;12]/7 [5;8] (<i>p</i>=0.000025); HADS depression 5 [4; 7] / 4 [4; 6] (<i>p</i>=0.00003); MoCA 22 [21; 22] / 25 [24; 26] (<i>p</i>=0.00001); TMT-B 281 [279; 290] sec / 231 [220; 236] sec (<i>p</i>=0.00001); FAS 27 [23; 31] / 20 [23; 31] (<i>p</i>=0.00001); questionnaire for scoring the subjective characteristics of sleep 15 [15; 16] / 25 [25; 26] (<i>p</i>=0.00001); SF-36 Physical Health 43.8 [42.3; 47.4] / 53.8 [52.3; 20] (<i>p</i>=0.00001); SF-36 Mental Health 34 [32.5; 35] / 47 [45.5; 48] (<i>p</i>=0.00001). The authors conclude that anxiety disorder and asthenia play an important role in the pathogenesis of post-COVID brain fog syndrome. Anvifen effectiveness is considered from the point of view of the participation of GABAergic structures in the pathogenesis of the phenomenon under study.

"[Features of psychoemotional status in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic]","To study the features of the psychoemotional status in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in the long term after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify factors affecting the development of clinically pronounced anxiety and depressive disorders. Psychoemotional status was analyzed in 151 patients in the long term after PTE using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Assessment (GAD-7) and the Beck Depression Inventory. The number of patients who underwent COVID-19 was recorded and the functional status scale of the patient who underwent COVID-19 (PCFS) was evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of clinically pronounced depression and GAD in the long-term period after surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinically significant GAD and depression in the long-term period after PTE during the COVID-19 pandemic were observed in 11 and 17.8% of patients, respectively. Clinically pronounced depression is associated with older age, chronic cerebral circulatory insufficiency and pronounced post COVID-19 disorders of functional status according to PCFS. The development of GAD symptoms is influenced by cardiopulmonary insufficiency in the hospital period after PTE. The combination of anxiety and depression symptoms is correlated with older age. In patients in the long term after PTE during the COVID-19 pandemic, the symptoms of GAD and depression were detected in 11 and 17.8% of cases, respectively. The complicated course of cardiac surgery has shown a negative impact on the development of GAD in the long term after surgery. The factors influencing the development of clinically pronounced depression were older age, chronic cerebral circulatory insufficiency and pronounced post COVID-19 disorders of functional status.

"Intensive care unit-acquired weakness: From molecular mechanisms to its impact in COVID-2019","Intensive Care Unit-Acquired Weakness (ICU-AW) is a generalized and symmetric neuromuscular dysfunction associated with critical illness and its treatments. Its incidence is approximately 80% in intensive care unit patients, and it manifests as critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and muscle atrophy. Intensive care unit patients can lose an elevated percentage of their muscle mass in the first days after admission, producing short- and long-term sequelae that affect patients' quality of life, physical health, and mental health. In 2019, the world was faced with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. COVID-19 produces severe respiratory disorders, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, which increases the risk of developing ICU-AW. COVID-19 patients treated in intensive care units have shown early diffuse and symmetrical muscle weakness, polyneuropathy, and myalgia, coinciding with the clinical presentation of ICU-AW. Besides, these patients require prolonged intensive care unit stays, invasive mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit pharmacological therapy, which are risk factors for ICU-AW. Thus, the purposes of this review are to discuss the features of ICU-AW and its effects on skeletal muscle. Further, we will describe the mechanisms involved in the probable development of ICU-AW in severe COVID-19 patients.","Gonzalez, Abrigo, Achiardi, Simon, Cabello-Verrugio","https://doi.org/10.4081/ejtm.2022.10511","20220829","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36782,""
"Pregnant in a Pandemic: Connecting Perceptions of Uplifts and Hassles to Mental Health","How women experience pregnancy as uplifting or a hassle is related to their mental and physical health and birth outcomes. Pregnancy during a pandemic introduces new hassles, but may offer benefits that could affect how women perceive their pregnancy. Surveying 118 ethnically and racially diverse pregnant women, we explore (1) women's traditional and pandemic-related pregnancy uplifts and hassles and (2) how these experiences of pregnancy relate to their feelings of loneliness, positivity, depression, and anxiety. Regressions show that women who experience more intense feelings of uplifts than hassles also feel more positive, less lonely, and have better mental health. Findings suggest that focusing on positive aspects of being pregnant, in general and during a pandemic, might be beneficial for pregnant women's mental health.","Reich, Tulagan, Dahlin, Labaff, Dutt, Rahmani","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591053221120115","20220829","COVID-19; hassles; loneliness; mental health; positivity; pregnancy; uplifts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36783,""

"""Sleep Quality and Depression Level in Nurses in COVID-19 Pandemic""","The COVID-19 spread rapidly all over the world and pandemic process has negatively affected nurses. Sleep disorders and depression are among these negative effects. Managers' awareness of problems experienced by nurses and taking precautions will increase employee and patient satisfaction and provide quality patient care. The study was conducted in descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational design to explain nurses' sleep quality and depression levels and relationship between them during the COVID-19 pandemic with 142 nurses who completed Personel Information Form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Beck Depression Index (BDI). Sleep quality of nurses (64.8%) was poor, 33.1% had depression, and high school education, having a chronic illness and PSQI score increased the risk of depression level of nurses.

"Emotional and Behavioral Health among Portuguese Toddlers during the COVID-19 Crisis: The Impact of Social Isolation and Caregiving Distress","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in the lives of families with young children. The present study aimed to explore whether child social isolation due to the COVID-19 crisis was associated with toddlers' emotional and behavioral health (EBH) and whether this association was moderated by caregiving distress, during the second mandatory lockdown in Portugal. Participants included 315 toddlers and their primary caregivers. Caregivers were invited to complete a set of questionnaires in order to report about toddlers' social isolation from other significant family members, other children, and activities outside the house, and to provide ratings of caregiving distress and toddlers' EBH. Family socioeconomic factors, including stressors resulted from the pandemic, were also measured. Significant interaction effects, independent of child sex and sociodemographic factors, between COVID-19-related social isolation and caregiving distress emerged in the prediction of toddlers' EBH: COVID-19-related social isolation was found to be a significant predictor of both emotional/behavioral competencies and problems, but only among toddlers exposed to higher levels of caregiving distress. This study evidences the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the functioning of Portuguese families and toddlers' EBH. It emphasizes the importance for policies to consider the implications of the COVID-19 crisis for young children, and to provide psychosocial support to families in order to reduce caregiving distress and, thus, prevent children's mental health problems.","Toscano, Lopes, Ramos, Baptista","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12187-022-09964-y","20220829","COVID-19; Caregiving distress; Emotional/behavioral health; Social isolation; Toddlers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36786,""
"Multimorbidity and Mental Health Trajectories Among Middle-Aged and Older US Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Findings From the COVID-19 Coping Study","This study aimed to examine the associations between multimorbidity at the COVID-19 pandemic onset and subsequent longitudinal trajectories of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and loneliness in middle-aged and older adults over a 12-month follow-up. Data were from monthly online questionnaires in the COVID-19 Coping Study of U.S. adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55 from April/May 2020 through April/May 2021 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦4,024). Multimorbidity was defined as having Ã¢â€°Â¥2 versus &lt;2 chronic conditions at baseline. Mental health outcomes were assessed monthly as depressive symptoms (8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), anxiety symptoms (5-item Beck Anxiety Inventory), and loneliness (3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale). We used multivariable-adjusted population- and attrition-weighted mixed-effects linear models to examine the longitudinal associations between multimorbidity and mental health symptoms. Multimorbidity at the pandemic onset was associated with elevated depressive (<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦0.37; 95% CI: 0.16-0.59) and anxiety (<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦0.39; 95% CI: 0.15-0.62) symptoms at baseline. Changes in symptoms for all three mental health outcomes were nonlinear over time, with worsening symptoms over the first 6 months of the pandemic (April/May to September/October 2020), followed by improvement in symptoms over the subsequent 6 months (September/October 2020 to April/May 2021). Middle-aged and older adults with multimorbidity experienced faster rates of change in anxiety symptoms and loneliness than those without multimorbidity, with persistently elevated mental health symptomatology throughout the follow-up. Results highlight the unique and persistent mental health risks experienced by middle-aged and older adults with multimorbidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The observed improvements in symptoms underscore the mental resilience of these individuals, indicating their adaptation to the ongoing pandemic.","Cheng, Wagner, O'Shea, Joseph, Finlay, Kobayashi","https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igac047","20220829","Depression and anxiety; Loneliness; Multiple chronic conditions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36787,""
"Characteristics of Patients with Non-Cancer Pain and Perceived Severity of COVID-19 Related Stress","Synopsis Patients with non-cancer pain reported increased pain and pain interference during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined if pain, prescription opioid use, and comorbidities were associated with perceived COVID-19-related stress as the pandemic peaked. Analysis of survey data revealed that depression/anxiety, pain severity, and pain interference were most strongly and consistently associated with greater stress due to COVID-19 related changes in lifestyle, worsening of emotional/mental health and worsening pain. Identifying specific stressful experiences that most impacted patients with non-cancer pain may help target public health and treatment interventions. During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with chronic pain reported increased pain severity and interference. This study measured the association between pain, prescription opioid use, and comorbidities with perceived COVID-19-related stress as the pandemic peaked in the United States. From 9/2020 to 3/2021, the first 149 subjects from a prospective cohort study of non-cancer pain, completed a survey which contained the Complementary and Integrative Research (CAIR) Pandemic Impact Questionnaire (C-PIQ). Respondents also reported whether the pandemic has contributed to their pain or opioid use. Bivariate comparisons explored patient characteristics with each CAIR domain. Respondents mean age was 54.6 (Ã‚Â±11.3) years, 69.8% were female, 64.6% were White. Respondent characteristics were not associated with reading/watching/thinking about the pandemic or with worry about health. Depression/anxiety (p=0.003), using any prescription opioid in the prior three months (p=0.009), higher morphine milligram equivalent used (p=0.005), higher pain severity (p=0.011), and higher pain interference (p=0.0004) were all positively and significantly associated with moderate to severe stress due to COVID-19 related lifestyle changes. Depression/anxiety, pain severity, and pain interference were positively associated with COVID-19-related worsening emotional/mental health. Depression/anxiety were significantly (p&lt;0.0001) associated with reporting that the pandemic made their pain worse. Depression, anxiety, pain severity, and pain interference were most strongly and consistently associated with COVID-19 changes in way of life, worsening of emotional/mental health, and worsening pain.

"The Relationship between Exercise Behavior and Mental Health during the COVID-19 Epidemic: Research Based on the Weibo Exercise Behavior User Dictionary","In the context of COVID-19, people face conditions of great stress and are susceptible to negative emotions such as worry, fear, and doubt. Therefore, the focus of epidemic prevention should be on mental health as well as physical health. It is important to pay attention to people's mental health while mitigating and controlling the epidemic. As an intervention to improve mental health, exercise behavior has attracted increasing attention from scholars due to its convenience and low cost. Therefore, the goal of this paper was to investigate the differences between characteristics related to linguistic expression and mental health indicators among different groups of Weibo users by constructing a Weibo exercise behavior user lexicon to explore the influence of exercise behavior on mental health. This study developed a user dictionary of exercise behavior, classified Sina Weibo users' exercise behavior, and established relevant systems to uncover the expressive characteristics of psychological vocabulary and behavioral vocabulary to explore the differences in expressive features related to psychological and behavioral vocabulary and mental health indicators among users who engage in different forms of exercise behavior during the period of COVID-19. As a result of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) conducted during the COVID-19 epidemic, (1) based on the constructed user lexicon of motion behavior in Weibo, the classification program exhibited good performance; (2) there were significant differences in the expressions of some lexical features among users who exhibited different motor behaviors; and (3) both nonphysical exercise and physical exercise behavior had positive relationships with some mental health indicators, but the mechanism associated with nonphysical exercise requires further exploration. This study provides a scientific online evaluation methodology and support for research concerning exercise and mental health during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Wang, Wang, Yuan, Yang, Wang, Sun, Ma, Li, Fu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03613-x","20220829","Big data; Exercise behavior; Mental health; User dictionary","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36789,""
"Will COVID-19 accelerate telecommuting? A cross-country evaluation for Israel and Czechia","The COVID-19 crisis has forced many people to work from home, rather than at their regular workplace. This paper aims to assess the impact of the pandemic on telecommuting and commuting behavior after the end of the crisis: Will people embrace teleworking and reduce commuting, even to some extent, or will they resume their pre-pandemic work patterns? This study, implementing a cross-country survey from Israel and Czechia, combines data regarding <i>revealed preferences</i> about work habits before and during the pandemic and <i>stated intentions</i> data regarding anticipated work patterns when life returns to ""normal"" after the pandemic. Two models were used for the data analysis, one addressing factors that affect the increased/decreased teleworking trend and the other addressing factors that affect the frequency of actual commutes. The results reveal that most respondents (62% in Israel and 68% in Czechia) will maintain the same telecommuting/working from home balance. About 19% of respondents in both countries expressed their intention to reduce the number of commuting days, while 6% stated they would increase out-of-home days. However, these estimates rely only on workers' expectations not accounting for employers' point of view and other constraints they may have. Not accounting for potential bias, a moderate reduction of 6.5% and 8.7% (in Israel and in Czechia, respectively) in the number of commuting trips is expected in the post-pandemic era. The anticipated decrease in commuting days is accompanied by an increase in teleworking: from 10% to 14% among those who work more than 20 hours a week (in both countries) and a drop in the rate of those who telework five hours or less a week (down from 73% to 63% in Israel and from 76% to 70% in Czechia). Self-employment, travel time to work, working solely on premise during the lockdown, and personal preferences regarding telework versus working away from home were found to significantly contribute to a decrease in the number of commuting days and to an increase in teleworking. An interesting finding is the high probability of increased teleworking among people who teleworked for the first time during the lockdown or who increased their teleworking time during the lockdown. This indicates that the teleworking experience due to the pandemic has enabled some people to view working from home as viable. Although, overall, the change in working habits does not seem dramatic, our results suggest that hybrid schemes for combining on premise and telework are expected to be adopted by some sectors.","Kogus, BrÃ…Â¯hovÃƒÂ¡ FoltÃƒÂ½novÃƒÂ¡, Gal-Tzur, Shiftan, VejchodskÃƒÂ¡, Shiftan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.011","20220829","COVID-19; cross-country analysis; global pandemic crisis; ordinal regression; telecommuting; travel behavior/activity; working from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36790,""
"Rewriting the script: How COVID-19 affected the relation between intrinsic aspirations and depressive symptoms","Self-determination theory proposes that intrinsic aspirations protect against negative mental health outcomes by satisfying people's basic psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness, and competence. The present study investigated this relationship using two four-wave prospective longitudinal studies which followed undergraduate students across the Canadian academic calendar (September to May). The first was conducted across 2018-19 and the second across 2019-20. By comparing these two samples, we examined whether baseline levels of intrinsic aspirations moderated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the development of depressive symptoms. Three main findings emerged, the first being that students reported higher levels of depressive symptoms in Spring 2020 than in Spring 2019. Second, students with more intrinsic aspirations in the pre-pandemic sample (2018-19) experienced fewer depressive symptoms from December to May while students with more intrinsic aspirations in the pandemic sample (2019-20) experienced more depressive symptoms during this period. Lastly, the latter relationship was mediated by need frustration, whereby students with higher levels of intrinsic aspirations experienced greater need frustration during the pandemic year. Together, these findings suggest that although intrinsic aspirations typically protect against negative psychological outcomes, the unique need frustrating context of the pandemic made them a risk factor for depression.","Avery, Leboeuf, Holding, Moore, Levine, Koestner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2022.111869","20220829","Basic psychological needs; COVID-19 pandemic; Depressive symptoms; Intrinsic aspirations; Self-determination theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36791,""
"Overcoming Clinician Technophobia: What We Learned from Our Mass Exposure to Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Mental health clinicians have migrated to telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic and have reported their use of telehealth may be permanent. Understanding how stakeholders overcame hesitancy regarding the use of telehealth can potentially reveal how stakeholders can adopt future clinical technologies. The exposure therapy conceptual framework provides one explanation of how mental health clinicians can face their concerns about technologies that promise to improve clinical outcomes and worker well-being. We review available literature published since the start of the pandemic on the extent to which clinicians migrated to telehealth and their reactions to their transitions. In particular, we review available literature that describes negative attitudes and worries by clinicians as one of many barriers of telehealth implementation. We introduce the perspective that the necessary transition to telehealth at the start of the pandemic functioned as an exposure exercise that changed many clinicians' cognitive and emotional reactions to the use of telehealth technologies. Next, we provide guidance on how clinicians can continue taking an exposure approach to learning emerging technologies that are safe and can benefit all stakeholders. Clinicians can now reflect on how they overcame hesitancy regarding telehealth during the pandemic and identify how to build on that new learning by applying strategies used in exposure therapy. The future of clinical work will increasingly require mental health clinicians to better serve their patient populations and enhance their own well-being by overcoming <i>technophobia</i>, a broad term for any level of hesitancy, reluctance, skepticism, worry, anxiety, or fear of implementing technology.","Sherrill, Wiese, Abdullah, Arriaga","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41347-022-00273-3","20220829","COVID-19; Exposure therapy; Future of work; Pandemic; Technology acceptance; Technology integration; Technophobia; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36792,""
"Application of Traditional Vaccine Development Strategies to SARS-CoV-2","Over the past 150 years, vaccines have revolutionized the relationship between people and disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, technologies such as mRNA vaccines have received significant attention due to their novelty and successes. However, more traditional vaccine development platforms have also been applied against SARS-CoV-2, yielding important tools in the worldwide fight against the virus. A variety of approaches have been used to develop COVID-19 vaccines that are now authorized for use in countries around the world. In this review, we highlight strategies that focus on the viral capsid outwards, rather than on the nucleic acids inside. Such approaches broadly fall into two categories: whole-virus vaccines and subunit vaccines. Whole-virus vaccine approaches use the virus itself, either in an inactivated or attenuated state. Subunit vaccines isolate an immunogenic component of the virus using various strategies that is then introduced through vaccination. We highlight specific vaccine candidates that utilize these approaches in different ways. In a companion manuscript, we review the more recent and novel development of nucleic-acid based vaccine technologies. We further consider the role that these COVID-19 vaccine development programs have played in providing immunity to people around the world. Well-established vaccine technologies have proved especially important because of the significant role they have played in COVID-19 vaccine access at the global scale. Vaccine development programs that use established platforms have been undertaken in a much wider range of countries than those using nucleic-acid-based technologies, which have been led by wealthy Western countries. Therefore, these vaccine platforms, while less cutting-edge on the biotechnology side, have proven to be extremely important to the management of SARS-CoV-2.","Rando, Lordan, Lee, Naik, Wellhausen, Sell, Kolla, Consortium, Gitter, Greene","https://www.google.com/search?q=Application+of+Traditional+Vaccine+Development+Strategies+to+SARS-CoV-2.","20220829","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36793,""
"The effects of racism and resilience on Black stroke- survivor quality of life: Study protocol and rationale for a mixed-methods approach","Stroke, a life-threatening stressor, often negatively impacts stroke-survivor (SS) quality of life (QoL). Annual age-adjusted incidence and death rates for stroke are significantly higher among Black Americans than among White Americans. Racism, a significant stressor, occurs at structural, cultural, and interpersonal levels and contributes to health disparities for Black SS. Resilience, a dynamic process of positive adaptation to significant stress, is impacted by factors or resources both internal and external to the individual. This study aims to examine the effects of experiences of racism and resilience on Black SS QoL during early stroke recovery. This article presents the study protocol. This will be a prospective observational mixed-methods study. Black community-dwelling adults who are within 4 weeks of a stroke will be eligible for inclusion. Baseline measures will include the exposure variables of experiences of racism and resilience. Covariates measured at baseline include sociodemographic variables (age, sex, marital status, education, income, health insurance, employment status, number of people in household, residential address), clinical variables (date and type of stroke, inferred Modified Rankin Scale, anxiety and depression screening), and psychosocial variables (COVID-19 stress, perceived stress, mindfulness). The outcome variable (QoL) will be assessed 6-months post-stroke. Multiple-level linear regression models will be used to test the direct effects of experiences of racism, and the direct and indirect effects of resilience, on QoL. Qualitative data will be collected <i>via</i> focus groups and analyzed for themes of racism, resilience, and QoL. Racism can compound the stress exerted by stroke on Black SS. This study will occur during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the aftermath of calls for social justice for Black Americans. Experiences of racism will be measured with instruments for both ""everyday"" discrimination and vigilance. Sociodemographic variables will be operationalized to assess specific social determinants of health that intersect with structural racism. Because of the long-standing history of racism in the United States of America (USA), cultural influences and access to resources are central to the consideration of individual-level resilience in Black SS. Study results may inform the development of interventions to support Black SS QoL through enhanced resilience.","Love, Brooks, Cox, Okpala, Cooksey, Cohen, Sharrief","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2022.885374","20220829","quality of life; racism; resilience; stress; stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36794,""
"Post COVID-19 Infection Psychosis: Could SARS-CoV-2 Virus Infection Be a Neuropsychiatric Condition That Triggers Psychotic Disorders? - A Case-Based Short Review","Corona virus (COVID-19) is an epidemy of respiratory disease caused by a novel corona virus and it was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global health pandemic emergency. Due to the neuropsychiatric manifestation of Covid-19 that have been associated with psychotic disorders, in this paper we choose to present a case from ""Elena Doamna"" Psychiatric Hospital from Galati, Romania and to correlate it with other cases from literature in a mini review presentation. In our paper, we present the case of a patient of 44-year-old men, with no past psychiatric history whose behavior included psycho-motor agitation, perception and thinking disorders, disorganized behaviour, attempted suicide by stabbing. The last perspectives from the two years of pandemic together with psychiatric disease linked the virus infections with psychosis to the main concern that Covid-19 could determine psychiatric disorders. There were also presented same literature studies of patients with no personal pathological history in the psychiatric field which developed psychiatric disorders after COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 has a psychological impact on the mental health status of the worldwide and, especially when it is associated with psychotic symptoms and can affect the quality-of-life. In some cases, the virus affected the brain and as a result, the psychosis symptoms could be an emerging phenomenon associated with the corona virus.

"COVID-19 Related Emotional Stress and Bedtime Procrastination Among College Students in China: A Moderated Mediation Model","Although bedtime procrastination is prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about the relationship between COVID-19 related emotional stress and bedtime procrastination. Therefore, we investigated the correlation between COVID-19 related emotional stress and bedtime procrastination and examined the mediating role of negative affect and the moderating role of rumination among Chinese college students. A multicenter, cross-sectional, and quantitative research was conducted in China from August 11, 2021, to August 27, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sampling method used in the study is the convenience sampling method. A total of 913 college students (aged 18-24 years) participated and completed online self-reported questionnaires. Their levels of COVID-19 related emotional stress, negative affect, rumination, and bedtime procrastination were measured by the Coronavirus Stress Measure, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Ruminative Responses Scale, and the Bedtime Procrastination Scale, respectively. The data were analyzed using Pearson correlations and moderated mediation analysis. COVID-19 related emotional stress was positively associated with bedtime procrastination. Meanwhile, the association could be mediated by negative affect (Effect = 0.33, Boot 95% <i>CI</i> = [0.26, 0.39]) and moderated by rumination (Effect = 0.05, Boot 95% <i>CI</i> = [0.03, 0.07]) through its moderation in the link between COVID-19 related emotional stress and negative affect. This indicated that the mediation effect of negative affect was stronger in college students with high levels of rumination than in those with low levels of rumination. The findings of this study shed light on a correlation between COVID-19 related emotional stress and bedtime procrastination. Moreover, this study suggests that interventions could be targeted at alleviating negative affect and rumination to reduce the bedtime procrastination of college students with high levels of COVID-19 related emotional stress.","Deng, Ye, Yang","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S371292","20220829","COVID-19; bedtime procrastination; emotional stress; negative affect; rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36796,""
"Remember the past, plan for the future: How interactions between risk perception and behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic can inform future Canadian public health policy","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the implementation of numerous temporary public health policies, including social distancing, masking, and movement limitations. These types of measures require most citizens to follow them to be effective at a population level. This study examined population adherence to emergency public health measures using early data collected in the Spring of 2020, when all Canadian jurisdictions were under relatively strict measures. In total, 1,369 participants completed an online questionnaire package to assess adherence, perceptions of government response, and perceptions of COVID-19 risk. Results indicated that most Canadians were pleased with the government's handling of the early phases of the pandemic and immediately engaged new public health mandates. Willingness to change behaviors was unrelated to satisfaction with the government response. Similarly, behavioral adherence was also unrelated to satisfaction with government, or personal risk perceptions; however, adherence to public health guidelines was related to elevated psychological distress. As the pandemic continues, public health officials must balance the mental health of the population with the physical health concerns posed by COVID-19 when applying public health mandates.","Law, Wilbiks, Roach, Best","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.784955","20220829","COVID-19; behavioral adherence; collective behavior; public health policy; public mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36797,""
"Acute and chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients: A qualitative review","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th, 2020. It has had unprecedented adverse effects on healthcare systems, economies, and societies globally. SARS-CoV-2 is not only a threat to physical health but has also been shown to have a severe impact on neuropsychiatric health. Many studies and case reports across countries have demonstrated insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and cognitive change in COVID-19 patients during the acute phase of the infection, as well as in apparently recovered COVID-19 patients.

"The effect of living alone on the mental health of the economically active floating population during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic broke out at the end of 2019 in China. Through a strict Zero-Tolerant strategy, the pandemic was nearly controlled in the first half of 2020, and production resumed in most regions of China. A survey was performed to explore the effect of living alone on the mental health of the economically active floating population (EAFP) in developed regions of China during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online cross-sectional survey was conducted in work resumed time in the first half of 2020 in several developed regions of China. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) is used to assess the mental health status. The Multi-level ordinary least squares regression was performed on a total of 4,405 samples to examine the relationships between living alone and the participants' mental health. Many participants lived alone during the COVID 19 pandemic. Living alone is negatively associated with mental health (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) for EAFP. The effect of living alone on mental health is stronger for females than males and for people with a lover than those without a lover. It is also stronger for the seniors (aged 56-70) than younger ones (aged 16-35), and has no significant influence on the middle-aged population (36-55). The effect is significant for self-employed people and employees, and is not significant for unemployed ones. Furthermore, the right amount of online entertainment can lower the effect of living alone on mental health. The results show that living alone strongly affected the mental health of EAFP during the COVID 19 pandemic. Moreover, this effect has generated new inequalities among different groups. In addition, to provide more public services to support people against the pandemic, the government should provide more psychological support to those who live alone and guide them to establish a correct view of marriage and love to reduce living alone negative effect and prevent them from mental health problems.","Xu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.931425","20220829","COVID-19 pandemic; EAFP; GHQ-12; living alone; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36800,""
"Psychological health in COVID-19 patients after discharge from an intensive care unit","Along with physical changes, psychological changes are detectable in patients with COVID-19. In these patients, the stressful experience of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization may aggravate psychological conditions. Our study examines the short- and long-term psychological consequences of COVID-19 in ICU patients. COVID-19 patients completed the self-rating questionnaires <i>Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale</i> (K10), <i>Perceived Stress Scale-10</i> (PSS), <i>Impact of Event Scale Revised (</i>IES-R), and <i>Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (</i>PTGI) and were clinically interviewed 1 and 6 months after discharge. Altered behavioral-psychological symptoms and patients' strategies (adaptive vs. maladaptive) for <i>coping</i> with stress during and after hospitalization were coded during clinical interviews. Between 20 and 30% of patients showed moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety and perceived stress 1 and 6 months after discharge. Sleep problems, difficulty concentrating, confusion in placing events, and fear of reinfection were observed in many (6-17%) patients. At 6 months, only 7% of patients showed PTSD symptoms, and 50% showed post-traumatic growth in the ""appreciation of life"" sub-scale. Finally, 32% of subjects were classified as ""maladaptive coping patients,"" and 68% as ""adaptive coping patients."" Patients who adopted ""adaptive"" coping strategies showed significantly lower levels of anxious-depressive symptoms and perceived stress when compared to subjects with ""maladaptive"" strategies at both time points. Coping strategy had no effect on PTSD symptoms or post-traumatic growth at 6 months. These findings clarify the short- and long-term psychological effects of intensive care due to COVID-19 infection and demonstrate that patient characteristics, particularly strategies for coping with stress, seem to play a critical role in psychological outcomes.","Carola, Vincenzo, Morale, Pelli, Rocco, Nicolais","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.951136","20220829","COVID-19; K10; SARS-CoV 2; clinical psychology; intensive care unit; perceived stress; state anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36801,""
"The coronavirus pandemic: Psychosocial burden, risk-perception, and attitudes in the Austrian population and its relation to media consumption","The aim was to assess the psychosocial burden, risk-perception and attitudes regarding the coronavirus pandemic among the Austrian population after the second infection wave in Austria. A self-designed questionnaire was available online from 17th January to 19th February 2021. Knowledge, attitudes, fears, and psychosocial burdens were collected in a comprehensive convenience sample of 3,848 adults from the Austrian general population. 67.2% reported their greatest fear was that a close relative could be infected; the fear of dying from COVID-19 oneself, however, was mentioned least frequently (15.2%). Isolation from family and friends (78%), homeschooling for parents (68.4%), and economic consequences (67.7%) were perceived as most stressful factors during the pandemic. Personal risk for COVID-19-associated (ICU) hospitalization was overestimated 3- to 97-fold depending on age group. Depending on the media mainly consumed, the sample could be divided into two subsamples whose estimates were remarkably opposite to each other, with regular public media users overestimating hospitalization risk substantially more. The results show a high degree of psychosocial burden in the Austrian population and emphasize the need for more objective risk communication in order to counteract individually perceived risk and consequently anxiety. Altogether data call for a stronger focus and immediate action for supporting mental well-being and general health in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.","Schabus, Eigl, Widauer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.921196","20220829","COVID-19; fear; media consumption; mental health; pandemic; risk assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36802,""
"Cognitive functions and anxiety among blue-collar workers in hospitals during COVID-19 pandemic","The rapid spread of COVID-19 poses a major threat to public health worldwide. Hospital blue-collar workers, like other health care workers, may be under severe physical and psychological stress. This psychological distress is mainly described as symptoms of anxiety and depression, stress and cognitive function. This study aimed to investigate the effects of anxiety on cognitive function among laundry and sterilization center workers in 4 hospitals during COVID-19 pandemic. This study has a cross-sectional design and it was conducted among health service workers who were occupied in health facilities (laundry and sterilization center) in 4 hospitals. In the present study, two questionnaires and a test were used to collect the data included a general health questionnaire (GHQ-28), a health anxiety index questionnaire (HAI-18) and a cognitive function test. Descriptive statistics and Spearman correlation coefficient by SPSS version 19 were used. The results showed that the overall score of coronavirus anxiety in male and female workers was 38.72 Ã‚Â± 5.94 and 40.92 Ã‚Â± 4.11, respectively. The correlation between auditory attention and coronavirus anxiety is moderate and has a negative trend (<i>P</i> = 0.050, <i>n</i> = 50, and r = -0.315). Workers with higher anxiety expressed lower auditory attention. Also, correlation between visual attention and coronavirus anxiety was weak and negative (<i>P</i> = 0.032, <i>n</i> = 50, and r = -0.179). This study revealed that cognitive and psychological aspects of mental health can be affected by COVID-19 exposure and its due anxiety in blue-collar workers in hospitals. These findings indicate that purposeful supportive interventions should be implemented to promote workers' health and cognitive function.","Mohammadi, Ibrahimi Ghavamabadi, Silavi, Dehaghi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.869699","20220829","cognitive; coronavirus; health; hospital; workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36803,""
"Psychosocial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Panama","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions on mental health is being studied. To analyze the psychosocial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in adults residing in Panama. A community sample of 480 adult residents of Panama completed a survey that included sociodemographic questions, COVID-19 related questions (e.g., health concerns regarding the virus, knowledge and behaviors in biosafety) and scales of stress, anxiety, depression, prosocial behavior, resilience, perceived social support, and insomnia. Most of the participants (&gt;60%) reported being negatively affected by the pandemic. Women experienced greater depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms than men, and age was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Self-perceived health status and self-perceived social support were negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Self-perceived social isolation was positively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Psychiatric illness and insomnia were positively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, whereas psychological resilience was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. These results corroborate other studies regarding COVID-19 and mental health. This study highlights the need for specific prevention and intervention mechanisms related to the COVID-19 pandemic in different population groups.

"Generation COVID-19 and bodily disorders: Hyperbolic narratives and a developmental psychopathology perspective","Starting from spring 2020, newspapers headlines and studies have suggested that the COVID-19 pandemics had a negative impact especially on the mental health of children and adolescents, so that terms like ""lost generation"" or ""generation COVID-19"" have been used to define youth in time of pandemic crisis. Similarly, international health agencies reported an increase in depression and anxiety among adolescents in COVID-19 time, but also a rise in bodily disorders, such as non-suicidal self-injury and eating disorders. However, scientific data on this matter are not as clear as they seem and theoretical-clinical proposals regarding the processes involved are lacking. Focusing specifically on bodily disorders in adolescents during COVID-19, the aim of this perspective paper is to review this issue and propose a novel viewpoint on it. Firstly, data regarding frequency and phenomenology of bodily disorders in adolescence before and during the pandemic will be presented to underline possible discrepancies, gaps, or hyperbolic descriptions in the literature published after the COVID-19 outbreak. Secondly, a specific theoretical-clinical perspective will be proposed, that is, a developmental psychopathology perspective which attempts to frame these phenomena in a more nuanced and complex way, taking into account the role of developmental processes in adolescence age and its difficulties in the specific, subjective life-context of the individual, when intertwining with vulnerability factors and stressful life events. As such, the function of the body for the adolescent as a primary mean for regulating the self-other relationship and developing a greater sense of self-agency will be highlighted. The final objective is to help the clinician in developing both a critical thinking about the data that are shared in public outlets and an intervention that takes into account the complexity of contemporary psychopathological phenomena.","D'Agostino, Gritti, Gagliardi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.976584","20220829","COVID-19; adolescents; bodily disorders; developmental psychopathology; eating disorders; non-suicidal self-injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36805,""
"Working conditions and stressors data during Covid-19 and mental well-being in Iranian healthcare workers","The current Covid-19 pandemic has affected the physical and mental stressors of hospital-based healthcare workers, but the extent of such effects are required to be quantified. This survey looked at data on nurses' perception across teaching hospitals to assess the impacts of Covid-19 on working conditions, exposure to stressors, and mental health symptoms. We implemented a population survey with a cross-sectional design in teaching hospitals affiliated with Medical Sciences Universities in Iran from April to November 2021. Participants were about 1200 health care workers, including hospital nursing staff, assistants, and technicians. Final data were assembled from 831 hospital nurses across surgery, dialysis, intensive care, emergency care, cardiac care, internal medicine, gynecology, and pediatric wards. Self-reported data were collected directly from survey participants. We collected information on variables including gender, marital status, employment status, occupational health training, evaluation of work environment stressors, fear of Covid-19, and occupational burnout constructs, specifically reflecting emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Focus groups of faculties evaluated and edited items to test the content wording and to define the content that are valid measures of the variables. The questionnaires were assessed for their reliability. Manual data entries were double-checked for errors. Data were recorded and categorized consistently to ensure the replicability of the data in the future. Statistical descriptive and analytical analyses were performed on the data. Data reported on the frequencies and mean values of responses and the variations of mental health in terms of worktime schedules. Chi- square, ANOVA, and correlation analyses determined relations between variables. The compiled data shed light on the exposure and response to physical and psychosocial factors and mental health symptoms among nurses during the pandemic. The data files detailed in this article can be further reused to inform workplace determinants of health in hospital settings. The obtained scores and existing dataset on mental health outcomes can help future studies to consider resilience strategies that should be provided among nurses.","Kangarlou, Fatemi, Dehdashti, Paknazar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108551","20220829","Burnout; Data; Health care settings; Occupational risk; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36806,""

The current study aims to examine the association between income and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic by using the data of 9,296 observations from the 2020 China Family Panel Studies. Employing ordinary least squares regression and two-stage least squares regression, we find the significant positive effect of income on Chinese mental health during this pandemic. In addition, the number of cigarettes smoked per day has significant negative effects on mental health. Education level'marriage and exercise frequency have significant positive correlation with mental health. Furthermore, the impact of income on individuals of different groups is heterogeneous during this pandemic. The impact of income for well-educated individuals is less strong than their less-educated counterparts. People who exercise regularly respond less strongly to changes in income than those who do not exercise. Finally, individuals' salary satisfaction and interpersonal relationship are shown to be the potential mechanism for the effect of income on Chinese mental health.","Yang, Hu, Ren, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.977609","20220829","COVID-19; China; income; interpersonal relationship; mental health; salary satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36807,""
"Effects of negative life events on depression in middle school students: The chain-mediating roles of rumination and perceived social support","Negative life events in middle school students have a significant impact on depression. However, the mechanism of this association is not fully understood. This study used rumination and perceived social support as mediating variables to explore the influence of negative life events on depression. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing, a convenient sampling method was adopted to collect information about middle school students in Shandong Province by means of online questionnaire. Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Check List, Ruminative Responses Scale, Perceived Social Support Scale and Children's Depression Inventory were used. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were conducted for four variables of middle school students, including life events, depression, rumination thinking and perceived social support, and the chain mediated effect was tested by using process plug-in. All statistically analysis was conducted by SPSS 23.0. 493 middle school students (16.7000 Ã‚Â± 0.9500 years) including 343 female students (69.6000%) from Shandong Province recruited. Results showed that the total effect between life events and depression was significant (effect = 0.2535, 95%CI: 0.2146, 0.2924). The total indirect effect was significant (effect = 0.1700, 95%CI: 0.1349, 0.2072). The indirect effect was significant (effect = 0.0988, 95%CI: 0.0741, 0.1252) with rumination as the mediating variable. The indirect effect of pathway with perceived social support as the mediating variable was significant (effect = 0.0476, 95%CI: 0.0295, 0.0674). The indirect effect of pathway with rumination and perceived social support as mediating variables was also significant (effect = 0.0236, 95%CI: 0.0147, 0.0339). This study indicated that ruminant thinking and perceived social support had a significant chain mediating effect on adolescents' life events and depression. Life events can not only directly affect depressive emotions, but also indirectly affect depressive emotions by affecting ruminant thinking and perceived social support. The results of this study not only provide new directions for the relationship between life events and depression, but also provide possible approaches for future prevention and intervention of depression in middle school students.","Xia, Han, Cheng, Liu, Wu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.781274","20220829","chain mediation; depression; middle school student; negative life events; perceived social support; rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36808,""
"Impact of closure of educational institutions due to COVID-19 lockdown on overall subjective wellbeing of adolescents and youth: Cross-sectional survey, India","Students were confined to their homes due to the national closure of educational institutions during the COVID 19 pandemic, thus presenting an unprecedented risk to children's education, protection, and wellbeing. This study aimed to understand the determinants of subjective wellbeing of adolescents and youth (aged 11-21 years) during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. A cross-sectional web-based survey was adapted, pre-tested, and finalized to obtain the participant's responses from schools and colleges. Participants aged 11-17 years were engaged through schools.

In logistic regression, middle-age categories (40 to 69 years; OR ranging from 2.32 to 2.58), female sex (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.33-1.48), hospitalization associated with COVID-19 (OR 3.8, 95% CI 3.05-4.73), long (8-30 days, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.31-2.17) or extended hospital stay (30+ days, OR 3.38, 95% CI 2.45-4.67), receipt of mechanical ventilation (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.18-1.74), and several comorbidities including depression (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.40-1.60), chronic lung disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.53-1.74), and obesity (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.16-1.3) were associated with increased likelihood of PASC diagnosis or care at a long-COVID clinic. Characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of PASC diagnosis or care at a long-COVID clinic included younger age (18 to 29 years), male sex, non-Hispanic Black race, and comorbidities such as substance abuse, cardiomyopathy, psychosis, and dementia. More doctors per capita in the county of residence was associated with an increased likelihood of PASC diagnosis or care at a long-COVID clinic.

"Pre-exposure to mRNA-LNP inhibits adaptive immune responses and alters innate immune fitness in an inheritable fashion","Hundreds of millions of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine doses have already been administered to humans. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the immune effects of this platform. The mRNA-LNP-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is highly inflammatory, and its synthetic ionizable lipid component responsible for the induction of inflammation has a long <i>in vivo</i> half-life. Since chronic inflammation can lead to immune exhaustion and non-responsiveness, we sought to determine the effects of pre-exposure to the mRNA-LNP on adaptive immune responses and innate immune fitness. We found that pre-exposure to mRNA-LNPs or LNP alone led to long-term inhibition of the adaptive immune responses, which could be overcome using standard adjuvants. On the other hand, we report that after pre-exposure to mRNA-LNPs, the resistance of mice to heterologous infections with influenza virus increased while <i>Candida albicans</i> decreased. The diminished resistance to <i>Candida albicans</i> correlated with a general decrease in blood neutrophil percentages. Interestingly, mice pre-exposed to the mRNA-LNP platform can pass down the acquired immune traits to their offspring, providing better protection against influenza. In summary, the mRNA-LNP vaccine platform induces long-term unexpected immunological changes affecting both adaptive immune responses and heterologous protection against infections. Thus, our studies highlight the need for more research to determine this platform's true impact on human health. We bring experimental evidence that pre-exposure to mRNA-LNPs or its LNP component affects innate and adaptive immune responses. Pre-exposure to mRNA-LNPs led to long-term inhibition of the adaptive immune responses, which the use of adjuvants could overcome. On the other hand, we report that after pre-exposure to mRNA-LNPs, the resistance of mice to heterologous infections with influenza virus increased while <i>Candida albicans</i> decreased. We also detected a general neutropenia in the mRNA-LNP exposed mice. Interestingly, mice pre-exposed to mRNA-LNPs can pass down the acquired immune traits to their offspring. In summary, the mRNA-LNP vaccine platform induces long-term immunological changes that can affect both adaptive immune responses and heterologous protection against infections, some of which can be inherited by the offspring. More studies are needed to understand the mechanisms responsible for these effects and determine this platform's impact on human health.","Qin, Bouteau, Herbst, IgyÃƒÂ¡rtÃƒÂ³","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.16.484616","20220829","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36811,""
"Mental health needs associated with COVID-19 on the diamond princess cruise ship: A case series recorded by the disaster psychiatric assistance team","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection prevention measures have led to a variety of mental health issues. Although several self-care methods have been recommended for those quarantined, evidence regarding how best to support quarantined people experiencing a mental health crisis is limited.

We were sent to address the mental health issues as the Disaster Psychiatric Assistance Team (DPAT). In the present study, we examined the acute mental health needs of the passengers and crew collected by the DPAT using the standard Emergency Medical Team daily reporting system. We assessed 206 cases (99 men and 107 women) with generic health issues and 127 cases (39 men and 88 women) with mental health issues. Mental health issues including disaster stress-related symptoms were as frequent as physical health events associated with COVID-19. The most significant mental health issue was anxiety, as an acute psychological reaction to the quarantine situation. Women and crews most frequently needed mental health support. Mental health improved in most clients after brief counseling. Although several passengers experienced suicidal ideation, there were no cases of actual suicide attempts during the quarantine period. This case has been regarded as a well-known public health event at the beginning of the COVID-19 era. In addition to physical health support, disaster mental health support was essential to save lives. Our findings may facilitate responses to future quarantines, accidents, and mental health crises.","Tachikawa, Kubo, Gomei, Takahashi, Kawashima, Manaka, Mori, Kondo, Koido, Ishikawa, Otsuru, Nogi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103250","20220829","COVID-19; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; DPAT; DPAT, Disaster Psychiatric Assistance Team; Diamond Princess; Mental health needs; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36812,""
"Prevalence and associated factors for elevated fear and depressive symptoms among the private service holders in Bangladesh during the Covid-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","The ongoing public health emergency has created incredible fear of getting the infection and a terrible psychological burden among all levels. The pandemic has severely affected private job holders' economic status and lifestyle factors in Bangladesh. Here we aimed to assess fear and depressive symptoms among private job holders in Bangladesh during the Covid-19 pandemic and associated risk factors. We conducted this online cross-sectional survey between January 15, 2021, and March 15, 2021, among 510 private job holders aged above 18 years. We followed the convenience sampling method for data collection. We assessed sociodemographic factors and two psychometric parameters. We applied the Fear of Covid-19 Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to assess increased fear and depressive symptoms, respectively. Chi-square test, independent sample t-test, and binary logistic regression analysis were performed for data analysis. The prevalence of increased fear and depressive symptoms were 86.27% and 42.16%, respectively. Factors associated with increased fear among private job holders during COVID-19 were economic class, obesity, on-time salary, company's downsizing policy, salary reduction, home office, and transportation facilities. However, depressive symptoms were associated with marital status, education level, residence area, the organizational practice of health safety rules, company performance, on-time salary, health insurance, downsizing, salary reduction policy, organization type, transportation, and mental health support at work. The present study also noticed some interrelations among the above factors with mental health issues. Based on the present findings, we recommend actionable items to improve the mental health of private job holders in Bangladesh due to the ongoing pandemic. Authorities can develop mental health support programs and efficient Covid-19 response systems. The policymakers and regulatory bodies might take some initiatives to promote mental health in the private sector in Bangladesh.","Islam, Nahar, Hossain, Hossain, Shahriar, Islam, Bhuiyan","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.795","20220829","CovidÃ¢â‚¬Â19; depressive symptoms; fear; mental health; private job; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36813,""
"Anxiety and depression levels of healthcare workers during Covid-19 pandemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), which causes a pandemic in the world, has started to appear in turkey since march 2020. Healthcare workers are at the top of the groups most at risk for covid-19 infection, which can have a negative impact on psychological state. It was aimed to evaluate anxiety and depression levels among healthcare workers. this cross-sectional study performed via an online survey in april 2020. Participants answered questions about sociodemographic features, personal views and experiences about covid-19 and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads). A total of 300 healthcare workers,193 men and 107 women, participated in the survey. According to hads, 44.6% of participants scored above anxiety and 68.2% scored above depression cut-off points. Being younger than 50 and taking care of covid-19 patients in hospitals were independently associated with anxiety risk. Female gender, young age (less than 50) and having comorbidity were independent risk factors for depression. Healthcare workers were at high risk of anxiety and depression during covid-19 outbreak. For this reason, psychological support should be given, especially to the group with high risk.","Turan, Demirci, GÃƒÂ¼ntÃƒÂ¼lÃƒÂ¼, AkÃƒÂ§ay, AktÃƒÂ¼rk, BilaÃƒÂ§eroÃ„Å¸lu, CoÃ…Å¸kun, KÃƒÂ¶ktÃƒÂ¼rk, Mirici, Ãƒâ€“zdemir, Ã…Å¾en, Yilmaz","https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v22i1.62","20220829","Healthcare workers; anxiety; covid-19; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36814,""
"A gender comparison of psychological distress among medical students in Nigeria during the Coronavirus pandemic: a cross-sectional survey","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic as a large scale stressor could have negative effects on the mental health of medical students. Since gender differences in mental health may exist, it is important to see if a large scale stressor like the pandemic may be associated with variances in the psychological distress between both genders. To assess and compare the psychological distress of male and female medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 1010 medical students from three universities in southwestern Nigeria within the first six months of the first reported case of the COVID-19 pandemic. The respondents were purposively selected. Data was obtained online on participants' demographic and psychological distress using the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12). Data was analyzed using the SPSS version 21, student t and chi-square tests were used to assess gender differences, and multivariate regression to assess the predictors of psychological distress among both genders. p values less than 0.05were considered statistically significant. Overall, female participants (OR=1.455, 95% CI= 1.095-1.936) were twice more likely to have experienced psychological distress than males during the COVID-19 pandemic. Age (OR=0.922, 95% CI= 0.867-0.979), being in pre-clinical years (OR= 1.394, 95% CI= 1.004-1.938), having a family income less than 100,000 naira (OR= 1.379, 95% CI=1.442-6.723) a previous history of mental illness (OR=3.077, 95% CI= 1.430-6.615) and having a relative/acquaintance diagnosed with COVID 19(OR=1.646, 95% CI= 1.062-2.551) were independently associated with psychological distress among the respondents. When comparing both genders, among females, age (OR=0.886, 95% CI= 0.803-0.978), family income less than 100,000 naira (OR=1.898, 95% CI= 1.306-2.759) and a previous history of mental illness (OR=5.266, 95% CI= 1.894-14.635) were associated with psychological distress, while, being in pre-clinical years (OR= 1.713, 95% CI= 1.052-2.790) was associated with psychological distress among males. Females had more psychological distress compared to male students. It is recommended that gender-specific interventions addressing psychological distress among medical students are instituted.","Idowu, Adaramola, Aderounmu, Olugbamigbe, Dada, Osifeso, Ogunnubi, Odukoya","https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v22i1.63","20220829","COVID-19; Psychological distress; gender; medical students; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36815,""
"The perceptions of Brazilian postgraduate students about the impact of COVID-19 on their well-being and academic performance","This study aimed at identifying the perceptions of Brazilian postgraduate students from all over the country on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their academic trajectories. Data from 5985 postgraduate students were collected in the end of 2020, through a 37-item questionnaire, including multiple-choice questions, through Google Forms. The questions were divided into blocks with different proposals: personal profile, academic profile, issues related to COVID-19 infection, and issues related to mental health. Our analysis showed that 51.43% were master's degree students; 43.02% were doctorate and 5.55% were specialization students, mostly attending Biological, Health, and Human Sciences post-graduation courses (18.13%, 17.91%, and 17.38%, respectively) of different Brazilian educational institutions, including public (e.g., UFRJ) and private (e.g., PUC) federal universities as well as research institutions (e.g<i>.</i>, Fiocruz) from all five regions of Brazil (north, south, southeast, northeast, and center Midwest). Most of them were academically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also involved psychological aspects such as high levels of anxiety and depression. The results showed readjustments of research projects, and academic activities, which in some particular research fields led to the successful completion through the remote activities. However, efforts are still needed by graduate programs in order to allow greater flexibility in academic activities to fulfill all previous planning and chronograms, in addition to implementing ongoing projects to support students' mental health.","CorrÃƒÂªa, Castro, Ferreira, AraÃƒÂºjo-Jorge, Stephens","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedro.2022.100185","20220829","Academic activities; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic in Brazil; Postgraduate students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36816,""
"Pre-Pandemic Adversity Buffers the Role of Social Loneliness in Caregiver Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Objectives:</b> This study investigates how family profiles of risk and resilience established prior to COVID-19 are associated with changes in caregiver depression and stress 1Ã‚Â year after the pandemic onset, and how these associations are moderated by experiences of social loneliness. <b>Methods:</b> A sample of 243 caregivers in four risk and resilience profiles interviewed pre-COVID-19 were interviewed virtually in December 2020-February 2021 (during pandemic). Multi-level models were used to examine changes in mental health. <b>Results:</b> All caregivers reported increases in extreme stress during the pandemic. Caregivers with less relative adversity pre-pandemic showed significantly greater depression and loneliness in the pandemic compared to caregivers with higher pre-pandemic adversity. Social loneliness was a moderator of the association between pre-pandemic adversity and mental health. <b>Conclusion:</b> The study suggests families with more pre-pandemic adversity demonstrate coping that buffers the negative impact of social loneliness on mental health, emphasizing the strengths of these families that are assets to build upon in crisis. Families with more relative advantage pre-pandemic likely need assistance to reduce feelings of stress and depression in the face of increased social loneliness.","Monahan, McCrae, Daferede","https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2022.1604675","20220829","COVID-19 pandemic; child caregiver; loneliness; longitudinal study; mental health; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36817,""

"Role of politically motivated internet addiction and ideological passion in linking college student's mental health education and wellbeing","College students are increasingly reporting common mental health issues like depression and anxiety, raising severe concerns for students' psychological wellbeing. Specifically, after the emergence of Post-COVID-19, digitization caused a potential role in mitigating students' psychological concerns. Therefore, the role of mental health education has been regarded as a topic of interest in managing the issue of Chinese college students' mental wellbeing. This study intends to look into the relationship between mental health education and psychological wellbeing, along with the moderating role of politically motivated internet addiction and the ideological passion of college students. For the given reason, the random sampling method was employed for collecting data from target respondents. The study uses 750 questionnaires prepared on a five-point Likert scale that were distributed to the respondents with an expected response rate of 50%. The partial least square (PLS) software was used to analyze the data for this study. The study concludes that there is a significant moderating role of politically motivated internet addiction and ideological passion in the relationship between college students' mental health and wellbeing.

"Post-traumatic growth trajectories among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A three-wave follow-up study in mainland China","The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people worldwide for more than 2 years. Previous studies have highlighted the negative effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) more than the positive changes, such as post-traumatic growth (PTG). Furthermore, most previous studies were cross-sectional surveys without follow-ups. This study draws on PTG follow-up during the COVID-19 outbreak at 12-month intervals for 2 years since 2020. The trajectories and baseline predictors were described. A convenience sampling method was used to recruit frontline nurses or doctors at the COVID-19-designated hospital who were eligible for this study. A total of 565 HCWs completed the 2 years follow-up and were used for final data analysis. The latent growth mixture models (GMM) was used to identify subgroups of participants with different PTG trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression model was used to find predictors among sociodemographic characteristics and resilience at baseline. Four trajectory PTG types among HCWs were identified: 'Persistent, ""Steady increase"", ""High with drop"", and ""Fluctuated rise."" Comparing the ""Persistent low"" type, the other three categories were all associated with older age, higher education. Furthermore, ""Persistent low"" was also negatively associated with resilience at baseline. The PTG of HCWs with different characteristics showed different trends over time. It is necessary to increase the measure frequency to understand the PTG status in different times. Improving HCW's resilience could help improve staff PTG.","Yan, Wenbin, Bohan, Qian, Qianqian, Ruting, Silong, Miao, Huanting, Lili","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.945993","20220829","COVID-19; healthcare workers (HCWs); post-traumatic growth (PTG); resilience; trajectory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36820,""
"Prevalence, increase and predictors of family violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, using modern machine learning approaches","We are facing an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is causing detrimental effects on mental health, including disturbing consequences on child maltreatment and intimate partner violence. We sought to identify predictors of child maltreatment and intimate partner violence from 380 participants (mean age 36.67 Ã‚Â± 10.61, 63.2% male; Time 3: June 2020) using modern machine learning analysis (random forest and SHAP values). We predicted that COVID-related factors (such as days in lockdown), parents' psychological distress during the pandemic (anxiety, depression), their personality traits, and their intimate partner relationship will be key contributors to child maltreatment. We also examined if there is an increase in family violence during the pandemic by using an additional cohort at two time points (Time 1: March 2020, <i>N</i> = 434; mean age 35.67 Ã‚Â± 9.85, 41.69% male; and Time 2: April 2020, <i>N</i> = 515; mean age 35.3 Ã‚Â± 9.5, 34.33%). Feature importance analysis revealed that parents' affective empathy, psychological well-being, outdoor activities with children as well as a reduction in physical fights between partners are strong predictors of a reduced risk of child maltreatment. We also found a significant increase in physical punishment (Time 3: 66.26%) toward children, as well as in physical (Time 3: 36.24%) and verbal fights (Time 3: 41.08%) among partners between different times. Using modernized predictive algorithms, we present a spectrum of features that can have influential weight on prediction of child maltreatment. Increasing awareness about family violence consequences and promoting parenting programs centered around mental health are imperative.","Todorovic, O'Leary, Ward, Devarasetty, Lee, Knox, Andari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.883294","20220829","COVID-19; anxiety; child maltreatment; depression; intimate partner violence; machine learning; random forest","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36821,""
"Post-COVID-19 fatigue: A systematic review","Fatigue is recognized as one of the most commonly presented long-term complaints in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. This systematic review was performed to describe symptoms, etiology, possible risk factors related to post-COVID-19 fatigue and the therapeutic approaches used for the treatment of post-COVID-19 fatigue. For the systematic literature search the databases PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycInfo were used. All articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed for demographics, clinical data and treatment. Included were studies which focused on an adult population (18-65 years old); elderly patients and patients with chronic somatic diseases which can also cause fatigue were excluded. We identified 2,851, screened 2,193 and finally included 20 studies with moderate to high methodological quality, encompassing 5,629 participants. Potential risk factors for post-COVID-19 fatigue were old age, female sex, severe clinical status in the acute phase of infection, a high number of comorbidities, and a prediagnosis of depression/anxiety. Lastly, a possible autoimmune etiology was suspected. Several treatment approaches have been tested mostly in small and uncontrolled studies so far: a Chinese herbal formulation improved breathlessness and fatigue. Moreover, molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) inhalation had beneficial health effects in terms of improved physical (6-min walking test) and respiratory function in patients with post-COVID-19. Patients also noticed improvement in fatigue after undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP). Lastly. muscle strength and physical function were improved after undergoing an 8-weeks biweekly physical therapy course including aerobic training, strengthening exercises, diaphragmatic breathing techniques, and mindfulness training. However, larger and controlled studies e.g., investigating the effect of physical and / or psychotherapy for patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue are urgently warranted.

"Psychological effects and associated factors among vaccinated and unvaccinated general population against COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh","The global effort to develop herd immunity in the general public against the COVID-19 pandemic is currently ongoing. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies on how the COVID-19 vaccine affects mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The present study investigated the psychological effects and associated factors among vaccinated and unvaccinated general populations against COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh. A nationwide online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Bangladesh from June 23 to December 25, 2021. The frequency of symptoms of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insomnia, and fear was assessed using the Bangla versions of the GHQ-12, PHQ-2, GAD-2, PSS-4, PC-PTSD-5, ISI, and FCV-19S scales, respectively. The study included 3,013 persons from all eight divisions of Bangladesh, with 1,272 (42.2%) being vaccinated and 1,741 (57.8%) being unvaccinated. Compared with unvaccinated populations, vaccinated populations had significantly lower prevalence rates of psychological distress (36.4 vs. 51.5%), depression (21.1 vs. 37.9%), anxiety (25.1 vs. 44.9%), stress (19.4 vs. 30.4%), PTSD (29.4 vs. 38.3%), insomnia (18.7 vs. 39.4%), and fear symptoms (16.1 vs. 27.5%). Among vaccinated populations, respondents who lived in nuclear families were significantly associated with higher risk of psychological distress (AOR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.78), depression (AOR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.11-1.98), anxiety (AOR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.21-1.98), and fear (AOR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.11-1.83) symptoms. Participants who lost family members, friends, or colleagues due to the COVID-19 pandemic had significantly higher risk of symptoms of psychological distress (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.02-1.79), anxiety (AOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.11-1.87), and PTSD (AOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.24-2.19). On the other hand, unvaccinated populations who lived in the Dhaka division were significantly associated with an increased risk of depression (AOR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.40-2.52), anxiety (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.15-2.47), stress (AOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.12-2.88), and insomnia (AOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.20-2.94) symptoms. Except for PTSD and fear symptoms, unemployed participants had considerably higher rates of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms (e.g., psychological distress: AOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.10-2.62; depression: AOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.37-2.19).

"Safety behaviors and job satisfaction during the pandemic: The mediating roles of uncertainty and managerial commitment","As the Covid-19 pandemic affects the world, disruptions to work routines impose a psychological burden on people, and thus can affect their job performance and well-being. We conducted an empirical study to explore the links between the experience of Covid-19 and workers' safety behaviors and well-being outcome of job satisfaction. Structural equation modelling (SEM) with a sample of 515 safety workers was conducted to simultaneously test the links among these constructs. Experience of Covid-19 was associated with lower employee job satisfaction, explained by higher psychological uncertainty and decreased perception of managerial commitment to safety. Notably, contrasting pathways from experience of Covid-19 to safety behaviors were found. On the one hand, higher psychological uncertainty caused by the pandemic was associated with lower perceptions of managerial safety commitment; and lower perceived managerial safety commitment was linked to reduced safety compliance and safety participation. On the other hand, experience of Covid-19 in this study showed unexpected positive direct links with safety behaviors, which might be explained by workers' enhanced safety knowledge, motivation, and status of mindfulness due to Covid-19 related safety instructions and communications. This exploratory study helps to deepen the understanding of workplace safety and well-being in the context of pandemic and in times of uncertainty.

"The associations between COVID-19 vaccination and psychological disorders among healthcare workers in China","COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented psychological affection that might impact the nationwide vaccination program in China. This study was to explore the association between COVID-19 vaccination and psychological disorders among healthcare workers. The study included 1571 healthcare workers from an anonymous online survey. Participants' sociodemographic characteristics, uptake data for the COVID-19 vaccine, and scores of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were collected. Nonparametric tests were conducted to compare the mean scores of DASS-21 between different subgroups. The potential factors related to psychological disorders of healthcare workers were analyzed using logistic regression. The vaccination rate was 69.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, the incidence of vaccine-related adverse events was 35.13Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, and the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress were 24.8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, 32Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, and 33.4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% in this study, respectively. Compared to vaccinated participants (single-dose and double-dose vaccines), unvaccinated participants got significantly higher mean scores of DASS-21 (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05 for all). Vaccinated participants who suffered no adverse events scored significantly lower than those who suffered 1-2 or Ã¢â€°Â¥3 adverse events (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05 for all). Vaccination was negatively associated with higher depression, anxiety, and stress, however, the number of vaccine-related adverse events was positively associated with them. As this is a cross-sectional study, we could only speculate on the causality. An obvious impact of the psychological disorders on the COVID-19 vaccine coverage and related adverse events was detected in this study. Public health agencies should attach great importance to the psychological states of our citizens before getting vaccinated.","Guo, Han, Sun, Sun, Luo, Zheng, Gao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.080","20220828","Anxiety; Association; COVID-19; Depression; Stress; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36826,""
"Mapping post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and quality of life among residents of Wuhan, China after the COVID-19 outbreak: A network perspective","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak may have a long-term impact on mental health in the general population. This study examined inter-relationships between post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSS) and quality of life (QOL) in Wuhan residents after the COVID-19 outbreak using network approach. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 25 and June 18, 2020. PTSS and QOL were measured using Chinese versions of the Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - brief version, respectively. A total of 2598 participants were included. A network analysis revealed ""Avoiding reminders"", ""Feeling emotionally numb"", ""Avoiding thoughts"", ""Hypervigilance"", and ""Reliving experiences"" as the most central (influential) nodes in PTSS network models both before and after controlling for covariates. The connection between ""Avoiding thoughts"" and ""Avoiding reminders"" had the strongest edge. Three symptom communities were detected and can be summarized as ""re-experiencing and avoidance"", ""negative changes in thinking and mood"", and ""hyperarousal"". The bridge symptoms connecting PTSS and QOL were ""Sleep disturbances"", ""Irritability"", and ""Loss of interest"". Limitations included the cross-sectional study design, self-report measures in data collection, and lack of follow-ups beyond the initial phase of the pandemic. PTSS were common among Wuhan residents even after the initial COVID-19 outbreak had passed. Attention should be paid to lingering symptoms of avoiding reminders, emotional numbness, avoiding thoughts, hypervigilance, and reliving experiences in treating PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Li, Zhao, Zhang, Yang, Cheung, Jackson, Sha, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.074","20220828","COVID-19; Network analysis; Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms; Wuhan residents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36827,""
"COVID-19 affects psychological symptoms of pregnant women indirectly by increasing their maternal concerns","Pregnant women themselves are at higher risk for psychological symptoms. The impact of ongoing COVID-19 may increase the risk. However, it is uncertain whether COVID-19 affects pregnant women's psychological symptoms directly or indirectly being mediated. This survey was conducted in four obstetrics and gynecology hospitals in Beijing from February 28, 2020, to April 26, 2020. Pregnant women who visited the antenatal-care clinic were mobilized to finish the online questionnaires, including the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Connor-Davidson resilience scale, and Insomnia Severity Index. A total of 828 pregnant women were included in the analysis. The estimated self-reported rates of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and any of the three were 12.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, 24.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, 13.3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, and 33.1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%, respectively. Mediating effect analysis showed that pregnant women's response to COVID-19 was not directly associated with psychological symptoms but indirectly through the mediating effect of maternal concerns, which accounted for 32.35Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% of the total effect. Stratified analysis by psychological resilience showed that women's attitude toward COVID-19 (OR, 2.68, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.16-6.18) was associated with a higher risk of psychological symptoms in those with poor psychological resilience. The study was a non-probability sampling survey, and the causal relationship between maternal concerns and psychological symptoms could not be determined due to the study's design. Under public health emergencies such as COVID-19, routine antenatal care should still be prioritized, and concerns related to childbirth-related caused by such emergencies should also be addressed, especially for those with weak psychological resilience.","Chen, Zou, Shi, Ma, Huang, Wang, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.069","20220828","COVID-19; Maternal concerns; Mental health; Pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36828,""
"Young children's traumatic stress reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic: The long reach of mothers' adverse childhood experiences","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted parental and child mental health; however, it is critical to examine this impact in the context of parental histories of adversity. We hypothesized that maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and pandemic-related negative life events would predict child traumatic stress symptoms (TSS) and tested potential mediating pathways through maternal pandemic-related TSS and/or poorer maternal sensitivity during the pandemic. Data were collected from a longitudinal sample of low-income, racially/ethnically diverse mothers and their children. Between May and November 2020, mothers (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯111) of young children (M ageÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯7.42Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years, SDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.45) completed questionnaires to assess their own and their child's pandemic-related TSS, exposure to pandemic-related negative events, and parent-child relationship quality. Maternal ACEs, maternal depression, parent-child relationship quality, and child internalizing symptoms had been assessed approximately 1-3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years prior. Structural equation analyses revealed that pandemic negative life events were indirectly associated with child TSS via greater maternal TSS. For mothers, recent pandemic-related negative events were associated with their own TSS, whereas maternal ACEs were not. Maternal ACEs directly predicted greater child TSS, with no evidence of mediation by either maternal TSS or maternal sensitivity. All measures were parent report, and pandemic-related measures were collected at the same time point. Findings underscore the long reach of mothers' own adverse childhood experiences, highlighting the negative consequences of these prior traumatic exposures alongside current pandemic-related maternal trauma symptoms for children's adjustment during the pandemic.","Hagan, Roubinov, Cordeiro, Lisha, Bush","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.061","20220828","Adverse childhood events; COVID-19; Parent-child relationship; Traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36829,""
"The prevalence and associated factors for self-harm and suicide ideation among Chinese Indonesians during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: This study aimed to identify the prevalence and associated factors for self-harm and suicide ideation among Chinese Indonesians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A non-random sampling was performed through a nationwide online survey in Indonesia (May-June 2021). The online survey covered participantsâ€™ demographic information, suicide literacy, suicide stigma, loneliness, and self-harm and suicide ideation. A series of t-tests, Chi-squares, and hierarchical logistic regressions with the backward-stepwise method were used to identify the factors associated with self-harm and suicide ideation. Responses from a total of 484 Chinese Indonesians were analyzed in this study. Results: The prevalence of self-harm and suicide ideation in the two weeks preceding the survey among Chinese Indonesian people was 35.5%. The predictive model showed a significant goodness-of-fit to the observed data (x2[17]=174.1, p<.001; RN2=.41). Chinese Indonesians with an average monthly income of =USD 843 were found to be 0.23 (95% CI=0.07-0.99) times less likely to experience self-harm and suicide ideation than those who did not have an income. A one-point increase in the intensity of suicide glorification and loneliness were associated with 3.06 and 3.67 increase in the chance of experiencing self-harm and suicide ideation, respectively. Conclusion: One-third of Chinese Indonesians self-reported self-harm and suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health and suicide prevention intervention programs are recommended to target those with low-socioeconomic status, high glorification towards suicide, and high perceived loneliness.","Benny Prawira et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01BE-28E-E4F","20220830","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; loneliness; ethnic minority; marginalized group; stigma; suicide ideation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","",36830,""
