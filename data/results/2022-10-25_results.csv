"Association between social connectedness and stress or anxiety among older cancer survivors during the 2020â€“2021 winter surge of the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Our goal was to estimate a relative decreased rate of social connectedness to family and friends, increased rate of stress or anxiety during the 2020â€“2021 winter surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, and investigate the association between social connectedness and stress or anxiety among a nationally representative sample of older adults with cancer history. Materials and Methods We used population-based, nationally representative cross-sectional data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Winter 2021 Community Supplement. The study cohort included community-living Medicare beneficiaries aged 65Â years and older who self-reported cancer history (other than skin cancer) (nÂ =Â 1650). Sample weights were applied to account for the complex survey design, with results generalizable to 8.5 million Medicare beneficiaries with cancer history. The outcome was self-reported feelings of stress or anxiety during the 2020â€“2021 winter surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. The independent variable was social connectedness, defined as feeling less socially connected to family and friends during the 2020â€“2021 winter surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted weighted descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results Overall, 42.5% of beneficiaries reported decreased social connectedness to family and friends, and 37.8% reported increased feelings of stress or anxiety during the 2020â€“2021 winter surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. After adjusting for all covariates, participants who reported decreased social connectedness had 154% higher odds of increased feelings of stress or anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOD]Â =Â 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]Â =Â 2.00â€“3.20, pÂ =0.001) compared to those who reported more or about the same social connectedness to family and friends. The odds of increased feelings of stress or anxiety were also higher for those who self-reported as Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic White beneficiaries (AORÂ =Â 1.35, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.10â€“1.73, pÂ =Â .016), women vs. men (AORÂ =Â 1.85, 95%CIÂ =Â 1.43â€“2.38, pÂ =0.001), and those who reported depression history vs. not reporting depression history (AORÂ =Â 2.55, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.86â€“3.48, pÂ =0.000). Discussion An estimated 3.6 million older adults with cancer history reported decreased social connectedness to family and friends, and 3.2 million reported increased feelings of stress or anxiety during the 2020â€“2021 winter surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying these adults and referring them to appropriate supportive care resources and services are essential to help them cope with negative feelings.","Poghosyan, Hermine, Margaryan, Yeva, Jeon, Sangchoon, Edelman, E.

"While We Wait: understanding the impact of service wait times on GPs' treatment behaviour for youth patients with mental health problems","Background: Wait times for in-person mental health treatment are a national crisis for young people. Long wait times are associated with many negative consequences such as lower treatment satisfaction and discontinuation, symptom deterioration and relapse, and lower likelihood of future help-seeking. With the onset of COVID-19, wait times have become longer. General Practitioners (GPs) are the primary referrers to in-person mental health treatment, however, their ability to care for their youth patients' mental health is often negatively impacted by long wait times, often resulting in GPs engaging in significantly high levels of management, with little resources to do so. Brief, low-intensity digital interventions may provide accessible, evidence-based, and cost-effective care while young people await in-person mental health care. Aim/Objectives: This study aims to examine the impact of service wait times on GPs' treatment of mental health problems in youth patients and explore their openness to recommending digital interventions as support during this time. Method(s): A national cross-sectional survey conducted among 430 GPs (currently recruiting). Finding(s): This presentation will outline the survey results. Preliminary results (N=53) indicate that wait times impact GP decisions and management of young patients. Specifically, participants reported that due to long wait times, they often increase their care rather than refer patients to services (M=4.08, SD=.79) and often refer patients to different services than their preferred service (M=4.00, SD=.69), are very open to recommending mobile mental health apps to their patients (M=4.24, SD=.84), but are only somewhat confident in doing so (M=3.57, SD=1.27). Implications: This research is the first in Australia to examine mental health service wait times on GP treatment care and decisions specifically for youth. It will inform how young patients can be best supported and which interventions GPs consider to be most ideal for supporting young people while they await in-person mental health care.","Parker, B.; Li, S.; Whitton, A.; Roxas, B.

"Life Orientation, Life Satisfaction and Well-being among School Teachers during COVID Pandemic","Previous researches have positioned well-being as an integral variable of mental health correlated with other factors like satisfaction with life and life orientation. The present research examines well-being, life satisfaction, and orientation towards life among teachers during COVID-19. During the initial phases of COVID-19, the Government imposed lockdown in the month of May-June (2020). This led to the closure of all the schools and colleges, offices, public places, etc. Although the schools were closed, staff and teachers of the schools were asked to perform tasks which included the distribution of ration, home surveys, shift- work at hospitals, airports, shelter homes, etc. With an increasing rate of infections and mortality, the teachers were hesitant to volunteer for any COVID duty and were generally apprehensive about being called up for such duties. In this research, 364 school teachers (both male & female of 27-60 years) were included as an inclusive sample of those performing and not performing any such duty from Delhi, India. The present research aims to understand the dynamics of well-being among teachers during COVID. It utilizes measures of the Life Orientation Test-revised (LOT-R), Satisfaction towards Life Scale (SWLS), and Warwick-Edinburg Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). Correlation and multiple regression are used as statistical measures to find out the relationship and predictability among the variables. Results show a significant relationship among Life orientation, life satisfaction and well-being and wellbeing is significantly predicted by life satisfaction and orientation towards life. Discussion suggests that similar results are being observed among variables under consideration amid COVID and future implications are drawn out from the present study.","Parashar, Divya, Aleem, Sheema","https://www.google.com/search?q=Life+Orientation,+Life+Satisfaction+and+Well-being+among+School+Teachers+during+COVID+Pandemic","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Positive Psychology; 13(3):216-221, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39603,""
"The Relationship between Traumatic Stress Symptoms and Psychological Resilience in Nurses Working During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose: This study was conducted to determine the relationship between traumatic stress symptoms and psychological resilience in nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The sample of this descriptive and correlational study consisted of 202 nurses working in a state hospital in Turkey. The data were collected using the Personal Information Form, the Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist and the Brief Resilience Scale. Results: Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were found in 14.9% of nurses, and comorbid depressive symptoms were found in 17.3%. A moderate negative correlation was found between the Brief Resilience Scale scores and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (r = -0.542;p = 0.000) and between the Brief Resilience Scale scores and comorbid depressive symptoms (r = -0.487;p = 0.000). In multiple regression analysis, perception of health, perception of psychological status and working hours of nurses were factors affecting post-traumatic stress symptoms (R = 0.242;R2 = 0.210;F = 7.691;p = 0.000) and comorbid depressive symptoms (R = 0.241;R2 = 0.210;F = 7.676;p = 0.000). Conclusion: There are post-traumatic stress and comorbid depressive symptoms in nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The pattern of mental health consultations at a metropolitan university general practice clinic in Sydney before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created social and medical disruptions to the Australian community. The introduction of telehealth Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item numbers in early March 2020 has shifted mental health consultations from face-to-face to telehealth. There is a literature gap pertaining to the ongoing trends that extend past the initial 'first wave' of the pandemic in the context of an Australian landscape. Aim/Objective: To describe the pattern of mental health care consultations in a university-based general practice in Sydney, specifically, the distribution of face-to-face, telephone and tele-video consultations, according to the change in socio-political landscape and lockdowns. The secondary aim is to explore the effect of age, ethnicity, birth sex and student status, and the severity of patient symptoms via K10/DASS21 scores. Method(s): Retrospective data will be obtained from records of 456 patients attending a university-based general practice in Sydney, Australia between four different 35-day time periods: baseline pre- COVID-19 (1st February 2019 to 8th March 2019);first COVID-19 lockdown (31st March 2020 to 5th May 2020);second COVID-19 lockdown (20th August 2021 to 24th September 2021);post COVID-19 lockdown (1st February 2022 to 8th March 2022). Attendances will be defined by mental health MBS codes that correspond to mental health consultations, mental health care plans, and mental health care plan reviews, for face-to-face, telephone and tele-video consultations. K10/DASS21 scores will also be obtained. Statistical analysis will be performed using the two-sample t-test on SPSS. Finding(s): Data analysis is currently in progress. Results will be available by July 2022. Implications: Given the recent temporary telehealth extension announced by the Australian Government on 16th January 2022, the findings of our study will illustrate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health consultations in various subgroups and provide additional data for policymakers to facilitate further examination in continuing MBS subsidisation.","Nguyen, V.; Tse, T.; Willcock, S.; Vagholkar, S.; Wu, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+pattern+of+mental+health+consultations+at+a+metropolitan+university+general+practice+clinic+in+Sydney+before+and+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Australian Journal of Primary Health; 28(4):xliv, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39605,""
"Intolerance to Uncertainty and Cyberchondria During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: COVID 19 is a problem that significantly affects community mental health. With this problem, many mental problems have emerged. Cyberchondria and intolerance to uncertainty are among the mental problems increasing during the pandemic process. aim, methods, results and conclusion. Aim: This study was carried out to determine the level of intolerance to uncertainty and cyberchondria of the society during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: In this descriptive-relational study, the random sampling method was used. The study was conducted between September-November 2020 with 1195 people aged 18-65. The data were collected using the Information Form consisting of three parts, the Intolerance to Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), and the Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS-33). Results: The mean Intolerance to Uncertainty Scale score of the participants was found to be 38.39Â±9.56, and the mean CSS score was 73.80Â±17.34. The analyses indicated that the predictor variable of the IUS score is using drugs without doctor's recommendation (ÃŸ=-0.059, p&lt;0.05), while the predictor variables of the CSS score are ceasing to use the prescribed medication based on the information on the internet (ÃŸ=-0.225, p&lt; 0.01), choosing a doctor and hospital according to the information on the Internet (ÃŸ=-0.101, p&lt;0.01), and people's belief that they have information about COVID-19 (ÃŸ=0.075, p=0.08). A weak positive correlation was observed between the IUS and CSS (p&lt;0.001).

"Allergic diseases and immunodeficiencies in children, lessons learnt from COVID-19 pandemic by 2022: A statement from the EAACI-section on pediatrics","By the April 12, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in over half a billion people being infected worldwide. There have been 6.1Â million deaths directly due to the infection, but the pandemic has had many more short- and long-term pervasive effects on the physical and mental health of the population. Allergic diseases are among the most prevalent noncommunicable chronic diseases in the pediatric population, and health-care professionals and researchers were seeking answers since the beginning of pandemic. Children are at lower risk of developing severe COVID-19 or dying from infection. Allergic diseases are not associated with a higher COVID-19 severity and mortality, apart from severe/poorly controlled asthma. The pandemic disrupted routine health care, but many mitigation strategies, including but not limited to telemedicine, were successfully implemented to continue delivery of high-standard care. Although children faced a multitude of pandemic-related issues, allergic conditions were effectively treated remotely while reduction in air pollution and lack of contact with outdoor allergens resulted in improvement, particularly respiratory allergies. There is no evidence to recommend substantial changes to usual management modalities of allergic conditions in children, including allergen immunotherapy and use of biologicals. Allergic children are not at greater risk of multisystem inflammatory syndrome development, but some associations with Long COVID were reported, although the data are limited, and further research is needed. This statement of the EAACI Section on Pediatrics provides recommendations based on the lessons learnt from the pandemic, as available evidence.","Munblit, Daniel, Greenhawt, Matthew, Brough, Helen A.; Pushkareva, Anna, Karimova, Diana, Demidova, Anastasia, Warner, John O.; Kalayci, Omer, Sediva, Anna, Untersmayr, Eva, Rodriguez del Rio, Pablo, Vazquez-Ortiz, Marta, Arasi, Stefania, Alvaro-Lozano, Montserrat, Tsabouri, Sophia, Galli, Elena, Beken, Burcin, Eigenmann, Philippe A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Allergic+diseases+and+immunodeficiencies+in+children,+lessons+learnt+from+COVID-19+pandemic+by+2022:+A+statement+from+the+EAACI-section+on+pediatrics","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology; 33(10), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39607,""

There has been an increasing recognition of the impact of mental health in the workplace. From the pervasive problems of stress and burnout to the movement toward creating cultures of authenticity and belonging, to the examination of the costs of absenteeism and presenteeism, employee mental health has emerged as a critical component in building and retaining a productive and engaged workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought mental health into even sharper focus.

"Strengthening laboratory biosafety in Liberia during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experience from the Global Laboratory Leadership Programme","Background The Global Laboratory Leadership Programme (GLLP) has biosafety and biosecurity as one of its core competencies and advocates for a One Health approach involving all relevant sectors across the human-animal-environment interface to empower national laboratory systems and strengthen health security. Decentralization of SARS-CoV-2 testing in Liberia coupled with an increase in the number of COVID-19 infections among laboratory professionals raised biosafety concerns. In response, a set of trainings on laboratory biosafety was launched for lab personnel across the country under the framework of the GLLP. The goal was to deliver a comprehensive package for laboratory biosafety in the context of SARS-CoV-2 through active learning. Methods Three one-day workshops were conducted between September and October 2020, training personnel from human, animal and environmental laboratories through a One Health approach. Concepts critical to laboratory biosafety were delivered in an interactive engagement format to ensure effective learning and retention of concepts. Pre- and post-training assessments were performed, and a paired t-test was used to assess knowledge gain. Results Of the 67 participants, 64 were from the human health sector, one from veterinary sector and two from environmental health sector. The average pre-test score was 41%. The main gaps identified were failure to acknowledge surgical antisepsis as a form of hand hygiene and recognition of PPE as the best risk control measure. The average post-test score was 75.5%. The mean difference of pre-test and post-test scores was statistically significant (p-value &lt;0.001). Participants indicated satisfaction with the workshop content, mode of delivery and trainers' proficiency. Conclusions The workshops were impactful as evidenced by significant improvement (34.5%) in the post-test scores and positive participant feedback. Repeated refresher trainings are vital to addressing the gaps, ensuring compliance, and promoting biosafety culture. GLLP's approach to cultivating multisectoral national laboratory leaders ready to take responsibility and ownership for capacity building provides a sustainable solution for attaining strong national laboratory systems better prepared for health emergencies and pandemics like COVID-19.","Malik, Shruti, Taweh, Fahn M.; Freeman, Maxwell, Dogba, John B.; Gwesa, Grace O.; Tokpah, Melvin, Gbondin, Prince P.; Kohar, T.

"Impact of Covid-19 on Pediatric Ibd Patients Receiving Infusions","As the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic continues in the United States, it has become evident that people of all ages are affected. Overall, children typically have a mild course of illness when infected with COVID-19. Available literature reports that children with IBD are not at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 when compared to the general population, however, research is limited. Our study explored the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to pediatric IBD patients as there are significant knowledge gaps in incidence, association, and effect on the mental health of the patient, and outcome of COVID -19 in these populations. It is widely known that adult patients with comorbidities are at a higher risk for developing a more severe COVID-19 disease course. An international pediatric and adult database collecting data on COVID-19 in IBD patients named the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE-IBD), has been monitoring outcomes of patients with IBD that were COVID-19 positive. In a study published in 2021, data from 209 children and adolescents showed a 7% hospitalization rate among pediatric IBD patients who tested positive for COVID-19, a rate much lower than the overall hospitalization rate of adult IBD patients with COVID-19. Factors that resulted in hospitalization included comorbid conditions, steroid use, moderate to severe IBD, and specific GI symptoms from COVID-19. Similarly, a study published in 2021 consisting of 290 pediatric IBD patients revealed only a minority of IBD patients had mild symptoms, and none of them required hospitalizations or treatment modification. We attempted to look into the impact of Covid-19 in our patients receiving infusions at the hospital infusion center. We offered a survey to 39 patients in our infusion center, 32 of which were included in our analysis. 4 patients refused to take part in the study, 1 consent form was not signed, and 2 were excluded for being older than 21 years of age. The majority of these patients received infliximab/Remicade infusions. Males-44%,females-56%. 72%-Crohn's disease, 28% -Ulcerative colitis. None of the patients required any specific treatments or hospitalizations based on survey responses. 3 patients required ER visits and no changes in medications were made in IBD management due to covid-19. 1 patient required a change in the schedule of the infusion due to Covid-19 symptoms. About 66% of patients either received the vaccine or intended to take it if eligible at the time of the survey. With continued research data on the safety and efficacy of vaccination, we expect this number will go up. While there was some anxiousness reported about the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a negative trend seen in the mood and feeling questionnaire across all questions (table 2). Overall, our study confirmed that the covid-19 pandemic so far had minimal impact on IBD management but identified a need to improve mental health for overall quality of life. Our study was only limited to patients receiving infusions at our hospital which leaves a significant number of patients receiving other modes of therapy or home infusions for IBD. Further ongoing research will be needed to identify the long-term impact of Covid-19 on IBD patients on a larger scale.","Magner, A.; Webster, K.; Patel, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+Covid-19+on+Pediatric+Ibd+Patients+Receiving+Infusions","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition; 75(Supplement 1):S58-S60, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39611,""

"Visual hallucinations caused by Charles Bonnet Syndrome are not impacted by the psychosocial factors resulting from COVID19 restrictions","Purpose : Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is a poorly understood, debilitating phenomenon following vision loss from common diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and currently has no treatment. Individuals with CBS often experience visual hallucinations in the form of images such as people, landscapes, or patterns that do not exist. This experience is the result of an imbalance between the loss of vision and the active visual brain but is often misdiagnosed as dementia or a mental health condition. Psychosocial factors have been suggested to exacerbate CBS visual hallucinations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the implementation of public health safety measures including extended periods of total or partial lockdowns to reduce virus transmission. To date, Canadians have undergone several waves of restrictions that may increase the risk of pervasive psychosocial issues from social isolation. The goal of this research is to assess how the social constraints of the current COVID-19 pandemic may affect CBS visual hallucinations. Methods : We surveyed 39 individuals (M: 69 years, SD: 16 years) with CBS from the CNIB Foundation. Visual hallucinations, anxiety, social isolation, loneliness, and QoL were assessed using: The Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire and modified versions of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 scale, Steptoe Social Isolation Index, DeJong Gierveld Loneliness scale, and the World Health Organization QoL scale, respectively. Results : 90.6% of patients reported no change (increase: 6.3%;decrease: 3.1%) in average duration and 62.2% reported no change (increase: 21.6%;decrease: 16.2%) in frequency of CBS hallucinations. No significant differences were observed in anxiety (p= 0.514);QoL (p= 0.155);social isolation (p= 0.835);and loneliness (p= 0.296) between participants who reported experiencing a change compared no change in hallucinations. Conclusions : The social constraints of the current COVID-19 pandemic measured through anxiety, social isolation, loneliness, and QoL do not affect visual hallucinations caused by CBS.

"Prevalence of Depression, Anxiety and Stress among Mothers of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in India during COVID-19 Pandemic","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological disability that lasts a lifetime. Children with ASD (CASD) exhibit impairment in communication and social relations, as well as repetitive and restricted behavioral issues. CASD may have major challenges and show disruptive behaviors when their routines are altered, which may negatively influence the mental health of primary caregivers, particularly mothers. As part of the COVID-19 protocol, the closure of training facilities and schools, social isolation, and lack of support may interfere with the CASD's everyday activities, increase their caregivers' burden, and negatively impact their mental well-being and the development of the CASD. Mothers may experience psychological distress such as depression, anxiety, and stress since they do not know how to handle the problem without professional support, which is inaccessible due to pandemic protocol. This research designed to assess the psychological distress of mothers of CASD (MCASD) during the COVID-19 epidemic, in Kerala, India. The researchers used the DASS-21 scale to measure depression, anxiety, and stress in MCASD. One hundred MCASD who accompanied their children to autism training centers and special schools in Kerala were recruited using purposive sampling and employed a cross-sectional design. According to the current study tindings, 89%, 83%, and 90% of mothers of children with ASD experience depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Our research shows that after several months from the COVID-19 pandemic breakout, mothers of children with ASD continue to experience severe psychological distress. Therefore, it is critical to pay special attention to these mothers' mental health and implement a viable intervention program to effectively face challenges and cope with stressors while caring for their children with ASD.","Joseph, Liji, Delariarte, Clarissa F.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevalence+of+Depression,+Anxiety+and+Stress+among+Mothers+of+Children+with+Autism+Spectrum+Disorder+in+India+during+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Health and Wellbeing; 13(3):301-306, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39614,""
"Protective Behavior and Psychological Health among Pregnant Women during the Covid-19 Pandemic","Pregnancy is a time of changes in a woman's life because it includes not only psychological but also physiological and anatomical changes. The woman needs all the support and understanding she can get to be able to deliver to a healthy baby. The presence of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in many aspects of life in a pregnant woman and her family thereby causing additional mental burden that may cause psychological as well as physiological alterations in a supposedly normal life changes. The aim of the study is to find out the protective behavior, coping mechanisms and psychological status of the pregnant women in order to come up with interventional activities to help these women cope with their current situation and with the pandemic. The respondents of the study were the 35 pregnant women who consented to participate in the study. The study made use of a survey questionnaire to be able to determine and describe the protective behaviors, their coping mechanisms and the psychological status. Results showed that the respondents practice protective behaviors, have good coping mechanisms and are of normal psychological status. There is no association between the variables to the profile of the respondents except for educational attainment which showed positive perfect correlations with protective behaviors and coping mechanisms against depression, anxiety and stress. The number of respondents limits the findings of the study so it was recommended that similar studies be done in a larger population as well as in significant others of the pregnant women be included as respondent. It is also recommended that a longitudinal study be conducted for more extensive findings.","Herminia, S. Palac Magc MsPH, Cynthia, Almarez R. M. MsPH, Melissa, D. Sarmiento R. M. M. S. N.; Bella, G.

"Parenting stress, maternal depression and child mental health in a Melbourne cohort before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Aim This paper aims to examine the maternal and child mental health and parenting outcomes in the context of COVID-19 pandemic conditions using a sample from Melbourne, Australia â€“ a city exposed to one of the longest lockdowns world-wide in response to the pandemic. Methods This study utilises observational data from a prospective, pregnancy cohort, Mercy Pregnancy Emotional Wellbeing Study and includes 468 women and their children followed up in Melbourne to 3â€“4 years postpartum pre-COVID pandemic and compared to those followed up during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results When compared to mothers followed up at 3â€“4 years postpartum pre-pandemic, those followed up during the COVID-19 pandemic showed higher depressive symptoms with a steep incline in their symptom trajectory (EMMdifferenceÂ =Â 1.72, Bonferroni-corrected P &lt; 0.01, dÂ =Â 0.35) and had a three times higher risk of scoring 13 or above on the EPDS (aRRÂ =Â 3.22, Bonferroni-corrected P &lt; 0.01). Although this increase was not associated with the variation in the duration of exposure to pandemic conditions, the steep increase in depressive symptoms was more pronounced in those with pre-existing depressive disorders. There was no difference in parenting stress or adjusted childhood mental health symptoms or disorder. Conclusions Our findings highlight the vulnerability of those with pre-existing clinical mental health disorders and the need for adequate clinical care for this vulnerable group. Equally, our study indicates the possibility thatÂ  parenting and early childhood mental health outcomes, at least in the short term, may be resilient.","Galbally, Megan, Watson, Stuart J.; Lewis, Andrew J.; van Ijzendoorn, Marinus H.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Parenting+stress,+maternal+depression+and+child+mental+health+in+a+Melbourne+cohort+before+and+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of paediatrics and child health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39617,""
"Emotional distress and quality of life among adults with developmental coordination disorder during COVID-19","Introduction: Individuals with developmental coordination disorder frequently report emotional and functional difficulties. A stressful era as COVID-19 pandemic may enhance emotional load. The present study aimed to (1) examine the emotional distress and quality of life among adults with developmental coordination disorder during COVID-19 as compared to typical controls, and (2) examine the relationships between these factors in adults with developmental coordination disorder. Method: Participants were 317 adults, aged 18â€“66, recruited during the first year of COVID-19: 227 were included in the developmental coordination disorder group, and 90 in the control group (normal motor performance) based on the Adult Developmental Co-ordination Disorders/Dyspraxia Checklist cutoff score. Participants completed a sociodemographic health status/daily life under COVID-19 questionnaire and self-reports about their emotional status (depression, anxiety, stress) and a quality of life. Results: The developmental coordination disorder group had significantly greater depression, anxiety, stress, and lower quality of life. Participants with developmental coordination disorder who were infected by COVID-19 or reported reduction of working hours due to COVID-19 had the lowest social and environmental quality of life. Depression significantly predicted reduced quality of life and mediated between developmental coordination disorder severity and quality of life. Conclusions: Prevention and intervention programs for adults with developmental coordination disorder should be elaborated, with reference to emotional load and to implications on daily life, especially in times of crisis, like COVID-19.","Engel-Yeger, Batya, Engel, Asi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Emotional+distress+and+quality+of+life+among+adults+with+developmental+coordination+disorder+during+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The British Journal of Occupational Therapy;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39618,""
"Pediatric Gastrointestinal Procedural Patterns during the Covid-19 Pandemic in New York City","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruptions in medical care and initially elective medical procedures were put on hold. Patients avoided medical facilities, deferring care for non-acute conditions. One study found an 86% decrease in colorectal cancer screening volumes after COVID, and research has shown that adult gastroenterology (GI) admissions for conditions such as bleeds and cholecystitis decreased during the pandemic. There is sparse literature documenting pediatric GI procedures and medical utilization during the pandemic. This study analyzes data from five New York City hospitals comprising the INSIGHT Clinical Research Network (CRN) to evaluate procedural patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. We extracted demographic and clinical data on 18177 GI procedures for children &lt;21 years from the INSIGHT CRN, available from 3/2019 to 11/2021 (27 months). GI procedures were categorized using the card sort method, in which clinicians independently sorted procedures into predefined categories that were then harmonized across clinician results. Daily procedure frequencies from March to July 2020 were plotted to assess early-pandemic trends. Changes in weekly procedure frequency from 2019 to 2021 were also analyzed by year, using 2019 as a baseline against which data from 2020 and 2021 were compared. Specifically, changes across years in weekly mean procedure frequency were assessed using a separate analysis of variance (ANOVA) model for each procedure category, and post-hoc Tukey tests were used for pairwise comparisons of year-specific means for ANOVA models with significant overall differences at a Type I error rate of 0.05. Percent changes in procedure frequency compared to 2019 were plotted by category and year, with post-hoc adjusted statistical significance noted. All races except Pacific Islander showed a decline in procedures during 2020 and a rise in 2021. Median age at procedure was stable. Though literature shows Hispanic and African American communities to be more affected by COVID, they did not have the greatest decline in procedure frequency relative to 2019 (25% and 20% respectively vs Asian decline 41%). During the pandemic period in 2020 (Figure 1), EGD/colonoscopies comprised the majority of procedures taking place. However, overall pediatric GI procedures declined precipitously during this period, from a mean daily procedure count of 23.5 from March to November of 2019 to 0.77 in April 2020 (Figure 1). We noted a &gt;40% decline in more invasive procedures such as liver and rectal suction biopsies. Procedures used in more acute settings, such as foreign body removal and bleeding control, had a smaller percent change during the pandemic (11% for both, see Figure 2). Compared to 2019, we noted a significant increase in motility procedures in 2021, potentially indicating a rise in functional illness. Further, there was an increase in foreign body removal during the same period, possibly due to circumstances of less supervision, and ERCP and EUS also increased. The COVID-19 pandemic led to multiple changes in pediatric GI procedures, however EGD/colonoscopies continued in the pediatric population contrary to what has been seen in adult literature. More invasive procedures requiring procedural rooms and admission were delayed, while more urgent procedures continued as expected. Additionally, it is noted after the initial pandemic wave that motility procedures increased. This phenomenon follows research showing increases in functional and mental health illnesses post pandemic. More research is needed to assess the health ramifications of the significant decline in procedures during the pandemic.","Dilwali, N.; Simmons, W.; Abramson, E.; Grinspan, Z.; Rose, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Pediatric+Gastrointestinal+Procedural+Patterns+during+the+Covid-19+Pandemic+in+New+York+City","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition; 75(Supplement 1):S188-S190, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39619,""
"Gender Disparities in Mental Health and Social Support among Glaucoma Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose : The mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic is thought to be substantial. Glaucoma patients are especially vulnerable considering prior reports of higher rates of anxiety and depression than the general population at baseline. In this study, we explore how measures of mental health and social support during the pandemic varied by gender among those diagnosed with glaucoma. Methods : We obtained a cohort of patients diagnosed with glaucoma (any type) from the NIH All of US Research Program. Answers from the latest COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) survey were used. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between reported depression (using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores), stress associated with social distancing, and measures of social support if one became sick with COVID-19 by self-reported gender (male, female, other). Multivariable models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, health insurance status, education, and income, with males as the reference group. Observations with missing values for covariates used in the models were dropped. Results : Of 3,675 glaucoma patients, 56.1% were female, 83.4% were non-Hispanic White, and 95.0% had insurance plans other than Medicaid or none. Many patients had a PHQ-9 score &gt;4 (33.5%), indicating mild, moderate, or severe depression, and 74.4% experienced â€œa lotâ€ or â€œsomeâ€ stress during the pandemic from social distancing. After adjusting for covariates, females were more likely to report depression (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.20-1.62) and stress associated with social distancing (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.14-1.57) than males. Further, females were less likely to report having help if they were sick with COVID-19 and needed someone to prepare meals (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.92) or help with daily chores (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.67-0.91). Conclusions : Females with glaucoma were more likely to experience depression, stress due to social distancing, and were less likely to have social support if sick with COVID-19 than their male counterparts. As measures of mental wellbeing and social support are associated with better medication adherence and health outcomes, glaucoma patients identifying as female may represent an especially vulnerable population. Efforts should be made to identify glaucoma patients experiencing hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Delavar, A.; Bu, J.; Saseendrakumar, B.

"Burnout and work engagement among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of satisfaction with job resources","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health challenge, particularly among frontline healthcare workers. This study examines the impact of satisfaction with job resources (leader-, task-, team-and organizational-level) on burnout and work engagement. Material(s) and Method(s): one-hundred and twenty-five healthcare workers (physicians, nur-ses) from a private health institution filled an anonymous online survey. Seventy-six participants were females. Result(s): Bivariate correlation and multiple regression analyses showed that satisfaction with job resources positively influences work engagement, and negatively influences burnout. In particular, regression analyses showed that burnout symptoms were mainly predicted by satisfaction with organizational resources (betaexhaustion =-.22;betacynicism =-.53) and work engagement was best predicted by satisfaction with task resources (betadedication = .45;betaabsorption = .34). Conclusion(s): Current findings point the value of satisfaction with job resources to protect the mental health of frontline healthcare workers during health crises and extreme work overload. Suggestions aimed at reducing burnout, promoting work engagement and protecting the well-being and mental health of healthcare workers during future public health crises are proposed.

"Patient Perspective of Telehealth for Retinal Disease during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose : Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has emerged as a safe and cost-effective alternative to traditional, in-person ophthalmology clinic visits. To better understand the implications of this technology on the patient-physician relationship, this study assessed patient perspectives about telemedicine to identify areas for improvement. Methods : A cross-sectional survey was distributed to patients at University Retina during July 2021. Responses regarding telehealth's ability to ease anxiety of contracting COVID-19, efficiency, patient education, quality of examination, and convenience were collected on a 5-point Likert scale. A positive attitude was defined as = 4 average Likert rating for all questions. Frequencies of positive attitudes were compared across demographic factors by the Pearson chi-square test. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate factors influencing patient preference for telehealth over traditional visits. Results : Of 103 respondents, most were female (53.8%), aged 65-74 (34.6%), and high school educated (46.2%). 38% of patients did not know their diagnosis and 62.1% had no prior history of telehealth usage. Overall, patients had a neutral attitude towards telehealth (mean Likert rating (SD) = 3.11/5 Â± 0.82). Nearly one-third (31%) preferred telehealth over face-to-face visits. Questions regarding â€œpatient educationâ€ had the greatest proportion of positive attitude, whereas â€œefficiencyâ€ had a largely negative attitude (both 63.1%). â€œConvenienceâ€ of telehealth yielded the highest number of responses in strong agreement or disagreement (38.9%). Patients with no history of telehealth usage more frequently reported negative attitudes compared to those with prior experience (87.5% vs. 71.8%, p = 0.046). Patients tended to respond more positively as education level increased, but this trend was not statistically significant (p = 0.18). On multivariate analysis, patients younger than 75 were more likely to prefer telehealth over in-person visits compared to patients 75 or older (odds ratio [OR] = 2.25, p = .007). Patient gender, knowledge of diagnosis, and history of past telehealth usage did not predict preference for telemedicine. Conclusions : Patients responded with a net neutral outlook on telehealth, indicating room for improvement. Efforts should focus on addressing technological inefficiencies and age-related barriers to patient satisfaction.","Chittaluru, N.; Bhagat, D.; Patel, P.; Sheth, V.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Patient+Perspective+of+Telehealth+for+Retinal+Disease+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science; 63(7):1390-A0086, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39622,""

"Risk factors for mental health in general population during SARS-COV2 pandemic: a systematic review","The COVID-19 pandemic and its social restrictions have affected mental health globally. This systematic review aims to analyze the psychological responses of the general population and its related sociodemographic risk factors, excluding the most vulnerable groups (e.g., healthcare workers, COVID-19 patients and survivors, pregnant women, people with chronic diseases or preexisting psychiatric disorders). A reproducible search from June 2020 to February 2021 was conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar, following the PRISMA guidelines. Papers that (1) considered the most at-risk populations, (2) did not report sociodemographic data, and (3) did not use validated scales were excluded from our analysis. Non-English papers and review articles were also excluded. Of 1116 papers identified, 25 were included for this review (n = 162,465). The main risk factors associated with the emergence of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder were: female gender, younger and later age, high level of education, Latino origin, free marital status, living quarantine in a house with no outdoor, negative coping strategies, close proximity to positive cases, high concern about contracting COVID-19 and living in a most affected area. High income, physical activity, resilience, family support, and a high level of knowledge about COVID-19, seems to be protective factors against the onset of psychological symptoms. In a general population, COVID-19 restrictions are linked to risk factors for psychological disorders caused by gender and sociodemographic conditions. In this regard governments should pay more attention to the publicâ€™s mental health and its risk and protective factors.","Biondi, Francesca, Liparoti, Marianna, Lacetera, Angelica, Sorrentino, Pierpaolo, Minino, Roberta","https://www.google.com/search?q=Risk+factors+for+mental+health+in+general+population+during+SARS-COV2+pandemic:+a+systematic+review","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Middle East Current Psychiatry, Ain Shams University; 29(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39624,""
"Quality of Chinese government environmental health information disclosure during COVID-19 pandemic: Satisfaction survey on University students","Government played a vital role during the COVID-19 pandemic by disclosing related environmental health information to the public. A satisfaction survey is often used to evaluate the public's satisfaction of the government's information disclosure while reflecting problems in the current disclosure system. As University students generally have better cognitive skills, they efficiently received related information during the pandemic, and therefore 717 questionnaires completed by University students were selected for this study. During the pandemic, the quality of the government's environmental health information disclosure system ranked at 13.89, marginally higher than average. Moreover, the timeliness and content adequacy of the disclosure system ranked at a level slightly above average. By adopting Hayes PROCESS Model 4 and 8, this study found that there is a direct impact of environmental health knowledge and environmental health awareness on satisfaction. Furthermore, University students' environmental health knowledge and awareness enhanced satisfaction through the mediating effect of self-reported environmental behavior. Finally, this study attempted to discover the conditions under which environmental health knowledge and awareness would have a greater direct and indirect influence on satisfaction, that is, the reverse moderating effect of household income level. In addition, this paper offers policy recommendations to enhance quality of government environmental health information disclosure system.","An, Ruikun, Wang, Feng, Hou, Yihan, Hideki, Kitagawa","https://www.google.com/search?q=Quality+of+Chinese+government+environmental+health+information+disclosure+during+COVID-19+pandemic:+Satisfaction+survey+on+University+students","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in public health; 10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39625,""

"Using a Quality-Driven Approach to Maintain an N-95 Respirator Supply During a Pandemic-Driven Global Shortage","Background: Reports of hospitals overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients created severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). In this large academic medical system, we used a systematic team approach to proactively maintain an adequate PPE supply. The team consisted of staff from multiple departments including infection prevention, environmental health and safety, operational efficiency, and supply chain. The healthcare system solicited donations of PPE, and our team was tasked with developing a sustainable method to provide healthcare workers with safe and effective N-95 respirators. Respirators are normally fitted to our 6,000+ healthcare workers through a fit-testing process using 4 models of N-95s. We received &gt;60 models, many in small quantities, posing a new level of complexity that prevented use of our typical fit-testing method. Methods: Donated respirators were manually verified on the CDC/NIOSH website to validate approval or approved alternative. A categorization system was developed, and respirators were sorted based on quality, style, and condition. User seal checks replaced qualitative fit testing due to the uncertain and quickly changing respirator supply. Staff were educated about the importance of performing a seal check to evaluate respirator fit and were provided instructions for what to do if they failed a seal check. We performed limited quantitative fit testing on a small group previously fit tested to 1 of the 4 models of N-95s normally stocked to identify the most effective alternative respirators to serve as substitute N-95s. Results: We were able to provide staff with new N-95s and delay the release of reprocessed N-95s. Overall, 18 models of respirators were tested on staff for filtration effectiveness and fit. We deemed 61% masks to be of last resort, and these were not released. We determined that 39% were acceptable as an alternative for at least 1 of our usual respirator models. However, only 3 models (17%) available in small quantities fit wearers whose size was in shortest supply. This scarcity led to the evaluation and purchase of a new respirator prototype for small N-95 wearers, which was an important success of our teamâ€™s work and for staff safety. Conclusions: Collaboration between teams from a variety of backgrounds, using both qualitative and quantitative data, resulted in a sustainable method for receiving, sorting, and evaluating donated N-95 respirators, ensuring the delivery of a steady supply of effective N-95 respirators to our staff. This quality-driven approach was an efficient and effective strategy to maintain our N-95 respirator supply during a pandemic driven global shortage.

"IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON BARRIERS TO DISPATCHER-ASSISTED CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION IN ADULT OUT-OF-HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARRESTS IN SINGAPORE","Fewer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. We investigated the impact of COVID-19 on barriers to dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR). We reviewed audio recordings of all calls to our national ambulance service call centre during the pandemic (January-June 2020) and pre-pandemic (January-June 2019) periods. Our primary outcome was the presence of barriers to DA-CPR. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the effect of COVID-19 on the likelihood of barriers to and performance of DA-CPR, adjusting for patient and event characteristics. There were 1241 and 1118 OHCA who were eligible for DA-CPR during the pandemic (median age 74 years, 61.6% males) and pre-pandemic (median age 73 years, 61.1% males) periods, respectively. Compared to pre-pandemic, there were more residential and witnessed OHCA during the pandemic (87% vs 84.9% and 54% vs 38.1%, respectively); rates of DA-CPR were unchanged (57.3% vs 61.1%). COVID-19 increased the likelihood of barriers to DA-CPR (aOR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.25-1.74) but not performance of DA-CPR (aOR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.73 - 1.02). Barriers such as 'patient status changed' and 'caller not with patient' increased during COVID-19 pandemic. 'Afraid to do CPR' markedly decreased during the pandemic; fear of COVID-19 transmission made up 0.5% of the barriers. Barriers to DA-CPR were encountered more frequently during the COVID-19 pandemic but did not affect callers' willingness to perform DA-CPR. Distancing measures led to more residential arrests with increases in certain barriers, highlighting opportunities for public education and intervention.

"[Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on the Utilization of Cancer Rehabilitation: a Difference-in-Differences Analysis]","Restricted access to rehabilitative care due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may affect the participation of cancer survivors and risks progression of the underlying disease. The aim of our analyses was to examined the extent to which cancer rehabilitations in Germany decreased due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data were retrieved from the German Pension Insurance which is the main provider for medical rehabilitation in Germany. We used monthly cross-sectional data on the utilization of cancer rehabilitation (Ca-rehab-services according to section 15 for working-aged people or section 31 social security code VI for pensioners) in 2019 and 2020. We used a difference-in-differences model to determine the reduction in rehabilitation utilization attributable to the pandemic and reported incidence rate ratios (IRR). We included 146,924 cancer rehabilitations in 2019 and 113,117 cancer rehabilitations in 2020. Compared to the previous year, the nationwide decline in cancer rehabilitations was greatest in April 2020 (63.2%). Utilization of cancer rehabilitation was reduced by 11.5% for benefits according to section 15 social security code VI (IRR=0.885; 95% CI: 0.864 to 0.906) and by 26.5% for benefits according to section 31 (IRR=0.735; 95% CI: 0.717 to 0.754) due to the pandemic. For pensioners the decline in utilization was more pronounced in Western Germany than in Eastern Germany and greater for non-post-acute rehabilitations than for post-acute rehabilitations. The analyses show a pandemic-related decline in cancer rehabilitations, especially in cancer rehabilitation services for pensioners. Failure to seek medical rehabilitation, through which physical and psychological recovery and relief from disease and treatment side effects can be achieved, will have a lasting impact on the participation for many cancer survivors. Repeated monitoring of work ability and health of chronically ill people could generate necessary data to clarify why people in need of rehabilitation have avoided seeking medical rehabilitation and how they can be supported. Der durch die SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie eingeschrÃƒÂ¤nkte Zugang zur rehabilitativen Versorgung kann die Teilhabe von Menschen mit Krebserkrankungen beeintrÃƒÂ¤chtigen und birgt die Gefahr einer Progression der zugrundeliegenden Erkrankung. Ziel unserer Analysen war es zu beschreiben, in welchem Umfang die Inanspruchnahme onkologischer Rehabilitation pandemiebedingt zurÃƒÂ¼ckgegangen ist. Wir nutzten monatliche Querschnittsdaten von der Deutschen Rentenversicherung zur Inanspruchnahme onkologischer Rehabilitation (Ca-Reha-Leistung nach Ã‚Â§ 15 fÃƒÂ¼r Versicherte im erwerbsfÃƒÂ¤higen Alter oder Ã‚Â§ 31 Abs. 1 Nr. 2 SGB VI fÃƒÂ¼r Rentner) in den Jahren 2019 und 2020. Mit einem Difference-in-Differences-Modell schÃƒÂ¤tzten wir die auf die Pandemie zurÃƒÂ¼ckzufÃƒÂ¼hrende Reduktion der Inanspruchnahme onkologischer Rehabilitation. Als Difference-in-Differences-SchÃƒÂ¤tzer wurde das Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) berechnet. Wir berÃƒÂ¼cksichtigten 146.924 onkologische Rehabilitationen im Jahr 2019 und 113.117 Leistungen im Jahr 2020. Die Inanspruchnahme onkologischer Rehabilitation reduzierte sich pandemiebedingt um 11,5% bei Leistungen nach Ã‚Â§ 15 SGB VI (IRR=0,885; 95% KI: 0,864 bis 0,906) und um 26,5% bei Leistungen nach Ã‚Â§ 31 (IRR=0,735; 95% KI: 0,717 bis 0,754). Bei Ca-Reha-Leistungen nach Ã‚Â§ 31 war der RÃƒÂ¼ckgang in den alten BundeslÃƒÂ¤ndern hÃƒÂ¶her als in den neuen BundeslÃƒÂ¤ndern und fÃƒÂ¼r allgemeine Antragsverfahren deutlich stÃƒÂ¤rker als fÃƒÂ¼r Anschlussrehabilitationen. Die Analysen zeigen einen pandemiebedingten RÃƒÂ¼ckgang onkologischer Rehabilitation vor allem bei onkologischen Rehabilitationsleistungen fÃƒÂ¼r Rentner nach Ã‚Â§ 31. Der Verzicht auf die durch medizinische Rehabilitation erreichbare kÃƒÂ¶rperliche und psychische Erholung und Linderung von Krankheits- und Behandlungsnebenwirkungen wird fÃƒÂ¼r viele an Krebs erkrankte Personen mit einer VerschÃƒÂ¤rfung von TeilhabeeinschrÃƒÂ¤nkungen einhergehen. Ein wiederholtes Monitoring von ArbeitsfÃƒÂ¤higkeit und Gesundheit chronisch kranker Menschen kÃƒÂ¶nnte erforderliche Daten generieren, um zu klÃƒÂ¤ren, warum rehabilitationsbedÃƒÂ¼rftige Menschen von der Inanspruchnahme onkologischer Rehabilitation Abstand genommen haben und wie sie unterstÃƒÂ¼tzt werden kÃƒÂ¶nnen.","Fauser, Banaschak, Zollmann, Streibelt, Bethge","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1936-4083","20221024","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39633,""
"The experience of individuals affected by Australia's international border closure during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study explored the experiences of individuals who reported being negatively affected by Australia's international border closure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative data from 1930 adults who responded to a cross-sectional online survey exploring the mental health and wellbeing of individuals affected by border closure were analysed using theoretical thematic analysis, drawing on understandings of the relationship between place and wellbeing. Four themes were identified: 'Disconnection from family and social connections', 'Disconnection from a sense of home and belonging', 'Disconnection and sense of self', and 'A desire for reconnection'. Results provide a rich illustration of the relationship between disconnection from place and wellbeing during COVID-19 and highlight the need to support those affected and consider these adverse effects in future public health planning.","Oster, Ali, Iasiello, Muir-Cochrane, Fassnacht","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2022.102928","20221024","COVID-19; Coronavirus; International border closures; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39634,""
"Understanding How the Design and Implementation of Online Consultations Affect Primary Care Quality: Systematic Review of Evidence With Recommendations for Designers, Providers, and Researchers","Online consultations (OCs) allow patients to contact their care providers on the web. Worldwide, OCs have been rolled out in primary care rapidly owing to policy initiatives and COVID-19. There is a lack of evidence regarding how OC design and implementation influence care quality. We aimed to synthesize research on the impacts of OCs on primary care quality, and how these are influenced by system design and implementation. We searched databases from January 2010 to February 2022. We included quantitative and qualitative studies of real-world OC use in primary care. Quantitative data were transformed into qualitative themes. We used thematic synthesis informed by the Institute of Medicine domains of health care quality, and framework analysis informed by the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability framework. Strength of evidence was judged using the GRADE-CERQual approach. We synthesized 63 studies from 9 countries covering 31 OC systems, 14 (22%) of which used artificial intelligence; 41% (26/63) of studies were published from 2020 onward, and 17% (11/63) were published after the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no quantitative evidence for negative impacts of OCs on patient safety, and qualitative studies suggested varied perceptions of their safety. Some participants believed OCs improved safety, particularly when patients could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload decreased when sufficient resources were allocated to implement OCs and patients used them for simple problems or could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload increased when OCs were not integrated with other software or organizational workflows and patients used them for complex queries. OC systems that required patients to describe their queries using multiple-choice questionnaires increased workload for patients and staff. Health costs decreased when patients used OCs for simple queries and increased when patients used them for complex queries. Patients using OCs were more likely to be female, younger, and native speakers, with higher socioeconomic status. OCs increased primary care access for patients with mental health conditions, verbal communication difficulties, and barriers to attending in-person appointments. Access also increased by providing a timely response to patients' queries. Patient satisfaction increased when using OCs owing to better primary care access, although it decreased when using multiple-choice questionnaire formats. This is the first theoretically informed synthesis of research on OCs in primary care and includes studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contributes new knowledge that, in addition to having positive impacts on care quality such as increased access, OCs also have negative impacts such as increased workload. Negative impacts can be mitigated through appropriate OC system design (eg, free text format), incorporation of advanced technologies (eg, artificial intelligence), and integration into technical infrastructure (eg, software) and organizational workflows (eg, timely responses).

"The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic on abortion access and pre-abortion mental health in Shanghai","To understand the barriers to abortion during the COVID-19 epidemic in Shanghai, and to compare the pre-abortion mental health status before and during the crisis. In this case-control study, two groups of women seeking abortion (age Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, gestational age &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°98Ã¢â‚¬â€°days) were recruited from March to September, 2021 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1070) and from February to April, 2022 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 625). The evaluation included COVID-19 related abortion stress questions, Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R) questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Family Environment Scale Chinese version (FES-CV). The researchers conducted interviews and collected questionnaires. The median gestational age at abortion among women during the pandemic was 65Ã¢â‚¬â€°days, compared with 51Ã¢â‚¬â€°days in the pre-pandemic group (P &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Anxiety and depression symptoms increased during the crisis (P &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Sleep disturbances were more common. Higher PSQI scores were related to increased anxiety and depression symptoms. A more negative family climate with was described during the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, abortion access has been delayed and pre-abortion mental disorders have increased. More attention should be paid to the mental health of women seeking abortions, and innovations should be promoted to ensure abortion services without delay.","Zhang, Wang, Wang, Zhang, Shan, Li","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.14516","20221024","abortion; family environment; mental health; sleep disorder; the coronavirus disease 2019","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39636,""
"How Are You Feeling? Interpretation of Emotions through Facial Expressions of People Wearing Different Personal Protective Equipment: An Observational Study","(1) Background: The perception of others' emotions based on non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, is fundamental for interpersonal communication and mutual support. Using personal protection equipment (PPE) in a work environment during the SAR-CoV-2 pandemic challenged health professionals' ability to recognise emotions and expressions while wearing PPE. The working hypothesis of this study was that the increased limitation of facial visibility, due to the use of a personal protective device, would interfere with the perception of basic emotions in the participants. (2) Methods: Through a cross-sectional descriptive study, the present research aimed to analyse the identification of four basic emotions (happiness; sadness; fear/surprise; and disgust/anger) through three types of PPE (FFP2 respirator, protective overall and powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR)), by using 32 photographs. The study was conducted using volunteer participants who met the inclusion criteria (individuals older than 13 without cognitive limitations). Participants had to recognise the emotions of actors in photographs that were randomly displayed in an online form. (3) Results: In general, the 690 participants better recognised happiness and fear, independently of the PPE utilised. Women could better identify different emotions, along with university graduates and young and middle-aged adults. Emotional identification was at its worst when the participants wore protective overalls (5.42 Ã‚Â± 1.22), followed by the PAPR (5.83 Ã‚Â± 1.38); the best scores were obtained using the FFP2 masks (6.57 Ã‚Â± 1.20). Sadness was the least recognised emotion, regardless of age. (4) Conclusions: The personal protective devices interfere in the recognition of emotions, with the protective overalls having the greatest impact, and the FFP2 mask the least. The emotions that were best recognised were happiness and fear/surprise, while the least recognised emotion was sadness. Women were better at identifying emotions, as well as participants with higher education, and young and middle-aged adults.","DÃƒÂ­az-Agea, Pujalte-JesÃƒÂºs, Arizo-Luque, GarcÃƒÂ­a-MÃƒÂ©ndez, LÃƒÂ³pez-Chicheri-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Rojo-Rojo","https://doi.org/10.3390/nursrep12040075","20221024","coronavirus infections; expressed emotion; health personnel; professional burnout; protective devices","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39637,""
"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on weight gain, physical activity and mental health among Turkish university students","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many restrictions that affected Turkey as well as other countries around the world. Restrictions on education, sports activities and social activities affected students physically and psychologically. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on weight gain, physical activity, and mental health among university students. The study included students of Pamukkale University aged between 18-25 years. Participants answered the online survey about changes in body composition and physical activity habits during the pandemic. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to assess physical activity levels. Beck Depression Scale (BDS) was used to assess the mental health. 848 (546 females, 302 males) students average aged 20,72Ã‚Â±1,63 years were included in the study. When the physical activity times before and during the pandemic were compared, a statistically significant difference was found (pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). Multivariate analyses showed that higher BDS scores (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.000) were significantly associated with increased weight gain. But there was no significant association with age and changes in physical activity time. The results of the study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has a negative effect on the physical activity level, weight gain and mental health of university students. Students reported an increase in weight during the pandemic. Also, the increase in depressive symptoms is related to higher levels of weight gain. Therefore, physical activity and mental health programmes should be offered to university students as an educational and health policy.","Soysal, Ã…Å¾imÃ…Å¸ek, Ãƒâ€“zdemir, Aslan","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-211161","20221024","Body composition; coronavirus; depression; restrictions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39638,""

"The Silent Pandemic: the Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Adolescents Living with HIV","The pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in millions of confirmed cases and likely more than six million deaths globally Worldometer (2022). We sought to understand secondary mental effects in adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) on the African continent caused by lockdowns, school closures, and other restriction measures for infection control. We reviewed the broader literature and conducted 86 retrospective chart reviews of mental health disorders of ALHIV and interventions utilized at a pediatric clinic in Eswatini. ALHIVs are disproportionately affected by mental health disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated adverse mental health outcomes of adolescents on the African continent, especially for ALHIV. There have been many calls for researchers, clinicians, and governments to prioritize mental health in adolescents going forward. In pediatric clinics in Eswatini, Malawi, and Uganda, there were psychosocial measures in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic for ALHIV. After looking closely at a pediatric clinic in Eswatini, we found that many interventions were paused and new psychosocial interventions compatible with social distancing were instead utilized by clinicians. Even so, after multidisciplinary management comprising of interventions such as psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, referral to psychologists/psychiatrists, and enrollment in peer support groups, the PHQ-9 depressions scores of ALHIV during the COVID-19 significantly improved.

"The neglect of researchers during the first COVID-19 pandemic induced national lockdown in India: inside the lives of JNU's research scholars","This p aper discusses the main findings of a study on the impact of the first COVID-19 induced nationwide lockdown and university closure in India on theÃ‚Â research scholars (PhD and MPhil)Ã‚Â ofÃ‚Â the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). An online survey was employed using the quantitative descriptive methodology. With responses from 530 research scholars, this is one of the first quantitative studies to assess the pandemic's effect on the research work, finances, and mental health of researchers in India from March to June 2020. Given the existing social inequality in higher education, the survey reflects the researchers' dismal state of reality as reported during the first 4Ã‚Â months of the pandemic. Research work witnessed a standstill with large-scale disruption in travel and every other scholar encountering unreliable electricity or internet connectivity. Untimely disbursal of fellowships intensified their already existing financial hardship. Nearly 90% of scholars reported stalled fieldwork, aÃ‚Â lack of clarity regarding extension of their research programme, and financial woes as some of the top reasons for theirÃ‚Â anxiety. Using the chi-square method, the study predicts that dropouts from research programmes are likely in the context of the pandemic, which correlates significantly with socio-economic backgrounds (caste, class and gender) of research scholars. Further, theÃ‚Â results show that theÃ‚Â challenges faced by terminal, mid-stage, and course-work scholars are unique, emphasizing on the need forÃ‚Â targeted interventions beyond extended research deadlines. Non-addressal of these immediate effectsÃ‚Â of the COVID-19 pandemic will have long-term repercussionsÃ‚Â on the lives of India's researchers and academic workers. It will onlyÃ‚Â deepen existing inequalities in higher education, leading to gentrification of research degrees in India.

"Emotional Analysis of Tweets About Clinically Extremely Vulnerable COVID-19 Groups","Background Clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) individuals have a significantly higher risk of morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This high risk is due toÃ‚Â predispositions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, or extreme age (Ã¢â€°Â¥75). The initial COVID-19 preventive measures (use of face masks, social distancing, social bubbles) and vaccine allocation prioritized this group of vulnerable individuals to ensure their continued protection. However, as countries start relaxing the lockdown measures to help prevent socio-economic collapse, the impact of this relaxation on CEVs is once again brought to light. In this study, we set out to understand the impact of policy changes on the lives of CEVs by analyzing Twitter data with the hashtag #highriskcovid used by many high-risk individuals to tweet about and express their opinions and feelings. Methodology Tweets were extracted from the Twitter API between March 01, 2022, and April 21, 2022, using the Twarc2 tool. Extracted tweets were inÃ‚Â English and included the hashtagÃ‚Â #highriskcovid. We evaluated the most frequently used words and hashtagsÃ‚Â by calculating term frequency-inverse document frequency, and the location of tweets using the tidygeocoder package (method = osm). We also evaluated the sentiments and emotions depicted by these tweets using the National Research Council sentiment lexicon of the Syuzhet package. Finally, we used the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm to determine relevant high-risk COVID-19 themes. Results The vast majority of the tweets originated from the United States (64%), Canada (22%), and the United Kingdom (4%). The most common hashtags were #highriskcovid (25.5%), #covid (6.82%), #immunocompromised (4.93%), #covidisnotover (4.0%), and #Maskup (1.40%), and the most frequently used words were immunocompromised (1.64%), people (1.4%), disabled (0.97%), maskup (0.85%), and eugenics (0.85%). The tweets were more negative (19.27%) than positive, and the most expressed negative emotions were fear (13.62%) and sadness (12.47%). At the same time, trust was the most expressed positive emotion and was used in relation to belief in masks, policies, and health workers to help. Finally, we detected frequently co-tweeted words such asmass and disaster, deadly and disabling, high and risk, public and health, immunocompromised and people, mass and disaster, and deadly and disabling. Conclusions TheÃ‚Â study provides evidence regarding the concerns and fears of high-risk COVID-19 groups as expressed via social media. It is imperative that further policies be implemented to specifically protect the health and mental wellness of high-risk individuals (for example, incorporating sentiment analyses of high-risk COVID-19 individuals such as this paperÃ‚Â to inform the evaluation of already implemented preventive measures and policies). In addition, considerable work needs to be done to educate the public on high-risk individuals.","Awoyemi, Ogunniyi, Adejumo, Ebili, Olusanya, Olojakpoke, Shonibare","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29323","20221024","cevs; covid-19; face masks; healthcare policy; highriskcovid; sentiment analysis; twitter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39642,""
"A Framework for the Implementation of Digital Mental Health Interventions: The Importance of Feasibility and Acceptability Research","Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have the potential to serve a significantly wider portion of the population in need of mental health services. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has especially highlighted the exacerbation of mental health disparities among minoritized populations. Innovations and research on DMHIs continue to expand, reinforcing the need for a more systemic process of DMHI implementation. In practice, DMHI implementation often skips the fundamental steps of conducting acceptability and feasibility studies. We propose a DMHI implementation framework that identifies an acceptability and feasibility study as an essential first step, simultaneously centering equitable processes that address populations disproportionately affected by mental illness.","Park, Nicksic Sigmon, Boeldt","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29329","20221024","acceptability; digital mental health; feasibility; implementation; mental health; mental health technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39643,""
"Psychological Assessment of Family Caregivers of Patients With COVID-19 in the United States of America and India","Background and objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the shortcomings worldwide in terms of preparedness protocols related to epidemics. A key area of research that is evidently overlooked across the globe is the mental health of family caregivers taking care of patients with COVID-19. In light of this, this studyÃ‚Â aimed to engage in a comparative analysis between the two worst affected countries, India and the United States of America (USA), which differ considerably in their demography, socio-epidemiological factors, and health system efficiency. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,250 family caregivers of patients with COVID-19 in India and the USA to assess their stress, anxiety, and sleep disturbance levels using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Psychological assessment questionnaires were administered through online mode, which gathered demographic information and responses on several self-reporting scales. The main outcome measures were self-reported ratings onÃ‚Â PSS, GAD-7Ã‚Â scale, and PSQI. Results WeÃ‚Â found that 75.4% of the family members of COVID-19 patients suffered from mental health issues. The scores of all three scales were higher in caregivers from the USA than in India,Ã‚Â more evident and pronounced in caregivers of hospitalized patients. The test scores were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) indicating a negative impact of having a dependent member in the family, being married, being of younger age, and having a longer duration of COVID-19 infection. Vaccines were found to have a life-enhancing effect. Conclusion Our findings highlight that the mental health of family caregivers is an ignored aspect and must be addressed. We recommend the implementation of well-researched and appropriate legislation, treatment programs, and health policies that involve not only the patients but also their families.","Sethi, Kaiwan, Bassiony, Vora, Agarwal, Gajwani, Garg, Sai, Prakash, Gohel, Roy","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29267","20221024","anxiety; covid; families of covid patients; family caregivers; sleep disturbances; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39644,""
"Relations of Adolescent Knowledge of COVID-19, Social Media Engagement, and Experiences During Quarantine/Lockdown with Well-Being","This study investigated the relations of adolescent COVID-19 knowledge, quarantine/lockdown experiences, and social media use with indices of their psychosocial adjustment. The sample consisted of 215 adolescents from throughout the United States, with adolescents ranging from ages 14 to 17. Better knowledge of COVID-19 was related to lower loneliness, stress, anxiety, depression, and fear of missing out (FoMO). Higher parent-reported restrictions during quarantine were associated with these difficulties as well. Further, the lowest anxiety was reported for adolescents with good COVID-19 knowledge who also checked social media relatively less frequently. The findings point to the importance of accurate information about COVID-19 for adolescents and the impact of quarantine/lockdown experiences on their perceived emotional and social adjustment.","Mousavi, Barry, Halter","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-022-02465-0","20221024","Adolescence; COVID-19; Quarantine; Social media engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39645,""

"<b>Academic stress and depression among vietnamese adolescents: a moderated mediation model of life satisfaction and resilience</b>","Academic stress is rising among high school students, especially in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, such as social distancing, long-term online learning, and lack of social support. Many studies have also shown that students with high levels of academic stress have a higher risk of depression. However, very few researchers are interested in studying life satisfaction as a moderate factor for the indirect relationship between academic stress and depression. This study investigated whether life satisfaction factors moderate the indirect effect of academic stress on the depressive disorder in Vietnam adolescents. Participants include 1336 Vietnamese adolescents. Participants completed the Educational Stress Scale for Adolescents, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. Moderated mediation analyses were conducted using the PROCESS macro to investigate the relationship among variables. In the relationship between academic stress and depressive disorder in Vietnamese adolescents, resilience is partly mediated; life satisfaction significantly moderated the indirect effect of academic stress on depressive disorder. This study suggests that depressive disorders prevention and intervention practices for adolescents need to consider enhancing resilience and life satisfaction.","Ho, Nguyen, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03661-3","20221024","Academic stress; Adolescents; Depression; Life satisfaction; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39647,""

"Prevalence of psychological symptoms and associated risk factors among nurses in 30 provinces during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","With the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), nurses have won well-deserved recognition for their indispensable roles in providing humane and professional healthcare for patients. However, by the nature of their role working at the forefront of patient care, nurses are prone to experiencing mental health consequences. Therefore, we pay attention to measuring the magnitude of psychological symptoms and identifying associated factors among nurses in China. We launched a nationwide, cross-sectional survey of nurses who worked in secondary or tertiary hospitals and public or private hospitals from 30 provinces in China. The prevalence and severity of symptoms of burnout, depression, and anxiety were investigated, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with each psychological symptom. A total of 138 279 respondents who worked in 243 hospitals completed this survey. A substantial proportion of nurses reported symptoms of burnout (34%), depression (55Ã‚Â·5%), and anxiety (41Ã‚Â·8%). In line with the disproportionality of economic development, we noted that the middle or western region was an independent risk factor for depression and anxiety. Compared with those working in the secondary hospital, nurses who worked in tertiary hospitals were associated with a higher likelihood of burnout and depression. Nurses are experiencing emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion during the COVID-19 epidemic. Governments and health policymakers need to draw attention to reinforcing prevention and ameliorating countermeasures to safeguard nurses' health.

"Trends and factors associated with change in COVID-19 vaccination intent among residents and staff in six Seattle homeless shelters, March 2020 to August 2021","Achieving high COVID-19 vaccination coverage in homeless shelters is critical in preventing morbidity, mortality, and outbreaks, however, vaccination coverage remains lower among people experiencing homelessness (PEH) than the general population. We conducted a cross-sectional study to retrospectively describe attitudes and identify factors associated with change in COVID-19 vaccination intent among shelter residents and staff during March 2020 - August 2021. To identify factors associated with change in COVID-19 vaccine intent becoming more positive overall compared to other attitudes, we utilized a Poisson model to calculate Risk Ratios with robust standard errors, adjusting for confounding by shelter site and demographic variables determined <i>a priori</i>. From July 12 - August 2, 2021, 97 residents and 20 staff participated in surveys across six shelters in Seattle King County, Washington. Intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 increased from 45.3% (n=53) when recalling attitudes in March 2020 to 74.4% (n=87) as of August 2021, and was similar among residents and staff. Many participants (43.6%, n=51) indicated feeling increasingly accepting about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine since March 2020, while 13.7% (n=16) changed back and forth, 10.3% (n=12) became more hesitant, and 32.5% (n=38) had no change in intent. In the model examining the relationship between becoming more positive about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine compared to all other attitudes (n=116), we found a 57.2% increase in vaccine acceptability (RR 1.57; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.45) among those who reported worsening mental health since the start of the pandemic. Findings highlight opportunities to improve communication with residents and staff about COVID-19 vaccination and support a need for continued dialogue and a person-centered approach to understanding the sociocultural complexities and dynamism of vaccine attitudes at shelters.<b>Clinical Trial Registry Number</b>: NCT04141917.","Cox, Rogers, Thuo, Meehan, Link, Lo, Manns, Chow, Al Achkar, Hughes, Rolfes, Mosites, Chu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvacx.2022.100232","20221024","COVID-19; Health Inequities; Homeless; SARS-CoV-2; Shelter; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39650,""
"The impact of diet and lifestyle on wellbeing in adults during COVID-19 lockdown","A healthy diet and lifestyle may protect against adverse mental health outcomes, which is especially crucial during stressful times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This preregistered longitudinal online study explored whether diet and lifestyle (physical activity, sleep, and social interactions) were associated with wellbeing and mood during a light lockdown in Germany. Participants (<i>N</i> = 117, 72 males; 28 Ã‚Â± 9 years old) answered mental health and lifestyle questionnaires (social connections, sleep, activity) followed by submitting 1 week of food and mood-lifestyle diary (food intake, positive and negative mood, mental wellbeing, sleep quality, physical activity level, quantity and quality of social interactions) <i>via</i> a smartphone app. We used multivariate linear and mixed-effects models to associate mood and wellbeing with dietary components and lifestyle factors. Interindividual analyses revealed that sleep and social interaction significantly impacted mood and wellbeing. Interestingly, fruit and vegetable intake correlated with wellbeing, even when controlling for all lifestyle factors. Fruit and vegetable intake also significantly correlated with daily fluctuations in wellbeing within individuals next to sleep, physical activity, and social interactions. We observed gender differences in fruit and vegetable intake and anxiety levels. Our results emphasize the importance of diet contributing to individual wellbeing, even in the challenging times of a pandemic. Future research is necessary to test if our findings could extend to other populations.","Muth, Losecaat Vermeer, Terenzi, Park","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.993180","20221024","COVID-19; activity; eating behavior; gender; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39651,""
"Anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","In this study, we examined the level of anxiety and depression, daytime sleepiness, and sleep quality in healthcare workers working during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was conducted in a tertiary care university hospital. Socio-demographic information form, Beck Anxiety Scale, Beck Depression Scale, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were used as data collection tools. A total of 273 healthcare workers were recruited into the study. It was determined that there is an enormous mental health burden on healthcare workers. About 100% and 45.4% of the participants got above-threshold scores from Beck Anxiety Scale, and Beck Depression Scale, and the prevalence of daytime sleepiness and impaired sleep quality was 11.4% and 38.8%, respectively. The female gender was found to have more severe anxiety levels and lower sleep quality (p&lt;0.001). In logistic regression analysis, the female gender was a risk factor for having a level of severe anxiety, and the nursing profession was a risk factor for having severe anxiety and low sleep quality (p&lt;0.05). Global serious outbreaks cause increased depression and anxiety levels and sleep disorders in healthcare workers. Therefore, we believe that trainings and support which aims to strengthen the psychological well-being of healthcare workers should be implemented.","Icten, Solakoglu, Uluk, Cag, Aciksari, Guner, Karakis","https://doi.org/10.14744/nci.2022.06936","20221024","Anxiety; COVID-19; Pittsburg sleep quality index; depression; epworth daytime sleepiness scale; healthcare workers; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39652,""
"The neurobiology of childhood trauma, from early physical pain onwards: as relevant as ever in today's fractured world","<b>Background:</b> The situation in the world today, encompassing multiple armed conflicts, notably in Ukraine, the Coronavirus pandemic and the effects of climate change, increases the likelihood of childhood exposure to physical injury and pain. Other effects of these worldwide hardships include poverty, malnutrition and starvation, also bringing with them other forms of trauma, including emotional harm, neglect and deliberate maltreatment. <b>Objective:</b> To review the neurobiology of the systems in the developing brain that are most affected by physical and emotional trauma and neglect. <b>Method:</b> The review begins with those that mature first, such as the somatosensory system, progressing to structures that have a more protracted development, including those involved in cognition and emotional regulation. Explored next are developing stress response systems, especially the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and its central regulator, corticotropin-releasing hormone. Also examined are reward and anti-reward systems and genetic versus environmental influences. The behavioural consequences of interpersonal childhood trauma, focusing on self-harm and suicide, are also surveyed briefly. Finally, pointers to effective treatment are proffered. <b>Results:</b> The low-threshold nature of circuitry in the developing brain and lack of inhibitory connections therein result in heightened excitability, making the consequences of both physical and emotional trauma more intense. Sensitive and critical periods in the development of structures such as the amygdala render the nervous system more vulnerable to insults occurring at those points, increasing the likelihood of psychiatric disorders, culminating in self-harm and even suicide. <b>Conclusion:</b> In view of the greater excitability of the developing nervous system, and its vulnerability to physical and psychological injuries, the review ends with an exhortation to consider the long-term consequences of childhood trauma, often underestimated or missed altogether when faced with adults suffering mental health problems. <b>Antecedentes:</b> La situaciÃƒÂ³n en el mundo actual, que abarca mÃƒÂºltiples conflictos armados, mayormente en Ucrania, la pandemia del Coronavirus y los efectos del cambio climÃƒÂ¡tico, aumenta la probabilidad de exposiciÃƒÂ³n infantil a lesiones fÃƒÂ­sicas y dolor. Otros efectos de estas dificultades mundiales incluyen pobreza, desnutriciÃƒÂ³n y hambruna, tambiÃƒÂ©n traen consigo otras formas de trauma, incluyendo daÃƒÂ±o emocional, negligencia y maltrato deliberado.<b>Objetivo:</b> Revisar la neurobiologÃƒÂ­a de los sistemas en el cerebro en desarrollo que se ven mÃƒÂ¡s afectados por el trauma fÃƒÂ­sico y emocional y la negligencia.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo:</b> La revisiÃƒÂ³n comienza con aquellos que maduran primero, como el sistema somatosensorial, progresando hacia estructuras que tienen un desarrollo mÃƒÂ¡s prolongado, incluidas las involucradas en la cogniciÃƒÂ³n y regulaciÃƒÂ³n emocional. A continuaciÃƒÂ³n se exploraron los sistemas de respuesta al estrÃƒÂ©s en desarrollo, especialmente el eje hipotÃƒÂ¡lamo-hipÃƒÂ³fisis-adrenal y su regulador central, la hormona liberadora de corticotrofina. TambiÃƒÂ©n se examinaron los sistemas de recompensa y anti-recompensa e influencias genÃƒÂ©ticas versus ambientales. Tambien se investigaron brevemente, las consecuencias conductuales del trauma infantil interpersonal, centrÃƒÂ¡ndose en las autolesiones y suicidio. Finalmente, se ofrecieron indicaciones para un tratamiento eficaz.<b>Resultados:</b> La naturaleza de bajo umbral de los circuitos en el cerebro en desarrollo y la falta de conexiones inhibitorias en ellos dan como resultado una mayor excitabilidad, lo que hace que las consecuencias del trauma fÃƒÂ­sico y emocional sean mÃƒÂ¡s intensas. Los periodos crÃƒÂ­ticos y sensibles en el desarrollo de estructuras como la amÃƒÂ­gdala hacen que el sistema nervioso sea mÃƒÂ¡s vulnerable a las agresiones que ocurren en esos puntos, lo que aumenta la probabilidad de trastornos psiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos, culminando en autolesiones e incluso suicidio.<b>ConclusiÃƒÂ³n:</b> En vista de la mayor excitabilidad del sistema nervioso en desarrollo y su vulnerabilidad a las lesiones fÃƒÂ­sicas y psicolÃƒÂ³gicas, la revisiÃƒÂ³n termina con una exhortaciÃƒÂ³n a considerar las consecuencias a largo plazo del trauma infantil, con frecuencia subestimado o ignorado totalmente cuando nos enfrentamos con adultos que sufren de problemas de salud mental. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¥Â½â€œÃ¤Â»Å Ã¤Â¸â€“Ã§â€¢Å’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â±â‚¬Ã¥Å Â¿Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã§Â§ÂÃ¦Â­Â¦Ã¨Â£â€¦Ã¥â€ Â²Ã§ÂªÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â°Â¤Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¹Å’Ã¥â€¦â€¹Ã¥â€¦Â°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥â‚¬â„¢Ã¦â€Â¹Ã¥ÂËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã§Â«Â¥Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã¨ÂºÂ«Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥Â®Â³Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€“Â¼Ã§â€”â€ºÃ¦Å¡Â´Ã©Å“Â²Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥â€¦Â¨Ã§ÂÆ’Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¨Â´Â«Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨ÂÂ¥Ã¥â€¦Â»Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¨â€°Â¯Ã¥â€™Å’Ã©Â¥Â¥Ã©Â¥Â¿Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â¿ËœÃ¥Â¸Â¦Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¥Â½Â¢Ã¥Â¼ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥Â®Â³Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¿Â½Ã¨Â§â€ Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨â€œâ€žÃ¦â€žÂÃ¨â„¢ÂÃ¥Â¾â€¦Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã§Â»Â¼Ã¨Â¿Â°Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¨ÂºÂ«Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¿Â½Ã¨Â§â€ Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¦Å“â‚¬Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¨â€žâ€˜Ã§Â³Â»Ã§Â»Å¸Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§Â»ÂÃ§â€Å¸Ã§â€°Â©Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã§Â»Â¼Ã¨Â¿Â°Ã¤Â»Å½Ã¥â€¦Ë†Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ§â€ Å¸Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ¥Â¼â‚¬Ã¥Â§â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¥Â¦â€šÃ¤Â½â€œÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã§Â³Â»Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§â€žÂ¶Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¥Â±â€¢Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¤Â¹â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å’â€¦Ã¦â€¹Â¬Ã¦Â¶â€°Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¨Â®Â¤Ã§Å¸Â¥Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã§Â»ÂªÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã¨Å â€šÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å½Â¥Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¥Âºâ€Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã§Â³Â»Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â°Â¤Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã¤Â¸ËœÃ¨â€žâ€˜-Ã¥Å¾â€šÃ¤Â½â€œ-Ã¨â€šÂ¾Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¨â€¦ÂºÃ¨Â½Â´Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦Å¾Â¢Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¨Å â€šÃ¥â€°â€šÃ¤Â¿Æ’Ã¨â€šÂ¾Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¨â€¦ÂºÃ§Å¡Â®Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã§Â´Â Ã©â€¡Å Ã¦â€Â¾Ã¦Â¿â‚¬Ã§Â´Â Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¿ËœÃ¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Â¥â€“Ã¨ÂµÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Â¥â€“Ã¨ÂµÂÃ§Â³Â»Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã©Ââ€”Ã¤Â¼Â Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§Å½Â¯Ã¥Â¢Æ’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¿ËœÃ§Â®â‚¬Ã¥Ââ€¢Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã§Â«Â¥Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ©â„¢â€¦Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§â€šÂ¹Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¦Ââ‚¬Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“â‚¬Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦ÂÂÃ¥â€¡ÂºÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â»ÂºÃ¨Â®Â®Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã¨â€žâ€˜Ã§Å½Â¯Ã¨Â·Â¯Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â½Å½Ã©ËœË†Ã¥â‚¬Â¼Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¨Â´Â¨Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§Â¼ÂºÃ¤Â¹ÂÃ¦Å â€˜Ã¥Ë†Â¶Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¨Â¿Å¾Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã¥â€¦Â´Ã¥Â¥â€¹Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã¨ÂºÂ«Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¦Å¾Å“Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Å Â Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ§Æ’Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦ÂÂÃ¤Â»ÂÃ¦Â Â¸Ã§Â­â€°Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¢ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã©â€Â®Ã©ËœÂ¶Ã¦Â®ÂµÃ¤Â½Â¿Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§Â»ÂÃ§Â³Â»Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ©Æ’Â¨Ã¤Â½ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦ÂÅ¸Ã¤Â¼Â¤Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¦Ëœâ€œÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Å½Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¥Â¢Å¾Ã¥Å Â Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¤Â¸Å Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å“â‚¬Ã§Â»Ë†Ã¥Â¯Â¼Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¦Â®â€¹Ã§â€Å¡Ã¨â€¡Â³Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¦Ââ‚¬Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã©â€°Â´Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â¥Å¾Ã§Â»ÂÃ§Â³Â»Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¥â€¦Â·Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â´Ã¥Â¥â€¹Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨ÂºÂ«Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥Â®Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Ëœâ€œÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â»Â¼Ã¨Â¿Â°Ã¦Å“â‚¬Ã§Â»Ë†Ã¥Â»ÂºÃ¨Â®Â®Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã§Â«Â¥Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©â€¢Â¿Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â½â€œÃ©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã©ÂÂ­Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Ë†ÂÃ¥Â¹Â´Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã¤Â½Å½Ã¤Â¼Â°Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã¥Â¿Â½Ã§â€¢Â¥Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Campbell","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2022.2131969","20221025","Development; childhood; neglect; neurobiology; pain; trauma; Child; Adult; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Child Abuse; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone; Pain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39653,""
"The mental health experiences of ethnic minorities in the UK during the Coronavirus pandemic: A qualitative exploration","Worldwide, the Coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact on people's health, lives, and livelihoods. However, this impact has not been felt equally across various population groups. People from ethnic minority backgrounds in the UK have been more adversely affected by the pandemic, especially in terms of their physical health. Their mental health, on the other hand, has received less attention. This study aimed to explore the mental health experiences of UK adults from ethnic minorities during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work forms part of our wider long-term UK population study ""Mental Health in the Pandemic."" We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with people from ethnic minority communities across the UK. A series of in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 women, 14 men and 1 non-binary person from ethnic minority backgrounds, aged between 18 and 65 years old (mean age = 40). We utilized purposefully selected maximum variation sampling in order to capture as wide a variety of views, perceptions and experiences as possible. Inclusion criteria: adults (18+) from ethnic minorities across the UK; able to provide full consent to participate; able to participate in a video- or phone-call interview. All interviews took place <i>via</i> MS Teams or Zoom. The gathered data were transcribed verbatim and underwent thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke carried out using NVivo 12 software. The qualitative data analysis yielded seven overarching themes: (1) pandemic-specific mental health and wellbeing experiences; (2) issues relating to the media; (3) coping mechanisms; (4) worries around and attitudes toward vaccination; (5) suggestions for support in moving forward; (6) best and worst experiences during pandemic and lockdowns; (7) biggest areas of change in personal life. Generally, participants' mental health experiences varied with some not being affected by the pandemic in a way related to their ethnicity, some sharing positive experiences and coping strategies (exercising more, spending more time with family, community cohesion), and some expressing negative experiences (eating or drinking more, feeling more isolated, or even racism and abuse, especially toward Asian communities). Concerns were raised around trust issues in relation to the media, the inadequate representation of ethnic minorities, and the spread of fake news especially on social media. Attitudes toward vaccinations varied too, with some people more willing to have the vaccine than others. This study's findings highlight the diversity in the pandemic mental health experiences of ethnic minorities in the UK and has implications for policy, practice and further research. To enable moving forward beyond the pandemic, our study surfaced the need for culturally appropriate mental health support, financial support (as a key mental health determinant), accurate media representation, and clear communication messaging from the Governments of the UK.","Van Bortel, Lombardo, Guo, Solomon, Martin, Hughes, Weeks, Crepaz-Keay, McDaid, Chantler, Thorpe, Morton, Davidson, John, Kousoulis","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.875198","20221025","BAME ethnicity; COVID-19; United Kingdom; coronavirus pandemic; ethnic minorities; inequalities; mental health; Adult; Male; Female; Humans; Adolescent; Young Adult; Middle Aged; Aged; Pandemics; Coronavirus; Mental Health; Ethnicity; Minority Groups; Ethnic and Racial Minorities; Coronavirus Infections; United Kingdom","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39654,""
"Anxiety and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study of staff and students from a tertiary education center in Malaysia","We examined the anxiety levels and coping strategies among staff and students of a tertiary educational institution during the COVID-19 pandemic and determined the association between anxiety level and coping strategies. Through an online survey, we used Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) to measure the level of anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) to assess the coping responses adopted to handle stressful life events. Coping strategies were classified as adaptive and maladaptive, for which the aggregate sores were calculated. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the predictors of anxiety adjusted for potentially confounding variables. Results from 434 participants were available for analysis. The mean score (SD) of the CAS was 1.1 (1.8). The mean scores of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies were 35.69 and 19.28, respectively. Multiple linear regression revealed that maladaptive coping [Adjusted B coefficient = 4.106, <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.001] and presence of comorbidities [Adjusted B coefficient = 1.376, <i>p</i>-value = 0.025] significantly predicted anxiety. Maladaptive coping and presence of comorbidities were the predictors of coronavirus anxiety. The apparent lack of anxiety in relation to COVID-19 and movement restriction is reflective of the reported high level of satisfaction with the support and services provided during the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia. Adaptive coping strategies were adopted more frequently than maladaptive. Nevertheless, public education on positive coping strategies and anxiety management may be still be relevant to provide mental health support to address the needs of the general population.","Lee, Yap, Ong, Pheh, Lye","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.936486","20221025","COVID-19; Malaysia; anxiety; coping; university; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Malaysia; Stress, Psychological; Anxiety; Adaptation, Psychological; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39655,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of pregnant women in Shanghai, China","COVID-19 has dramatically impacted people's health, especially mental health. This study aimed to compare the psychological status of pregnant women before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants were recruited (from September 29, 2019, to November 5, 2020) and screened by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). The study participants were categorized into three groups based on two turning-points: January 23, 2020, when China initiated a locked-down strategy, and May 11, 2020, when Shanghai started to ease the COVID-19 measures. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with depression and anxiety in pregnant women. We used enter method for variable selection; only variables with <i>P</i> &lt;0.10 were included in the final model. We recruited 478 pregnant women. After the outbreak, the depression rate (PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5) increased by 12.3% (from 35.4 to 47.7%), and the anxiety rate (GAD-7 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5) was stable (13.3 vs. 16.2%). The multivariable logistic regression results further confirmed that the odds of depression in pregnant women increased 81% after the outbreak (aOR = 1.81, 95%CI: 1.16-2.84). However, the median depression scale score was still statistically higher after the pandemic situation was stable (5.0 vs. 4.0) compared to the outbreak period. The depression rate increased among pregnant women after the outbreak and was not recovered after the ease of COVID-19 measures in Shanghai. Health institutes should pay attention to the long-term influence of the pandemic.","Zhang, Yuan, Xu, Yi, Tang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.938156","20221025","COVID-19; China; anxiety; depression; pregnant women; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; COVID-19; Mental Health; Pregnant Women; SARS-CoV-2; Depression; China","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39656,""
"A cross-sectional study to assess the level of satisfaction with virtual education in Peruvian medical students","Education has totally changed in the context of the pandemic. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the factors associated with the level of satisfaction with virtual education in Peruvian medical students during COVID-19. Analytical and cross-sectional study, based on an online survey of students nationwide. We use previously validated instruments to measure the level of satisfaction and stress (EPP-10-c) of students with virtual education. For the associated factors, adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using Poisson regression. Of the 1,878 students surveyed, the median age was 21 years, 57.8% (1,086) were women, 34.8% (654) had a high level of satisfaction with virtual education and 10.7% (202) presented high levels of stress. The factors associated with a low level of satisfaction were attending the fifth year of study, the partial and non-virtual adaptation of the university to virtual education, and a high level of stress. On the other hand, the factors associated with a high level of satisfaction were the education platform used and the study method used. Seven out of 10 students presented a low level of satisfaction with virtual education, 1 out of 10 presented a high level of stress. The factors associated with the low level of satisfaction were attending the fifth year of study, the non-virtual and partial adaptation of the university to virtual education, and the high level of stress.","Grados-Espinoza, Zila-Velasque, Soriano-Moreno, Regalado-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Sosa-NuÃƒÂ±ez, Barzola-FarfÃƒÂ¡n, Gronerth, Guizado, Mejia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1004902","20221025","Latinos; cross-sectional survey design; epidemiology; evaluation; mental health; Humans; Female; Young Adult; Adult; Male; Students, Medical; Personal Satisfaction; Cross-Sectional Studies; COVID-19; Peru","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39657,""
"The relationship between perceived social support with anxiety, depression, and insomnia among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating role of self-control","We aimed to investigate the associations between perceived social support and anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance <i>via</i> self-control among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Perceived Social Support Scale, Self-control Scale, Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Self-rating Depression Scale, and Insomnia Severity Index Scale were used to survey 1,997 college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, who submitted valid questionnaires (<i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 19.93, <i>SD</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 1.47, Range = 18-24 years, 62% female). The perceived social support and self-control were significantly positively correlated, and they were significantly and negatively associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Further analysis found that self-control partially mediated the relationships between perceived social support with anxiety, depression, and insomnia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese college students' self-control played a partial mediating effect in the relationships between perceived social support and anxiety, depression, and insomnia. This study provides new insights and inspiration for improving college students' mental health in the context of the pandemic.","Zhao, Xie, Li, Ding, Li, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.994376","20221024","COVID-19; college students; mental health; perceived social support; self-control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39658,""
"Mental burden among Chinese undergraduate medical students: A prospective longitudinal study before, during, and after the COVID-19 outbreak","Increasing evidence indicated a clear association between COVID-19 pandemic and mental health. This study aimed to assess the dynamic change of mental burden during and after the COVID-19 outbreak and related predictive factors among Chinese undergraduate medical students. This longitudinal survey was conducted among Chinese undergraduate medical students before, during, and after the COVID-19 outbreak. We focused on COVID-19 related mental burdens including psychological distress, stress reaction, and insomnia symptoms, and defined the sum score of the three specific mental burden indexes as the overall mental burden index. The prevalence of specific and overall mental burdens and their changing patterns at two phases of the pandemic (during vs. after the COVID-19 outbreak) were measured. In addition, multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess the associations between the psychosocial status before the pandemic and specific and overall mental burden changing patterns. Our findings showed that the prevalence of overall mental burden increased (from 27.46 to 37.28%) after the COVID-19 outbreak among the 863 Chinese undergraduate medical students who participated in the surveys at baseline, during, and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, the prevalence of stress reaction symptoms decreased (from 10.90 to 3.60%), while the rates of psychological distress (from 28.06 to 37.95%) and insomnia symptoms (from 12.54 to 20.71%) increased. Participants, with obsessive-compulsive symptoms, somatic symptoms, internet addiction, childhood adversity, stressful life events, and being neurotic were found to have a higher risk of developing mental burden in at least one survey (during or after the COVID-19 outbreak). Healthy family function and being extravert were found to positively impact mental burden. Psychological distress, stress reaction and insomnia symptoms have been prevalent among Chinese undergraduate medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the prevalence of overall mental burden increased after the COVID-19 outbreak. Some students, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibited persistent or progression symptoms. Continued mental health care was in demand for them even after the COVID-19 outbreak.","Liao, Zhang, Wang, Jiang, Li, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.982469","20221024","COVID-19; insomnia; longitudinal study; psychological distress; stress reaction; undergraduate medical students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39659,""
"University freshmen's excessive smartphone use and psychological safety during the COVID-19 pandemic","Although excessive smartphone use has been confirmed as being associated with specific representations of mental health (e. g., anxiety, depression, wellbeing, etc.) throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship between excessive smartphone use and cognitive representations of mental health (i.e., psychological safety) is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to identify the association between excessive smartphone use and psychological safety among university freshmen during the COVID-19 pandemic; in addition, we examined the mediation effects of hardiness and interpersonal distress in this relationship. In this study, 1,224 university freshmen were selected at random from several universities in Guizhou Province of China. The Psychological Safety Scale was used to evaluate the mental health of university freshmen; the Mobile Phone Dependence Scale was used to evaluate excessive smartphone use; the Hardiness Questionnaire was used to evaluate hardiness; and the Interpersonal Relation Synthetic Diagnose Test was used to evaluate interpersonal distress. The findings showed that: (1) the greater the degree of excessive smartphone use, the more serious respondents' interpersonal distress and the lower their hardiness; (2) excessive smartphone use was not only directly related to the psychological safety of university freshmen but also indirectly related to their psychological safety through the independent mediation of hardiness and interpersonal distress, as well as through the chain mediation of hardiness and interpersonal distress. In general, excessive smartphone use in university freshmen could lead to a decline in their psychological safety. Also, hardiness and interpersonal distress play a complex role in this relationship. During the COVID-19 pandemic, interventions on the mental health of college freshmen should not only provide guidance on how to use their smartphone responsibly but also to provide them with support and guidance for the enhancement of their hardiness and improvement of their interpersonal relationships.","Yang, Shi, Zeng, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.993555","20221024","excessive smartphone use; hardiness; interpersonal distress; psychological safety; university freshmen","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39660,""
"Psychological outcomes and associated factors amongst healthcare workers during a single wave, deeper into the COVID-19 pandemic in China","To date, the repeated breakout of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic across many regions in China has caused continuous physical and mental harm to health care workers. This study investigates the psychological burden of the pandemic and its associated risk factors among Chinese healthcare workers (HCWs) during a single wave of COVID-19. For this cross-sectional web-based survey conducted from January 16, 2022 to February 5, 2022, a total of 412 HCWs from Northwestern China were recruited. Their socio-demographic data and COVID-19 related survey variables were then collected using online self-rating questionnaires. In addition, the Chinese versions of well-validated instruments, including the 12-item General Health Questionnaire for psychiatric morbidity, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression and the Insomnia Severity Index-7 for insomnia, were used to assess the participants' mental health status. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was eventually performed to identify the risk factors associated with the psychological outcomes. Of the 388 participants who were included in the final study (94.17% response rate), the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were 25.3% (95% CI: 20.9-29.6%), 40.7% (95% CI: 35.8-45.6%), and 30.9% (95% CI: 26.3-35.5%), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that being a woman and having a perceived need for psychological support were risk factors for all psychological outcomes, while poor disease cognition and perceived susceptibility were risk factors for anxiety. Poor disease cognition and being unvaccinated against COVID-19 were risk factors for depression, with the latter also being an independent risk factor for insomnia. This study has identified a relatively lower prevalence rate of psychological disorders among Chinese HCWs during a single wave, deeper into the COVID-19 pandemic. Female HCWs, and those who had a perceived need for psychological support, had poor disease cognition, were perceived as susceptible to COVID-19 and had not been vaccinated against COVID-19 deserve more attention.","Tang, Wu, Qi, Li, Shi, Wang, Niu, Liu, Wang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.983909","20221024","COVID-19; China; healthcare workers; mental health; single wave","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39661,""
"Health inequity in pandemic anxiety about COVID-19 infection and socioeconomic consequences in Japan: A structural equation modeling approach","Health inequity in relation to COVID-19 infection and socioeconomic consequences is a major global concern. Mental health issues in vulnerable populations have received special attention in research and practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is limited evidence on the nature of the anxieties experienced as a result of COVID-19, and how such concerns vary across demographic groups. This study examines anxiety among the working population of Japan (aged 18-59), in terms of both COVID-19 infection and socioeconomic consequences, using an internationally validated tool, the Pandemic Anxiety Scale (PAS). Data were collected using an online survey (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2,764). The analyses included an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM), followed by validation of the Japanese version of the PAS. A two-factor latent variable model shows the multidimensionality of anxiety in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic and the disparity across population groups in predicting the two defined anxiety dimensions. Several path coefficients showed somewhat unexpected and/or unique results from Japan compared with previous European studies. Specifically, self-reported health status was not significantly related to disease anxiety, and those who were not in paid employment reported lower consequence anxiety. The SEM results showed a greater number of significant exogenous variables for consequence anxiety compared to disease anxiety, highlighting disparities in pandemic anxiety by socioeconomic status in regard to socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic. In contrast to existing European studies, evidence from the current study suggests contextual patterns of health inequity. Due to the prolonged socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic, multidisciplinary research on mental health issues and the quality of life remains an important research agenda in exploring socioeconomic measures in context, towards addressing inequity concerns.","Shimamoto, McElroy, Ibuka","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2022.101269","20221024","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39662,""
"(Es)Ketamine for Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: Clinical Efficacy","Suicidal ideation and behavior are among the most severe psychiatric presentations, warranting emergency room visits and psychiatric admission for higher levels of care. In the United States, suicide rates continue to climb, especially in younger patients, and the continued psychosocial stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic may further exacerbate this crisis. Suicidal ideation and behavior are core features of a major depressive episode, but there are limited treatment options to rapidly redress these life-threatening symptoms. Racemic ketamine and its S-enantiomer, esketamine, are N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists and glutamate modulators that have robust antidepressant efficacy in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. Additionally, both ketamine and esketamine have demonstrated rapid-acting antisuicidal efficacy in major mood disorders. In August 2020, this culminated in a first-in-class approval of SpravatoÃ‚Â® (intranasal esketamine) for the treatment of major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation and behavior. In this article, we review the literature in support of the antisuicidal efficacy of ketamine and esketamine.","Alario, Niciu","https://doi.org/10.1177/24705470221128017","20221024","bipolar depression; bipolar disorder; glutamate; ketamine; major depressive disorder; suicidal ideation; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39663,""
"Shifts in Stressors, Internalizing Symptoms, and Coping Mechanisms of Teachers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","As the frontline of our education system, teachers endure greater job-relatedÃ‚Â stressÃ‚Â than other professionals, even under the best of circumstances. While they were already exposed to certain stressors affecting their emotional health, the pandemic outbreak introduced new challenges putting teachers at risk of experiencing higher rates of emotional distress. This longitudinal study aimed to identify changes in teaching stressors and teachers' coping strategies in the period before the pandemic to the immediate outbreaks of COVID-19 in Fall 2020. In addition, we examined the correlation of teachers' coping approaches with stress, anxiety, and depression to understand if coping strategies correlate and predict such emotional distress. To this end, 376 English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers in Iran in the first wave and 351 in the second wave completed a battery of validated inventories capturing their emotional distress, teaching stressors, and coping approaches. The mean scores of the stressors and coping strategies across two waves indicated significant shifts toward using functional coping strategies upon experiencing new demands. Furthermore, we found that novice teachers experienced higher rates of stress and anxiety, which were positively associated with dysfunctional coping strategies. The results of the stepwise regression analysis with (dys)functional coping strategies indicated that coping mechanisms significantly account for 25% of variances in stress, anxiety, and depression. The implications of the study regarding promoting teacher mental health through identifying the risk factors associated with dysfunctional coping strategies have been discussed.","Ghasemi, Herman, Reinke","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12310-022-09549-8","20221024","(Dys)functional coping mechanisms; Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Stress; Teaching-related stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39664,""
"Hippocampal and amygdalar increased BDNF expression in the extinction of opioid-induced place preference","The opioid crisis was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States with alarming statistics about overdose-related deaths (Ahmad et al., 2022). Current treatment options, such as medication assisted treatments, have been unable to prevent relapse in many patients, whereas cue-based exposure therapy have had mixed results in human trials. To improve patient outcomes, it is imperative to develop animal models of addiction to understand molecular mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets. We previously found increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) transcript in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (VS/NAc) of rats that extinguished morphine-induced place preference. Here, we expand our study to determine whether BDNF protein expression was modulated in mesolimbic brain regions of the reward system in animals exposed to extinction training. Drug conditioning and extinction sessions were followed by Western blots for BDNF in the hippocampus (HPC), amygdala (AMY) and VS/NAc. Rears, as a measure of withdrawal-induced anxiety were also measured to determine their impact on extinction. Results showed that animals who received extinction training and successfully extinguished morphine CPP significantly increased BDNF in the HPC when compared to animals deprived of extinction training (sham-extinction). This increase was not significant in animals who failed to extinguish (extinction-resistant). In AMY, all extinction-trained animals showed increased BDNF, regardless of behavior phenotype. No BDNF modulation was observed in the VS/NAc. Finally, extinction-trained animals showed no difference in rears regardless of extinction outcome, suggesting that anxiety elicited by drug withdrawal did not significantly impact extinction of morphine CPP. Our results suggest that BDNF expression in brain regions of the mesolimbic reward system could play a key role in extinction of opioid-induced maladaptive behaviors and represents a potential therapeutic target for future combined pharmacological and extinction-based therapies.","Lloret-Torres, Ayala-Pagan, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Rivera, Bonilla, Barreto-Estrada","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2022.10.007","20221024","Amygdala; BDNF; Conditioned Place Preference; Extinction; Hippocampus; Morphine; Nucleus Accumbens","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39665,""
"Depression, anxiety, stress, and physical activity of Australian adults during COVID-19: A combined longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a worsening of mental health and health behaviors. While physical activity is positively associated mental health, there is limited understanding of how mental health and physical activity evolve throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine changes in depression, anxiety and stress and physical activity, and associations between depression, anxiety, and stress with physical activity in Australian adults across three-time points during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study collected both longitudinal and cross-sectional data at three-time points during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (i.e., April, July/August, and December 2020). Australians aged 18 years and over were invited to complete online surveys hosted on Qualtrics survey platform. Linear mixed models with random subject effect and general linear models were used to analyze the longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional data respectively. The number of participants in cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal surveys was 1,877 and 849, respectively. There was an overall reduction between time 2 vs. time 3 in depression (<i>d</i> = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.20, 1.85), anxiety (<i>d</i> = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.02, 1.12), and stress (<i>d</i> = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.21, 2.04) scores but no significant differences in physical activity across three-time points. On average, participants who met the physical activity guidelines had lower depression (<i>d</i> = -2.08, 95% CI = -2.90, -1.26), anxiety (<i>d</i> = -0.88, 95% CI = -1.41, -0.34), and stress (<i>d</i> = -1.35, 95% CI = -2.13, -0.56) scores compared to those not meeting the guidelines. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, both governments and service providers should continue to provide the public with timely mental health support and promote the benefits of physical activity, as a cost-effective strategy to improve mental health and wellbeing.","Zhao, Vandelanotte, Khalesi, Alley, Williams, Thwaite, Fenning, Stanton, To","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.962962","20221024","COVID-19 pandemic; DASS-21; anxiety; depressive symptoms; distress; exercise; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39666,""
"COVID-19 certificate as a cutting-edge issue in changing the perception of restaurants' visitors-Illustrations from Serbian urban centers","As one of the first European cases of the introduction of COVID-19 certificates, the Serbian Government initiated the measure of limited working hours of restaurants for unvaccinated visitors. Due to such actions and frequent bans on working during the pandemic, many restaurants in Serbia had to lay off workers or close. At the end of October 2021, the certificate for entering restaurants and all catering facilities for all the visitors became mandatory. It is interesting to note that earlier findings suggested that some personality characteristics determine the specific behaviors during the pandemic, but there is still a small number of results related to restaurants' visitors. This study aimed to investigate the predictive strength of the Big Five Factors (BFF) to attitudes toward visits to restaurants in Serbia during the pandemic, depending on the attitudes toward accepting COVID-19 certificates. A survey was conducted on a total sample of 953 visitors of restaurants in three major cities in Serbia. The results of hierarchical regression analysis showed that Openness and Extraversion positively predict attitudes toward visits to facilities during a pandemic, while Conscientiousness and Neuroticism were negative predictors. However, in the second step of hierarchical regression analysis, attitudes toward a COVID-19 certificate as a mediator variable significantly reduced the negative effect of Neuroticism on the attitudes toward visits. It seems that, by obtaining the certificate, the fear of unsafe stays in restaurants can be reduced, and that making decisions about (no) visiting restaurants during the pandemic does not necessarily have to be compromised by emotional lability.","GajiÃ„â€¡, PetroviÃ„â€¡, BleÃ…Â¡iÃ„â€¡, VukoliÃ„â€¡, MilovanoviÃ„â€¡, RadovanoviÃ„â€¡, VukoviÃ„â€¡, KostiÃ„â€¡, VuksanoviÃ„â€¡, MalinoviÃ„â€¡ MiliÃ„â€¡eviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.914484","20221024","BFF; COVID-19; Serbia; behavior; consumer; restaurants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39667,""
"Creativity in lockdown: Understanding how music and the arts supported mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic by age group","Recent research has indicated that many people around the world turned to artistic creative activities (ACAs) to support their mental health during COVID-19 lockdowns. However, studies have also shown that the negative psychosocial impacts of the pandemic have disproportionately affected young people, suggesting that the use of ACAs to support mental health in lockdown may have varied across age groups. This study investigated how Australians in four different age groups (18-24, 25-34, 35-54, and 55+) engaged in ACAs to support their mental health during the 2020 pandemic lockdowns. Participants (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°653) recruited from the general public completed an online survey between May and October 2020, in which they reported which ACAs they had undertaken during the pandemic using an established list. Participants subsequently ranked undertaken ACAs in terms of effectiveness at making them ""feel better,"" and those who had engaged in musical ACAs also completed the Musical Engagement Questionnaire (MusEQ). Additionally, ratings of anxiety (GAD7) and depression (PHQ9) symptoms were obtained and examined for potential variations across four diverse variables: age, exercise, gender and state/territory of residence. ACA rankings showed that younger participants overwhelmingly rated musical activities as most effective, while, with the exception of singing, those aged 55+ rated non-musical activities as being most effective. These differences were further supported by ratings for all six MusEQ subscales, with responses strongly indicating that the youngest participants (aged 18-24) used music in significantly different ways during the pandemic than participants in all other age groups. Specifically, these youngest participants were more likely to integrate music into daily life, use music for emotion regulation, respond to music in embodied ways, and use music to perform a social identity. In line with prior research, further analyses indicated that symptoms of anxiety and depression were lessened for older participants, as well for those who reported exercising more during the lockdowns. These findings provide insight into how ACAs can support mental health during a pandemic crisis for specific age groups, which may inform future policy directions, and suggestions for how this can be done are provided.","Chmiel, Kiernan, Garrido, Lensen, Hickey, Davidson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.993259","20221024","Australian lockdown; COVID-19; age; anxiety and depression; artistic creative activities; exercise; mental health; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39668,""
"VisualEars: How an immersive art exhibit impacts mood during the COVID-19 pandemic","This paper explores the positive impact of viewing a virtual art exhibit on mood during the COVID-19 Pandemic. During global lockdowns, depression, anxiety, and the burden of other mental illnesses have increased even among prior psychiatrically healthy individuals. Art and music-based interventions have shown to be effective clinical interventions in individuals with mental illness. The VisualEars project explored whether a virtual activity involving vision and auditory stimuli could improve positive and negative affect. Eight musical pieces were selected, and 28 visual artists from around the world visualized two musical pieces. A total of 56 works of art were created and hung in eight 3D virtual rooms. Visitors were randomly selected to either view the art exhibit without music (non-immersive) or view the art exhibit while listening to music (immersive). Visitors were asked to complete a positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) in three languages (English, French, and Farsi) pre and post their virtual visit. A total of 160 participants completed baseline PANAS, 58 of which completed the follow-up PANAS. Linear mixed-effects models found that older participants had lower negative affect scores overall (<i>b</i> = -0.3, <i>p</i> = 0.003), while male participants had lower positive affect scores overall (<i>b</i> = -0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Following the virtual exhibit participants of both conditions had higher positive (<i>b</i> = 0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and lower negative affect scores (<i>b</i> = -0.19, <i>p</i> = 0.007). We found that the virtual art exhibit increased positive affect and decreased negative affect in participants, suggesting an overall improvement in mood attributable to the virtual exhibit. This suggests that virtual exhibits may serve as a beneficial and accessible intervention to improve mood during a pandemic.","Hadavi, Kennedy, Mariotti, DeSouza","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.910767","20221024","COVID-19 pandemic; PANAS; mental health; mood enhancement; music; virtual art exhibit; visual art","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39669,""
"Using synthetic controls to estimate the population-level effects of Ontario's recently implemented overdose prevention sites and consumption and treatment services","Between 2017 and 2020, Ontario implemented overdose prevention sites (OPS) and consumption and treatment services (CTS) in nine of its 34 public health units (PHU). We tested for the effect of booth-hours (spaces within OPS/CTSs for supervised consumption) on opioid-related health service use and mortality rates at the provincial- (aggregate) and PHU-level. We used monthly rates of all opioid-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths between January 2015 and March 2021 as our three outcomes. For each PHU that implemented OPS/CTSs, we created a synthetic control as a weighted combination of unexposed PHUs. Our exposure was the time-varying rate of booth-hours provided. We estimated the population-level effects of the intervention on each outcome per treated/synthetic-control pair using controlled interrupted time series with segmented regression; and tested for the aggregate effect using a multiple baseline approach. We adjusted for time-varying provision of prescription opioids for pain management, opioid agonist treatment (OAT), and naloxone kits; and corrected for seasonality and autocorrelation. All rates were per 100,000 population. For sensitivity analysis, we restricted the post-implementation period to before COVID-19 public health measures were implemented (March 2020). Our aggregate analyses found no effect per booth-hour on ED visits (0.00, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.01; p-value=0.6684), hospitalizations (0.00, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.00; p-value=0.9710) or deaths (0.00, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.00; p-value=0.2466). However, OAT reduced ED visits (-0.20, 95% CI: -0.35, -0.05; p-value=0.0103) and deaths (-0.04, 95% CI: -0.05, -0.03; p-value=&lt;0.0001). Conversely, prescription opioids for pain management modestly increased deaths (0.0008, 95% CI: 0.0002, 0.0015; p-value=0.0157) per 100,000 population, respectively. Except for a few treated PHU/synthetic control pairs, disaggregate results were congruent with overall findings. Booth-hours had no population-level effect on opioid-related overdose ED visit, hospitalization, or death rates.","Panagiotoglou, Lim","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103881","20221024","Consumption and treatment services; Harm reduction interventions; Interrupted time series; Overdose prevention sites; Synthetic controls","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39670,""
"Managing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir during COVID-19: pharmacists' experiences from the Perak state of Malaysia","Novel therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV-2 have emerged over time, serving to reduce the severity of the disease, admission and mortality, especially among high-risk populations. Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>) was found to reduce the risk of disease progression. Pharmacists played multiple roles in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This article highlights the roles of pharmacists in managing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within the Malaysian context. Pharmacists were actively involved in Paxlovid<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> inventory management. To ensure the balance between supply and demand of new therapeutic drugs, pharmacists in health facilities constantly monitor the inventory levels of the medications. As Paxlovid<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> was initially reserved for a certain population who met the clinical eligibility criteria based on a scoring system, pharmacists were required to screen and exclude patients with non-indications or contraindications to the medication. During dispensing, pharmacists convey clear instructions on how to take the medications to ensure adherence and medication safety. The novel nature of the medications necessitates pharmacists to counsel patients regarding its indication, the mode of action, actions to take when missing a dose or overdose happens, side effects, storage and disposal methods, as well as mechanism of reporting adverse drug reactions. Pharmacists were required to follow-up all patients via phone call on Day 3 and Day 5 post-initiation, examining both adherence and adverse drug reactions associated with Paxlovid<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>. Pharmacists experienced multiple challenges in managing Paxlovid<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>, particularly due to increased workload, suboptimal follow-up response, stringent medication storage requirements, and adherence issues. Universal research and innovation initiatives were proposed to improve the delivery of novel therapeutic agents in the future health system.","Chang, Ong, Lim, Chew, Rajan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40545-022-00469-1","20221024","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","",39671,""
"The First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Changes in Preventive Services in Community Health Centers","Community Health Centers provide comprehensive primary healthcare services to many underserved populations. It is unknown how routine preventive and chronic care services in Community Health Centers may have changed nationwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2014-2020 Health Resources and Services Administration Uniform Data System of Community Health Centers was used, and data analysis was conducted from November 2021 to May 2022. Data for clinical quality measures in 2020 were treated as during the pandemic, whereas receipt of care in 2019 and before were treated as before the pandemic. Outcomes included 6 clinical quality measures of being up to date for colorectal cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, tobacco screening and cessation counseling, BMI screening and follow-up, depression screening and follow-up, and aspirin use for ischemic vascular disease. A mixed effects regression model was used to estimate changes in measures by year. Between 2019 and 2020, receipt of preventive services declined for each of the 6 clinical quality measures: from 40.8% to 37.7% for colorectal cancer screening, from 48.8% to 44.9% for cervical cancer screening, from 85.8% to 83.4% for tobacco screening and cessation counseling, from 70.7% to 65.4% for BMI screening and follow-up, from 71.1% to 64.9% for depression screening and follow-up, and from 81.5% to 79.4% for aspirin use for ischemic vascular disease.
