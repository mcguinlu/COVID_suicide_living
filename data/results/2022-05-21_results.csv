"Prevalence and determinants of mental well-being and satisfaction with life among university students amidst COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a slew of mental illnesses due to a lack of cures and vaccinations, as well as concerns about students' well-being and satisfaction with life, resulting in psychological symptoms and dissatisfaction with their lives. As students are highly susceptible to mental health issues, researchers discovered that perceived SWL and MWB decreased. The present study investigated the prevalence and determinants of mental well-being and satisfaction with life among university students in Bangladesh. Methods: An e-survey based cross-sectional study was carried out from February to April 2021 among 660 students. A purposive sampling technique was utilized in the study. Self-reported mental well-being and satisfaction with life psychological tools were also used. The e-questionnaire survey was conducted with informed consent and questions were related to socio-demographics, satisfaction with life, and mental well-being scales. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses were performed. The data were rechecked and analyzed with the R programming language. Results: The prevalence estimates of mental well-being and satisfaction with life were 27% and 13% respectively. In a total of 660 participants, 58.2% of them were male and the rest of them were female (41.8%). Among the participants, 22.5% suffer the worst conditions regarding their financial conditions, and 16.5% badly seek a job for livelihood. Conclusion: The present findings revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic and longtime educational institution closure significantly affect the students mental health. Students mental well-being was in vulnerable conditions and their satisfaction with life was extremely poor. A comprehensive student psychological support service should be expanded to help students mental health.","Md.

"Death and Resistance: Professionals on the Front Line Against COVID-19; Morte e ResistÃªncia: Profissionais na Linha de Frente Contra a Covid-19; Muerte y Resistencia: Profesionales de Primera LÃ­nea Contra el Covid-19","Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has intensely affected the quality of life and labor conditions of healthcare workers (HCWs). This study sought to understand the experiences of 16 professionals in medicine, nursing and physical therapy who work on the ""frontline"" of the new Coronavirus. A phenomenological design was used. Results were organized into four axes: (a) the impact of the arrival of the pandemic; (b) participants' progressive exhaustion; (c) fear and coping; and (d) rethinking life and death. Experiences of anguish, anxiety, depression, and physical and psychological health problems stand out. It was possible to observe that the lack of national coordination, in addition to unscientific political positions, were felt as an aggravating factor for work demands, and that impotence in the face of the disease implicated in rethinking the meaning of life and death. According to the JD-R model, the need to expand resources and emotional support so HCWs can properly manage psychosocial risk factors at work is evident.; Resumo A pandemia vem afetando intensamente a qualidade de vida e condiÃ§Ãµes laborais dos trabalhadores da saÃºde (TS).

"Anxiety and depressive symptomatology among children and adolescents exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic - A systematic review","Background/Aim. Children and adolescents are sensitive groups for the development of mental disorders during the crisis. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depressive symptomatology in the population of children and adolescents. Methods. The investigation was based on a systematic review followed by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol, including Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and APA Psyc Info databases, to identify relevant studies reporting anxiety and depressive symptoms among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 27 articles were included. Results. Anxiety symptoms increased from 28.3% before the pandemic to 49.5% during confinement [General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 = 11)] (McNemar test, p &lt; 0.0001). More depressive symptomatology was found, as well as weight and sleep disturbances which are the characteristics of children and adolescents' mental health. Additionally, female teenagers were experiencing grater declines in mood disorders than male teenagers during the COVID-19 crisis. On the one hand, different positive correlations between anxiety and other variables, were found, such as clinical depressive symptoms and anxiety (3/14), smartphone and internet addiction (2/14), lower levels of family income (2/14), perceived threats (2/14), higher grades at school (2/14), and loneliness (1/14). On the other hand, positive correlations were reported between depression and children and adolescents that were socially disconnected (3/17). Finally, mothers with higher level of education and income were associated with higher level of happiness (2/17). Conclusion. COVID-19 has a strong impact on the mental health of children and adolescents regarding depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevention programs focused on coping strategies should be conducted in elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. Mental health should become a priority matter for governments, and the current pandemic could be an opportunity to highlight the importance of mental well-being and to invest in the betterment of clinical trainings, treatments and mental health research.

"Automated Virtual Reality Cognitive Therapy (gameChange) in Inpatient Psychiatric Wards: Qualitative Study of Staff and Patient Views Using an Implementation Framework","Background: Automated virtual reality (VR) therapy could allow a greater number of patients to receive evidence-based psychological therapy. The aim of the gameChange VR therapy is to help patients overcome anxious avoidance of everyday social situations. gameChange has been evaluated with outpatients, but it may also help inpatients prepare for discharge from psychiatric hospital. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the views of patients and staff on the provision of VR therapy on psychiatric wards. Methods: Focus groups or individual interviews were conducted with patients (n=19) and National Health Service staff (n=22) in acute psychiatric wards. Questions were derived from the nonadoption, abandonment, and challenges to the scale-up, spread, and sustainability framework. Expectations of VR therapy were discussed, and participants were then given the opportunity to try out the gameChange VR therapy before they were asked questions that focused on opinions about the therapy and feasibility of adoption. Results: There was great enthusiasm for the use of gameChange VR therapy on psychiatric wards. It was considered that gameChange could help build confidence, reduce anxiety, and â€œbridge that gapâ€ between the differences of being in hospital and being discharged to the community. However, it was reflected that the VR therapy may not suit everyone, especially if they are acutely unwell. VR on hospital wards for entertainment and relaxation was also viewed positively. Participants were particularly impressed by the immersive quality of gameChange and the virtual coach. It was considered that a range of staff groups could support VR therapy delivery. The staff thought that implementation would be facilitated by having a lead staff member, having ongoing training accessible, and involving the multidisciplinary team in decision-making for VR therapy use. The most significant barrier to implementation identified by patients and staff was a practical one: access to sufficient, private space to provide the therapy. Conclusions: Patients and staff were keen for VR to be used on psychiatric wards. In general, patients and staff viewed automated VR therapy as possible to implement within current care provision, with few significant barriers other than constraints of space. Patients and staff thought of many further uses of VR on psychiatric wards. The value of VR therapy on psychiatric wards now requires systematic evaluation.

"Gap in Willingness and Access to Video Visit Use Among Older High-risk Veterans: Cross-sectional Study","Background: The recent shift to video care has exacerbated disparities in health care access, especially among high-need, high-risk (HNHR) adults. Developing data-driven approaches to improve access to care necessitates a deeper understanding of HNHR adultsâ€™ attitudes toward telemedicine and technology access. Objective: This study aims to identify the willingness, access, and ability of HNHR veterans to use telemedicine for health care. Methods: WWe designed a questionnaire conducted via mail or telephone or in person. Among HNHR veterans who were identified using predictive modeling with national Veterans Affairs data, we assessed willingness to use video visits for health care, access to necessary equipment, and comfort with using technology. We evaluated physical health, including frailty, physical function, performance of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL);mental health;and social needs, including Area Deprivation Index, transportation, social support, and social isolation. Results: The average age of the 602 HNHR veteran respondents was 70.6 (SD 9.2;range 39-100) years;99.7% (600/602) of the respondents were male, 61% (367/602) were White, 36% (217/602) were African American, 17.3% (104/602) were Hispanic, 31.2% (188/602) held at least an associate degree, and 48.2% (290/602) were confident filling medical forms. Of the 602 respondents, 327 (54.3%) reported willingness for video visits, whereas 275 (45.7%) were unwilling. Willing veterans were younger (P&lt;.001) and more likely to have an associate degree (P=.002), be health literate (P&lt;.001), live in socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods (P=.048), be independent in IADLs (P=.02), and be in better physical health (P=.04). A higher number of those willing were able to use the internet and email (P&lt;.001). Of the willing veterans, 75.8% (248/327) had a video-capable device. Those with video-capable technology were younger (P=.004), had higher health literacy (P=.01), were less likely to be African American (P=.007), were more independent in ADLs (P=.005) and IADLs (P=.04), and were more adept at using the internet and email than those without the needed technology (P&lt;.001). Age, confidence in filling forms, general health, and internet use were significantly associated with willingness to use video visits. Conclusions: Approximately half of the HNHR respondents were unwilling for video visits and a quarter of those willing lacked requisite technology. The gap between those willing and without requisite technology is greater among older, less health literate, African American veterans;those with worse physical health;and those living in more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our study highlights that HNHR veterans have complex needs, which risk being exacerbated by the video care shift. Although technology holds vast potential to improve health care access, certain vulnerable populations are less likely to engage, or have access to, technology. Therefore, targeted interventions are needed to address this inequity, especially among HNHR older adults.","Dang, Stuti, Muralidhar, Kiranmayee, Li, Shirley, Tang, Fei, Mintzer, Michael, Ruiz, Jorge, Willy Marcos, Valencia","https://doi.org/10.2196/32570","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Medical Internet Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31672,""
"The Impact of Web-Based Physical Activity Interventions on Depression and Anxiety Among College Students: Randomized Experimental Trial","Background: Depression and anxiety are growing issues for college students, with both aerobic resistance training and mindfulness yoga exercises known to be effective in reducing symptoms and severity. However, no known research is available comparing these 2 depression and anxiety interventions simultaneously and in a web-based environment. Objective: This study aims to determine the effects of a web-based aerobic resistance exercise intervention (WeActive) and a web-based yoga mindfulness exercise intervention (WeMindful) on depression and anxiety symptoms in college students. Methods: The participants were 77 college students who anonymously completed a Qualtrics survey, including the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and the Major Depression Inventory at baseline and after the intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to either the WeActive or WeMindful group and underwent two 30-minute web-based aerobic resistance exercise lessons or yoga mindfulness lessons per week for 8 weeks. Results: The results of analysis of covariance with repeated measures indicated that although not statistically significant, both groups showed a notable decrease in anxiety with a marginally significant main effect of time (F1=3.485;P=.07;<U+03B7>2=0.047) but no significant main effect of group and no significant interaction effect of time with group. The 2 intervention groups experienced a significant decrease in depression with the main effect of time (F=3.892;P=.05;<U+03B7>2=0.052). There was no significant main effect of group or interaction effect of time with group for depression. Conclusions: College students in both WeActive and WeMindful groups experienced a significant decrease in depression symptoms and a decrease, although not significant, in anxiety as well. The study suggests that web-based WeActive and WeMindful interventions are effective approaches to managing US college studentsâ€™ depression and anxiety during a pandemic.","Murray, Andy, Marenus, Michele, Cahuas, Ana, Friedman, Kathryn, Haley, Ottensoser, Kumaravel, Varun, Sanowski, Julia, Chen, Weiyun","https://doi.org/10.2196/31839","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 6(4), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31673,""

"Depression and suicidal ideation among medical students in a private medical college of Bangladesh A cross sectional web based survey","This study was done to investigate the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation among private medical students in Bangladesh. A total of 237 medical students participated in this cross-sectional web-based survey by e-questionnaire using the Google Form. The study was conducted from November 2020 to December 2020 at Enam Medical College and Hospital which is situated in Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Out of 237 medical students, prevalence of depression was found 58.6%, and prevalence of suicidal ideation was found 27.4% which is higher than the global prevalence. Bivariate and multivariate analysis and logistic regression-based odds ratios (ORs) was done to see the association between grade of depression and suicidal thoughts with different variables. Association between grade of depression with family problems (x2 = 16.716, P = 0.001), drug addiction (x2 = 16.601, P = 0.001), committed relationship status (x2 = 40.292, P = &lt;0.001) were statistically significant. Whereas, the association between suicidal thoughts with family problems (x2 = 29.881, P = &lt;0.001), failed any subject during study (x2 = 12.024, P = 0.007), alcohol uses (x2 = 15.977, P = 0.001), drug addiction (x2 = 22.633, P = &lt;0.001), committed relationship status (x2 = 35.219, P = &lt;0.001) were statistically significant. However, medical students whom had to earn other than their family income were 2.3 times (OR: 2.285, 95% CL: 0.897, 5.820) greater prone to be depressed than those who do not had to earn by themselves. On the contrary, medical students who are single were 2.35 times (OR: 2.352, 95% CL: 0.926, 5.973) greater prone to have suicidal thoughts than the married students. This study showed that a large percentage of Bangladeshi medical students have been suffering from depression and suicidal ideation.

"A Socially Distanced Case Study: Implementing the Unified Protocol-Adolescent in the Treatment of Comorbid Depression and Anxiety via Telehealth","Anxiety and depression are two of the most common mental health diagnoses in adolescents, with higher prevalence rates for gender-nonconforming youth relative to an age-equivalent population of cisgender youth (Veale et al., 2017). This case study examined the effectiveness of the Unified Protocol-Adolescent (UP-A) for a gender-nonconforming 13-year-old diagnosed with both generalized anxiety and mild depression. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this transdiagnostic implementation provided psychoeducation and targeted emotion identification, present-moment awareness, cognitive restructuring, and problem-solving over 21 sessions. Outcome data demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms, with a notable qualitative change on three subjective measures of anxiety/depression symptoms, as ratings moved from clinical to nonclinical score ranges. Moreover, outcome data demonstrated the potential efficacy of the UP-A administered via telehealth for nonbinary youth with comorbid anxiety and depression. Clinical and research implications regarding the utility of implementing a flexible, transdiagnostic approach to treating diverse adolescentsâ€™ emotional disorders are discussed.

"Social Networking Security during COVID-19: A Systematic Literature Review","During the Covid-19 Pandemic, the usage of social media networks increased exponentially. People engage in education, business, shopping, and other social activities (i.e., Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube). As social networking expands rapidly, its positive and negative impacts affect human health. All this leads to social crimes and illegal activities like phishing, hacking, ransomware, password attacks, spyware, blackmailing, Middle-man-attack. This research extensively discusses the social networking threats, challenges, online surveys, and future effects. We conduct an online survey using the google forms platform to collect the responses of social networking sites (SNS) users within Pakistan to show how SNS affects health positively and negatively. According to the collected response, we analyzed that 50% of the users use SNS for education purposes, 17.5% use it for shopping purposes, 58.2% use it for entertainment, 37.1% use it for communication, and 9.8% use it for other purposes.

"Rebuilding the workplace to promote young workers' mental health","Purpose&gt;Young adults have been particularly adversely affected by COVID-19-related disruptions, especially in relation to industries with an over-representation of young adults. This study, a report, aims to discuss the findings from survey data from young adults who reported poorer mental health comparative to older generations prior to the pandemic. Drawing on the international literature and the research findings, the authors propose recommendations for rebuilding the workplace post-pandemic to support young adult's mental health.Design/methodology/approach&gt;Data from 1,999 respondents from 200 organisations in the UK were sought in relation to workplace well-being and mental health through a 15-item multiple choice online survey. Overall, 17% of the sample were senior management, 31% junior management, 37% in non-management roles and a further 15% stated â€œotherâ€. Exploratory quantitative analyses were undertaken to assess differences in responses to questions between age groups.Findings&gt;Participants in the 16â€“25-year-old age group were more likely than any other age group to report that work adversely affected their mental health, that their mental health challenges influenced their performance at work, that they had witnessed colleagues' employment negatively influenced by mental health challenges and they felt more comfortable citing physical health challenges for absence than mental health difficulties.Originality/value&gt;COVID-19-related disruptions meant a large-scale move to remote working for many people. As we return to physical workplaces, we have an exciting opportunity to reform and improve the status quo. The findings, in relation to the mental health of young adults, highlight key risk factors that need to be addressed.","Parry, Sarah Louise, Carr, Natalie A.; Staniford, Leanne J.; Walker, Lucy","https://doi.org/10.1108/ijwhm-10-2021-0188","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Workplace Health Management; 15(3):307-319, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31679,""

"The impact of workplace safety and customer misbehavior on supermarket workers' stress and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","Purpose&gt;Essential frontline workers in the retail sector face increased exposure risks to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to frequent interactions with the general public. Often these interactions are fraught with controversies over public safety protocols. The purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of frontline workers' perceptions of workplace safety and customer misbehaviors on their stress and psychological distress to inform managing workplace health and safety during public health crises.Design/methodology/approach&gt;The authors conducted an online survey of 3,344 supermarket workers in the state of Arizona (US) during the state's first COVID-19 pandemic wave in July 2020. Measures included mental health distress, and perceptions of workplace safety and customer behaviors. The authors utilized a mixed-methods approach combining multiple regression analyses with qualitative analyses of open-ended comments.Findings&gt;Workers reported high rates of stress and psychological distress. Increases in mental health morbidity were correlated with perceptions of being unsafe in the workplace and concerns about negative customer encounters. Qualitative analyses reveal frustration with management's efforts to reduce risks intertwined with feelings of being unsafe and vulnerable to threatening customer encounters.Practical implications&gt;The findings highlight the need to provide and enforce clear safety guidelines, including how to manage potential hostile customer interactions, to promote positive health workplace management during a pandemic.Originality/value&gt;This study is among the first to assess the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the mental health of non-health care frontline essential workers and presents novel insights regarding perceived customer misbehavior and need for management support and guidance in a public health crisis.","Mayer, Brian, Helm, Sabrina, Barnett, Melissa, Arora, Mona","https://doi.org/10.1108/ijwhm-03-2021-0074","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Workplace Health Management; 15(3):339-358, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31681,""
"The Effects of Torture in the Context of COVID-19 and Continuous Type III Traumaâ€™s Variants: The Peri-Post Type III Trauma Mental Health Syndrome in Syrian Torture Survivors","The goal was to explore the applicability of the continuous traumatic stress type-III paradigm to the tortureâ€™s interface with other ongoing traumatic stressors (e.g., COVID-19 and discrimination) and other adversities' impact. On a sample of 891 Syrian internally displaced (461 torture survivors), we measured cumulative trauma, COVID-19 stressors, and the peri-post type III trauma syndrome (i.e., CPTSD, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and executive functions). We conducted t-test and structural equation modeling. Torture predicted higher COVID-19 stressors and the peri-post type III trauma syndrome. Intersected discrimination amplified the effects of torture. The conceptual and clinical implications of these findings were discussed.

"Virtual canine comfort: A randomized controlled trial of the effects of a canine-assisted intervention supporting undergraduate wellbeing","Being a university student is known to be a stressful experience, and researchers across studies have reported elevated stress and compromised mental health for university students when compared with findings from the general population. The unexpected disruption to their studies arising from COVID-19 and its corresponding social isolation added to the stress experienced by students. This study assessed the effects of a virtual canine-assisted intervention to support student stress reduction and wellbeing. Participants (n = 467) were recruited from undergraduate psychology classes at a mid-size Western Canadian university and were randomly assigned to either synchronous (i.e., live Zoom) or asynchronous (i.e., pre-recorded YouTube videos) sessions with or without a dog present. An abbreviated, small group dose intervention of five minutes was used and handlers across conditions followed a script that mirrored as closely as possible the dialogue shared during a typical live, in-person visit (i.e., shared information about their dog, asked participants to reflect on their wellbeing, etc.). Measures of wellbeing included 1-item measures of connectedness to campus, loneliness, and stress, the PANAS, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Circumplex Model of Affect, and self-ratings of engagement during the intervention. Results of paired samples t-tests revealed that participants, regardless of condition, reported significant reductions in anxiety, stress, loneliness, and negative affect and more positive emotional states and stronger feelings of connectedness to their campus. Regarding the impact of platform delivery, participants reported greater campus connectedness following their participation in the synchronous conditions;however, type of platform was not associated with other aspects of wellbeing as noted above. As hypothesized, undergraduate students in this study did report feeling less stressed at the end of the intervention when a dog was present. The implications of the findings are discussed within the context of university student wellbeing.

The aim of the current study was to gain a deeper understanding of young peopleâ€™s experiences in relation to their mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. Seventeen young people, aged 11-16 years, sampled for diverse characteristics, and living in the UK, were interviewed virtually between December 2020 and February 2021. Eighteen parents/carers and 10 professionalsÂ working with children and familiesÂ and were also interviewed to gain a more comprehensive perspective of young peopleâ€™s experiences. Reflexive thematic analysis was carried out by the research team, which included individuals with lived experience, and revealed five overarching themes: (1) positives;(2) worries and anxiety;(3) sadness and anger about losses;(4) mental exhaustion;and (5) support from others. Young peopleâ€™s experiences appeared to vary according to key background characteristics. Continued measurement of young peopleâ€™s mental health, initiatives to identify young people who have been struggling and the provision of support (including evidence-based and accessible interventions) will be important for protecting young people from future adversities as we emerge from the pandemic.","Waite, Polly, Pearcey, Samantha, Burgess, Lowrie Caitlin Hulley, Sajid, Eshal, Klampe, Marie-Louise, Sargent, Milly, Lawrence, Peter","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/xmpw3","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31684,""

Mental health indicators were represented by general levels of depression and anxiety and the COVID-related stress and anxiety. Only minor changes in depression and anxiety were observed, however, the dynamic in COVID-related stress and especially anxiety was more noteworthy.

"Assessment of fear, anxiety, obsession and functional impairment of COVID-19 amongst health-care workers and trainees: A cross-sectional study in Nepal [version 1;peer review: 1 approved (preprint)","Background: The emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic threw the world into turmoil. The medical community bore the brunt of the pandemic's toll. Long work hours, and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and social support all had an influence on mental health. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among Lumbini Medical College Teaching Hospital students and employees in Palpa, Nepal. Data entailing their demographic details, pre-existing comorbidities, or death in the family due to COVID-19 was collected using a self-administered survey.Â In addition, the level of fear, anxiety, obsession, and functional impairment due to COVID-19 was recorded using previously validated respective scales. Results: In total, 403 health-care workers and trainees participated in our study. The average age of the study participants was 23Â±4 years, and more than half of them (n=262, 65%) were females. A significant association was found between fear score with age (p-value=0.04), gender (p-value &lt;0.01) and occupation (p-value&lt;0.001). The participants suffering from chronic diseases (p-value=0.36), and those who had experienced a COVID-19 death in the family (p-value=0.18), were not found to be significantly obsessed with COVID-19. However, for those who had experienced a COVID-19 death in the family (p-value=0.51) and age (p-value=0.34), these factors were not found to be significantly associated with higher anxiety levels. Nursing students suffered from a significantly greater functional impairment than other medical professionals (mean score=269.15, p-value &lt; 0.001). A moderately positive correlation was observed between fear, anxiety, obsession, and functional impairment scales. Conclusion: This study revealed various socio-demographic characteristics as risk factors for psychological stress in the people related to the health-care profession of Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic. A viable answer to this quandary might be adequate psychosocial intervention by health-care authorities, increased social support, and the introduction of better mental health management measures for the front-line medical workers.","Atreya, Alok, Nepal, Samata, Menezes, Ritesh G.; Shurjeel, Qazi, Qazi, Sana, Ram, Muskaan Doulat, Usman, Muhammad Shariq, Ghimire, Sristi, Marhatta, Anu, Islam, Md Nazmul, Sapkota, Arbin Dev, Garbuja, Chandra Kumari","https://www.google.com/search?q=Assessment+of+fear,+anxiety,+obsession+and+functional+impairment+of+COVID-19+amongst+health-care+workers+and+trainees:+A+cross-sectional+study+in+Nepal+[version+1;peer+review:+1+approved+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31687,""
"The psychology of pandemics: Lessons learned for the future","Pandemics are not simply events in which some harmful microbe ""goes viral,"" rapidly spreading across the globe. Psychology plays a central role in pandemics, influencing the spreading and containment of diseases, and shaping pandemic-related distress and socially disruptive, divisive, and potentially harmful phenomena such as panic buying, racism, and protests against pandemic mitigation restrictions. Insights from contemporary research, combined with analyses of historical records, offers numerous lessons for planning and managing future pandemics: (1) pandemics are not ""once in a lifetime"" events;plan for more to come, (2) forgetting past pandemics is not an option, (3) the labels given to pandemics matter a lot, (4) the infodemic regarding health information is here to stay and we need to learn to deal with it, (5) uncertainty is an  stressor pervading all aspects of pandemics, from beginning to end, (6) pandemics are dynamic events;don't assume static patterns of emotions, attitudes, or behaviors, (7) pandemics can elicit extreme psychological reactions, (8) lockdown harms mental health;alternatives need to be developed and evaluated, (9) resilience is the norm, (10) but a substantial minority of pandemic survivors will need mental health services, (11) health care worker burnout is a serious but tractable problem, (12) mental health services must move beyond the consulting room, (13) we need to be proactive in anticipating and addressing pandemics, and (14) there needs to be a greater involvement of psychology in preparing for and managing pandemics.

"Characterizing Physician Suicide in the US (2003-2017)","OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Suicide is a growing public health problem with the rate of suicide increasing 33% since 1999. Physicians are not immune to this growing problem. Physicians represent a unique population that has been understudied with respect to suicide. The aim of the study is to investigate risk factors unique to physicians compared to the general population. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System, a nationwide CDC database which aggregates information on violent deaths, we extracted demographic and circumstantial data on 172,135 suicide decedents Ã¢â€°Â¥ 25 years old in participating states from 2003-2017. Of these, we found complete information regarding demographics, occupation, and circumstance for 160,159 suicide decedents. We separated suicide decedents by physician-status and compared 795 physicians to 159,364 non-physician decedents using chi-squared test. We then used multivariate logistic regression to examine differences in suicide method and circumstance by physician-status status, controlling for age, sex, and race. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Compared to non-physicians, physicians were more likely to be male (84.5% vs 77.3%, p&lt;0.001) and older (45.1% Ã¢â€°Â¥65 vs. 17.8%, p&lt;0.001). Controlling for demographics, physicians were less likely to complete suicide by firearm (aOR=0.60, 95%CI=0.51-0.71) but were more likely to suicide by overdose (aOR=1.41, 95%CI=1.13-1.77) or cutting (aOR=2.81, 95%CI=2.03-3.88). Physicians were more likely to have job related stressors (aOR=2.24, 95%Cl=1.83-2.74) and legal problems (aOR=2.34, 95%Cl=1.70-3.21). Physicians were also more likely to leave a suicide note (aOR=1.48, 95%Cl=1.26-1.73) but were less likely to be intoxicated on alcohol at time of death (aOR=0.76, 95%Cl=0.62-0.93). Physicians were no different than non-physicians in terms of financial or relational stressors. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Physicians are more likely to be male and older. Given their medical training, overdose and cutting may be more accessible and lethal methods for physicians. Physicians are more likely to leave a suicide note and less likely to be intoxicated, which may imply less impulsivity. Job stressors and legal problems may also contribute to physician suicide.","Borota, Daniel, Nestadt, Paul S.","https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2022.31","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Translational Science; 6(s1):3-4, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31689,""
"Self-compassion as a moderator of the association between covid-19 stressors and psychological symptoms: A longitudinal study","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in adverse psychological outcomes for many around the globe. Less is known however regarding dispositional traits that may protect against negative psychological outcomes. This study examined the prospective association between COVID-19 stressors and psychological symptoms, and whether self-compassion (referring to a dispositional tendency of relating to oneself kindly) would moderate this association. A convenience sample of 212 university students and working adults (60.4% female;Mage = 20.92 years) based in Singapore completed measures assessing COVID-19 stressors (perceived COVID-19 health risk, economic impact, and impact on daily life), psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms), and self-compassion 2 months apart. Results indicated that perceived COVID-19 health risk at baseline predicted anxiety symptoms 2 months later, above and beyond baseline anxiety symptoms. Self-compassion moderated the association between perceived COVID-19 health risk and depressive symptoms, and the relationship between perceived impact on daily life and anxiety symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of self-compassion in alleviating psychological symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"What can work and how? An overview of evidence-based interventions and delivery strategies to support health and human development from before conception to 20 years","Summary Progress has been made globally in improving the coverage of key maternal, newborn, and early childhood interventions in low-income and middle-income countries, which has contributed to a decrease in child mortality and morbidity. However, inequities remain, and many children and adolescents are still not covered by life-saving and nurturing care interventions, despite their relatively low costs and high cost-effectiveness. This Series paper builds on a large body of work from the past two decades on evidence-based interventions and packages of care for survival, strategies for delivery, and platforms to reach the most vulnerable. We review the current evidence base on the effectiveness of a variety of essential and emerging interventions that can be delivered from before conception until age 20 years to help children and adolescents not only survive into adulthood, but also to grow and develop optimally, support their wellbeing, and help them reach their full developmental potential. Although scaling up evidence-based interventions in children younger than 5 years might have the greatest effect on reducing child mortality rates, we highlight interventions and evidence gaps for school-age children (5â€“9 years) and the transition from childhood to adolescence (10â€“19 years), including interventions to support mental health and positive development, and address unintentional injuries, neglected tropical diseases, and non-communicable diseases.","Vaivada, Tyler, Lassi, Zohra S.; Irfan, Omar, Salam, Rehana A.; Das, Jai K.; Oh, Christina, Carducci, Bianca, Jain, Reena P.; Als, Daina, Sharma, Naeha, Keats, Emily C.; Patton, George C.; Kruk, Margaret E.; Black, Robert E.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(21)02725-2","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Lancet; 399(10337):1810-1829, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31691,""
"Improving health and social systems for all children in LMICs: structural innovations to deliver high-quality services","Summary Despite health gains over the past 30 years, children and adolescents are not reaching their health potential in many low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In addition to health systems, social systems, such as schools, communities, families, and digital platforms, can be used to promote health. We did a targeted literature review of how well health and social systems are meeting the needs of children in LMICs using the framework of The Lancet Global Health Commission on high-quality health systems and we reviewed evidence for structural reforms in health and social sectors. We found that quality of services for children is substandard across both health and social systems. Health systems have deficits in care competence (eg, diagnosis and management), system competence (eg, timeliness, continuity, and referral), user experience (eg, respect and usability), service provision for common and serious conditions (eg, cancer, trauma, and mental health), and service offerings for adolescents. Education and social services for child health are limited by low funding and poor coordination with other sectors. Structural reforms are more likely to improve service quality substantially and at scale than are micro-level efforts. Promising approaches include governing for quality (eg, leadership, expert management, and learning systems), redesigning service delivery to maximise outcomes, and empowering families to better care for children and to demand quality care from health and social systems. Additional research is needed on health needs across the life course, health system performance for children and families, and large-scale evaluation of promising health and social programmes.","Kruk, Margaret E.; Lewis, Todd P.; Arsenault, Catherine, Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.; Irimu, Grace, Jeong, Joshua, Lassi, Zohra S.; Sawyer, Susan M.; Vaivada, Tyler, Waiswa, Peter, Yousafzai, Aisha K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(21)02532-0","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Lancet; 399(10337):1830-1844, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31692,""
"Egyptian perspectives on potential risk of paracetamol/acetaminophen-induced toxicities: Lessons learnt during COVID-19 pandemic","Paracetamol/Acetaminophen was widely used as a first-line antipyretic and analgesic for COVID-19 patients without giving any attention to the potential risk of related toxicities. A survey was conducted on 176 Egyptians using an online survey portal to assess their knowledge, and attitude regarding potential risk of paracetamol toxicities and whether COVID-19 pandemic affected their practices regarding safe use of paracetamol. The self-administered questionnaire was developed by the researchers and was validated by expert opinions. A pilot testing of the questionnaire was done. Alpha Cronbach test used to assess the internal consistency reliability of the survey revealed good reliability. Overall percent-score revealed that only 24.4% of participants had good knowledge about paracetamol and its related potential toxicities. 62.5% of participants considered paracetamol safer than other medications of the same indications. 42.6% of participants could advise others to use paracetamol without prescription. According to the participants' responses, physicians were less concerned to give instructions about possibility of overdosage. Our results also revealed that participants' administration of paracetamol without physician prescription was more during COVID-19. Practice of paracetamol administration more than the allowed number of tablets/day was significantly more evident during the pandemic. We concluded that the unsupervised use of paracetamol is an alarming sign that should be addressed as this could lead to a high rate of accidental paracetamol toxicity. A lesson learnt from COVID-19 pandemic is the need to implement behavior change measures to mitigate the risk of accidental paracetamol toxicity.","Mostafa, E. M. A.; Tawfik, A. M.; Abd-Elrahman, K.

"Self-harm in an older adult population during the COVID -19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented major challenges for all demographics of society. The strict lockdown measures utilised to control the spread of the virus have the potential unintended consequences of exacerbating social isolation and loneliness, which are recognised to be pre-existing issues in the elderly population. Because of this, the pandemic may have disproportionality impacted the elderly population. One way that the distress caused by the pandemic could manifest is through self-harm and suicide. Here, the authors present a retrospective, cross-sectional study examining self-harm in an older adult population in the south west of England.","Obidoa, Michael, Bello, Rakiya, Hardman, Stephen","https://doi.org/10.1002/pnp.747","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Progress in Neurology and Psychiatry; 26(2):24-28, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31695,""
"The feasibility and promise of Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training with teachers and school personnel in high-poverty schools","This study examined the feasibility and promise of using virtual Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training (DBT-ST) with educators. DBT-ST was offered to 39 educators (89% female, mean age 46.45) in one high-poverty school district during the COVID-19 pandemic using a preâ€“post design. Educators attended five of eight groups (Mode = 8) and there were statistically significant decreases in stress (p = .001, rrb = -.51) and dysfunctional coping (p = .000, rrb = -.57), and increases in DBT skill use (p = .016, rrb = .44). Ratings on anxiety and depression were unchanged. The <U+03C7>2 analyses indicated a significant relationship between stress and attendance with the high stress group more likely to attend the groups than the low stress group, <U+03C7>2(1) = 4.88, p = .027. DBT-ST may be feasible for teachers but future considerations regarding the role of mental health personnel in delivering teacher health and wellness interventions is warranted.

"Urban Scaling of Health Outcomes: a Scoping Review","Urban scaling is a framework that describes how city-level characteristics scale with variations in city size. This scoping review mapped the existing evidence on the urban scaling of health outcomes to identify gaps and inform future research. Using a structured search strategy, we identified and reviewed a total of 102 studies, a majority set in high-income countries using diverse city definitions. We found several historical studies that examined the dynamic relationships between city size and mortality occurring during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In more recent years, we documented heterogeneity in the relation between city size and health. Measles and influenza are influenced by city size in conjunction with other factors like geographic proximity, while STIs, HIV, and dengue tend to occur more frequently in larger cities. NCDs showed a heterogeneous pattern that depends on the specific outcome and context. Homicides and other crimes are more common in larger cities, suicides are more common in smaller cities, and traffic-related injuries show a less clear pattern that differs by context and type of injury. Future research should aim to understand the consequences of urban growth on health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, capitalize on longitudinal designs, systematically adjust for covariates, and examine the implications of using different city definitions.","McCulley, Edwin M.; Mullachery, Pricila H.; Ortigoza, Ana F.; RodrÃ­guez, Daniel A.; Diez Roux, Ana V.; Bilal, Usama","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-021-00577-4","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31697,""

Studies published from January 1999 to January 2020 were considered. Findings indicated that Chinese students routinely report increased levels of fear, stress, anxiety, depression and social problems, as well as decreased levels of general well-being, while studying in Australia. Numerous factors may exacerbate the issues confronted by Chinese university students studying in Australia, including language barriers;social, academic and financial difficulties;challenges associated with the different education systems of the two countries;and their own underuse of available mental health services.

"Living with COVID-19: Depression, anxiety and life satisfaction during the new normal in Turkey","Current findings suggest that many people experience high levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms and life dissatisfaction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effects of the pandemic and life changes during the new normal of social restrictions in Turkey are yet to be examined. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, correlates and predictors of life satisfaction, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms during the new normal of ongoing social restrictions. This is a cross-sectional study conducted online with 352 participants living in Turkey. Measures included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Satisfaction with Life Scales. Sociodemographic variables and questions relating to the COVID-19 were collected. The results showed that low social communication and the sense of being restricted were significant predictors of life dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. Of the participants, 91.5% were dissatisfied with their lives during the new normal of social restrictions. In addition, nearly half of the participants showed depressive symptoms (55.7%) and anxiety symptoms (54.3%). The present study suggested that social communication might be a key factor to improve psychological wellbeing. Considering the long-term effects of the pandemic on public mental health, developing effective preventive measures and intervention strategies are crucial.

"Impact of COVID-19 on cash crops: the case of black pepper in Kerala","The nationwide lockdown which has been in force from 24th March 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic had a severe economic impact on agriculture sector. This has been in spite of the exemptions given to the sector after two weeks of lockdown. The agriculture has been seen by many in the post-COVID scenario as the bright spot in the economy. But, the pepper crop is uniquely located in the sense that its consumption is largely driven by food processing industries which had been affected by the pandemic. Not only that the two back-to-back floods in 2018 and 2019 had severely affected the pepper production in Idukki district of Kerala which accounts for the largest production share. The district even faced a spate of farmer suicides in the recent times. This paper is an exploration into the various impacts of the present pandemic on the pepper economy of Kerala.

"Network analysis of depression, anxiety, insomnia and quality of life among Macau residents during the COVID-19 pandemic","Although the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly impacted individuals' mental health and quality of life, network analysis studies of associations between symptoms of common syndromes during the pandemic are lacking, particularly among Macau residents. This study investigated the network structure of insomnia, anxiety, and depression and explored their associations with quality of life in this population. This online survey was conducted in Macau between August 18 and November 9, 2020. Insomnia, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and quality of life were assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-brief version, respectively. Analyses were performed to identify central symptoms and bridge symptoms of this network and their links to quality of life. 975 participants enrolled in this survey. The prevalence of depressive, anxiety and insomnia symptoms were 38.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 35.5%-41.5%), 28.8% (95%CI: 26.0%-31.7%), and 27.6% (95% CI: 24.8%-30.4%), respectively. ""Sleep maintenance"" had the highest expected influence centrality, followed by ""Trouble relaxing"", ""Interference with daytime functioning"", ""Irritability"", and ""Fatigue"". Five bridge symptoms were identified: ""Sleep problems"", ""Restlessness"", ""Irritability"", ""Severity of sleep onset"", and ""Motor activity"". The insomnia symptom, ""Sleep dissatisfaction"", had the strongest direct relation to quality of life. Insomnia symptoms played a critical role in the distress symptom network regarding node and bridge centrality as well as associations with quality of life among Macau residents.

"Prevalence of psychological distress on public health officials amid COVID-19 pandemic","While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to increased burnout among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs), little research has been done regarding the potential psychological burden among public health officials who have worked tirelessly to tackle the pandemic from an administrative perspective. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout, depression, and job-related stress in Japanese public health officers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an anonymous, self-administered web-based cross-sectional survey including basic demographics, work-related questions, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-3, and Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. 100 public health officers working in the public health centers (PHCs) in Okayama, Japan, answered the survey in December 2021 when the 5th surge in the number of COVID-19 was over. The prevalence of burnout, depression, and job-related stress was 27%, 43%, and 62%, respectively. The multivariate logistic analysis demonstrated that females, public health nurses, and those who suffered from a lack of support from their workplaces were significantly associated with psychological distress. While we tend to focus on mitigation plans to help alleviate burnout of frontline HCWs, more focus is needed to help public health officers, and public health nurses, in particular, to alleviate their psychological distress and job-related stress to prevent further staff shortages and secure sustainable health systems.","Nishimura, Miyoshi, Hagiya, Otsuka","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2022.103160","20220520","Burnout; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Depression public health center; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31706,""
"Adolescent Screen Time Associated with Risk Factor of Fear of Missing Out During Pandemic Covid-19","The use of digital technology for educational and recreational purposes among adolescents has drastically increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the prolonged isolation and excessive screen time of the social media platforms might lead to mental health issues, particularly the fear of missing out (FOMO). Thus, this study is aimed at exploring the adolescent's screen time and its contribution to FOMO. This study employed a qualitative method using semi-structured interviews with 30 selected adolescents. The data were collected during the third peak of the pandemic period in Malaysia, between the 11th of April 2021 and the 1st of July 2021. The results revealed that there were four issues related to the FOMO: loneliness, life satisfaction, self-disclosures, and social comparison. In short, self-regulation and awareness on the effects of long screen time need to be instilled among the adolescents during the pandemic. Also, it is pivotal to address the psychological needs, such as healthy social interactions in ensuring the adolescents are not inclined toward FOMO.","Amran, Jamaluddin","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2021.0308","20220520","adolescent; fears of missing out; pandemic covid-19; screen time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31707,""
"Mental health among healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand","This study aimed to measure the prevalence of burnout syndrome, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic disorders (PTSD), as well as examine their associated factors among Thai healthcare workers (HCWs) during COVID-19 outbreak. We employed a multiple-method design at a tertiary-care hospital in Bangkok between May 22, 2021 and June 30, 2021 by using an online survey. The information included demographic characteristics, work details, perceived support, PTSD symptoms, Maslach Burnout Inventory: General Survey (MBI-GS), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9), and narrative response to an open-ended question. The associated factors of mental health problems were analysed by multiple logistic regression analyses. The qualitative data were analysed by the content analysis method. A total of 986 HCWs (89.1% female; mean age = 34.89 Ã‚Â± 11.05 years) responded to the survey. 16.3%,16%, and 53.5% of respondents had a high level of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and diminished personal achievement, respectively. 33.1%, 13.8%, and 2.3% of respondents had anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Risk factors of emotional exhaustion were male sex (ORadj = 2.29), nurses (ORadj = 3.04), doctors (ORadj = 4.29), working at COVID-19 inpatient unit (ORadj = 2.97), and working at COVID-19 intensive care unit (ORadj = 3.00). Additionally, preexisting mental illness was associated with anxiety (ORadj = 2.89), depression (ORadj = 3.47), and PTSD (ORadj = 4.06). From qualitative analysis, participants reported that these factors would improve their mental health: supportive and respectful colleagues, appropriate financial compensation, reduced workload, clarity of policy and communication channel, and adequate personal protective equipment. Thai HCWs experienced negative mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic substantially.

"Misinformation in Italian Online Mental Health Communities During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Content Analysis Study","Social media platforms are widely used by people suffering from mental illnesses to cope with their conditions. One modality of coping with these conditions is navigating online communities where people can receive emotional support and informational advice. Benefits have been documented in terms of impact on health outcomes. However, the pitfalls are still unknown, as not all content is necessarily helpful or correct. Furthermore, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and related problems, such as worsening mental health symptoms, the dissemination of conspiracy narratives, and medical distrust, may have impacted these online communities. The situation in Italy is of particular interest, being the first Western country to experience a nationwide lockdown. Particularly during this challenging time, the beneficial role of community moderators with professional mental health expertise needs to be investigated in terms of uncovering misleading information and regulating communities. The aim of the proposed study is to investigate the potentially harmful content found in online communities for mental health symptoms in the Italian language. Besides descriptive information about the content that posts and comments address, this study aims to analyze the content from two viewpoints. The first one compares expert-led and peer-led communities, focusing on differences in misinformation. The second one unravels the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, not by merely investigating differences in topics but also by investigating the needs expressed by community members. A codebook for the content analysis of Facebook communities has been developed, and a content analysis will be conducted on bundles of posts. Among 14 Facebook groups that were interested in participating in this study, two groups were selected for analysis: one was being moderated by a health professional (n=12,058 members) and one was led by peers (n=5598 members). Utterances from 3 consecutive calendar years will be studied by comparing the months from before the pandemic, the months during the height of the pandemic, and the months during the postpandemic phase (2019-2021). This method permits the identification of different types of misinformation and the context in which they emerge. Ethical approval was obtained by the UniversitÃƒ della Svizzera italiana ethics committee. The usability of the codebook was demonstrated with a pretest. Subsequently, 144 threads (1534 utterances) were coded by the two coders. Intercoder reliability was calculated on 293 units (19.10% of the total sample; Krippendorff ÃŽÂ±=.94, range .72-1). Aside from a few analyses comparing bundles, individual utterances will constitute the unit of analysis in most cases. This content analysis will identify deleterious content found in online mental health support groups, the potential role of moderators in uncovering misleading information, and the impact of COVID-19 on the content.

"How to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on laparoendoscopic single-site surgery training?","Because of special technical challenges, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has been introduced into surgical practice, with surgeons required to have adequate training. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected every aspect of healthcare systems, including LESS training, which must be modified to minimise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A 3-session training programme was designed in 2020 during the epidemic, which was modified in 2019 before the pandemic. Session 1 was an online study on LESS knowledge. Session 2 involved the trainees' self-directed simulator-training. Task performance was evaluated using the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) scoring. Session 3 was practical training, including trainers' live surgical video demonstrations and trainees' surgical video feedback after training. Video feedback performance was evaluated using the modified global rating scale (GRS). Furthermore, trainees completed a general self-efficacy (GSE) instrument. Forty-two gynaecology trainees were allocated into two groups: novices (n=32) and experts (n=10). Compared with pre-training, FLS scores improved in peg transfer (P &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001 and P =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and pattern cutting (P =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02 and P &lt;0.001) for novices and experts, respectively. Participants (81% vs. 67%) provided first and second video feedback, respectively. Compared to the first feedback, the GRS scores of both groups improved significantly in the second feedback. All trainees showed an increase in GSE after training (P &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The modified LESS training programme is a practical and effective option that allows trainees to continue training during the epidemic.","Xu, Zhou, Chen, Ding, Hua, Ren, Shen","https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.17819","20220520","COVID-19; LESS; Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery; pandemic; surgical training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31710,""
"Age differences in mental health from May through August 2020 among US adults: trajectories and the role of pandemic, lifestyle, and social factors","<b>Objectives:</b> Using nationally representative data among U.S. adults, we assess age differences in changes in mental health both from 2018 to May 2020 and during the pandemic. We also examine factors explaining age differences in mental health.<b>Methods:</b> We analyzed 2018 General Social Survey data (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,348; age 18-89) and three waves of COVID Response Tracking Study data (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,279; age 20-94) spanning May-August 2020. Outcomes included happiness, loneliness, stress, positive affect, and negative affect.<b>Results:</b> U.S. adults reported greater loneliness and less happiness in May 2020 versus 2018. Only loneliness and negative affect changed significantly from May to August 2020, showing declines. Mental health trajectories did not differ significantly by age. Overall, older adults reported lower loneliness, stress, and negative affect than younger adults during 2020. Older age was associated with two factors linked with better mental health: less likelihood of COVID-19 exposure and greater satisfaction with social activities and relationships. However, none of the factors examined herein explained age differences in mental health.<b>Conclusion:</b> Although mental health trajectories during the pandemic were similar across ages, older adults tended to report better mental health than younger adults. Future research should identify factors that explain age differences in mental health that persisted into 2020.","Finch, Hawkley, Krummenacher, Stripp, Sterrett, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2076206","20220520","COVID-19; Loneliness; happiness; mental health; negative affect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31711,""
"COVID-19 pandemic and the mental health care system","The psychological impact of pandemics, which historically appear in the human species, is described in detail in Steven Taylor's excellent book ""The Psychology of Pandemics"",1 which was published in 2019, a few months before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. This pandemic shows similar characteristics in terms of mental health problems to the previous ones described in the book, according to the findings of epidemiological research, both internationally and in Greece.2-5 The results of these studies show a significant increase of the prevalence of common mental disorders, especially in vulnerable groups, particularly in persons with preexisting mental disorders. The necessary restrictive measures applied, especially in the first stages of the pandemic, had an impact in the accessibility of psychiatric patients to the mental health services, both in- and outpatient ones.6 This led to decreased outpatient appointments and admissions in inpatient wards, depriving a large number of these patients from necessary treatments and interventions, often resulting in worsening their mental state or relapse of acute episodes. The lack of accessibility to mental health services, had a greater impact on persons with social and financial problems, which deteriorated during the pandemic, leading to mental health problems.3 An additional problem is that persons suffering from severe mental disorders, such as chronic psychoses, face a greater risk of infection and death by Covid-19.7 These problems, arising during the pandemic (increased prevalence of mental disorders, increase of relapses of serious mental disorders, increased risk of infection and death by Covid-19, increased prevalence in those infected, especially those in the ICUs, problems of accessibility) underline the chronic insufficiencies of the mental health care system, which in many countries, especially in Greece, is fragmented and is not covering adequately the mental health needs of the population. A series of articles in prestigious mental health journals point out the problem and propose solutions, in order to correct insufficiencies and create a new strong mental health system through a series of activities.8-10 These articles underline the problems known for decades and propose the following solutions for enhancing the existing mental health system, not only to cover additional needs created by the pandemic, but leading to a new mental health system covering adequately the needs of the population: (1) Strengthening leadership and governance, with interventions to politicians and administrators, in order to understand mental health issues, and provide services in terms of inclusivity, equity and accountability. (2) Supporting financially evidence-based services, adopting policies to counteract the social determinants of mental health, as well as the additional needs created by the pandemic. (3) Promoting programmes targeting vulnerable groups, especially those related to social determinants, with the active participation of stakeholders, with emphasis in combating stigma and enhancing mental health literacy. (4) Strengthen mental health services in all three levels, with emphasis in community mental health services, treatment at home, special services for vulnerable groups, services for the Covid-infected and the relatives of the deceased from the infection, the staff of health services dealing with Covid-19, using ""telehealth"" services, adopting information systems to assist services and close collaboration with the services dealing with Covid-19. (5) Training the staff of primary health care in mental health by using the mhGAP programme of the World Health Organization (WHO) and linking them to the special mental health services. (6) Implementing programmes for mental health promotion and prevention of mental disorders, with the participation of stakeholders, NGOs and the civil society. (7) Improving mental health information systems and connecting them with parallel systems dealing with Covid-19. (8) Strengthen and finance research in mental health, from epidemiology and services research, to neurobiology, as well as research aiming to provide innovative solutions for improving the system of mental health services and the provision of services and interventions through the social media. (9) Protecting rights of mental patients aiming to provide high quality services by use of evaluation instruments such as WHOQualityRights of WHO.","Mavreas, Stylianidis","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2022.081","20220520","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31712,""
"Prognosis of rapid onset functional tic-like behaviors: Prospective follow-up over 6 months","The prognosis of rapid onset functional tic-like behaviors (FTLBs) is unknown. This prospective cohort study describes the course and treatment of rapid onset FTLBs in adolescents (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 20) and adults (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9) previously reported in two case series. Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) scores were compared between first clinical presentation and 6-month follow-up assessment. All treatments used for FTLBs and any psychiatric comorbidities were recorded. In adolescents with FTLBs, motor tics, vocal tics, total tics, impairment, and global scores on the YGTSS significantly improved at 6 months, with a mean decrease in the YGTSS global score of 31.9 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 15.4, 48.4, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .0005. In adults with FTLBs, only impairment and global scores significantly improved, with a mean decrease in the YGTSS global score of 19.6 points, 95% CI -3.2, 42.3, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .04. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety and depression were the most used treatment in both age groups.

"Impact of a single school-based intervention for COVID-19 on improving mental health among Japanese children","An underlying concern about the COVID-19 pandemic is the decline of children's mental health. The present study is aimed to investigate whether a single school-based intervention, including self-monitoring and psychoeducation for COVID-19, effectively achieved its aim to promote children's mental health. The study was conducted in a junior high school. We assigned the third grade as the intervention group, the second grade as the announcement group, and the first grade as the control group. We hypothesized that the intervention group would experience improved mental health and reduced fear of COVID-19 compared to the announcement and control groups. Interaction effects were observed only for depression, indicating a significant effect in the intervention group. These findings suggest that a single school-based intervention that includes self-monitoring and psychoeducation for COVID-19 can help improve children's mental health. It is suggested that school-based interventions that intend to raise children's awareness of COVID-19 promote their healthy development and adaptation to crises within the school.","Kubo, Masuyama, Shinkawa, Sugawara","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045221094392","20220520","COVID-19; School; education; intervention; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31714,""
"Relationships Between Aging Attitudes and Successful Aging Outcomes in Middle-age and Older Women","This study aimed to explore the relationships between aging attitudes and the outcomes of successful aging, including whether aging attitudinal types moderate psychological adjustment in the context of medical and mental health diagnoses. In total, 409 community-dwelling women aged 40-79 years in Australia completed the Reactions to Aging Questionnaire (RAQ), Geriatric Depression Scale, Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory. Information about medical and mental health diagnoses were collected. Overall, aging attitudes and all three RAQ subscales were negatively correlated with scores on measures of depression and anxiety, and number of medical diagnoses. Attitudinal types toward aging were found to moderate the relationship between the number of mental health diagnoses and scores on the psychological measures of depression but not anxiety. Unique RAQ domain-specific relationships were found with the number of mental health diagnoses. The findings support the link between aging attitudes and psychological outcomes, the potential clinical value of RAQ attitudinal typologies classification as well as a multidimensional conceptualization of aging attitudes. The findings reinforce the need for efforts to reduce ageism on a societal level, as well as informing clinical decision-making with older clients.","Seow, Byrne, Arnold, Pachana","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2022.2072791","20220520","Aging; Australia; COVID-19 pandemic; grief and loss; health; meaning-making; older adult; preventive health; psychology; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31715,""
"Factors associated with progression of depression, anxiety, and stress-related symptoms in outpatients and inpatients with COVID-19: A longitudinal study","It is known that there is an increase in the frequency of psychiatric disturbances in the acute and post-illness phase of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Comorbid psychiatric symptoms complicate the management of patients and negatively affect the prognosis, but there is no clear evidence of their progress. We aimed to determine psychiatric comorbidity in inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19 and recognize the factors that predict psychiatric comorbidity. For this purpose, we evaluated patients on the first admission and after 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. We investigated psychiatric symptoms in outpatients (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 106) and inpatients (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 128) diagnosed with COVID-19. In the first 7Ã¢â‚¬â€°days after diagnosis (first phase), sociodemographic and clinic data were collected, a symptom checklist was constructed, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Severity of Acute Stress Symptoms Scale (SASSS) were applied. After 30-35Ã¢â‚¬â€°days following the diagnosis, the SASSS and the HADS were repeated. In the first phase, the frequency of depression and anxiety were 55% and 20% in inpatients, and 39% and 18% in outpatients, respectively. In the second phase, depression scores are significantly decreased in both groups whereas anxiety scores were decreased only in inpatients. The frequencies of patients reporting sleep and attention problems, irritability, and suicide ideas decreased after 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month. Patients with loss of smell and taste exhibit higher anxiety and depression scores in both stages. Our results revealed that the rate of psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients improves within 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°month. Inpatients have a more significant decrease in both depression and anxiety frequency than do outpatients. The main factor affecting anxiety and depression was the treatment modality. Considering that all patients who were hospitalized were discharged at the end of the first month, this difference may be due to the elimination of the stress caused by hospitalization.","HoÃ…Å¸gÃƒÂ¶ren AlÃ„Â±cÃ„Â±, Ãƒâ€¡Ã„Â±nar, HasanlÃ„Â±, Ceran, Onar, GÃƒÂ¼lten, Akdemir Kalkan, MemikoÃ„Å¸lu, Ãƒâ€¡elik, Devrimci-Ozguven","https://doi.org/10.1002/pchj.557","20220520","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; psychopathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31716,""
"A cross-sectional study to determine the psychological distress among pulmonary tuberculosis patients during COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic had adversely affected the services of the National Tuberculosis (TB) Elimination Programme, resulting in psychological distress among pulmonary tuberculosis patients (PTB). This cross-sectional, hospital-based study included 361 PTB patients. Three pre-defined questionnaires were used for the analysis, a questionnaire to evaluate anxiety related to COVID-19, a patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, and a fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) questionnaire. Among 361 PTB patients, 13% (n=47) had COVID-19 infection. Out of the total patients, 69% (n=250) were DR-TB (drug resistance-tuberculosis) cases. Proportion of anxiety, fear and depression due to COVID-19 was found in 49% (n=177), 23% (n=83), 67% (n=247) respectively. Delay in the initiation of anti-tubercular treatment was found in 58% (n=210) of the cases, among which the majority, i.e., 69% (n=172, p=0.011), were DR-TB. This pandemic has led to a sudden step-down of PTB. Trend analysis of the psychological distress showed a peak following the COVID-19 pandemic. Most DR-TB patients had delayed initiation of the anti-tubercular treatment during the pandemic.

"Training Patterns and Mental Health of Bodybuilders and Fitness Athletes During the First Lockdown of the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Cross-Sectional Study","Government restrictions during the first COVID-19 lockdown, such as the closure of gyms and fitness centers, drastically limited the training opportunities of bodybuilders and fitness athletes (BoFA) who rely on indoor training facilities. This provided a unique situation to investigate the effect of training limitations on the training patterns, training adaptive strategies and mental health of BoFAs. The primary aim of this study was to investigate differences in the training patterns and the mental health of BoFA before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown. The secondary aim was to assess whether BoFA who exhibited features of muscle dysmorphia were affected differently from the group that did not. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 85 BoFAs by means of an online questionnaire asking about sports activity, intensity, subjective physical performance, and economic status, including primary or secondary occupations before (from memory) and during lockdown, current physical health problems and financial fears, symptoms of depression, sleep disorders, anxiety (trait and state), muscle dysmorphia, coping mechanisms and actions during the first lockdown in Switzerland. Training patterns and mental health of BoFA were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and first lockdown. During lockdown, the physical activity on the BoFA dropped significantly from 2.3 Ã‚Â± 0.8 h per day to 1.6 Ã‚Â± 0.9 h per day (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), the subjective training intensity decreased significantly from 85.7 Ã‚Â± 13.2% to 58.3 Ã‚Â± 28.3% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and the subjective performance declined significantly from 83.4 Ã‚Â± 14.3% to 58.2 Ã‚Â± 27.8% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) of maximal performance. In comparison to those without risk for body dysmorphia, participants at risk rated their maximal performance significantly lower and scored significantly higher for depression, sleep disorders and anxiety. This study showed the significant changes on the training patterns of BoFA before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown and poor mental health scores of BoFA during the lockdown itself, with those at risk of muscle dysmorphia scoring statistically worse regarding mental health than those with no risk of muscle dysmorphia. To better understand the particularities of BoFA, further investigation is needed to understand their psychology and in particular the effect of training restrictions on it.","Iff, FrÃƒÂ¶hlich, Halioua, Imboden, SpÃƒÂ¶rri, Scherr, Butzke, Seifritz, Claussen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.867140","20220520","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; bodybuilding; mental health; resistance training; sports psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31718,""
"Evaluating the Implementation of a Mental Health App for Overseas Filipino Workers in Macao China: A Mixed-Methods Study of Stakeholders' Perspectives","Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) is one of the largest communities of international migrant workers. They face systemic barriers to fulfilling their health needs. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened this condition and provided a context to evaluate the utility of a digital mental health intervention delivered within a stepped-care model to address OFW mental health. Using an implementation science framework, this study aimed to evaluate stakeholders' perspectives on the implementation of Kumusta Kabayan, a mobile phone-based mental health app, for OFWs in Macao. A mixed-methods convergent design was used by conducting two parallel steps, including quantitative and qualitative measures. The quantitative data was collected from Filipino team members and local non-governmental organization (NGO) staff members (<i>N</i> = 12). The qualitative data were gathered from interviews with OFWs in Macao who used the app (<i>N</i> = 25; 80% females, 76% domestic workers). From the online survey, the staff members of the local partner NGO and the Filipino team members strongly perceived that their organization could adapt Kumusta Kabayan to their program and generally evaluated that Kumusta Kabayan achieved its goal and was received well by OFWs. In the interviews, the OFW app users shared their experiences in using Kumusta Kabayan, which was thematically organized into six aspects of the participants' experience: (1) promotional channel and expectation; (2) when to use the app and in what language; (3) lessons learnt; (4) memorable aspects; (5) key facilitators and barriers; and (6) suggestions. Kumusta Kabayan was well accepted and shows potential to be integrated into the existing support services for OFWs in Macao. This app has the promise of being scaled-up for OFWs in other countries by collaborating with local and overseas stakeholders. Lessons learnt from this evaluation could also be implemented in wider digital mental health services in different settings.","Liem, Pakingan, Garabiles, Sit, Burchert, Lam, Hall","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.836156","20220520","digital health; global mental health; implementation science; stepped care; telehealth; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31719,""
"Evolution in French University Students' Mental Health One Month After the First COVID-19 Related Quarantine: Results From the COSAMe Survey","The COVID-19 related quarantine had negative psychological effects among University students. Evidence from previous epidemics suggests that negative psychological effects of quarantine measures can last or even worsen after the quarantine lift. The objective of this study was to assess the evolution of students' mental health and to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes 1 month after the lift of the lockdown. This repeated cross-sectional study collected data during the first quarantine in France (T1, <i>N</i> = 68,891) and 1 month after its lift (T2, <i>N</i> = 22,540), through an online questionnaire sent to all French University students. Using cross-sectional data, we estimated prevalence rates of suicidal thoughts, severe anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State subscale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) at T1 and T2. Using longitudinal data (<i>N</i> = 6,346), we identified risk factors of poor mental health outcomes among sociodemographic characteristics, precariousness indicators, health-related data, information on the social environment, and media consumption, adjusting for baseline mental health status. We found lower prevalence rates of severe stress (21.7%), anxiety (22.1%), and depression (13Ã‚Â·9%) one month after the quarantine compared to the quarantine period (24.8%, 27.5%, and 16.1%, respectively). The prevalence rate of suicidal thoughts increased from 11.4 to 13.2%. Regardless of the existence of symptoms during quarantine, four factors were systematically associated with poor mental health outcomes 1 month after the quarantine was lifted: female gender, a low feeling of integration before the quarantine period, a low quality of social ties during the quarantine, and a history of psychiatric follow-up. The prevalence rates of severe stress, anxiety, and depression, although being lower than during the first lockdown, remained high after its lift. The prevalence rate of suicidal ideation increased. This stresses the need to consider the enduring psychological impact of the pandemic on students as a critical public health issue.","Wathelet, Vincent, Fovet, Notredame, Habran, MartignÃƒÂ¨ne, Baubet, Vaiva, D'Hondt","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.868369","20220520","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic (COVID19); quarantine; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31720,""
"Association of Different Restriction Levels With COVID-19-Related Distress and Mental Health in Somatic Inpatients: A Secondary Analysis of Swiss General Hospital Data","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related countermeasures hinder health care access and affect mental wellbeing of non-COVID-19 patients. There is lack of evidence on distress and mental health of patients hospitalized due to other reasons than COVID-19-a vulnerable population group in two ways: First, given their risk for physical diseases, they are at increased risk for severe courses and death related to COVID-19. Second, they may struggle particularly with COVID-19 restrictions due to their dependence on social support. Therefore, we investigated the association of intensity of COVID-19 restrictions with levels of COVID-19-related distress, mental health (depression, anxiety, somatic symptom disorder, and mental quality of life), and perceived social support among Swiss general hospital non-COVID-19 inpatients. We analyzed distress of 873 hospital inpatients not admitted for COVID-19, recruited from internal medicine, gynecology, rheumatology, rehabilitation, acute geriatrics, and geriatric rehabilitation wards of three hospitals. We assessed distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and four indicators of mental health: depressive and anxiety symptom severity, psychological distress associated with somatic symptoms, and the mental component of health-related quality of life; additionally, we assessed social support. The data collection period was divided into modest (June 9 to October 18, 2020) and strong (October 19, 2020, to April 17, 2021) COVID-19 restrictions, based on the Oxford Stringency Index for Switzerland. An additional 13% (95%-Confidence Interval 4-21%) and 9% (1-16%) of hospital inpatients reported distress related to leisure time and loneliness, respectively, during strong COVID-19 restrictions compared to times of modest restrictions. There was no evidence for changes in mental health or social support. Focusing on the vulnerable population of general hospital inpatients not admitted for COVID-19, our results suggest that tightening of COVID-19 restrictions in October 2020 was associated with increased COVID-19-related distress regarding leisure time and loneliness, with no evidence for a related decrease in mental health. If this association was causal, safe measures to increase social interaction (e.g., virtual encounters and outdoor activities) are highly warranted. www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04269005.","Aebi, Fink, Wyss, Schwenkglenks, Baenteli, Caviezel, Studer, Trost, Tschudin, Schaefert, Meinlschmidt","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.872116","20220520","anxiety; depression; health-related quality of life; pandemic; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31721,""
"Early Adolescents' Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Changes in Their Well-Being","Early adolescence is a time of psychological and social change that can coincide with declines in mental health and well-being. This study investigated the psychological and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of students who responded to a survey in Grades 7 and 8 (ages 12-14) in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The objectives of this study were (i) to provide an overview on early adolescents' experiences and social-emotional well-being during the pandemic; and (ii) to examine whether changes in social experiences as well as feeling safe from getting COVID-19 at school were associated with changes in well-being outcomes over the course of a year. A sample of <i>n</i> = 1,755 students from a large public school district self-reported on their life satisfaction, optimism, and symptoms of sadness across two time points: First, in their Grade 7 year (pre-pandemic; January to March, 2020) and then 1 year later in their Grade 8 year (during the pandemic; January to March, 2021). In Grade 8, students also reported on pandemic-specific experiences, including changes in mental health, social relationships, and activities, as well as coping strategies and positive changes since the pandemic. Data were collected online using the Middle Years Development Instrument (MDI), a population-based self-report tool that assesses children's social-emotional development and well-being in the context of their home, school, and neighborhood. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between pandemic-related changes in relationships and perceived safety from getting COVID-19 at school with changes in well-being outcomes. Students reported a range of experiences, with a large proportion reporting moderate concerns and impacts of the pandemic, including worries about their mental health and missing school activities. Students reported significantly lower optimism, lower life satisfaction, and higher sadness compared to the previous year. Within the sample, improvements in relationships with parents and other adults at home was associated with higher well-being during the pandemic. Results from this study can inform decision making of policy-makers, educators, and practitioners working with youth, by providing information on students' experiences during the pandemic and identifying factors that may be protective for students' mental health during and beyond the pandemic.","Gadermann, Thomson, Gill, Schonert-Reichl, GagnÃƒÂ© Petteni, Guhn, Warren, Oberle","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.823303","20220520","COVID-19; adolescent; mental health; survey; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31722,""
"Experience and Perceptions of Chinese University Students Regarding the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted a significant influence on university student's learning, life and mental health. Using the method of inductive content analysis, this study examined the experience and perceptions of Chinese university students regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Eighteen university students including seven males and eleven females were involved in this study. In this study, we identified five themes concerning experience and perceptions of Chinese university students regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, that is, emotional reactions toward the COVID-19 pandemic, the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the participant's learning, the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the participant's daily life, participants' positive responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and China's moves toward the COVID-19 pandemic. This study elaborated on experience and perceptions of Chinese university students regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, which would provide us a better understanding of how university students perceive the COVID-19 pandemic and to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced their learning and daily lives.","Wu, Yin, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.872847","20220520","COVID-19; China; content analysis; experiences; perceptions; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31723,""
"COVID-19: A Source of Stress and Depression Among University Students and Poor Academic Performance","Current research examines how COVID-19 has impacted the daily life of students, specifically personal and academic aspects. The authors investigated the role of academic and family stress caused by COVID-19 on students' depression levels and the subsequent impact on their academic performance based on Lazarus' cognitive appraisal theory of stress. The non-probability convenience sampling technique has been used to collect data from undergraduate and postgraduate students using a modified questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale. This study used structural equation modeling to examine the link between stress, depression, and academic performance during COVID-19. It was confirmed that educational and family stress significantly leads to depression among students, negatively affecting their academic performance and learning outcomes. This research provides valuable information to parents, educators, and other stakeholders concerned about their children's education and performance.","Jiang, Jia, Tao, DÃƒÂ¶rdÃƒÂ¼ncÃƒÂ¼","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.898556","20220520","COVID-19; academic performance; academic stress; family stress; student learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31724,""
"Changes in Maternal Substance Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Maternal stress and mental health challenges have increased since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began. Experts are concerned about elevated substance use given its well-known association with negative emotions, but existing research has not examined substance use among mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a crucial next step to inform policy and service supports given links between maternal substance use and adverse family experiences. Data were collected online between April 14 and 28, 2020. A total of 508 mothers (mean age = 34.8 years, <i>SD</i> = 5.1) with children 0-8 years old participated via the Parenting During the Pandemic study. Mothers self-reported substance use change and motivations for using substances, as well as mental health symptoms. Of participating mothers, 54.9% did not change, 39.2% increased, and 5.9% decreased their substance use. Findings indicated that mothers with an anxiety disorder or elevated anxiety symptoms were more likely to report increased substance use during the pandemic. Using substances to cope with anxiety, depression, and boredom was elevated among mothers self-reporting increased substance use during the pandemic versus those reporting no change or a decrease in usage. Using substances to cope with anxiety was a risk factor for increased substance use. Many mothers have increased their substance use since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlight the need to treat maternal anxiety and the importance of teaching mothers coping strategies, other than using substances, to reduce the incidence of increased substance use among mothers and its negative sequelae.","Joyce, Cameron, Sulymka, Protudjer, Roos","https://www.google.com/search?q=Changes+in+Maternal+Substance+Use+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic.","20220519","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31725,""
"How long-term metal and lead exposure among foundry workers affect COVID-19 infection outcomes in Jordan","Foundry workers face a number of occupational health hazards, which may lead to an increased risk of respiratory disease, cancer, and anxiety level and are associated with endocrine, hematologic, renal, and neurological problems in humans. This study aims to evaluated thyroid functions, glutathione level, and the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 after vaccinated (two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine) foundry workers in Jordan. We examined the efficacy BNT162b2 vaccine by calculating the rate of mortality and the degree of severity from mild to severe respiratory infections in 105 adult males foundry workers occupationally exposed to metals and Pb who had been received two doses, 21Ã‚Â days apart, of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Seventy-five male subjects not exposed to the Pb and who received two shots of the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) served as the control group. In foundry workers who were infected with COVID-19, the mortality rate (0%) was similar as in the control group (0%), and increased transmission of infection with SARS-CoV-2; the non-hospitalized infections increased nearly 3.4-times and hospitalized infections increased 4.29-times among people exposed to lead and metal contamination compared to the healthy persons control group. Also, among the foundry workers, the blood lead, FT3, and FT4 levels were significantly higher (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) and the levels of glutathione and TSH were significantly decreased (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) compared with the control group. In conclusion, long-term exposure to Pb is associated with a risk of infection with COVID-19 despite the 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech). Also, exposure to Pb is associated with hyperthyroidism and a reduction in glutathione.","Saadh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20845-3","20220519","COVID-19; Foundry workers; Lead exposure; Oxidative stress; Pollution; Thyroid hormones","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-21","",31726,""
