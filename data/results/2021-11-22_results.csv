"Risk factors for workplace bullying, severe psychological distress, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide internet survey for the general working population in Japan","Abstract Objectives: The pandemic of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created a challenging environment for workers. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for workplace bullying and mental health outcomes during the pandemic among workers. Methods: We conducted a nationwide online cross-sectional survey from August to September 2020 in Japan (N = 16,384). Workplace bullying was measured by one item from the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire; severe psychological distress (SPD) by K6 ([&ge;]13); and suicidal ideation by one item. Prevalence ratios were calculated by Poisson regression analyses adjusting for potential confounders such as gender, age, occupational characteristics, and a prior history of depression. Results: Overall, 15% of workers experienced workplace bullying, 9% had SPD, and 12% had suicidal ideation during the second and third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The results of this study showed men, executives, managers, and permanent employees had a higher risk of bullying compared to women or part-time workers. Increased physical and psychological demands were common risk factors for bullying, SPD, and suicidal ideation. Newly starting working from home was a significant predictor for adverse mental health outcomes, however, it was found to be a preventive factor against workplace bullying. Conclusions: The results of this study found different high-risk groups for bullying or mental health during the pandemic. When intervening to decrease workplace bullying or mental health problems, we should focus on not only previously reported vulnerable workers but also workers who experienced a change of their working styles or job demands.","Kanami Tsuno; Takahiro Tabuchi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.18.21266501","20211121","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22403,""
"Patient experience with healthcare: Feedback for a Post COVID-19 clinic at a tertiary care center in rural area","Purpose: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection(PASC) is a complex condition with multi-system involvement. We assessed patients perspectives and experience with a PASC clinic established at University of Iowa in June 2020. Methods: We conducted a mixed-method survey in June 2021 to ask PASC clinic patients about 1) PASC symptoms and their impact on physical and mental health, and cognition using the PROMIS Global Health and Cognitive Function abilities items, and 2) satisfaction with clinic services and referrals, barriers to care, and recommended support resources. Findings: Ninety-seven patients (97/277, 35% response rate) completed the survey. Most were women(67%, n=65/97), Caucasian(93%, n=90/97) and received outpatient care during acute COVID-19 illness (79%). Fifty percent reported wait time of 1-3 months and 40% traveled >1 hour for the appointment at PASC clinic. The most common symptoms >3 months from initial infection were fatigue (77%), brain fog (73%), exercise intolerance (73%), anxiety (63%), sleep difficulties (56%) and depression (44%). A minority of patients reported significantly reduced functioning ([&ge;]1.5 SD below mean) of their physical health (22.5%), mental health (15.9%) and cognitive abilities (17.6%). Qualitative analysis of open-ended answers added valuable context to quantitative results. Satisfaction with clinical services was high though participants identified barriers to care including scheduling delays and financial concerns. Respondents suggested potential strategies for optimizing recovery including continuity of care, a co-located multispecialty clinic and being provided with timely information from emerging research. Conclusion: Our study reports high PASC symptom burden, its impact on health and patient experience with healthcare. It is important that primary healthcare professionals listen to patients with empathy and support them during recovery. Healthcare systems and policymakers should focus on accessible, comprehensive, and patient-centered integrated care.","Alpana Garg MD; Maran Subramain PhD; Patrick B Barlow PhD; Lauren Garvin PhD; Karin F Hoth PhD; Kimberly Dukes PhD; Richard M Hoffman MD,MPH; Alejandro P Comellas MD","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.20.21266640","20211121","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22404,""
"Intimate partner violence and pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in psychological sequelae in different populations, especially female victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) who are pregnant. Nonetheless, little is known about how IPV events and pregnancy are related to mental health outcomes for pregnant women during the pandemic, when this research took place. 155 pregnant women (82 primigravidas and 73 multigravidas women) were assessed using questionnaires for mental health status and IPV events. The results showed that primigravida women were less likely to experience intimate partner violence than multigravida women. Further, first time pregnancy was not related to symptoms of psychopathology nor perceived stress, even after controlling for the potential effect of IPV. In contrast, IPV was related to all measures of psychopathology, except for pregnancy-specific stress. The results provide information about the relationship of IPV, pregnancy and psychopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the study design (part of awider study), it is not yet possible to examine how IPV patterns with respect to pregnancy may have changed in response to the pandemic. In light of the relationship between IPV and mental health during the pandemic, assessment of IPV appears to be an important component in health assessments of pregnant women.

"COVID-19 bereavement, depressive symptoms, and binge drinking","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the death of over half a million Americans, leaving in its wake widespread grief and despair. Using national survey data (nÂ =Â 1998) and a treatment-weighting strategy, this study examines how COVID-19 bereavement associates with depressive symptoms and binge drinking. After adjustment for non-random exposure to COVID-19 bereavement, I find that respondents who have lost someone close to them to the virus report greater depressive symptomology and more frequent binge drinking. Among essential workers, the loss of a close tie to COVID-19 exacerbates these associations, with bereavement posing stronger effects for depressive symptoms and binge drinking for members of this group. The implications of these findings for the long-term mental health of the bereaved and those most vulnerable to the virus are discussed.","Grace, Matthew K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2021.100041","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100041, 2021.; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100041, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22406,""
"Increase in urgent care for patients with an eating disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Spanish province","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on peopleâ€™s mental health. Patients with eating disorders (ED) are also highly sensitive to the pandemic situation due to their physical and mental health. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact that the COVID 19 pandemic may have had on the reasons for the urgent care of patients with an eating disorder, comparing the reasons for care with those from a previous period. Method: We compared the visits to the emergency room and their characteristics before and after the pandemic of patients with an eating disorder in the province of Lleida. Information regarding sociodemographic status, reason for consultation, diagnosis, characteristics of suicidal behaviour, and other data were obtained from the electronic medical records. Results: Within the total emergency attendances, eating disorders increased from 1.7% in the pre-pandemic period to 3.1% during the pandemic (p = 0.030). Regarding the reason for consultation, a change in the pattern is observed, decreasing consultations for anxious decompensation (p &lt;0.001) and increasing suicidal behaviour (p = 0.016) and behavioural disorder (p = 0.022). Conclusions: In our study we ascertained an increase in urgent care given to patients with an eating disorder during the two states of alarm, while consultations for anxiety symptoms decreased notably. However, care for suicidal behaviour increased, especially in women with comorbidity of personality disorders and who were unemployed.","Irigoyen-OtiÃ±ano, MarÃ­a, GonzÃ¡lez-Pinto, Ana, Llorca-BofÃ­, Vicent, Adrados-PÃ©rez, Marina, Arenas-Pijoan, Laura, Torterolo, Giovanni, SÃ¡nchez-Cazalilla, Marta, Buil, Esther, Nicolau-Subires, EugÃ¨nia, Albert-Porcar, Carla, Ibarra-Pertusa, LucÃ­a, Puigdevall-Ruestes, Margarita","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2021.11.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Revista de PsiquiatrÃ­a y Salud Mental;2021.; Publication details: Revista de PsiquiatrÃ­a y Salud Mental;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22407,""
"Mental Health Symptoms among American Veterans during the COVID-19 Pandemic","We examined the symptom trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety among 1,230 American veterans assessed online one month prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States (February 2020) through the next year (August 2020, November 2020, February 2021). Veterans slightly increased mental health symptoms over time and those with pre-pandemic alcohol and cannabis use disorders reported greater symptoms compared to those without. Women and racial/ethnic minority veterans reported greater symptoms pre-pandemic but less steep increases over time compared to men and white veterans.

"Determining the relationship between loneliness and internet addiction among adolescents during the covid-19 pandemic in Turkey","Purpose This study was conducted to determine the relationship between the levels of loneliness adolescents feel during the pandemic, and their respective levels of internet addiction. Design and methods The sample of the study consists of 482 adolescents who volunteered to participate in the study. All participants had the cognitive competence to express themselves, and had access to the Internet. Participants filled out a Google Docs form including the â€œDescriptive Information Formâ€, â€œULS-SFâ€ and â€œIASAâ€, which were used to collect data. Results As a result of the multiple regression analysis, it was found that family income, mothers' education status, fathers' education status, the duration of Internet use before and during the pandemic, and the total score of ULS-SF had statistically significant effects on the total score of IASA (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). Conclusions It was concluded that adolescents' internet addiction increases with the increasing level of loneliness. Adolescents who reported feeling moderately lonely had a low level of Internet addiction. There were certain variables that were also found to be influential on adolescents' average levels of loneliness and Internet addiction during the Covid-19 pandemic. Practice implications Protecting adolescents' mental health during the pandemic is dependent on taking measures to reduce the risks, while strengthening the protective factors. These protective factors include providing adolescents the access to the appropriate information resources and encouraging the rational use of the Internet, which will support the individual and the individual's social development.","Sarialioglu, Arzu, Atay, Tutku, Arikan, Duygu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.11.011","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric Nursing;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric Nursing;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22409,""

Encourageant le maintien des liens sociaux chez les jeunes, lâ€™OMS soutient lâ€™initiative #PlayApartTogether (jouer ensemble Ã  distance), malgrÃ© lâ€™ajout rÃ©cent de lâ€™addiction aux jeux vidÃ©o (JV) Ã  la CIM-11.

Summary Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by restrictive measures, and avoiding close social contact is one of those basic preventive principles. As a result, screen time among adolescents has increased, especially through video games (VG). Wishing to encourage the maintenance of social connection among young people, the WHO is supporting the #PlayApartTogether initiative, despite the addition of the VG addiction to ICD-11. A misunderstanding can arise from the paradoxical nature of these two messages. Method We conducted a review of the international literature in order to argue the benefits and risks of practicing VG during this health crisis. Results It turns out that it is difficult to reach a consensus. During the pandemic, practicing VG seems to be able to promote the psychological well-being of the adolescent. The so-called prosocial VGs are a way of maintaining the link with the other. Some VGs, for their part, are mobilized physically. Suffering from anxiety or depression beforehand can lead to a real addiction. The non-specific literature of the COVID-19 period reports the improvement in cognitions associated with a regular practice of VG. The practice of prosocial VGs could be beneficial on behavior. Virtual violence and real-life violence are not clearly associated. An increased risk of death by suicide among players has not been established. The risk of developing addiction and gaming disorder was associated with pre-existing anxiety or depression especially among adolescents with a high level of awareness of the consequences of the pandemic. Conclusion The literature argues for the benefit of practicing VGs today, and those known as prosocial must be privileged. However, we must remain attentive to the risk of addiction, in particular in young people with pre-existing or new onset depression and who are fully aware of the impact of the virus, which is eminently anxiety-provoking.","Lesimple, P.; Verley, J.

"Strengthening mental health responses to COVID-19 in the Americas: A health policy analysis and recommendations","The COVID-19 pandemic is having a major impact on the mental health of populations in the Americas. Studies show high rates of depression and anxiety, among other psychological symptoms, particularly among women, young people, those with pre-existing mental health conditions, health workers, and persons living in vulnerable conditions. Mental health systems and services have also been severely disrupted. A lack of financial and human resource investments in mental health services, limited implementation of the decentralized community-based care approach and policies to address the mental health gap prior to the pandemic, have all contributed to the current crisis. Countries must urgently strengthen their mental health responses to COVID-19 by taking actions to scale up mental health and psychosocial support services for all, reach marginalized and at-risk populations, and build back better mental health systems and services for the future.

"Systematic review of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal behaviour among health and social care workers across the world","Background : The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the mental health of healthcare and social care workers, and its potential effect on suicidal thoughts and behaviour is of particular concern. Methods : This systematic review identified and appraised the published literature that has reported on the impact of COVID-19 on suicidal thoughts and behaviour and self-harm among healthcare and social care workers worldwide up to May 31, 2021. Results : Out of 37 potentially relevant papers identified, ten met our eligibility criteria. Our review has highlighted that the impact of COVID-19 has varied as a function of setting, working relationships, occupational roles, and psychiatric comorbidities. Limitations : There have been no completed cohort studies comparing pre- and post-pandemic suicidal thoughts and behaviours. It is possible some papers may have been missed in the search. Conclusions : The current quality of evidence pertaining to suicidal behaviour in healthcare workers is poor, and evidence is entirely absent for those working in social care. The clinical relevance of this work is to bring attention to what evidence exists, and to encourage, in practice, proactive approaches to interventions for improving healthcare and social care worker mental health.","Eyles, Emily, Moran, Paul, Okolie, Chukwudi, Dekel, Dana, Macleod-Hall, Catherine, Webb, Roger T.; Schmidt, Lena, Knipe, Duleeka, Sinyor, Mark, McGuinness, Luke A.; Arensman, Ella, Hawton, Keith, C O'Connor, Rory, Kapur, Nav, O'Neill, Siobhan, Olorisade, Babatunde, Cheng, Hung-Yuan, Higgins, Julian P.

"Prescription Fill Patterns for Benzodiazepine and Opioid Drugs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","Background COVID-19 and resulting mitigation measures in the United States (US) brought about limited access to medical care that has been linked to increases in mental health problems, excessive substance use, and drug overdoses. The increase in co-prescription of benzodiazepines and opioids may indicate population-level changes in health behaviors that can be exacerbated by limited access, hence necessitating the tracking of these drugs during COVID-19. We evaluated the impact of the declaration of COVID-19 as a US national emergency on prescription patterns in 2020. Methods Prescriptions of benzodiazepines and opioids were analyzed using data aggregated on a weekly basis across 38 states over the January 2019-December 2020 period. Data were from Appriss Health Prescription Drug Monitoring Program and covered all individuals regardless of insurance status. Generalized additive models estimated the effects of the March 13, 2020 declaration on proportion of prescriptions to all controlled substances by comparing volumes before to after the week of March 13 in 2020 (range: January 27-May 24) and comparing this trend to its 2019 counterpart. Results When comparing the January 27-March 9 period to the March 16-May 24 period in 2020, there was a statistically significant 2.0% increase in the proportion of benzodiazepine dispensations to all controlled substances, and a significant 1.7% mean decrease in proportion of opioid dispensations to all controlled substances. A significant return approaching pre-declaration levels was observed only for opioids (beginning week of May 18, 2020). Conclusions The results suggest significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on dispensations of benzodiazepines and opioids across the US. Continued monitoring of prescription trends and maintenance of adequate and accessible access to mental healthcare are important for understanding public health crises related to substance use.","de Dios, Constanza, Fernandes, Brisa S.; Whalen, Kristine, Bandewar, Shruti, Suchting, Robert, Weaver, Michael, Selvaraj, Sudhakar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109176","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109176, 2021.; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109176, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22413,""

"Modeling Covid-19 Cases in West African Countries: A Comparative Analysis of Quartic Curve Estimation Models and Estimators","COVID-19 has remained and continued to be a severe pandemic threatening the present and future health stability of all the countries, the West African Countries inclusive. The challenge to avert the threat by modeling the reported cases in each of these West African Countries becomes needful for future planning and a concern in this book chapter. Consequently, COVID-19 data on daily confirmed and death cases in each of the sixteen (16) countries in West Africa were collected from European Centre for disease prevention and control (www.ecdc.europa.eu ) beginning from the first day of its occurrence until 25th September 2020. As at this time, West African counties had recorded 181,376 confirmed cases and 2748 death cases. It is intended to determine and use an appropriate curve estimation statistical model to forecast for the remaining days of the year 2020;and establish the direction of movement of the future forecast values for effective planning. The Quartic Curve Estimation Model with autocorrelated error terms of order 1 (AR (1)) was found useful with some estimators. The best estimator of the model parameters was identified to be either the Cochrane Orcutt orÂ the Hildreth-LU or the Prais-WinstenÂ estimator. There is an upward movement of forecast values of COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases towards the end of the year 2020 in Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Code d'Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. So, the government in these countries needs not to relax in their fight against the spread of COVI-19. Similarly, there is an upward movement of forecast values of COVID-19 cumulative death cases in Benin, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria and Togo. So, these countries would need to critically look after their COVID-19 confirmed patients so as not to lose them to death. COVID-19 cases in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea and Niger are expected to flatten out towards the year while they have to be approached with all seriousness in Cape Verde, Mali, Mauritania and Nigeria.

"Mortality Risk Among Patients With COVID-19 Prescribed Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressants","Importance: Antidepressant use may be associated with reduced levels of several proinflammatory cytokines suggested to be involved with the development of severe COVID-19. An association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)-specifically fluoxetine hydrochloride and fluvoxamine maleate-with decreased mortality among patients with COVID-19 has been reported in recent studies;however, these studies had limited power due to their small size. Objective: To investigate the association of SSRIs with outcomes in patients with COVID-19 by analyzing electronic health records (EHRs). Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used propensity score matching by demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and medication indication to compare SSRI-treated patients with matched control patients not treated with SSRIs within a large EHR database representing a diverse population of 83584 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January to September 2020 and with a duration of follow-up of as long as 8 months in 87 health care centers across the US. Exposures: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and specifically (1) fluoxetine, (2) fluoxetine or fluvoxamine, and (3) other SSRIs (ie, not fluoxetine or fluvoxamine). Main Outcomes and Measures: Death. Results: A total of 3401 adult patients with COVID-19 prescribed SSRIs (2033 women [59.8%];mean [SD] age, 63.8 [18.1] years) were identified, with 470 receiving fluoxetine only (280 women [59.6%];mean [SD] age, 58.5 [18.1] years), 481 receiving fluoxetine or fluvoxamine (285 women [59.3%];mean [SD] age, 58.7 [18.0] years), and 2898 receiving other SSRIs (1733 women [59.8%];mean [SD] age, 64.7 [18.0] years) within a defined time frame. When compared with matched untreated control patients, relative risk (RR) of mortality was reduced among patients prescribed any SSRI (497 of 3401 [14.6%] vs 1130 of 6802 [16.6%];RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.99];adjusted P = .03);fluoxetine (46 of 470 [9.8%] vs 937 of 7050 [13.3%];RR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54-0.97];adjusted P = .03);and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine (48 of 481 [10.0%] vs 956 of 7215 [13.3%];RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.55-0.99];adjusted P = .04). The association between receiving any SSRI that is not fluoxetine or fluvoxamine and risk of death was not statistically significant (447 of 2898 [15.4%] vs 1474 of 8694 [17.0%];RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84-1.00];adjusted P = .06). Conclusions and Relevance: These results support evidence that SSRIs may be associated with reduced severity of COVID-19 reflected in the reduced RR of mortality. Further research and randomized clinical trials are needed to elucidate the effect of SSRIs generally, or more specifically of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, on the severity of COVID-19 outcomes.","Oskotsky, T.; Maric, I.; Tang, A.; Oskotsky, B.; Wong, R.

We attempted to highlight the effectiveness of problem-solving therapy regarding both stress and depression management, as an overall attempt to combat all isolation-related psychological implications. We reviewed PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and the Web of Science databases to retrieve related studies between 2010 and 2019;their reference lists were examined as well. Ten studies indicated problem-solving therapy's effectiveness regarding stress, depression, and chronic disease management.

"Psychological Effect of Coronavirus Disease-19 on Healthcare Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study in Kayseri","Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Many studies have examined their psychological effects. However, during these periods when the new case of COVID-19 patients decreased, their psychological effects were not sufficiently reported. Our aim was to investigate the anxiety and depressive symptom levels of healthcare workers (HCW) during the periods when the increase in the number of cases slowed down in the COVID-19 epidemic. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional a questionnaire consisted of Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory was applied to 143 people working in a university hospital. General information such as age, gender, marital status, study history in the COVID-19 pandemic, history of chronic disease, and whether there are other HCW at home was collected and compared. Results: The median value of beck anxiety score was 6. The median value of Beck depression score varies by gender (p=0.015). Median value of Beck depression score varies according to marital status (p=0.011). The median value of Beck anxiety score varies according to gender (p=0.008). The median value of Beck anxiety score varies according to occupational groups (p=0.003). A significant link was obtained between Beck depression groups and marital status (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: COVID-19 shows that it emphasizes ways to reduce mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service. Case definitions were developed, and their performance characteristics assessed. Pre-pandemic trends in monthly suicide and drug toxicity deaths were modelled and the observed numbers of deaths in the pandemic year compared to expected numbers. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in suicide deaths in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nova Scotia, with about 21 fewer non-drug toxicity suicide deaths than expected in March 2020 to February 2021 (risk ratio = 0.82). No change in drug toxicity mortality was detected. Case definitions were successfully applied to free-text cause of death statements and cases where cause and manner of death remained under investigation. CONCLUSION: Processes for case classification and monitoring can be implemented in collaboration with medical examiners/coroners for timely, ongoing public health surveillance of suicide and drug toxicity mortality.

"COVID-19's Social Ecological Impacts on Health and Human Services Worker Well-being","Health and human services workers (HHS; e.g., child welfare, physical and mental healthcare) engage with clients facing heightened vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under typical circumstances, HHS workers face a host of challenges in carrying out their job responsibilities such as high caseloads and burnout, and now navigate new challenges such as social distancing protocols and protecting their own health and that of their families and clients. This study explored the experiences of 531 HHS workers in Florida to understand well-being impacts of COVID-19 on the HHS workforce. Using a social ecological framework, we analyzed open-ended responses from HHS workers to better understand the multi-level and frequently intertwined impacts of COVID-19. Participants reported numerous proximal factors (i.e., intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational) impacting their well-being but fewer distal factors (i.e., community, public policy). Agencies should work to understand the intersecting vulnerabilities of their workers and implement safety protocols to preserve workers' well-being.","Magruder, L; Wilke, D; Radey, M; Cain, M; Yelick, A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2021.1997864","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Soc Work Public Health;: 1-11, 2021 Nov 12.; Publication details: Soc Work Public Health;: 1-11, 2021 Nov 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22431,""
"Quality of life, mood and cognitive performance in older adults with cognitive impairment during the first wave of COVID 19 in Argentina","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In Argentina, government has established lockdown on 19 March 2020 to decrease SARS-COV-2 infection. Study aim was to understand how mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 pandemic has affected quality of life, mood, and cognitive performance of older adults with cognitive impairment. DESIGN: Longitudinal descriptive-observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with cognitive impairment attending to online cognitive training sessions. MEASURE: ments: Participants have completed by themselves Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease scale (QOL-AD), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Test your Memory (TYM) and an attention and executive task created by our institution. Same assessments were done at the beginning of the lock down and 7 months later. RESULTS: 51 adults were included. An increase in BDI-II score (p = 0.049) and worse performance in one of the executive attention tests (p = 0.012) have been found. No significant differences in QOL-AD, TYM, verbal fluency or memory tests total scores have been observed. Reviewing scales subitems, differences in changes in sleep habits (p = 0.021), energy level decrease (p = 0.004), worse subjective record of memory capacity (p = 0.028) and decrease in ability to do housework (p = 0.007) have been shown. In those who lived alone, BDI and TYM higher scores in BDI -II (p = 0.030) (p = 0.022) have been found. CONCLUSION: Mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 pandemic was associated with worsening of mood, some quality of life variables and decrease in attention in older adults with cognitive impairment in Argentina.

"The longitudinal psychological, physical activity, and financial impact of a COVID-19 lockdown on older adults in Singapore: The PIONEER-COVID population-based study","BACKGROUND: Several countries have implemented 'lockdown' measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AIMS: To examine the psychological, physical activity (PA), and financial impact of a 2-month COVID-19 lockdown on older adults aged &#8805;60Â years in Singapore, and to identify factors associated with adverse lockdown-related outcomes. METHOD: We interviewed 496 community-dwelling adults (mean age [standard deviation]: 73.8 [7.6] years; 54.8% female) during the lockdown who had previously participated in a population-based epidemiological study. Validated questionnaires were utilised to assess loneliness and depressive symptoms at both timepoints, while inhouse questionnaires were used to assess PA and financial difficulty during lockdown. Multivariable regression models determined the lockdown-related change in loneliness and depression scores, and the factors associated with adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Loneliness increased significantly during the lockdown period (pÂ <Â 0.001) while depressive symptoms decreased (pÂ =Â 0.022). Decreased PA, greater financial problems, male gender, Indian ethnicity, living alone, having a greater body mass index and perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 were all associated with worsening loneliness scores. A total of 36.9% and 19.6% participants reported decreased PA and had financial problems during the lockdown, respectively. Unemployment was associated with decreased PA, while self-employed individuals, cleaners, retail workers and smokers had greater odds of experiencing financial difficulty. CONCLUSION: Despite a decrease in depressive symptoms, our population of older Asians reported a significant increase in loneliness and decreased PA, with one-fifth experiencing financial problems during lockdown. Our data suggest that more targeted public health efforts are needed to reduce repercussions of future lockdowns.","Lee, Ester Pei Xuan; Man, Ryan Eyn Kidd; Gan, Tau Liang Alfred; Fenwick, Eva K; Aravindhan, Amudha; Ho, Kam Chun; Sung, Sharon Cohan; Wong, Tien Yin; Ho, Cyrus Su Hui; Gupta, Preeti; Lamoureux, Ecosse L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gps.5645","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Geriatr Psychiatry;2021 Nov 02.; Publication details: Int J Geriatr Psychiatry;2021 Nov 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22433,""
"Mental Health Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic Long-Term Exposure in Italian Dermatologists","The present study aimed at assessing the consequences of prolonged exposure to COVID-19 distress on mental health in non-frontline health care workers. For this purpose, we have conducted a survey on 425 Italian dermatologists, in the period February-March 2021. The psychopathological symptoms, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD), as well as resilience, have been evaluated. The main factors that influence the physician's psychological health have been also investigated. Our study showed that the physicians older than 40 years, as well as those who lived this period in company, reported more personal resources, better managing the distress. Resilience, COVID-19 beliefs, COVID-19 working difficulties, and age were the common predictors of the severe psychopathological symptoms. An interesting result is that the lower level of resilience was the most powerful predictor of a more severe depression, as well as of a higher severity of generalized anxiety disorder, but not of COVID-19 PTSD. The fear of COVID-19 was the most powerful predictor of COVID-19 PTSD. Home conditions and previous SARS-CoV2 infection constituted significant predictors of severe depressive symptoms, but not of anxiety and COVID-19 PTSD. These results are useful in a better understanding of protective and risk factors involved in COVID-19 long-term distress exposure.","Ciuluvica Neagu, Cristina; Gualdi, Giulio; Dal Canton, Marco; Fantini, Fabrizio; Paradisi, Andrea; Sbano, Paolo; Simonacci, Marco; Dusi, Daniele; Vezzoni, Gian Marco; D'Acunto, Carmine; Lombardo, Maurizio; Zanchi, Malvina; Alfredo, Zucchi; Eisendle, Klaus; Prignano, Francesca; Amerio, Paolo","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111239","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(21)2021 Oct 26.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(21)2021 Oct 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22434,""
"The interplay between acute post-traumatic stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms among healthcare workers functioningÂ duringÂ the COVID-19 emergency: a multicenter study comparing regions with increasing pandemic incidence","BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) deployed to the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic are at risk for developing mental disorders, with a possible impact on their wellbeing and functioning. The present study aimed at investigating post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), anxiety and depressive symptoms and their relationships with impairment in the functioning impairment among frontline HCWs from three Italian regions differently exposed to the first wave of the COVID-19 emergency: Tuscany (low), Emilia-Romagna (medium) and Lombardy (high). METHODS: 514 frontline HCWs were consecutively enrolled in hospital units devoted to the treatment of COVID-19 patients. They completed the IES-R, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 to assess PTSS, depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively, and the WSAS to investigate functioning impairment. RESULTS: A total of 23.5% of HCWs reported severe PTSS, 22.4% moderate-severe anxiety symptoms, 19.3% moderate-severe depressive symptoms and 22.8% impairment in global functioning. HCWs from the higher-exposure regions reported significantly higher scores in all instruments than those from lower-exposure regions. In a multiple linear regression model, PTSS, depressive and anxiety symptoms presented a significant positive association with the functioning impairment. Both PTSS and depression resulted to be independently related to functioning impairment. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design and the use of self-report instruments. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive and PTSS appear to be the greatest contributors to functioning impairment in HCWs exposed to a massive stressful sanitary event as the COVID-19 pandemic. A more accurate assessment of work-related mental health outcomes in such population could help planning effective prevention strategies and therapeutic interventions.","Carmassi, Claudia; Dell'Oste, Valerio; Bui, Eric; Foghi, Claudia; Bertelloni, Carlo Antonio; Atti, Anna Rita; Buselli, Rodolfo; Di Paolo, Marco; Goracci, Arianna; Malacarne, Paolo; Nanni, Maria Giulia; Gesi, Camilla; Cerveri, Giancarlo; Dell'Osso, Liliana","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.128","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord;298(Pt A): 209-216, 2021 Oct 30.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;298(Pt A): 209-216, 2021 Oct 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22435,""

"Prospective survey of psychiatric patients during the first confinement of the COVID 2019 pandemic","In the early steps of an emerging infectious disease epidemic such as Covid-19, uncertainties about the nature of the disease, its spread and impact can lead to emotional distress. In addition, the studies on confinement during an epidemic have shown a psychological impact of this measure on the feelings of anxiety and depression in the general population. METHOD: We assessed the psychological health of 550 patients followed up in outpatient psychiatry, via a pandemic-related teleconsultation during the first confinement period between March and June 2020. Patients were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the confinement on their personal situation, social relationships, professional activity, anxiety and mood. We also evaluated patients' symptomatology and their quality of life. RESULTS: Patients were well informed about Covid-19 via the media and complied with the confinement and barrier procedures. They appreciated the phone-calls and the teleconsultation follow-up. A small proportion of patients were completely socially isolated mainly at the beginning of the confinement (10%). There was no difference between the beginning and the end of the confinement in terms of depressive and anxiety symptoms or quality of life. The women were more anxious and depressed than men. Only smoking was significantly increased during this period. CONCLUSION: The expected and feared health catastrophe in psychiatry during this first phase of the pandemic in 2020 did not occur. Will the psychiatric wave appear in the ""post- pandemic"", the future will tell.","Januel, Dominique; Fourati, Taoufik; Moulier, Virginie; Ledosseur, Yann; BollorÃ©, Ombline; Isaac, ClÃ©mence; Senouci, Habib; Benadhira, RenÃ©; Stamatiadis, Laurence; Saba, Ghassen; Mascarenhas, Eugenia; Beaucousin, Marie Christine; Ernouf, Thibault; Slama, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Motut, Alex; Rosetti, Raluca; Vassal, Laurent; Pecot, Fabrice; Chammas, Francesca; Baha, Djamel; Rejeb, Hammadi Ben; Bouaziz, Noomane","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102888","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Asian J Psychiatr;66: 102888, 2021 Oct 24.; Publication details: Asian J Psychiatr;66: 102888, 2021 Oct 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22437,""
"Transformational strategies for optimizing use of medications and related therapies through us pharmacists and pharmacies: Findings from a national study","SETTING: Nonoptimized medication therapies (NOMTs) are associated with likely avoidable illnesses and mortality affecting millions of people and costing an estimated $528 billion per year in excess health spending in the United States. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought into focus barriers limiting the ability of U.S. pharmacists and pharmacies to provide services that can reduce NOMTs and improve U.S. population health. OBJECTIVES: This National Science Foundation Center for Health Organization Transformation study explored potential strategies that U.S. pharmacists, pharmacies, and their partners could implement to reduce NOMTs while also delivering other forms of value to U.S. populations from 2021 to 2025 (during and after the COVID-19 pandemic). DESIGN: A panel of senior leaders representing the U.S. pharmacist and pharmacy sector participated in a 4-round Delphi process to identify unmet needs, barriers, change drivers, and priority strategies for meeting those needs. Data were gathered and analyzed by public health researchers, most of whom are outside the pharmacist and pharmacy sector. RESULTS: A comprehensive set of evidence-based strategies with potential to reduce NOMTs, protect and improve population health and well-being, and strengthen the sector were identified. Four transformational strategies were recommended: comprehensive payment and practice transformation, strengthening pharmacy data interoperability infrastructure, development of unifying measurement and management mechanisms, and development of a more robust national research infrastructure. Strengthening health equity was a cross-cutting strategy affecting all areas. CONCLUSION: The results may be of interest to policy makers, pharmacists, pharmacies, physicians, nurses and other clinicians, pharmaceutical firms, plan sponsors, plans, health systems, clinics, aging care, digital technology companies, and others interested in optimizing outcomes from medications and related therapies for U.S.","Thornewill, Judah; Antimisiaris, Demetra; Ezekekwu, Emmanuel; Esterhay, Robert","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2021.10.018","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Am Pharm Assoc (2003);2021 Oct 20.; Publication details: J Am Pharm Assoc (2003);2021 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","",22438,""
