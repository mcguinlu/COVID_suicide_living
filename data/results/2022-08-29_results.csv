"Effect of Pranayama on Perceived Stress, Well Being and Quality of Life of Frontline Healthcare Professionals on Covid-19 Duty: A Quasi- Randomized Clinical Trial","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unparalleled challenges for health systems worldwide, the impact of which has also been borne by the Healthcare Professionals (HCPs). Numerous studies have revealed the positive effects of Pranayama and Meditation on mental health. The effect of Pranayama in improving mental health of frontline HCP exposed to Covid-19 patients has not been studied. Aim & Objective: This quasi-randomized clinical trial was done to study the effect of especially designed Pranayama protocol on perceived stress, wellbeing and quality of life of frontline health care professionals who were exposed to COVID-19 patients in hospital settings. Methodology This study was done with 280 frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) assigned duties with COVID-19 patients during September-November, 2020 in 5 government hospitals and COVID-19 quarantine/isolation centres in New Delhi, India. The HCPs were first assessed for COVID-19 infection in the past using antibody test, and only those found negative were recruited. The enrolled respondents were randomly assigned to two arms an intervention arm where there were to practice 28 day Pranayama module (morning and evening sessions) under supervision of a trainer and a Control arm where the HCPs continued routine physical activity (walking jogging etc). Baseline and end-line (total: 250 HCPs) Psychological parameters of Perceived Stress, Well Being and Quality of Life were collected through self-reported questionnaires. Results The intervention (HCPs 123) and control (HCPs 127) groups (Total 250) were comparable in their demographic profile and baseline characteristics. Intervention with Pranayama module led to a significant reduction (Mean diff -2.46 P-value 0.028) in perceived stress score in the intervention group compared to the control group. The wellbeing index in Interventional group intervention showed a non-significant increase. The WHO Quality-of-life score increased in the intervention group as compared to the controls (mean difference 2.78, p-value: 0.17). Of its four components, the one for Psychological domain increased significantly (mean diff: 1.52, P-value: 0.019), while those for Physical domain and Environmental domains increased (mean diff: 0.64, P-value: 0.29 and mean diff: 0.68, p-value: 0.48) though not statistical significantly. Conclusion: The intervention of twice daily practice of the Pranayama module for 28 days in frontline HCPs performing COVID-19 duties had a noteworthy effect in lowering Perceived Stress, improving perceived Quality of life, especially its Psychological domains as measured through standardized questionnaires.","Rakesh Sarwal; Rajinder K Dhamija; KHUSHBU JAIN; Ishwara V.

"Religion, Islam, and Compliance with COVID-19 Best Practices","While many have implemented best practices intended to help stem the spread of COVID-19, there are also a substantial number of citizens, both domestically and abroad, who have resisted these practices. We argue that public health authorities, as well as scientific researchers and funders, should help address this resistance by putting greater effort into ascertaining how existing religious practices and beliefs align with COVID-19 guidelines. In particular, we contend that Euro-American scholars-who have often tended to implicitly favor secular and Christian worldviews-should put added focus on how Islamic commitments may (or may not) support COVID-19 best practices, including practices that extend beyond the domain of support for mental health.","Dajani, Coetsee, Al-Tabba, Al-Hussaini","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-022-01621-6","20220827","COVID-19; Ethics; Islam; Low and middle income countries; Public health; Religion; Scientists; Secularism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-29","",36740,""
