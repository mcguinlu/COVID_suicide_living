"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Mental Health Symptoms during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Southeast Asia","Aims: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the mental health of the general public and high-risk groups across the globe. Southeast Asia, one of the first regions to be affected by the outbreak, is of particular interest given its proximity and close links to China, experience with recent epidemics (i.e. SARS), and the variable course of the outbreak in the region thus far. The aim of this study was to systemically review and assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms in the general adult population, frontline and general healthcare workers (HCWs), and adult students in Southeast Asia during the course of the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Several literature databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and medRxiv) were systemically searched for articles published up to February 2021. Two reviewers independently evaluated all the relevant studies using pre-determined criteria and assessed the risk of bias for each included study. The prevalence rates of mental health symptoms were estimated using a random-effect meta-analysis model. Results: In total, 32 samples from 25 studies with 20,352 participants were included. Anxiety symptoms was assessed in all 25 studies and depressive symptoms in 15 studies with pooled prevalence rates of 22% and 16% respectively. Only two studies evaluated insomnia, whose prevalence was estimated to be 19%. The overall prevalence of mental health disorders was similar amongst frontline HCWs (18%), general HCWs (17%), and students (20%) whilst being noticeably higher in the general population (27%). Conclusions: The results indicate that a considerable proportion of participants report the presence of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms. However, the pooled prevalence rates in Southeast Asia are significantly lower than those reported in other meta-analyses from other areas such as China and Europe. This meta-analysis may provide valuable evidence for more targeted identification of mental health needs and guide future research of long-term outcomes.

"Prevalence of long-term effects in individuals diagnosed with COVID-19: a living systematic review","Background: Patients have described symptoms persisting or recurring for weeks after acute COVID-19 illness referred to as post COVID-19 conditions. The objective of this living systematic review is to document the prevalence of post COVID-19 conditions 4-12 weeks (short-term) and >12 weeks (long-term) after COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of primary peer-reviewed published literature reporting on the prevalence of the symptoms, sequelae and difficulties conducting usual activities [&ge;]4 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. We adapted a previous search strategy used by the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and updated it to search for new research published until January 15, 2021 in Embase, Medline, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Central. Two independent reviewers screened references; one reviewer extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty in the evidence while another verified them. Prevalence data from laboratory-confirmed individuals were meta-analyzed, where appropriate, using a random effects model and synthesized separately in the short- and long-term periods after COVID-19 diagnosis; data from clinically-diagnosed populations were synthesized narratively. Results: Of the 2807 unique citations, 36 observational studies met our inclusion criteria. Over 100 post COVID-19 conditions were reported in laboratory-confirmed individuals. Eighty-three percent (95%CI: 65-93%; low certainty) and 56% (95%CI: 34-75%; very low certainty) reported persistence or presence of one or more symptoms in the short- and long-term, respectively. The most prevalent symptoms in both periods included: fatigue, general pain or discomfort, sleep disturbances, shortness of breath and anxiety or depression (point estimates ranging from 22-51%; low to very low certainty). Interpretation: Our data indicate that a substantial proportion of individuals reported a variety of symptoms [&ge;]4 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. Due to low certainty in the evidence, further research is needed to determine the true burden of post COVID-19 conditions.","Francesca Reyes Domingo; Lisa A Waddell; Angela M Cheung; Curtis L Cooper; Veronica J Belcourt; Alexandra M.

"Emotions in the time of coronavirus: Antecedents of digital and social media use among Millennials","Increasingly, people are turning to digital and social media to address health threats. While research has commonly investigated the psychosocial antecedents of digital health information seeking behavior (digital HISB) and social media use (SMU), there has been limited research on the independent effects of emotions and no research on the interactive effects of emotions. In the context of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, this study investigates the affective, personal relevance, and socio-demographic antecedents of digital HISB and SMU, using data from an online survey of U.S. Millennials (N = 1037) in Aprilâ€“May 2020. Linear regression results show the effects of socio-demographic and personal relevance factors. For the independent effects of emotions, fear and sadness were associated with digital HISB; fear, joy, and disgust were associated with high-informational SMU; and joy and disgust were associated with low-informational SMU. Three interactive effects of discrete negative emotions suggest that an increase in one emotion can amplify the effect of another emotion on a measure of digital and social media use. In the fourth interaction of two negative emotions with strong biological regulatory processes, there is evidence that an increase in one emotion can diminish the effect of another emotion. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106876","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-07","",14383,""
"Research advances in the fabrication of biosafety and functional leather: A way-forward for effective management of COVID-19 outbreak","With the recent events following the pandemic COVID-19, global awareness about the use of biosafety materials has been in raise. Leather industry being a major commodity-driven sector, its role in addressing the issues concerning the safe use of leather products has become inevitable for the sustainability of the industry. A significant number of researches have been conducted to fabricate bio-safe leather by incorporating different types of antimicrobial agents during leather manufacturing. Besides, the increasing diversity in the development of synthetic materials and the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on automotive industry may create more demand from customers for incorporating different functionalities in leather without losing its inherent properties. Some of the key functionalities discussed include resistance to microbial growth, self-cleaning through superhydrophobicity and photocatalysis, thermal regulation, flame retardance and scented leather. This review focusses on the fabrication of such advanced functional leather materials over the past decade with special emphasis on antimicrobial leather. Some of the key factors elaborated in the review include the state of art approaches for the preparation of functional materials, mode of incorporation of the same into the leather matrix, the mechanism behind with a perspective on the challenges involved in fabrication for real-world applications. A major outcome of this review is that even though several kinds of cutting edge researches are happening in the field of leather manufacturing, most of them were not validated for its practical applicability and sustainability of the proposed solution. This could be majorly attributed to the cost involved in fabrication of such materials, which forms a crucial factor when it comes to a mass production industry such as leather. Also, the researchers should concentrate on the toxicity of the fabricated materials which can impede the process of adopting such emerging and need of the hour technologies in the near future. Knowledge obtained from this review on fabrication of bio-safety leather against bacteria, mold and fungi would help further to integrate the antiviral property into the same which is a global need. Also, fabrication of functionalized leather would open new avenues for leather manufactures to venture into the development of advanced leather products such as flexible electronics, radiation shielding and fire fighting garments etc.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.127464","20210810","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-07","",14384,""
"Exploring the association between mental health and subjective sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi university students","The outbreak of new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has triggered a global panic, affecting the mental well-being of people of all ages, including students. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between self-reported mental health concerns and subjective sleep quality of the Bangladeshi university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted to maintain the social distancing recommended by the World Health Organization. There were 1,317 student responses from 49 universities across Bangladesh. Data was analyzed by executing both bi-variate and multivariate analysis. Findings indicate that 27.1%, 51.0%, 45.9%, and 86.0% of students had poor subjective sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and fear of COVID-19, respectively. Anxiety (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06â€“1.12, p < 0.001) was a risk factor for increasing the poor subjective sleep quality of university students. In contrast, the odds of poor subjective sleep quality were lower with increasing the score of depression (AOR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.86â€“0.90, p < 0.001) and fear of COVID-19 (AOR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94â€“0.99, p < 0.05). Compared to public university students, private university students were more likely to report poor subjective sleep quality since the pandemic began. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that psychiatric conditions of university students should be monitored during the COVID-19 epidemic, and necessary strategies, such as allocation of resources, implementation of awareness programs, establishment of psychological counselling unit, should carefully be devised.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07082","20210501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-07","",14385,""
