"519 MINDFULNESS AS A MEDIATOR IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL LONELINESS AND DEPRESSION IN YOUNG ADULTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great influence on society, especially on the lives of emerging adults  Due to social distancing, many emerging adults have been restricted to their homes and have had limited contact with their friends and family, which may lead to increased feelings of social loneliness and sadness  Mindfulness, the psychological process of being aware of the present moment, has been found to alleviate mental health problems, such as depression  The current study explores the mediating role of mindfulness in the relationship between social loneliness and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods: Participants for this IRB-approved study were recruited by using online flyers (N = 302;Mage = 20 9 years;78 7% female, 8 6% Hispanic, 80 5% White)  The participants completed multiple online self-report measures including the DeJong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale  Results: An initial regression analysis found that social loneliness was a predictor of depression (b = 0 99;p &lt; 0 001)  Further analysis was conducted using Hayesâ€™s SPSS PROCESS macro (Model 4)  The overall model was significant (F2,299 = 57 96;p &lt; 0 001;R2 = 0 28), explaining 28% of the variance  The path between social loneliness and mindfulness (b = â€“0 10;p &lt; 0 004) was significant, with increased social loneliness being associated with decreased mindfulness  The path from mindfulness to depression symptoms (b = â€“2 57;p &lt; 0 001) was also significant, suggesting that higher levels of mindfulness were associated with fewer depressive symptoms among participants  The path from social loneliness to depression symptoms remained significant (b = 0 74;p &lt; 0 001) when mindfulness was added to the model, indicating partial mediation  Conclusions: These results suggest that, during the current pandemic, emerging adults experiencing social loneliness may be less likely to engage in mindfulness, leading to an increase in depressive symptoms  During times of social isolation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be beneficial for young people to engage in interventions that foster mindfulness to decrease depression symptoms precipitated by social loneliness  DDD","Michel, R.; DiFonte, M.; Ruiz, E.; James, C.; Flannery-Schroeder, E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.08.419","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry;59(10):S253, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry;59(10):S253, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6459,""

"Efficacy of an online cognitive behavioral therapy program developed for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: the REduction of STress (REST) study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: The acknowledgment of the mental health toll of the COVID-19 epidemic in healthcare workers has increased considerably as the disease evolved into a pandemic status. Indeed, high prevalence rates of depression, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in Chinese healthcare workers during the epidemic peak. Symptoms of psychological distress are expected to be long-lasting and have a systemic impact on healthcare systems, warranting the need for evidence-based psychological treatments aiming at relieving immediate stress and preventing the onset of psychological disorders in this population. In the current COVID-19 context, internet-based interventions have the potential to circumvent the pitfalls of face-to-face formats and provide the flexibility required to facilitate accessibility to healthcare workers. Online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular has proved to be effective in treating and preventing a number of stress-related disorders in populations other than healthcare workers. The aim of our randomized controlled trial study protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the 'My Health too' CBT program-a program we have developed for healthcare workers facing the pandemic-on immediate perceived stress and on the emergence of psychiatric disorders at 3- and 6-month follow-up compared to an active control group (i.e., bibliotherapy). METHODS: Powered for superiority testing, this six-site open trial involves the random assignment of 120 healthcare workers with stress levels > 16 on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to either the 7-session online CBT program or bibliotherapy. The primary outcome is the decrease of PSS-10 scores at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include depression, insomnia, and PTSD symptoms; self-reported resilience and rumination; and credibility and satisfaction. Assessments are scheduled at pretreatment, mid-treatment (at 4 weeks), end of active treatment (at 8 weeks), and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: This is the first study assessing the efficacy and the acceptability of a brief online CBT program specifically developed for healthcare workers. Given the potential short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers' mental health, but also on healthcare systems, our findings can significantly impact clinical practice and management of the ongoing, and probably long-lasting, health crisis.

"Comparing Chinese and US practitioners' attitudes towards teletherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic","The China American Psychoanalytic Alliance (CAPA) has been offering psychoanalytic psychotherapy training and treatment to Chinese mental health professionals entirely over the Internet since 2006. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, most practitioners worldwide had to turn to teletherapy. US psychoanalytic practitioners were more negative towards teletherapy than those from other theoretical orientations. We predicted that CAPA practitioners as compared to US psychoanalytic practitioners would be more prepared for teletherapy services during the pandemic, since they their training and treatment had been on-line. We compared survey results from 164 CAPA practitioners with 165 US psychoanalytic practitioners (matched for age) who had recently psychoanalytically treated a patient on-line. CAPA participants were recruited from CAPA email lists and the US sample were recruited from the Society for Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychology of the American Psychological Association, the American Psychoanalytic Association and International Psychotherapy Institute. CAPA practitioners as compared to US psychoanalytic practitioners had more positive opinions about teletherapy before the pandemic; had more positive opinions about teletherapy during the pandemic; and had more positive opinions about the effectiveness of teletherapy in working with transference, relational issues and resistance. The CAPA practitioners were more prepared to do psychoanalytic psychotherapy during the pandemic than the US psychoanalytic practitioners. Xiubing Wang discusses these findings in terms of her own experience as a CAPA graduate and treater before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic in China.","Wang, Gordon, Snyder","https://doi.org/10.1111/appy.12440","20201027","Covid-19; Telepsychotherapy; distance psychotherapy; remote psychotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6473,""
"Using Mixed Methods to Identify the Primary Mental Health Problems and Needs of Children, Adolescents, and Their Caregivers during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","Our understanding of child, adolescent, and caregiver mental health (MH) problems during the coronavirus pandemic, and which interventions are needed, may be advanced by consumer input. 133 general population caregivers reported top MH problems and needs for themselves and their children (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.21; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.94), using standardized and idiographic measures. We applied linear regression models to quantitative data and thematic analysis to qualitative data. Caregivers' COVID-era depression and anxiety symptom means fell within the clinical range, as did their children's MH symptoms. Caregiver-reported child and adolescent symptoms were positively associated with number of children in the home. Caregiver and caregiver-reported child and adolescent symptoms were more pronounced in regions with more lenient COVID-19 restrictions. Among the kinds of help most urgently needed, MH services were ranked #1 for caregivers and adolescents, #2 for 6-12Ã‚Â year-olds, and #3 for 1-5Ã‚Â year-olds.

"Prevalence, Psychological Responses and Associated Correlates of Depression, Anxiety and Stress in a Global Population, During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic","Uncertainty and isolation have been linked to mental health problems. Uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to trigger mental health problems, which include anxiety, stress, and depression. This paper evaluates the prevalence, psychological responses, and associated correlates of depression, anxiety, and stress in a global population during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A cross-sectional study design was adopted. 678 completed forms were collected during the COVID-19 quarantine/lockdown. An online questionnaire was designed and DASS-21 was used as the screening tool. A non-probability sampling technique strategy was applied. 50.9% of participants showed traits of anxiety, 57.4% showed signs of stress, and 58.6% exhibited depression. Stress, anxiety, and depression are overwhelmingly prevalent across the globe during this COVID-19 pandemic, and multiple factors can influence the rates of these mental health conditions. Our factorial analysis showed notable associations and manifestations of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. People aged 18-24, females, and people in non-marital relationships experienced stress, anxiety, and depression. Separated individuals experienced stress and anxiety. Married people experienced anxiety. Single and divorced people experienced depression. Unemployed individuals experienced stress and depression. Students experienced anxiety and depression. Canada, the UK, and Pakistan are all countries that are experiencing stress and depression as a whole. An extended number of days in quarantine was associated with increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Family presence yielded lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Lastly, lack of exercise was associated with increased stress, anxiety, and depression.","Shah, Mohammad, Qureshi, Abbas, Aleem","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-020-00728-y","20201027","Anxiety; COVID 19; Corona; Depression; Quarantine; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6475,""
"Risk and Protective Factors for Prospective Changes in Adolescent Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The restrictions put in place to contain the COVID-19 virus have led to widespread social isolation, impacting mental health worldwide. These restrictions may be particularly difficult for adolescents, who rely heavily on their peer connections for emotional support. However, there has been no longitudinal research examining the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' mental health, and moderators of change, as well as assessing the factors perceived as causing the most distress. Two hundred and forty eight adolescents (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.4; 51% girls; 81.8% Caucasian) were surveyed over two time points; in the 12 months leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak (T1), and again two months following the implementation of government restrictions and online learning (T2). Online surveys assessed depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction at T1 and T2, and participants' schooling, peer and family relationships, social connection, media exposure, COVID-19 related stress, and adherence to government stay-at-home directives at T2 only. In line with predictions, adolescents experienced significant increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety, and a significant decrease in life satisfaction from T1 to T2, which was particularly pronounced among girls. Moderation analyses revealed that COVID-19 related worries, online learning difficulties, and increased conflict with parents predicted increases in mental health problems from T1 to T2, whereas adherence to stay-at-home orders and feeling socially connected during the COVID-19 lockdown protected against poor mental health. This study provides initial longitudinal evidence for the decline of adolescent's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that adolescents are more concerned about the government restrictions designed to contain the spread of the virus, than the virus itself, and that those concerns are associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and decreased life satisfaction.","Magson, Freeman, Rapee, Richardson, Oar, Fardouly","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-020-01332-9","20201027","Adolescence; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Life satisfaction; Longitudinal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6476,""

We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a pragmatic sample administering the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)- 9, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD)-7, the Brief Adjustment Scale (BASE-6), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Twenty fours individuals were included (75% male and 25% female, mean age 21.75 years old). The sample of adults with ADHD we surveyed had significant levels of emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic period. However, no claim can be made that during the COVID-19 pandemic there is evidence of significant deterioration to the mental health of this sample. When treatment for ADHD is maintained, the effects of the COVID-19 to the mental health of this population group are mild. Targeted psychological interventions may be useful in such circumstances.","Adamou, Fullen, Galab, Mackintosh, Abbott, Lowe, Smith","https://doi.org/10.2196/24430","20201027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6477,""
"A Mobile Health Intervention (LifeBuoy App) to Help Young People Manage Suicidal Thoughts: Protocol for a Mixed-Methods Randomized Controlled Trial","Self-help smartphone apps offer a new opportunity to address youth suicide prevention by improving access to support and by providing potentially high fidelity and cost-effective treatment. However, there have been very few smartphone apps providing evidence-based support for suicide prevention in this population. To address this gap, we developed the LifeBuoy app, a self-help smartphone app informed by dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help young people manage suicidal thoughts in their daily life. This study describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the LifeBuoy app for reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, and improving general mental well-being in young adults aged 18 to 25 years. This is a randomized controlled trial recruiting 378 young adults aged between 18 and 25 years and comparing the LifeBuoy app with a matched attention control (a placebo app with the same display but no DBT components). The primary outcome is suicidal thoughts measured by the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). The secondary outcomes are suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and general mental well-being. The changes in the levels of insomnia, rumination, suicide cognitions, distress tolerance, loneliness, and help seeking before and after using the app are evaluated in this study. The study also addresses risk factors and responses to the intervention. A series of items assessing COVID-19 experiences is included in the trial to capture the potential impact of the pandemic on this study. Assessments will occur on the following three occasions: baseline, postintervention, and follow-up at 3 months postintervention. A qualitative interview about user experience with the LifeBuoy app will take place within 4 weeks of the final assessment. Using linear mixed models, the primary analysis will compare the changes in suicidal thoughts in the intervention condition relative to the control condition. To minimize risks, participants will receive a call from the team clinical psychologist by clicking a help button in the app or responding to an automated email sent by the system when they are assessed with elevated suicide risks at the baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up surveys. The trial recruitment started in May 2020. Data collection is currently ongoing. This is the first trial examining the efficacy of a DBT-informed smartphone app delivered to community-living young adults reporting suicidal thoughts. This trial will extend knowledge about the efficacy and acceptability of app-based support for suicidal thoughts in young people.

Traumatic response and emotional exhaustion were greater among (i) women (odds ratio [OR]: 1.48, 95% CI 1.12-1.97 PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.006; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.54, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.003), (ii) critical care units (OR: 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.35, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.33, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) (iii) COVID-19 designated hospital (OR: 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.38; PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.36; PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and (iv) COVID-19-related departments (OR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.29, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.006, emotional exhaustion only). To date, this is the first large-scale study to report the rates of trauma and burnout for nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study indicates that nurses who identified as women, working in ICUs, COVID-19 designated hospitals, and departments involved with treating COVID-19 patients had higher scores in mental health outcomes. Future research can focus on the factors the study has identified that could lead to more effective prevention and treatment strategies for adverse health outcomes and better use of resources to promote positive outcomes.","Chen, Sun, Chen, Jen, Kang, Kao, Chou","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12796","20201027","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; nurses; psychological outcomes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6480,""
"[Evaluation of Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19 in Terms of Risk Factors]","Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that can cause disease in the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans and animals. Lately, a new coronavirus causing pneumonia cases was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Soon after, the name of the virus was identified as the &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2&quot;, and the World Health Organization named the disease coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In our country, the first cases began to appear in the second week of March. In this study, we aimed to investigate the demographic characteristics and risk factors of patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 100 patients (53 female and 47 male) were included in our study. The patients included in the study were randomly selected from the registration system and their information was evaluated retrospectively. The mean age of the patients was 54.42 (Age range= 20-90). When the risk factors for catching the disease were evaluated; it was determined that there was at least one risk factor in 46 patients; 30 patients had close contact with the COVID-19 patient in the social environment (30%) and 16 patients had a travel history outside the city in the last 14 days (16%). The most common symptoms in our patients were; cough (93%), fever (42%), dyspnea (22%), weakness (8%), sore throat (7%), diarrhea (6%), headache (5%) and sputum (2%). The most common comorbid conditions in our patients were detected as hypertension (42%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (21%), congestive heart failure (10%), allergic asthma (7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6%), rheumatoid arthritis (3%), coronary artery disease (2%), solid organ tumour (2%), depression (1%) and epilepsy (1%). The mean age of our 15 patients who were monitored in intensive care unit was 65 y (Ã‚Â± 11.46), the mean age of 85 patients followed in the service was 52.55 (Ã‚Â± 16.35) and this difference was statistically significant (p= 0.006). When these two groups were compared in terms of comorbid diseases, the presence of DM was 40% higher (n= 6) in intensive care patients, and this difference was statistically significant (p= 0.05). In addition, the majority [11 patients (73%)] of the patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit were male (p= 0.03). When smoking was evaluated as a risk factor for serious illness, 4 of 11 patients (26%) in intensive care unit had a smoking history, while none of the patients who have died due to COVID-19 had a smoking history. These findings suggested to us that smoking does not increase the severity of COVID-19 disease. As a result, knowledge about the disease should be increased rapidly by sharing the studies on risk factors, transmission routes and clinical features of COVID-19 infection, which affects the whole world.","GÃƒÂ¼nal, TÃƒÂ¼re, Bayburtlu, Arslan, DemiraÃ„Å¸, TaÃ…Å¸kÃ„Â±n, KÃ„Â±lÃ„Â±ÃƒÂ§","https://doi.org/10.5578/mb.69811","20201027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6481,""
"COVID-19 Outbreak and Its Association with Healthcare Workers' Emotional Stress: a Cross-Sectional Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has exposed healthcare workers to extreme physical workloads and psychological challenges. Thus, we aimed to assess the immediate correlates of emotional stress and to identify which specific jobs, departments, and exposure types are risk factors for emotional stress in healthcare workers. In this cross-sectional study conducted from April 2 to 10, 2020, university hospital workers were administered self-reported questionnaires that covered general characteristics and included the Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, and a visual analog scale. At-risk groups for depression and anxiety were identified, and the odds ratios for depression and anxiety were analyzed after adjusting for age, gender, education, marital status, and duration of employment. The data of 1,003 participants were analyzed. Of these, 14.2% worked in wards for confirmed COVID-19 cases and 15.2% had had direct contact with these patients. Treating patients with COVID-19 was associated with depression and anxiety, while dealing with COVID-19 test samples was associated with depression. Exposure to random or unspecified patients was also associated with depression. Lastly, social rejection and other negative experiences were associated with depression and anxiety. The COVID-19 outbreak is correlated with healthcare workers' emotional stress, and specific types of jobs and duties involving close contact with these patients can be risk factors. Interestingly, even low-exposure groups reported significant depression and anxiety as a result of social stigma and uncertainty. Adequate and timely management measures for emotional stress are required for vulnerable and at-risk groups.","Park, Hwang, Jo, Bae, Sakong","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e372","20201027","COVID-19; Daegu; GAD-7; PHQ-9","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6482,""
"Triggers of mental health problems among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in private care homes and domiciliary care agencies: Lived experiences of care workers in the Midlands region, UK","COVID-19 was first reported in China and later spread across the world causing panic because there is no cure for it. The pandemic has adversely affected frontline health workers and patients, owing to poor preparedness. The study explored the triggers of mental health problems among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. An exploratory qualitative approach was utilised in the study. Forty individual semi-structured interviews were held with frontline healthcare workers. A thematic approach underpinned by some aspects of interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) and the Silences Framework (SF) was utilised. The research found that triggers of mental health problems among frontline health workers in private care homes and domiciliary care agencies are fear of infection and infecting others, lack of recognition/disparity between National Health Service (NHS) and social care, lack of guidance, unsafe hospital discharge, death and loss of professionals and residents, unreliable testing and delayed results and shortage of staff. It is important to support frontline workers in private care homes and domiciliary care agencies.","Nyashanu, Pfende, Ekpenyong","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13204","20201027","COVID-19; care homes; coronavirus; domiciliary care; fear of infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6483,""

Anonymous online survey of adult Australian residents, 3 April - 2 May 2020. Self-reported psychological status during the preceding fortnight assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; symptoms of depression) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Optimism about the future was assessed with a 10-point study-specific visual analogue scale. 13Ã‚Â 829 respondents contributed complete response data. The estimated prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 10) was 27.6% (95% CI, 26.1-29.1%) and of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7 Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 10) 21.0% (95% CI, 19.6-22.4%); 14.6% of respondents (95% CI, 13.5-16.0%) reported thoughts of being better off dead or self-harm (PHQ-9, item 9) on at least some days and 59.2% (95% CI, 57.6-60.7%) that they were more irritable (GAD-7, item 6). An estimated 28.3% of respondents (95% CI, 27.1-29.6%) reported great optimism about the future (score Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 8). People who had lost jobs, were worried about contracting COVID-19, or for whom the restrictions had a highly adverse impact on daily life were more likely to report symptoms of depression or anxiety, and less likely to report high optimism than people without these experiences. Mental health problems were widespread among Australians during the first month of the stage two COVID-19 restrictions; in addition, about one-quarter of respondents reported mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety.

"Effect of COVID-19 on Mental Health Rehabilitation Centers","The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is an unprecedented event in modern history worldwide. To facilitate speedy and smooth recovery during this time period, an added responsibility is placed upon rehabilitation center counselors, staff and management. In this paper we expose the role that psychiatric rehabilitation plays during the COVID-19 crisis. Since COVID-19 pandemic has remarkably raised mental health concerns, one of the high risks and possibly neglected groups includes individuals undergoing mental health rehabilitation, the impact on which can be significant as compared to the rest of the population. In order to ensure that individuals on the road to recovery are not alone and forgotten during the times of coronavirus crisis they should be provided with adequate resources, such as online meetings and group therapy sessions, assessment, treatment and support by telephone and video consultation and getting the medications they need to recover. This article highlights how the coronavirus pandemic, that has hit hard the health care and all categories of patients affected by mental disorders, is likely to be particularly dramatic for mental health rehabilitation centers. Indeed, the COVID-19 crisis has severely tested the health systems worldwide, reducing sometimes the quality and quantity of care offered to psychiatric patients both hospitalized and not in rehabilitation centers. The main goal of this paper is to raise awareness of the importance, often underestimated, of mental health rehabilitation centers, on which one should invest for the both future of psychological and psychiatric rehabilitation and the current crisis as well.","Aamir, Awan, de Filippis, Diwan, Ullah","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40737-020-00203-7","20201027","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation centers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6487,""

"Perceived psychosocial health and its sociodemographic correlates in times of the COVID-19 pandemic: a community-based online study in China","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been affecting people's psychosocial health and well-being through various complex pathways. The present study aims to investigate the perceived psychosocial health and its sociodemographic correlates among Chinese community-dwelling residents. This cross-sectional survey was carried out online and using a structured questionnaire during April 2020. In total, 4788 men and women with the age range of 11-98Ã‚Â years from eight provinces in eastern, central and western China were included in the analysis. We adopted a tactical approach to capture three key domains of perceived psychosocial health that are more likely to occur during a pandemic including hopelessness, loneliness, and depression. Multiple regression method, binary logistic regression model and variance inflation factor (VIF) were used to conduct data analysis. Respectively 34.8%, 32.5% and 44.8% of the participants expressed feeling more hopeless, lonely, and depressed during the pandemic. The percentage of all three indicators was comparatively higher among women than among men: hopelessness (50.7% vs 49.3%), loneliness (52.4% vs 47.6%), and depression (56.2% vs 43.8%). Being married was associated with lower odds of loneliness among men (odds ratio [OR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.63, 95% CI: 0.45-0.90). Loneliness was negatively associated with smoking (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.67, 95% CI: 0.45-0.99) and positively associated with drinking (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.45, 95% CI: 1.04-2.02).

Smoking also showed negative association with depression only among men (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.63, 95% CI: 0.43-0.91). More than one-third of the participants reported worsening in the experience of hopelessness and loneliness, with more than two-fifth of worsening depression during the pandemic compared with before the outbreak. Several socioeconomic and lifestyle factors were found to be associated with the outcome variables, most notably participants' marital status, household income, smoking, alcohol drinking, existing chronic conditions. These findings may be of significance to treat patients and help them recover from the pandemic.","Wang, Tang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00770-8","20201027","COVID-19; China; Mental health; Psychosocial stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6490,""

"A hybrid inductive-abductive analysis of health workers' experiences and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic puts health workers at increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes. However, no studies have assessed health workers' experiences using qualitative methods during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States to identify novel factors that could relate to their mental health. In May 2020, we distributed an online survey to health workers across 25 medical centers throughout the United States. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care-Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise and associated cutoff values were used to assess rates of probable major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol use disorder, respectively. To provide insight into the factors shaping these and other mental health conditions, we included two open-ended questions asking respondents to recount their most upsetting and hopeful experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it made them feel. Using a hybrid inductive-abductive approach and thematic content analysis, we created a Social Ecological Model to represent themes among health workers' experiences within five ecological levels: individual, interpersonal, organization, community, and public policy. Of the 1,132 participants who completed the survey, 14.0% had probable major depression, 15.8% probable generalized anxiety disorder, 23.1% probable post-traumatic stress disorder, and 42.6% probable alcohol use disorder. Individual level themes included participants' personal health and self-care behaviors. Interpersonal level themes included the health of their social circle, family functioning, and social support. Organization level themes included their hospital's management, resources, patient care, routine, and teams. Themes in the community level included the media, scientific knowledge about COVID-19, morale, behavior, and support of health workers. Lastly, government and health system leadership and shelter-in-place policy were themes within the public policy level. Our findings provide insights into novel factors that have impacted health workers' wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors should be further explored to inform interventions and public policy that mitigate mental health morbidities among health workers during this and future outbreaks.","Hennein, Lowe","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240646","20201026","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6496,""

This cohort study is part of an ongoing large panel study of adults aged 18 years and older residing in the UK, the COVID-19 Social Study, established on March 21, 2020. Data analysis was conducted in May 2020. Sociodemographic risk factors included belonging to the Black, Asian, and minority racial/ethnic communities, low socioeconomic position (SEP), and essential worker roles (eg, workers in health and social care, education, childcare, or key public services). Health-related and psychosocial risk factors included preexisting physical and mental health conditions, experience of psychological or physical abuse, and low social support. Depressive symptoms were measured on 7 occasions from March 21 to April 2, 2020, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Group-based depressive symptom trajectories were derived using latent growth mixture modeling. The analytical sample comprised 51Ã¢â‚¬Â¯417 adults aged 18 years and older (mean [SD] age, 48.8 [16.8] years; 26Ã¢â‚¬Â¯276 [51.1%] women; 6145 members [12.0%] of Black, Asian, and minority racial/ethnic communities). Among these, 17Ã¢â‚¬Â¯143 participants (33.3%) were in the lowest SEP quartile, and 11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯342 participants (22.1%) were classified as essential workers. Three levels of severity of depressive symptoms were identified: low (30Ã¢â‚¬Â¯850 participants [60.0%]), moderate (14Ã¢â‚¬Â¯911 participants [29.0%]), and severe (5656 participants [11.0%]). After adjusting for covariates, experiences of physical or psychological abuse (odds ratio [OR], 13.16; 95% CI, 12.95-13.37; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), preexisting mental health conditions (OR, 12.99; 95% CI, 12.87-13.11; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), preexisting physical health conditions (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 3.29-3.54; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), low social support (OR, 12.72; 95% CI, 12.57-12.86; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and low SEP (OR, 5.22; 95% CI, 5.08-5.36; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) were significantly associated with severe depressive symptoms. No significant association was found for race/ethnicity (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.85-1.28; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.56). Participants with essential worker roles were less likely to experience severe depressive symptoms (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.80; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Similar patterns of associations were found for the group of participants with moderate depressive symptoms (abuse: OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 5.15-5.54; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; mental health condition: OR, 4.24; 95% CI, 4.24-4.24; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; physical health condition: OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.80-1.98; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; low social support: OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 4.60-4.82; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; low SEP: OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.87-2.08; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In this cohort study of UK adults participating in the COVID-19 Social Study, people with psychosocial and health-related risk factors, as well as those with low SEP, were at the most risk of experiencing moderate or severe depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Iob, Frank, Steptoe, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.26064","20201027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6497,""

"COVID-19 in Neonates: A Call for Standardized Testing","The limited evidence on neonatal coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests that vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rare, and most neonates seem to acquire the infection postnatally through respiratory droplets and contact. Testing of neonates with perinatal or postnatal exposure to COVID-19 infection plays a vital role in the early diagnosis, management and institution of infection prevention measures thereby cutting off the chain of epidemic transmission. A recently concluded online neonatal COVID-19 conference conducted by the National Neonatology Forum (NNF) of India and a nationwide online survey pointed to substantial variation in neonatal testing strategies. We, herein, summarize the relevant literature about the incidence and outcomes of neonatal COVID-19 and call for a universal and uniform testing strategy for exposed neonates. We anticipate that the testing strategy put forth in this article will facilitate better management and safe infection prevention measures among all units offering neonatal care in the country.","Sivanandan, Chawla, Kumar, Deorari","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+in+Neonates:+A+Call+for+Standardized+Testing.","20201026","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6501,""
"Behavioral Change Towards Reduced Intensity Physical Activity Is Disproportionately Prevalent Among Adults With Serious Health Issues or Self-Perception of High Risk During the UK COVID-19 Lockdown","<b>Objectives:</b> We assessed whether lockdown had a disproportionate impact on physical activity behavior in groups who were, or who perceived themselves to be, at heightened risk from COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> Physical activity intensity (none, mild, moderate, or vigorous) before and during the UK COVID-19 lockdown was self-reported by 9,190 adults between 2020-04-06 and 2020-04-22. Physician-diagnosed health conditions and topic composition of open-ended text on participants' coping strategies were tested for associations with changes in physical activity. <b>Results:</b> Most (63.9%) participants maintained their normal physical activity intensity during lockdown, 25.0% changed toward less intensive activity and 11.1% were doing more. Doing less intensive physical activity was associated with obesity (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.42), hypertension (OR 1.25, 1.10-1.40), lung disease (OR 1.23, 1.08-1.38), depression (OR 2.05, 1.89-2.21), and disability (OR 2.13, 1.87-2.39). Being female (OR 1.25, 1.12-1.38), living alone (OR 1.20, 1.05-1.34), or without access to a garden (OR 1.74, 1.56-1.91) were also associated with doing less intensive physical activity, but being in the highest income group (OR 1.73, 1.37-2.09) or having school-age children (OR 1.29, 1.10-1.49) were associated with doing more. Younger adults were more likely to change their PA behavior compared to older adults. Structural topic modeling of narratives on coping strategies revealed associations between changes in physical activity and perceptions of personal or familial risks at work or at home. <b>Conclusions:</b> Policies on maintaining or improving physical activity intensity during lockdowns should consider (1) vulnerable groups of adults including those with chronic diseases or self-perceptions of being at risk and (2) the importance of access to green or open spaces in which to exercise.","Rogers, Waterlow, Brindle, Enria, Eggo, Lees, Roberts","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.575091","20201026","COVID-19; SARS-CoV2; chronic condition; lockdown; mixed method approach; obesity; perceptions of risk; physical activity (exercise)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6502,""
"Relationship Between Psychological Responses and the Appraisal of Risk Communication During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Two-Wave Study of Community Residents in China","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Data collection in the ascending phase is crucial to address a rapidly evolving crisis by helping us understand the uncertain relationship between risk communication and psychological responses. Data were collected from 26 January 26, 2020, until February 17, 2020, with a mean test-retest interval of 16 days. A total of 846 adults from four residential communities in high-risk areas (Wuhan city) and low-risk areas (Zhengzhou city) were invited to complete a set of Internet-based questionnaires measuring the adoption of preventive behaviors, appraisal of risk communication, anxiety level, and susceptibility to emotional contagion. At the baseline assessment (Wave 1), 58 withdrew from the study, and 788 (433 females) completed the questionnaires. At the Wave 2 survey, 318 (185 females) adults from Wave 1 were retained. The results from cross-lagged models demonstrated reciprocal negative associations between anxiety and risk communication and between the appraisal of risk communication and the adoption of preventive behaviors. In addition, a higher appraisal of risk communication in the initial period of the outbreak mitigated the respondents' susceptibility to emotional contagion later on. Susceptibility to emotional contagion was positively associated with preventive behaviors taken. Furthermore, multiple-group structural equation modeling suggested that risk communication was more likely to affect the susceptibility to emotional contagion of people on the frontline of the outbreak than people living in low-risk areas. This study demonstrated the importance of risk communication aimed at encouraging appropriate countermeasures against virus outbreaks.","Jin, Zhao, Xia, Chen, Yu, Tamunang Tamutana, Yuan, Shi, Adamseged, Kogay, Park","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.550220","20201026","COVID-19; anxiety; emotion; longitudinal data; mental health; preventive measures; risk communication; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6503,""

"Double Burden of COVID-19 Pandemic and Military Occupation: Mental Health Among a Palestinian University Community in the West Bank","The Covid-19 pandemic created major global health crises, with serious effects on all aspects of life. The pandemic reached the Israeli occupied West Bank of Palestine in early March 2020, and lockdown immediately ensued. To assess the prevalence and predictors of distress and insecurity among Birzeit University's community during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. An online survey completed in March-April 2020 using standardized and previously validated distress and insecurity scales. The survey was placed on the University portal accessed by students, faculty and employees, and was sent by email to faculty and employees. Data were weighted to reflect the University community's distribution. There were 1,851 participants in the study: 84% were undergraduate students, 10% graduate students, and 6% faculty and employees. Sixty two percent were women. Ages ranged from 17 to 70 years (mean 24 Ã‚Â± 9.7). Prevalence of moderate/high distress and insecurity were 40% and 48% respectively. Multiple logistic regression revealed that women, those under 35 years old and those with worse reported income, had significantly higher odds of distress and insecurity compared to their counterparts. Undergraduate students or living with a person at home with high risk of illness with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of distress compared to their counterparts (OR = 1.56, 95%CI[1.13-2.15]) and (OR = 1.34, 95%CI[1.11-1.62]) respectively. A COVID-19 worry score was significantly associated with higher odds of distress and insecurity (OR = 1.77, 95%CI[1.46-2.14]) and (OR = 4.3, 95%CI[3.53-5.23]) respectively. This study emphasizes the need to pay attention not only to physical health but also to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among young people, women, those with lower economic status, and those living with high risk persons during the pandemic.

"Mental Health Status of Healthcare Workers in China for COVID-19 Epidemic","COVID-19 first appeared in China in December 2019, with a high rate of infectivity and morbidity, which brought tremendous psychological pressure to healthcare workers. To understand the psychological health status of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak and decline, and to provide a theoretical reference for the future establishment of a psychological crisis intervention system. Healthcare workers were recruited using convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods, and the electronic version of the SCL-90 scale and a sociodemographic questionnaire were administered. In the pretest, a total of 5018 responses were collected; after six weeks, random sampling was performed. The SCL-90 and measures of other epidemic-related problems were administered, with 1570 responses received; then, the final data analysis was performed. After six weeks, the post-test GSI score; SCL-90 total score; and PST, PSDI, O-C, I-S, DEP, ANX, PHOB, PAR, PSY, and HOS scores were significantly lower than the corresponding pretest scores (p &lt; 0.05). The results by occupational category showed that the scores of nursing staff decreased significantly for 12 indexes and that the scores of the doctors and other hospital staff also significantly decreased. There was a significant difference between the pretest (50.78 Ã‚Â± 28.18) and post-test (45.00 Ã‚Â± 28.49) scores for the degree of worry about the epidemic. Healthcare workers believed that the top three aspects of life affected by the epidemic were economic problems (816 people), interpersonal communication problems (731 people), and mental health (728 people). Over the course of the epidemic, the item scores generally declined significantly. Therefore, during an outbreak period, attention should be paid to psychological crisis interventions for healthcare workers; problems caused by psychological pressure, and even other psychological conditions, can be significantly alleviated to reduce the probability of subsequent health problems.","Liu, Wu, Shi, Ma, Ma, Teng, You, Zhang, Zhang, Feng, Long, Ma, Wang, Zeng","https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.3005","20201027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6506,""
"Unprecedented but not Unpredictable: Effects of the COVID-19 Crisis on Commodity-Dependent Countries","The global spread of COVID-19 represents a massive challenge for developing countries. Beyond the health crisis and the sudden stop of domestic economic activities, many countries face turmoil linked to commodity dependence. Commodity prices have reacted strongly to the crisis, reflecting changes in supply and demand due to policy measures to limit contagion. Commodity-dependent developing countries are therefore confronted with an unprecedented combination of shocks. However, the crisis has also exposed structural vulnerabilities of these countries linked above all to commodity price dynamics. In the context of a longstanding debate on commodities and development, we portray recent commodity price developments and underlying drivers and discuss implications for commodity-dependent countries, including the risks of depressed export earnings and of changing global production patterns in the long run. Responses to the crisis have to include measures to stabilize commodity prices as well as strategies for economic diversification.

"Living with covid-19","From the beginning of 2020, the alarming news from Italy and the first known cases arrived in Greece, along with travelers from the Holy Land. Spain, France and all other countries followed. From the first week of March, restrictive measures began in Greece and then confinement in order to limit the spread of the pandemic and not drown the National Health System by serious cases. The policy of restrictive measures to stop the pandemic was the internationally accepted response1 and the generalized adherence proved effective, despite the shock and the various reactions from the unprecedented, generalized state of restriction, different scale from epidemics of other times.2-4 In other countries, the loose restrictive measures have cost thousands of deaths. The general restrictive measures, however, have serious consequences for people's mental equilibrium, economy and employment, and for this reason they can only be of limited duration.5 The gradual return to normal life rhythms began gradually from May. But the test of the holiday time and the gradual opening of the tourist season, that is, the open communication of moving populations with limited, random checks for the virus and only local restrictions of the gathering of citizens. We are experiencing now the gradual and severe increase in cases, with an uncertain spreading, with asymptomatic and younger in age likely playing a central role in the spread of the virus, while the fear of a potential large increase in serious cases remains. At the time of this writing, the only means of coping is to maintain and locally strengthen the protective measures, while we gradually realize that these measures came to stay for many more months.6,7 A major problem is that the initial small number of cases favored the underestimation of risk by part of the population, and the serious consequences on people's jobs and lives, along with the deregulation of employment and social security relations legislated in recent months, have provided substantial material to conspiracy theories. We carefully monitor the research on the epidemiological behavior of covid-19 and the clinical data, the discussion on the drugs that make the symptoms milder, the effect of the virus on the CNS and the expected vaccine or vaccines. Our role from the beginning concerned the enormous psychological burden of a global health crisis, with serious consequences on people's working and social lives and equally avoiding the deregulation of the management of our patients and of the units that provide it. At the time of confinement, the telephone contact, familiar to all generations, offered valuable information and support, the lines 10306 and 1110, as well as many local or voluntary help-lines. Telepsychiatry was used more widely - being also an initiative of the Hellenic Psychiatric Association - and seems to have entered impetuously in our work, as well as in education. Its central or complementary role and its safe use are issues that are widely discussed at the moment.8 Protection measures against the virus seriously affect the normal functioning of health and mental health services. The solution should be sought in the urgent operational upgrade, the very necessary reinforcement of the staff and its effective protection from the virus and stress from exposure to danger, which has emerged as important factors for the normal operation of the mental health units.9 The use of telepsychiatry has solved a number of operational problems, but in many cases, it remains complementary, as it cannot replace physical presence in more specific care operations. The need not only to normalize, but to improve the follow up of our patients, the need to strengthen the units that provide basic, community mental health services, is shown by the increase in cases of involuntary hospitalization in the psychiatric hospitals of Athens and Thessaloniki during the last two months. A health crisis that affects almost the entire planet and the working and social life of most is a major social and political problem that concerns all of us,10 while mental health professionals are called to offer their scientific tools for people to face a multifaceted threat and in particular to claim and ensure the continuation of the treatment of our patients and the normal operation of our units.","Ploumpidis","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2020.313.197","20201025","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6510,""
"The Impact of Physical Distancing Policies During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Health and Well-Being Among Australian Adolescents","Physical distancing policies in the state of New South Wales (Australia) were implemented on March 23, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated changes in physical activity, dietary behaviors, and well-being during the early period of this policy. A cohort of young people aged 13-19Ã‚Â years from Sydney (NÃ‚Â = 582) were prospectively followed for 22 weeks (November 18, 2019, to April 19, 2020). Daily, weekly, and monthly trajectories of diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior, well-being, and psychological distress were collected via smartphone, using a series of ecological momentary assessments and smartphone sensors. Differences in health and well-being outcomes were compared pre- and post-implementation of physical distancing guidelines. After the implementation of physical distancing measures in NSW, there were significant decreases in physical activity (odds ratio [OR]Ã‚Â = .53, 95% confidence interval [CI]Ã‚Â = .34-.83), increases in social media and Internet use (ORÃ‚Â = 1.86, 95% CIÃ‚Â = 1.15-3.00), and increased screen time based on participants' smartphone screen state. Physical distancing measures were also associated with being alone in the previous hour (ORÃ‚Â = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.33-3.28), decreases in happiness (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .38, 95% CIÃ‚Â = .18-.82), and fast food consumption (ORÃ‚Â = .46, 95% CIÃ‚Â = .29-.73). Physical distancing and social restrictions had a contemporaneous impact on health and well-being outcomes associated with chronic disease among young people. As the pandemic evolves, it will be important to consider how to mitigate against any longer term health impacts of physical distancing restrictions.","Munasinghe, Sperandei, Freebairn, Conroy, Jani, Marjanovic, Page","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.008","20201027","Adolescents; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Diet; Mental health; Physical activity; Social isolation; Well-being; Young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6511,""

"Alcohol and substance use in pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rates of alcohol and substance use raises significant concerns, as substances may be coping mechanisms for social isolation and/or disruptions to employment and the economy. Pregnant women are currently experiencing unusually high rates of anxiety and depression symptoms and may be especially affected. We analysed results from an ongoing study of pregnant individuals in Canada: Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Participants were asked about current substance during pregnancy, and concerns about the threat of COVID-19 to their babyâ€™s life, decreased quality of prenatal care, and whether they felt more socially isolated, experienced financial difficulties, or lost their job. The percentage of participants reporting use during pregnancy was 6.9% for alcohol, 3.7% for cannabis, 3.5% for tobacco, and 0.2% for illicit drugs. Odds for cannabis use increased by 0.9% for each unit increase in concern about lower quality prenatal care and by 2.1% for each unit increase in financial difficulties. Odds for tobacco use increased by 220.0% for loss of employment. COVID-19 concerns did not significantly predict alcohol use. Comprehensive public health strategies, including access to perinatal, mental health, and financial supports, as well as education around the effects of prenatal exposures and the possible effects of COVID-19 on the mother and baby, are important to facilitate healthy coping mechanisms for mothers, reduce substance use in pregnancy, and mitigate poor perinatal and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes for babies.","Preeti Kar et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-EA9-B48","20200707","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6513,""
"Protocol for the Canadian Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and countermeasures implemented by governments around the world have led to dramatically increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological effects of COVD-19 public health measures, because they represent a demographic that is most affected by disasters and because pregnancy itself entails significant life changes that require major psychosocial and emotional adjustments. The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study was designed to investigate the associations between exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals, and developmental outcomes in their offspring. Methods The PdP study comprises a prospective longitudinal cohort of pregnant individuals (at enrollment) with repeated follow-ups during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Participants were eligible if they were: pregnant, =17 years, =35 weeks gestation at study enrollment, living in Canada, and able to read and write in English or French. Participant recruitment via social media (Facebook, Instagram) began on April 5, 2020 and is ongoing. At enrollment, participants completed an initial survey that assessed demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, previous pregnancies and births, pre-pregnancy health, health conditions during pregnancy, medications, psychological distress, social support, and hardships experienced because of COVID-19 (e.g., lost employment, loved one dying). For the first three months following the initial survey, participants received a monthly email link to complete a follow-up survey that asked about experiences since the previous survey. After three months, follow-up surveys were sent bi-monthly to reduce participant burden. For each of these surveys, participants were first asked if they were still pregnant and then routed either to the next prenatal survey or to the delivery survey. In the postpartum, surveys were sent at 3-, 6-, and 12-months of infant age to assess maternal psychological distress and infant development. Discussion This longitudinal investigation seeks to elucidate the associations between hardships, maternal psychological distress, child development during COVID-19, and risk and resilience factors that amplify or ameliorate these associations. Findings are intended to generate knowledge about the psychological consequences of pandemics on pregnant individuals and point toward prevention and intervention targets.","Gerald Giesbrecht","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602C-D25-F53","20201002","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Infancy","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6514,""
"Subjective wellbeing in parents during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Australia","Objectives: To examine the subjective wellbeing of Australian parents raising children and adolescents (0-18 years) during â€˜stage threeâ€™ COVID-19 restrictions (April 2020), in comparison with subjective wellbeing in parents assessed over an 18-year period prior to the pandemic. We also aimed to examine socio-demographic and COVID-19 predictors of subjective wellbeing during the pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional data were from: (1) the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Survey (CPAS, N=2,365 parents of a child 0-18 years, 8-28th April, 2020); and, (2) a pre-pandemic database bringing together over 18-years of national data on subjective wellbeing (N=17,529 adults living with children, collected in annual surveys over 2002-2019). Results: Levels of subjective wellbeing during the pandemic were considerably lower than ratings prior to the pandemic (Personal Wellbeing Index, mean [SD]=65.3 [17.0]; compared to [SD]=75.8 [11.9], p<0.001). Within the pandemic data, subjective wellbeing was lower in parents with low education, language other-than-English, receiving income assistance (i.e., a government benefit), single parents, and young parents. Subjective wellbeing was also lower in fathers, parents raising a child with a neurodevelopmental condition, parents with physical or mental health problems, and parents reporting COVID-related stressors, such as employment changes, financial strain, negative feelings/attributions about COVID-19, and supervising children while working-from-home. Unexpectedly, parent engagement with news media about the pandemic was associated with higher subjective wellbeing. Conclusion: Subjective wellbeing in parents raising children aged 0-18 years appears to be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social restrictions in Australia. Specific at-risk groups, for which government intervention may be warranted, include parents in socially disadvantaged contexts, parents with pre-existing mental health difficulties, and parents facing significant COVID-19 related work changes.","Elizabeth Westrupp et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B8-78B-514","20201027","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; subjective wellbeing; future security; families; achieving in life; covid-19 pandemic; community-connectedness; personal health; personal safety; standard of living; personal relationships; australia; parent","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6515,""
"Why Identifying Households by Degree of Food Insecurity Matters for Policymaking","Experience-based household food insecurity (HFI) indicators can be used to rank households across the continuum of levels of severity of HFI. However, studies have not closely examined if there is value for policymakers to receive information on all or just some of the HFI levels. We examined peer reviewed and gray literature reports to answer this question. Reporting on different HFI levels is key for targeting and evaluating policies and programs. In addition, there are dose-response or curvilinear relationships between HFI levels and diverse physical and mental health outcomes, and early childhood development indicators. The process of introduction of HFI experience-based measures in Latin America improved the understanding of the meaning of different HFI levels among policymakers, media and population at large. Findings strongly suggest that HFI can only be properly understood and addressed by assessing and reporting on all levels of HFI at the local, provincial, national, regional and global levels. Tracking and reporting secular trends of different HFI levels is key during major economic shocks and public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rafael PÃ©rez-Escamilla et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46099-6F2-13A","20201027","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy; evidence-based decision making; food systems governance; household food insecurity; food policy; measurement","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-28","",6516,""
