"Optimal mobility restriction minimizing COVID-19 and excess suicide deaths in Japan","Background: Strict countermeasures for COVID-19 outbreak such as lockdowns and voluntary restrictions against going out might have reduced mortality because of COVID-19 directly, but might have raised suicide rates. Object: We examined best policies for minimizing overall mortality attributable to COVID-19 directly, and excess mortality by suicide because of COVID-19. Method: We regressed the estimated excess mortality attributable to suicide deaths against mobility-restrictive measures. Mortality attributable to COVID-19 directly was estimated through association between the effective reproduction number and mobility. We sought the best mobility restriction for minimizing overall deaths. Results: Significant association was found between mobility and suicide, but the data were very few. Results showed the best mobility level as 65.5, which represents a 34.5% reduction in mobility from the normal level. Discussion and Conclusion: An overly restrictive policy inducing lower than optimal mobility led to higher total mortality.","Junko Kurita; Tamie Sugawara; Yoshiyuki Sugishita; Yasushi Ohkusa","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252644","20210302","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11387,""
"Employees' mental wellbeing, organizational outcome and innovative practices during covid-19","This study is conducted to analyze mental wellbeing of employees' and its organizational outcome during COVID-19  Due to this global pandemic, the Nation's economy has declined and hence many organizations decided to cut down the cost by lowering the salary package and to terminate few employees  Organization shifted to remote working but this caused a negative impact on employees' mental health  Employees are stressed due to workload, lack of communication, work life balance, insecurity of job, anxiety and other reasons during COVID-19  The dependent factor called organizational outcome is influenced by the factors namely employee wellbeing, virtual communication, organizational support and social media  The researcher circulated questionnaires among Information technology (IT) industry employees  The sample size of the study is 90  Various analytical tools such as frequency analysis, mean analysis, T- Test, ANOVA and Regression for comparing the dependent and independent factor have been analyzed using SPSS software in order to analyze the primary data  From the results, It is inferred that the organisation's support is the most influencing factor  Providing mental wellbeing training and programs, implementing new policies which help in bringing positive impact on employees and their performance which results in effective organization outcome","Gigi, G.

"Portable Sensing Devices for Detection of COVID-19: A Review","The coronavirus pandemic is the most challenging incident that people have faced in recent years  Despite the time-consuming and expensive conventional methods, point-of-care diagnostics have a crucial role in deterrence, timely detection, and intensive care of the disease&#x2019;s progress  Hence, this detrimental health emergency persuaded researchers to accelerate the development of highly-scalable diagnostic devices to control the propagation of the virus even in the least developed countries  The strategies exploited for detecting COVID-19 stem from the already designed systems for studying other maladies, particularly viral infections  The present report reviews not only the novel advances in portable diagnostic devices for recognizing COVID-19, but also the previously existing biosensors for detecting other viruses  It discusses their adaptability for identifying surface proteins, whole viruses, viral genomes, host antibodies, and other biomarkers in biological samples  The prominence of different types of biosensors such as electrochemical, optical, and electrical for detecting low viral loads have been underlined  Thus, it is anticipated that this review will assist scientists who have embarked on a competition to come up with more efficient and marketable in-situ test kits for identifying the infection even in its incubation time without sample pretreatment  Finally, a conclusion is provided to highlight the importance of such an approach for monitoring people to combat the spread of such contagious diseases  IEEE","Sadighbayan, D.; Ghafar-Zadeh, E.","https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2021.3059970","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: IEEE Sensors Journal;2021.; Publication details: IEEE Sensors Journal;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11399,""
"Firms that prosper in all weathers: surviving recessions and plagues","Purpose: Whether they support long-term growth companies, entrepreneurial firms or turnarounds, top teams need to make bold strategic investment choices in times of boom, bust or pandemic  This paper aims to discuss firm strategies, as evidenced by their investment choices, over a 21-year period during which they led firms committed to growth through times of crisis and disruption  Design/methodology/approach: The starting point for this research is Fortune magazineâ€™s 100 Fastest Growing Companies, published in 2018 and updated in 2019  The list is based on the magazineâ€™s ranking of the worldâ€™s top three-year performers in revenues, profits and stock returns for the four quarters preceding publication  Inclusion on the list is all about growth, not starting size (the smallest and not renown)  The classification of firms by industry sector follows Fortuneâ€™s nomenclature  Comparing these firms with industry peers in the same period, the authors look at Fortuneâ€™s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies of 2018 from the vantage point of their financials from 1999 to 2017, years that included the tech boom and bust, the mortgage meltdown and the Great Recession  This period also saw a relatively long expansion which was, paradoxically, punctuated by a trade war with China and recession fears that have impacted spending for growth  Only 32 of Fortuneâ€™s 2018 list made it to Fortuneâ€™s 100 Fastest Growing Companies of 2019  The authors call them the Persistent 32 and examine their investment and performance metrics from 2018 through 2020  Findings: The Persistent 32 â€“ companies that have survived multiple recessions, including the COVID-19 recession, and continue to grow â€“ have lessons to teach, although there is no silver bullet or secret formula, even within the same industry  It was found that in the group of 32, the average company lifespan is 28 75 years and astute, decisive leadership matters  Companies that persist make unique, strategic resource choices  They postpone expenditures on marketing and sales, fixed assets or R&D or all three depending on their needs, rather than fit with industry  They continue to invest in future growth  Their people are not expendable: employee retention during a recession has been a familiar strategy for the top growers covered in this investigation throughout the period (1999â€“2020)  They cut cost of goods and services produced (COGS)  The Persistent 32, loathing the idea of cutting COGS in the face of earlier recessions or recessionary threats, are cutting expenses other than personnel expenditures now  Amazon, Nvidia, Stamps com, Lam Research, Supernus Pharmaceuticals all continue to rein in costs while simultaneously reinvesting in growth  They communicate their concerns and plans to their constituents  These companies retained and grew headcount while communicating their safety program as well as work-from-home and social-distancing strategies to employees, customers, shareholders and elected officials during the COVID-19 recession of 2020  They plan for supply disruptions  All have already articulated their plans for supply disruptions or alternative sources  Both the Federal Government and semiconductor companies are looking to jump-start the development of new chip factories in the USA as concern grows about reliance on Asia as a source of critical technology  They sense, seize, transform  David Teeceâ€™s dynamic capabilities framework is still the best way to turn every black swan event into an opportunity for business based on newly immediate needs  They work remotely  Businesses that are growing despite the recession are already committed to remote work  Join them and take the high anxiety out of work for both employees and customers  Research limitations/implications: The starting point for our research was Fortune magazineâ€™s 100 Fastest Growing Companies, published in 2018 and updated in 2019  The list is based on the magazineâ€™s ranking of the worldâ€™s top three-year performers in revenues, profits and stock returns for the four quarters preceding publicatio   Only 32 of Fortuneâ€™s 2018 list made it to Fortuneâ€™s 100 Fastest Growing Companies of 2019  The authors call them the Persistent 32 and examine their investment and performance metrics from 2018 through 2020  They sought answers to three questions: First, do the fastest growing firms invest heavily in their businesses during recessions? The authors looked at the 100 fastest growing companies from 1999 to 2017 and then the Persistent 32 from 2018 to 2020  Second, what happened to the investments and performance of the Persistent 32 during the pandemic and recession that began in the first quarter of 2020? Where did they invest or curtail investment, what plans did they make around COVID-19 and what headcount decisions did they make? Third, do growth-committed firms follow different investment strategies that can be categorized based on spending patterns? Practical implications: Companies that can survive and grow through the hardest of times have lessons to teach, although there is no silver bullet or secret formula, even within the same industry  Social implications: Employee retention during a recession has been a familiar strategy for the top growers covered in this investigation throughout the period (1999â€“2020)  This strategy is not generally common among US firms  Indeed, it says something about the growth prospects of these firms and their dependence on talent and need to leverage their prior investment in recruiting and training employees  Originality/value: What is important about this topic? Whatever the industry, trying times call for top teams to try harder, identify priorities, spend to achieve them, manage stakeholder expectations and protect and build their access to top talent  The authors can help with the last four: they set up a structure for analyzing firm spending and performance metrics, based on Gulati and others writing for business practitioners;they comb the evidence for spending and performance shifts in good times and bad from 1999 to 2020;they categorize firm strategies by spending patterns versus industry;they examine the findings for insights;and finally, the authors identify key actions that set still growing firms apart  Â© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","Connell, C.

"Understanding temporary reduction in atmospheric pollution and its impacts on coastal aquatic system during COVID-19 lockdown: a case study of South Asia","The strict lockdown measures not only contributed to curbing the spread of COVID-19 infection, but also improved the environmental conditions worldwide  The main goal of the current study was to investigate the co-benefits of COVID-19 lockdown on the atmosphere and aquatic ecological system under restricted anthropogenic activities in South Asia  The remote sensing data (a) NO2 emissions from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), (b) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and (c) chlorophyll (Chl-a) and turbidity data from MODIS-Aqua Level-3 during Janâ€“Oct (2020) were analyzed to assess the changes in air and water pollution compared to the last five years (2015â€“2019)  The interactions between the air and water pollution were also investigated using overland runoff and precipitation in 2019 and 2020 at a monthly scale to investigate the anomalous events, which could affect the N loading to coastal regions  The results revealed a considerable drop in the air and water pollution (30â€“40% reduction in NO2 emissions, 45% in AOD, 50% decline in coastal Chl-a concentration, and 29% decline in turbidity) over South Asia  The rate of reduction in NO2 emissions was found the highest for Lahore (32%), New Delhi (31%), Ahmadabad (29%), Karachi (26%), Hyderabad (24%), and Chennai (17%) during the strict lockdown period from Aprâ€“Jun, 2020  A positive correlation between AOD and NO2 emissions (0 23â€“0 50) implies that a decrease in AOD is attributed to a reduction in NO2  It was observed that during strict lockdown, the turbidity has decreased by 29%, 11%, 16%, and 17% along the coastal regions of Karachi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and Dhaka, respectively, while a 5â€“6% increase in turbidity was seen over the Madras during the same period  The findings stress the importance of reduced N emissions due to halted fossil fuel consumption and their relationships with the reduced air and water pollution  It is concluded that the atmospheric and hydrospheric environment can be improved by implementing smart restrictions on fossil fuel consumption with a minimum effect on socioeconomics in the region  Smart constraints on fossil fuel usage are recommended to control air and water pollution even after the social and economic activities resume business-as-usual scenario  Â© 2021 The Author(s)  Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Shafeeque, M.; Arshad, A.; Elbeltagi, A.; Sarwar, A.; Pham, Q.

"Chronic PTSD and other psychological sequelae in a group of frontline healthcare workers who contracted and survived SARS","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003 was highly concentrated in health care settings and resulted in a high number of health care workers (HCWs) contracting the disease  The SARS epidemic has improved our understanding of how trauma impacts frontline HCWs who serve as first responders during an infectious disease outbreak  However, our insight into the trajectory of frontline HCWs' morbidity posttrauma continues to be limited, as the majority of the previous work has focused on the short-term or immediate impact of SARS on HCWs, with only a few studies dedicated to the evaluation of its long-term or sustained impact  Previous research into the long-term impact of SARS on HCWs spans 1-3 years postoutbreak  The present study extends previous research by examining HCWs up to 7 years postoutbreak  More specifically, frontline HCWs who contracted and survived SARS were evaluated at 1 year (2004), 4 years (2007), and 7 years (2010) postoutbreak by using a within-participants design  Across all three time points, frontline HCWs showed a lack of abatement in clinically significant levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology  In addition, HCWs reported below average and persistent functional outcomes, such as problems with pain, reduced vitality, and reductions in physical, mental, and social functioning  Finally, we report on the particular psychiatric variables from 1 year postoutbreak that are significantly associated with functional debility at 4 and 7 years postoutbreak  Findings of this study underscore the importance of understanding the long-term sequelae of infectious disease outbreaks on frontline HCWs, in order to decrease the likelihood of chronic adverse outcomes in this population  This information is especially relevant now, given the current global outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (French) L'epidemie de syndrome respiratoire aigu severe (SRAS) de 2003 s'est grandement manifestee dans les milieux de soins de sante, et un grand nombre de travailleurs de la sante (TS) ont contracte la maladie  L'epidemie de SRAS a grandement ameliore notre comprehension de l'incidence d'un traumatisme parmi les TS de premiere ligne qui constituent les premiers intervenants durant les eclosions d'une maladie infectieuse  Toutefois, nos connaissances sur la trajectoire de la morbidite post-traumatique parmi les TS de premiere ligne restent limitees, car la majorite des recherches anterieures ont porte sur les effets immediats ou a court terme du SRAS sur les TS;quelques etudes seulement etaient destinees a evaluer son incidence soutenue ou a long terme  Les recherches anterieures sur les effets a long terme du SRAS sur les TS s'etendaient sur 1 a 3 ans post-epidemie  La presente etude pousse plus loin les recherches precedentes en examinant les TS jusqu'a 7 ans apres l'epidemie  Plus precisement, les TS de premiere ligne qui ont survecu a une infection au SRAS ont ete evalues a 1 an (2004), a 4 ans (2007) et a 7 ans (2010) apres l'epidemie dans le cadre d'une etude de conception intrasujet  Aux trois points, on a constate chez les TS de premiere ligne un manque de reduction des symptomes de depression, d'anxiete et du trouble de stress post-traumatique (TSPT) de niveaux cliniquement significatifs  De plus, les TS ont rapporte des resultats fonctionnels inferieurs a la moyenne et persistants, tels que de la douleur, une vitalite diminuee et une diminution du fonctionnement physique, mental et social  Finalement, nous rapportons des variables psychiatriques particulieres depuis l'annee 1 post-epidemie, qui sont significativement associees a une souffrance fonctionnelle aux annees 4 et 7 post-epidemie  Les resultats de cette etude soulignent l'importance de comprendre les sequelles a long terme des eclosions de maladies infectieuses parmi les TS, afin de reduire les probabilites de problemes chroniques parmi cette population  Cette information est particulierement pertinente aujourd'hui etant donne la pandemie de coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Public Significance Statement-The present study is one of a few studies that has thus far examined the long-term impact of an infectious disease outbreak on frontline healthcare workers  A group of Canadian frontline healthcare workers who contracted and survived SARS were evaluated at 1 year (2004), 4 years (2007), and 7 years (2010) postoutbreak  Across all three time points, frontline healthcare workers reported clinically significant levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptomatology, in addition to adverse functional outcomes  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Moallef, Parvaneh, Lueke, Niloufar A.;

"Thirty-day suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the spanish adult general population during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 pandemic","Aims: To investigate the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB;i e , suicidal ideation, plans or attempts) in the Spanish adult general population during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 pandemic (March-July, 2020), and to investigate the individual- and population-level impact of relevant distal and proximal STB risk factor domains  Methods: Cross-sectional study design using data from the baseline assessment of an observational cohort study (MIND/COVID project)  A nationally representative sample of 3,500 non-institutionalized Spanish adults (51 5% female;mean age=49 6 [SD = 17 0]) was taken using dual-frame random digit dialing, stratified for age, sex, and geographical area  Professional interviewers carried out computer-assisted telephone interviews (June 1-30, 2020)  Thirty-day STB was assessed using modified items from the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  Distal (i e , pre-pandemic) risk factors included sociodemographic variables, number of physical health conditions, and pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders;proximal (i e , pandemic) risk factors included current mental disorders and a range of adverse events-experiences related to the pandemic  Logistic regression was used to investigate individual-level associations (odds ratios [OR]) and population-level associations (population attributable risk proportions [PARP]) between risk factors and thirty-day STB  All data were weighted using post-stratification survey weights  Results: Estimated prevalence of thirty-day STB was 4 5% (1 8% active suicidal ideation;n=5 [0 1%] suicide attempts)  STB was 9 7% among the 34 3% of respondents with pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders, and 1 8% among the 65 7% without any pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorder  Factors significantly associated with STB were pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders (total PARP=49 1%) and current mental disorders (total PARP=58 4%), i e , Major Depressive Disorder (OR=6 0;PARP=39 2%), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (OR=5 6;PARP=36 3%), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (OR=4 6;PARP=26 6%), Panic Attacks (OR=6 7;PARP=36 6%), and Alcohol/Substance Use Disorder (OR=3 3;PARP=5 9%)  Pandemic-related adverse events-experiences associated with STB were lack of social support, interpersonal stress, stress about personal health and about the health of loved ones (PARPs 32 7-42 6%%), and having loved ones infected with COVID-19 (OR=1 7;PARP=18 8%)  Up to 74 1% of STB is potentially attributable to the joint effects of mental disorders and adverse events-experiences related to the pandemic  Conclusions: STB at the end of the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 pandemic was high, and large proportions of STB are potentially attributable to mental disorders and adverse events-experiences related to the pandemic, including health-related stress, lack of social support and interpersonal stress  There is an urgent need to allocate resources to increase access to adequate mental healthcare, even in times of healthcare system overload  Â© 2021 CSIRO  All rights reserved","Mortier, P.; Vilagut, G.; Ferrer, M.; Alayo, I.; Bruffaerts, R.; CristÃ³bal-NarvÃ¡ez, P.; Del Cura-GonzÃ¡lez, I.; DomÃ¨nech-Abella, J.; Nobrega, M.

"Effect of COVID-19 confinement on the mental status of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus; Efecto del confinamiento por COVID-19 en el estado mental de pacientes con lupus eritematoso sistÃ©mico","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are more vulnerable to higher levels of stress and psychopathological symptoms than the general healthy population. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. PATIENTS AND METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n=276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n=152). RESULTS: The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (P<.0001), depression (P&#8804;.05), anxiety (P&#8804;.05), phobic anxiety (P<.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (P&#8804;.043), and psychoticism (P&#8804;.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. CONCLUSIONS: The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings show their vulnerability to a public health alert and indicate the need to carry out a psychological approach to these patients while the state of health emergency lasts as well as to possible outbreaks of the virus.","Santos-Ruiz, Ana; Montero-LÃ³pez, Eva; Ortego-Centeno, Norberto; Peralta-RamÃ­rez, MarÃ­a Isabel","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.12.004","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Med Clin (Barc);2021 Jan 29.; Publication details: Med Clin (Barc);2021 Jan 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11427,""
"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on critical care healthcare workers' depression, anxiety, and stress levels","AIM: The aim of the study was to determine levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and factors associated with psychological burden amongst critical care healthcare workers in the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019Â pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous Web-based survey distributed in April 2020. All healthcare workers employed in a critical care setting were eligible to participate. Invitations to the survey were distributed through Australian and New Zealand critical care societies and social media platforms. The primary outcome was the proportion of healthcare workers who reported moderate to extremely severe scores on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). RESULTS: Of the 3770 complete responses, 3039 (80.6%) were from Australia. A total of 2871 respondents (76.2%) were women; the median age was 41 years. Nurses made up 2269 (60.2%) of respondents, with most (2029 [53.8%]) working in intensive care units. Overall, 813 (21.6%) respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, 1078 (28.6%) reported moderate to extremely severe anxiety, and 1057 (28.0%) reported moderate to extremely severe stress scores. MeanÂ Â±Â standard deviation values of DASS-21 depression, anxiety, and stress scores amongst woman vs men was as follows: 8.0Â Â±Â 8.2 vs 7.1Â Â±Â 8.2 (pÂ =Â 0.003), 7.2Â Â±Â 7.5 vs 5.0Â Â±Â 6.7 (pÂ <Â 0.001), and 14.4Â Â±Â 9.6 vs 12.5Â Â±Â 9.4 (pÂ <Â 0.001), respectively. After adjusting for significant confounders, clinical concerns associated with higher DASS-21 scores includedÂ not being clinically prepared (ÃŸ = 4.2, pÂ <Â 0.001), an inadequate workforce (ÃŸ = 2.4, pÂ =Â 0.001), having to triage patients owing to lack of beds and/or equipment (ÃŸÂ = 2.6, pÂ =Â 0.001), virus transmission to friends and family (ÃŸÂ = 2.1, pÂ =Â 0.009), contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (ÃŸÂ = 2.8, pÂ =Â 0.011), being responsible for other staff members (ÃŸÂ = 3.1, pÂ <Â 0.001), and being asked to work in an area that was not in the respondents' expertise (ÃŸÂ = 5.7, pÂ <Â 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this survey of critical care healthcare workers, between 22 and 29% of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, with women reporting higher scores than men. Although female gender appears to play a role, modifiable factors also contribute to psychological burden and should be studied further.","Hammond, Naomi E; Crowe, Liz; Abbenbroek, Brett; Elliott, Rosalind; Tian, David H; Donaldson, Lachlan H; Fitzgerald, Emily; Flower, Oliver; Grattan, Sarah; Harris, Roger; Sayers, Louise; Delaney, Anthony","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.12.004","","Country: AU; AUSTRÃLIA; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Aust Crit Care;2020 Dec 26.; Publication details: Aust Crit Care;2020 Dec 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11428,""

Burnout-associated suicide amongst physicians represents a real &quot;public health crisis.&quot; This article discusses the drivers of burnout and offers some strategies to mitigate burnout and improve well-being. Measures of burnout such as stress, micro, and macro-aggression in the workplace have a psychological impact on staff. Additionally, a measurable economic price is exacted when an organization fails to address the lack of well-being burnout represents. As healthcare providers struggle to survive and deal with the complex new set of problems and obstacles that the COVID-19 pandemic, the National economic crisis, and the increasing regulatory obligations have summoned forth, professional burnout rates have risen drastically. With good leadership, developing comprehensive programs to identify, track, and treat burnout symptoms and improve well-being in the work environment can result in greater work satisfaction and save resources.","Janosy, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACO.0000000000000969","20210302","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11430,""
"Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers associated with lower risk of COVID-19 in household contacts","Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) has been hypothesized to affect COVID-19 risk. To examine the association between use of ACEI/ARB and household transmission of COVID-19. We conducted a modified cohort study of household contacts of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 4 and May 17, 2020 in a large Northeast US health system. Household members were identified by geocoding and full address matching with exclusion of addresses with &gt;10 matched residents or known congregate living functions. Medication use, clinical conditions and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained from electronic medical record (EMR) data on cohort entry. Cohort members were followed for at least one month after exposure to determine who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Mixed effects logistic regression and propensity score analyses were used to assess adjusted associations between medication use and testing positive. 1,499 of the 9,101 household contacts were taking an ACEI or an ARB. Probability of COVID-19 diagnosis during the study period was slightly higher among ACEI/ARB users in unadjusted analyses. However, ACEI/ARB users were older and more likely to have clinical comorbidities so that use of ACEI/ARB was associated with a decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 in mixed effect models (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.81) or propensity score analyses (predicted probability 18.6% in ACEI/ARB users vs. 24.5% in non-users, p = 0.03). These associations were similar within age and comorbidity subgroups, including patients with documented hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, as well as when including other medications in the models. In this observational study of household transmission, use of ACEIs or ARBs was associated with a decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. While causality cannot be inferred from these observational data, our results support current recommendations to continue ACEI/ARB in individuals at risk of COVID-19 exposure.","Armstrong, Soltoff, Rieu-Werden, Metlay, Haas","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247548","20210302","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11431,""
"Feasibility and Initial Outcomes of a Group-Based Teletherapy Psychiatric Day Program for Adults with Serious Mental Illness: An Open, Non-Randomized Trial in the Context of COVID-19","In the context of COVID-19, many behavioral health services transitioned to teletherapy to continue delivering care for patients with mental illness. Studies that evaluate the outcome of this rapid teletherapy adoption and implementation are pertinent. This single-arm, non-randomized pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and initial patient-level outcomes of a psychiatric transitional day program that switched from an in-person to a video teletherapy group during COVID-19. Patients with transdiagnostic conditions who were at risk of psychiatric hospitalization were referred to the Adult Transitions Program (ATP) at a large academic medical center in the United States. ATP was a 3-week intensive outpatient program that implemented group teletherapy guided by cognitive and behavioral principles delivered daily for 3 hours per day. Feasibility was assessed via retention, attendance rate, and rate of securing aftercare appointments prior to ATP discharge. Patients completed standardized patient-reported outcome measures at admission and discharge to assess program effectiveness for improving quality of mental health, depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. Patients (N = 76) started the program between March to August of 2020. Feasibility was established with 70 (92.1%) completing the program, mean attendance of 14.43 (SD = 1.22) days, and 71 (94.7%) had at least one behavioral health aftercare service scheduled prior to ATP discharge. All patient-level reported outcomes demonstrated significant improvement on depression (95% Cl: -3.6 to -6.2; Cohen's d = 0.77; P&lt;.001), anxiety (95% Cl: -3.0 to -4.9; Cohen's d = 0.74; P&lt;.001), overall suicide risk (95% Cl: -0.5 to-0.1; Cohen's d =0.41; P=.019), wish to live (95% Cl: 0.3 to 1.0; Cohen's d = 0.39; P &lt;.001), wish to die (95% Cl: -0.2 to-1.4; Cohen's d = 0.52; P=.011), and overall mental health (95% Cl: 1.5 to 4.5; Cohen's d = 0.39; P&lt;.001) from admission to discharge.

"Discrimination and Stress Among Asian Refugee Populations During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Bhutanese and Burmese Refugees in the USA","To measure COVID-19 pandemic-related discrimination and stress among Bhutanese and Burmese refugees in the USA and to identify characteristics associated with these two measures. From 5/15-6/1/2020, Bhutanese and Burmese refugee community leaders were invited to complete an anonymous, online survey and shared the link with other community members who were English-proficient, Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years old, and currently living in the USA. We identified characteristics associated with pandemic-related discrimination and stress applying ordinal logistic regression models. Among 218 refugees from 23 states, nearly one third of participants reported experiencing at least one type of discrimination, and more than two-thirds experienced at least one type of pandemic-related stress. Having had COVID-19, having a family member with COVID-19, and being an essential worker were associated with discrimination. Discrimination, financial crisis, and female gender were associated with stress. Reducing pandemic-related discrimination should remain a priority, as should the promotion of social support and coping strategies. Noting that this is a nonrepresentative sample, we recommend that larger national studies tracking experiences with pandemic-related discrimination and stress include Asian American subgroups with limited English proficiency.","Zhang, Gurung, Anglewicz, Baniya, Yun","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-00992-y","20210302","Asian Americans; Bhutanese and Burmese refugees; COVID-19 pandemic; Discrimination; Mental health; Racism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11435,""
"Assessment of a Hotel-Based COVID-19 Isolation and Quarantine Strategy for Persons Experiencing Homelessness","Several jurisdictions in the United States have secured hotels to temporarily house people experiencing homelessness who require isolation or quarantine for confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To our knowledge, little is known about how these programs serve this vulnerable population outside the hospital setting. To assess the safety of a hotel-based isolation and quarantine (I/Q) care system and its association with inpatient hospital capacity. This retrospective cohort study of a hotel-based I/Q care system for homeless and unstably housed individuals in San Francisco, California, was conducted from March 19 to May 31, 2020. Individuals unable to safely isolate or quarantine at home with mild to moderate COVID-19, persons under investigation, or close contacts were referred from hospitals, outpatient settings, and public health surveillance to 5 I/Q hotels. Of 1009 I/Q hotel guests, 346 were transferred from a large county public hospital serving patients experiencing homelessness. A physician-supervised team of nurses and health workers provided around-the-clock support, including symptom monitoring, wellness checks, meals, harm-reduction services, and medications for opioid use disorder. Characteristics of I/Q hotel guests, program retention, county hospital readmissions, and mean length of stay. Overall, the 1009 I/Q hotel guests had a median age of 44 years (interquartile range, 33-55 years), 756 (75%) were men, 454 (45%) were Latinx, and 501 (50%) were persons experiencing sheltered (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°295) or unsheltered (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°206) homelessness. Overall, 463 (46%) received a diagnosis of COVID-19; 303 of 907 (33%) had comorbid medical disorders, 225 of 907 (25%) had comorbid mental health disorders, and 236 of 907 (26%) had comorbid substance use disorders. A total of 776 of 955 guests (81%) completed their I/Q hotel stay; factors most strongly associated with premature discontinuation were unsheltered homelessness (adjusted odds ratio, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.6; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and quarantine status (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In total, 346 of 549 patients (63%) were transferred from the county hospital; of 113 ineligible referrals, 48 patients (42%) had behavioral health needs exceeding I/Q hotel capabilities. Thirteen of the 346 patients transferred from the county hospital (4%) were readmitted for worsening COVID-19. Overall, direct transfers to I/Q hotels from emergency and outpatient departments were associated with averting many hospital admissions. There was a nonsignificant decrease in the mean hospital length of stay for inpatients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from 5.5 to 2.7 days from March to May 2020 (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.11). To support persons experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic, San Francisco rapidly and safely scaled a hotel-based model of I/Q that was associated with reduced strain on inpatient capacity. Strategies to improve guest retention and address behavioral health needs not met in hotel settings are intervention priorities.","Fuchs, Carter, Evans, Graham-Squire, Imbert, Bloome, Fann, Skotnes, Sears, Pfeifer-Rosenblum, Moughamian, Eveland, Reed, Borne, Lee, Rosenthal, Jain, Bobba, Kushel, Kanzaria","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.0490","20210302","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11436,""
"Digital Interventions to Support Population Mental Health in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Rapid Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a number of negative health related consequences, including impacts on mental health. More than 22% of Canadians reported that they had felt depressed in the last week, in response to a December 2020 national survey. Given the need to physically distance during the pandemic, and the increase in demand for mental health services, digital interventions that support mental health and wellness may be beneficial. The purpose of this research was to identify digital interventions that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to identify (1) the populations these interventions were developed for, inclusive of exploring areas of equity such as socioeconomic status, sex/gender, race/ethnicity and culture, and relevance to Indigenous peoples and communities; (2) the effect of the interventions; and (3) any barriers or facilitators to the use of the intervention. This study was completed using a Cochrane Rapid Review methodology. A search of Embase, PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science, along with Google, Million Short, and popular mobile app libraries, was conducted. Two screeners were involved in applying inclusion criteria using Covidence software. Academic articles and mobile apps identified were screened using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields resource, the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Framework, and the Mental Health Commission of Canada's guidance on app assessment and selection. A total of 31 mobile apps and 114 web-based resources (eg, telemedicine, virtual peer support groups, discussion forums, etc) that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian population during the pandemic were identified. These resources have been listed on a publicly available website along with search tags that may help an individual make a suitable selection. Variability exists in the populations that the interventions were developed for, and little assessment has been done with regard to areas of equity. The effect of the interventions was not reported for all those identified in this synthesis; however, for those that did report the effect, it was shown that they were effective in the context that they were used. A number of barriers and facilitators to using these interventions were identified, such as access, cost, and connectivity. A number of digital interventions that could support population mental health in Canada during the global COVID-19 pandemic were identified, indicating that individuals have several options to choose from. These interventions vary in their purpose, approach, design, cost, and targeted user group. While some research and digital interventions addressed equity-related considerations, more research and focused attention should be given to this area.","Strudwick, Sockalingam, Kassam, Sequeira, Bonato, Youssef, Mehta, Green, Agic, Soklaridis, Impey, Wiljer, Crawford","https://doi.org/10.2196/26550","20210302","COVID-19; digital health; eHealth; informatics; mental health; mobile apps; pandemic; population health; psychiatry; public health; telemedicine; virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11437,""
"Early Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Sleep in a Large Spanish Sample","<b>Introduction:</b> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) forced Spain to implement unprecedented lockdown restriction.

"Impact of anxiety, stress and depression related to COVID-19 pandemic on the course of hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency","Hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks can be provoked with psychological factors. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of anxiety, depression and stress related to COVID-19 pandemic on disease activity of HAE patients during the quarantine period (QP) and the return to normal period (RTNP). This study was conducted between March 2020 and September 2020 in four allergy centres. Demographic, clinical features and mental health status were evaluated in QP (from March to the beginning of June) and RTNP (from June to the beginning of September) applied by the government. The 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS10) was used to define the severity of HAE attacks. Depression-Anxiety- Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Fear of COVID-19 (FC-19) scales were performed to assess mental health status. 139 HAE patients were included in the study. In QP, median attack numbers and median VAS10 scores were 5 (min-max: 0-45) and 6 (min-max: 0-10), respectively. HAE attack numbers, DASS-21 stress, anxiety, depression and total DASS-21 scores, as well as FC-19 scores were higher in QP than RTNP (p=0.001, p&lt;0.001, p=0.001, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, respectively). However, there was no difference in attack severity scores between the two periods (p&gt;0.05).

Internationally established instruments for measuring health-related quality of life and mental health (including anxiety and depressive symptoms) were administered to nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1586 parents with 7Ã¢â‚¬â€˜ to 17-year-old children and adolescents, of whom nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1040 11- to 17-year-olds also provided self-reports, from 26 May to 10 June 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and bivariate tests. Seventy-one percent of the children and adolescents and 75% of the parents felt burdened by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the time before the pandemic, the children and adolescents reported aÃ‚Â lower health-related quality of life, the percentage of children and adolescents with mental health problems almost doubled, and their health behavior worsened. Socially disadvantaged children felt particularly burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two-thirds of the parents would like to receive support in coping with their child during the pandemic.

"Rethinking Strategies and Programs to Improve Physical and Emotional Well-being Among Healthcare Professionals: Facing the New Normalcy","With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a different perspective on the future of humanity has emerged that emphasizes the importance of building the capacities of healthcare providers in order to assist them with the heavy burden that these changes have placed on them both now and in the future. A reduction in the quality of life and the presence of prolonged fatigue are some of the most imminent problems that emerge among these professionals. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a holistic intervention (workshop) for health science students aimed at developing skills that will enable them to obtain a better self-assessment of their quality of life, and prolonged fatigue. Pre- and post-measures of quality of life, and prolonged fatigue were obtained from 130 health science students, including a group of 96 attendees (cases) of a 4-h wellness workshop and 34 students who did not attend (controls). Paired <i>t</i> tests indicated a significant improvement in nearly all dimensions related to quality of life, and prolonged fatigue in the case group who attended the workshop. A comprehensive wellness strategy that utilizes a holistic approach can play an important role in improving and promoting essential skills to improve healthcare provider's self-assessment about the quality of life and reduce their prolonged fatigue. The critical importance of these needs has long been recognized, and this will also be crucial for addressing new challenges and emerging realities.","GÃƒÂ³mez, Lamas, Ramirez-Martinez, Blunk, Leiner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40670-021-01214-0","20210302","Burnout; Depression; Healthcare personnel; Indivisible Self; Wellness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11441,""

Operating under the Northern Virginia Emergency Medical Services Council, Ashes2Art provides art supplies, art classes, and a creative community of support to mitigate the deleterious effects the stress of the job can take on fire fighters and first responders' health and mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ashes2Art has seen an increased demand for art supplies and the, now online, creative arts classes and self-care strategies. Currently, approximately 100 emergency services personnel and family members are actively participating in these initiatives during this crisis. Managing the cumulative emotional load these first responders and their families experience is paramount to COVID-19 recovery efforts and post-pandemic operations. Helping first responders and their families manage the short- and long-term emotional toll from the work they do in responding to the COVID-19 crisis is paramount to the United States' successful recovery back to a well-functioning post-pandemic society.

"Evaluation of myocardial injury patterns and ST changes among critical and non-critical patients with coronavirus-19 disease","Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a major public health crisis globally. Currently, myocardial damage is speculated to be associated with COVID-19, which can be seen as one of the main causes of death of patients with COVID-19. We therefore, aim to investigate the effects of COVID-19 disease on myocardial injury in hospitalized patients who have been tested positive for COVID-19 pneumonia in this study. A prospective study was conducted among 201 patients with COVID-19 in the Pakistan Military Hospital from April 1 to August 31, 2020, including non-critical cases and critical cases. COVID-19 patients were stratified as critical and non-critical according to the signs and symptoms severity; with those requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation as critical, and those did not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation as non-critical. A total of 201 COVID-19 patients with critical and non-critical categories presented with myocardial injury. All patients with myocardial injury had an elevation in CKMB and Troponin-I levels. Of these patients, 43.7% presented with new electrocardiography (ECG) changes, and ST depression was typically observed in 36.3% patients. In addition, 18.7% patients presented with abnormal echocardiography findings, with right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction commonly seen among critical group patients. Results analyzed by a logistic regression model showing COVID-19 direct contribution to myocardial injury in these patients.

"An internet-based self-help intervention for people with psychological distress due to COVID-19: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has reached pandemic status and is affecting countries all over the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by various stressors that require adjustment in everyday life and possibly changes in personal future prospects. While some individuals cope well with these challenges, some develop psychological distress including depressive symptoms, anxiety, or stress. Internet-based self-help interventions have proven to be effective in the treatment of various mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Based on that, we developed an internet-based self-help program for individuals with psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The 3-week self-help program consists of 6 modules comprising texts, videos, figures, and exercises. Participants can request guidance within the self-help program (guidance on demand). The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the self-help program compared to a waiting control condition. The design is a parallel group randomized controlled trial. Participants are allocated to a 3-week self-help intervention plus care as usual or a 3-week waiting period with only care as usual. There are follow-ups after 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks and 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. At least 80 participants with COVID-19 pandemic related psychological distress will be recruited. Primary outcome are depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes include anxiety and chronic stress, suicidal experiences and behavior, health-related quality of life, generalized optimism and pessimism, embitterment, optimistic self-beliefs, emotion regulation skills, loneliness, resilience, and the satisfaction with and usability of the self-help program. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies investigating the efficacy of an internet-based self-help program for psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the results of this study may give further insight into the use of internet-based self-help programs in pandemic-related psychological distress. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04380909 .

"Sexual function, mental health, and quality of life under strain of COVID-19 pandemic in Iranian pregnant and lactating women: a comparative cross-sectional study","The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of pregnant and lactating women is unclear. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health, sexual function, and quality of life (QoL) in Iranian pregnant and lactating women and compare the results with non-pregnant/non-lactating women. This comparative cross-sectional study was carried out on pregnant and lactating women, with non-pregnant/non-lactating women from May to Jun 2020. Patients were asked to complete three questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). One-way ANOVA was used to reveal the statistical differences between the three groups. The mean age of patients was 20.81Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.92Ã‚Â years old. The mean (SD) score of HADS in pregnant, lactating and non-pregnant / non-lactating women were 12.11 (6.72), 11.98 (8.44) and 9.38 (6.2) respectively, and the results showed that the scores in pregnant, lactating women were higher than non-pregnant / non-lactating women (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Also the mean (SD) score of QOL and FSFI was 68.29 (9.47), 74.18 (12.65), 79.03 (10.48) and 22.71 (8.16), 22.72 (8.16), 26.19 (3.93) in three groups and the scores in pregnant, lactating women were lower than non-pregnant/non-lactating women (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The COVID-19 epidemic increases the risk of depression, anxiety, FSD, and lowers QoL in pregnant and lactating women, with the general population. This suggests the urgent need for psychological intervention in the maternal population during the epidemic.","Mirzaei, Jahanian Sadatmahalleh, Bahri Khomami, Moini, Kazemnejad","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-021-01720-0","20210302","COVID-19; Lactating women; Pregnant women; Quality of life; Sexual function","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11446,""
"Reduced level of physical activity during COVID-19 pandemic is associated with depression and anxiety levels: an internet-based survey","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a strong negative impact on economic and social life worldwide. It has also negatively influenced people's general health and quality of life. The aim of the present study was to study the impact of social distancing on physical activity level, and the association between mood state (depression and anxiety level) or sex with actual physical activity levels, the change in physical activity caused by social distancing period, the adhesion level to social distancing, the adoption time of social distancing, family income and age. A self-administered questionnaire with personal, quarantine, physical activity, and mood state disorders information's was answered by 2140 Brazilians of both sex who were recruited through online advertising. The physical activity level adopted during the period of social distancing (3.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.8) was lower than that the adopted prior to the pandemic period (2.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.1, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Thirty percent of the participants presented symptoms of moderate/severe depression and 23.3% displayed moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. A greater presence of symptoms related to anxiety and depression were associated with low physical activity levels, low family monthly income, and younger age. A higher percentage of men who had no mood disorders was observed among those who were very active than among those less active. The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on physical activity. Those who reduced their level of physical activity had the highest levels of mood disorders. Therefore, physical activity programs should be encouraged, while respecting the necessary social distancing to prevent the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.","Puccinelli, da Costa, Seffrin, de Lira, Vancini, Nikolaidis, Knechtle, Rosemann, Hill, Andrade","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10470-z","20210302","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mood state; Pandemic; Physical exercise; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11447,""
"Stressors, coping, and resources needed during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of perinatal women","Psychological stress and coping experienced during pregnancy can have important effects on maternal and infant health, which can also vary by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Therefore, we assessed stressors, coping behaviors, and resources needed in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of 162 perinatal (125 pregnant and 37 postpartum) women in the United States. A mixed-methods study captured quantitative responses regarding stressors and coping, along with qualitative responses to open-ended questions regarding stress and resources needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze differences between pregnant and postpartum participants, as well as differences across key demographic variables. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze open-ended questions. During the COVID-pandemic, food scarcity and shelter-in-place restrictions made it difficult for pregnant women to find healthy foods. Participants also reported missing prenatal appointments, though many reported using telemedicine to obtain these services. Financial issues were prevalent in our sample and participants had difficulty obtaining childcare. After controlling for demographic variables, pregnant women were less likely to engage in healthy stress-coping behaviors than postpartum women. Lastly, we were able to detect signals of increased stressors induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and less social support, in perinatal women of racial and ethnic minority, and lower-income status. Qualitative results support our survey findings as participants expressed concerns about their baby contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital, significant others missing the delivery or key obstetric appointments, and wanting support from friends, family, and birthing classes. Financial resources, COVID-19 information and research as it relates to maternal-infant health outcomes, access to safe healthcare, and access to baby supplies (formula, diapers, etc.) emerged as the primary resources needed by participants. To better support perinatal women's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers should engage in conversations regarding access to resources needed to care for newborns, refer patients to counseling services (which can be delivered online/via telephone) and virtual support groups, and consistently screen pregnant women for stressors.","Barbosa-Leiker, Smith, Crespi, Brooks, Burduli, Ranjo, Carty, Hebert, Waters, Gartstein","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-03665-0","20210302","COVID-19; Coping; Health disparities; Parenting; Perinatal; Postpartum; Pregnancy; Social support; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11448,""
"Physical activity, resilience, emotions, moods, and weight control of older adults during the COVID-19 global crisis","The main purpose of the research was to examine the differences between adults in the age group 70+ and two other age groups (45-59 and 60-69), concerning their healthy and active lifestyle. The death toll of the current COVID-19 pandemic is strongly biased toward the elderly. However, some studies of crises suggest that older adults tend to perceive events as less stressful than do younger people. Therefore, we examined healthy behavior in populations at risk according to the age cutoff-points used by the Ministry of Health at the time of vaccination, and divided the participants into three age groups (45-59, 60-69, and 70+) following health organizations' recommendations. Participants were 1202 people, 381 males and 821 females, aged 45-90. A survey comprised of six parts was used: Demographic background, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short version, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - PANAS, the Connor and Davidson Resilience Scale, a questionnaire for measuring depressive moods, and questions regarding weight change, based on the Israeli National Health and Nutrition (MABAT) survey. Data were collected in Israel during the first complete lockdown. The questionnaire was distributed via e-mail, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook using a snowball sampling method. Resilience and negative feelings and depression symptoms were higher in age group 45-59 compared to 70+ year-old participants, and the depression symptoms score was also higher among participants aged 45-59 compared to ages 60-69. Physical activity was associated with higher resilience, fewer depression symptoms, and fewer negative emotions. Regarding gender and psychological variables, no differences were found. During the time of lockdown, weight change was not prevalent and sleeping hours increased. In adults at 70+, the physical activity level, physical activity before and during the lockdown, emotions, sleeping hours, and weight change were similar to the other adult groups that were examined (45-59 and 60-69). However, in the older adults groups (70+ and 60-69), resilience and depression symptoms were lower than in the youngest age group.","Zach, Zeev, Ophir, Eilat-Adar","https://doi.org/10.1186/s11556-021-00258-w","20210302","COVID-19; Depression symptoms; Healthy behavior; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11449,""
"Effects of COVID-19 Public Health Safety Measures on Births in Scotland between March and May 2020","Objective: To combat the wide-spread transmission of COVID-19, many countries, including the United Kingdom, have imposed nationwide lockdowns. Little is known about how these public health safety measures affect pregnant mothers and their offspring. This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 public health safety measures on births in Scotland. Study Design: Cohort Study Methods: Using routinely collected health data on pregnancy and birth in Scotland, this study compares all births (N = 11220) between March and May 2020 to births in the same period in 2018 (N = 12428) to investigate the potential negative effects of public health safety measures introduced in Scotland in spring 2020. Birth outcomes were compared using Mann-Whitney-U tests and chi-square tests. Results: Mothers giving birth during the pandemic tended to combine breastfeeding and formula-feeding rather than exclusively breastfeed or exclusively formula-feed, stayed in hospital for fewer days and more often had an epidural or a spinal anaesthetic compared to women giving birth in 2018. Conclusion: Overall, results suggest little impact of public health safety measures on birth outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the longer-term impacts of being born in the pandemic on both maternal mental health and child development.","Lydia Gabriela Speyer et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DC-429-6BE","20210302","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; maternal &amp; covid-19; child health; social-distancing","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-03","",11450,""
