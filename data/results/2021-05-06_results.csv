"Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Systematic review","Objective: Identifying the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Systematic review of original studies published in any language. Protocol published in PROSPERO under number CRD42021240543. The search was carried out in the Web of Science, PsycINFO, Pubmed, Embase, LILACS, and SciELO databases, using the descriptors: anxiety, depression, stress, teacher, faculty, COVID-19, and their synonyms. Narrative synthesis was carried out in line with the synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) in systematic reviews. Results: Of the 1,372 records identified, six studies, all cross-sectional, were included in the review. The studies were carried out in China, Brazil, the United States of America, India, and Spain. Five studies included more women than men. The participants were aged from 24 to 60 years. Three studies included only school teachers, two included schools and universities teachers, and one only university teachers. Of the five studies, all dealt with remote activities and only one included teachers who returned to face-to-face classes one to two weeks ago. The prevalence of anxiety ranged from 10% to 49.4%, and depression from 15.9% to 28.9%, being considerably higher in studies with teachers who worked in schools. The prevalence of stress ranged from 12.6% to 50.6%. Conclusions: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress was high among teachers during the pandemic, with great variation between studies. Anxiety and stress were more prevalent in the Spanish study. The results show the need for measures for the care of teachers"" mental health, especially when returning to face-to-face classes. Keywords: anxiety, depression, stress, teachers, COVID-19.","David Franciole de Oliveira Silva; Ricardo Ney Oliveira Cobucci; Severina Carla Vieira Cunh Lima; Fabia Barbosa de Andrade","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.01.21256442","20210505","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13488,""
"Preventing COVID-19 Outbreaks Through Surveillance Testing in Healthcare Facilities - A Modelling Study","Surveillance testing within healthcare facilities provides an opportunity to prevent severe outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the quantitative impact of different available surveillance strategies is not well-understood. Our study adds to the available body of evidence by examining different strategies for their potential to decrease the probability of outbreaks in these facilities. Based on our findings, we propose determinants of successful surveillance measures. To this end, we establish an individual-based model representative of a mental health hospital yielding generalizable results. Attributes and features of this facility were derived from a prototypical hospital, which provides psychiatric, psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic treatment. We estimate the relative reduction of outbreak probability for three test strategies (entry test, once-weekly test and twice-weekly test) relative to a symptom-based baseline strategy. We found that fast diagnostic results and adequate compliance of the clinic population are mandatory for conducting effective surveillance. The robustness of these results towards uncertainties is demonstrated via comprehensive sensitivity analyses. In summary, we robustly quantified the efficacy of different surveillance scenarios and conclude that active testing in mental health hospitals and similar facilities successfully reduces the number of COVID-19 outbreaks.","Tim Litwin; Jens Timmer; Mathias Berger; Andreas Wahl-Kordon; Matthias Mueller; Clemens Kreutz","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.03.21255976","20210505","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13489,""
"Changes in work and health of Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal cohort study","Objectives To determine the long-term effects of work loss on health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether any effects are persistent upon returning to work. Methods A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 2603 participants across Australia monitored changes in health and work during between March and December 2020, with participants completing surveys at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months later. Outcomes described psychological distress, and mental and physical health. Linear mixed regression models examined associations between changes in health and experiences of work loss, and return to work, over time. Results Losing work during the early stages of the pandemic was associated with long-term poorer mental health, which began to recover over time as some returned to work. Physical health deteriorated over time, greater for people not working at baseline. Being out of work was associated with poorer mental health, but better physical health. These effects were larger for people that had recently lost work than for people with sustained work loss, and retaining employment played a protective role. Generally, returning to work resulted in poorer physical health and improvements in mental health, although this depended on the broader context of changes in work. Conclusions Work cessation during the pandemic led to poor health outcomes and had long-lasting effects. Returning to work benefits mental health but may reduce physical activity in the short-term. We encourage the provision of accessible mental health supports and services immediately following loss of work, and for people with prolonged forms of work loss.","Daniel Griffiths; Luke Sheehan; Caryn van Vreden; Dennis Petrie; Peter Whiteford; Malcolm Sim; Alex Collie","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.02.21256492","20210505","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13490,""
"Resilience and Work-Related Stress May Affect Depressive Symptoms in Nursing Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic Era","We aimed to investigate the effect of nursing professionals' resilience on their mental health, work-related stress, and anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an online survey in the Asan Medical Center and Ulsan University Hospital, South Korea. We extracted data of 824 nursing professionals who consented to participate, including demographic variables and the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9), PHQ-9, GAD-7, and Brief Resilience Scale scores. Resilience was negatively correlated with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (rho=-0.23), Generalized Anxiety Scale-7 items (GAD-7) (rho=-0.25), Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidem-ics-6 items (SAVE-6) (rho=-0.15), and Stress And anxiety to Viral Epidemics-3 items (SAVE-3) (rho=-0.13, all, p&lt;0.001). Logistic regression analysis adjusting age, marital status, and years of employment revealed that high level of general anxiety [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.31-1.50], work-related stress during viral epidemics (aOR=1.16, 95% CI=1.03-1.29), and a low level of resilience (aOR=0.91, 95% CI=0.85-0.97) were expecting variables for the depression of healthcare workers. Nursing professionals' level of resilience may be associated with low level of work-related stress and anxiety induced by a viral epidemic. We need to explore further the possibility of resilience as coping strategy of healthcare workers in this pandemic era.","Hong, Lee, Lee, Kim, Cho, Ahn, Shin, Park, Chung","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0019","20210505","COVID-19; Health personnel; Occupational stress; Resilience; SAVE-9","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13491,""
"Prevalence and Risk Factors for Anxiety and Depression in Patients With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Infectious diseases can cause psychological changes in patients. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and related risk factors for anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was performed on patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Sino-French New City branch of Wuhan Tongji Hospital from January to February 2020. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety and Depression Scales were used to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression. Demographic, clinical, and sociological data were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. In the current study, 183 patients were enrolled (mean age = 53 Ã‚Â± 9 years; 41.1% women). The prevalences of anxiety and depression were 56.3% and 39.3%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, female sex, being divorced or widowed, COVID-19 disease duration, renal disease, and depression were identified as independent risk factors for anxiety in patients with COVID-19. Factors that were associated with depression were female sex, being widowed, COVID-19 disease duration, and anxiety. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19 at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China. The identification of demographic, clinical, and social factors may help identify health care professionals to provide psychological care as part of treatment for patients with COVID-19 and other life-threatening infectious diseases.","Li, Sun, Liu, Wang, Zhang, Gong, Duan","https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000934","20210505","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13492,""
"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and related fears and anxiety","Vaccination is crucial to limit the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Therefore, besides the development and supply of vaccines, it is essential that sufficient individuals are willing to get vaccinated, but concerning proportions of populations worldwide show vaccine hesitancy. This makes it important to determine factors that are associated with vaccine acceptance. 1779 adults of a non-probability convenience sample in Germany were assessed with an online survey in a cross-sectional survey period from 1st to 11th January 2021 (a few days after the beginning of vaccinations in Germany). 64.5% of the sample stated that they absolutely would accept the vaccination, 13.8% would rather accept it, 10.4% were undecided, and 5.2% would rather not and 6.0% absolutely not get vaccinated. COVID-19-related anxiety, and fears of infection and health-related consequences correlated significantly positively with vaccine acceptance (all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). In contrast, social (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .006) and economic fears (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001) showed significant negative associations with vaccination willingness. The broader constructs of unspecific anxiety and depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with vaccine acceptance. Vaccine acceptance differed between users/non-users of social media and official websites to gain information about the pandemic (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). COVID-19-related anxiety and health-related fears were associated with higher vaccine acceptance, whereas the fear of social and economic consequences showed the contrary direction. These findings highlight the need to differentiate between several types of fears and anxiety to predict their influence on vaccine acceptance, and provide important information and an essential base for future studies and interventions.","Bendau, Plag, Petzold, StrÃƒÂ¶hle","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107724","20210505","Corona; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccine acceptance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13493,""
"Prevalence and factors associated with psychological burden in COVID-19 patients and their relatives: A prospective observational cohort study","Due to the dramatic measures accompanying isolation and the general uncertainty and fear associated with COVID-19, patients and relatives may be at high risk for adverse psychological outcomes. Until now there has been limited research focusing on the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors in COVID-19 patients and their relatives. The objective of our study was to assess psychological distress in COVID-19 patients and their relatives 30 days after hospital discharge. In this prospective observational cohort study at two Swiss tertiary-care hospitals we included consecutive adult patients hospitalized between March and June 2020 for a proven COVID-19 and their relatives. Psychological distress was defined as symptoms of anxiety and/or depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), i.e., a score of Ã¢â€°Â¥8 on the depression and/or anxiety subscale. We further evaluated symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), defined as a score of Ã¢â€°Â¥1.5 on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Among 126 included patients, 24 (19.1%) had psychological distress and 10 (8.7%) had symptoms of PTSD 30 days after hospital discharge. In multivariate logistic regression analyses three factors were independently associated with psychological distress in patients: resilience (OR 0.82; 95%CI 0.71 to 0.94; p = 0.005), high levels of perceived stress (OR 1.21; 95%CI 1.06 to 1.38; p = 0.006) and low frequency of contact with relatives (OR 7.67; 95%CI 1.42 to 41.58; p = 0.018). The model showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92. Among 153 relatives, 35 (22.9%) showed symptoms of psychological distress, and 3 (2%) of PTSD. For relatives, resilience was negatively associated (OR 0.85; 95%CI 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.007), whereas perceived overall burden caused by COVID-19 was positively associated with psychological distress (OR 1.72; 95%CI 1.31 to 2.25; p&lt;0.001). The overall model also had good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.87. A relevant number of COVID-19 patients as well as their relatives exhibited psychological distress 30 days after hospital discharge. These results might aid in development of strategies to prevent psychological distress in COVID-19 patients and their relatives.","Beck, Vincent, Becker, Keller, Cam, Schaefert, Reinhardt, Sutter, Tisljar, Bassetti, Schuetz, Hunziker","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250590","20210505","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13494,""
"Influence of life intervention on anxiety, depression, and quality of life of COVID-19 patients: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients suffer from anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder due to isolation treatment and other reasons. Whether life interventions can be an alternative therapy for COVID-19 patients, accompanied with anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder, is controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of life interventions on anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder in COVID-19 patients to provide some guidance for clinical application. The randomized controlled trials related to the life intervention and COVID-19 from inception to February 2021 will be searched.

"Engagement and Effectiveness of a Healthy Coping Intervention via Chatbot for university students: proof-of-concept study during the COVID-19 pandemic","University students are increasingly reporting common mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety and depression, and they frequently face barriers to seeking psychological support, because of stigma, cost and availability of mental health services. This issue is even more critical in the challenging time of COVID-19 pandemic. Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via chatbots on mobile devices, offer the potential to achieve scalability of healthy coping interventions by lowering cost and supporting prevention. To conduct a proof-of-concept evaluation measuring the engagement and effectiveness of Atena, a psychoeducational chatbot supporting healthy coping with stress and anxiety, in a university students' population. In a proof-of-concept study, 71 university students, 67.6% female (48/71), attending the first year of university during the Covid-19 pandemic, who were on average 20.6 years old (SD 2.4) were enrolled and asked to use the Atena psychoeducational chatbot for 4 weeks (8 sessions, 2 per week), providing healthy coping strategies based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, positive psychology and mindfulness techniques. The intervention program consisted of conversations combined to audio-video clips delivered by the Atena chatbot. Participants were asked to complete web-based versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) at baseline and post intervention to assess effectiveness. They were asked to complete the User Engagement Scale (UES-short form) at week 2 to assess engagement with the chatbot and to provide qualitative comments on their overall experience with Atena post intervention. Participants engaged with the Atena chatbot an average of 78 (SD 24.8) times over the study period. 61 over 71 participants completed the first 2 weeks of intervention and provided data on engagement (14.1% attrition), while 41 participants completed the full intervention and the post intervention questionnaires (42.26% attrition). Results from the completers analysis showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms for participants in more extreme GAD-7 score ranges (t (39) = 0.94, P = .009) and a decrease in stress symptoms (t (39) = 2.00, P = .05) for all participants post intervention. Participants improved significantly also in the Describing and NonJudging scales scores of FFMQ and asked for some improvements in the user experience with the chatbot. This study shows the benefit of deploying digital healthy coping interventions via chatbots to support university students with higher levels of distress. While findings collected during the COVID-19 pandemic show promise, further research is required to confirm conclusions.","Gabrielli, Rizzi, Bassi, Carbone, Maimone, Marchesoni, Forti","https://doi.org/10.2196/27965","20210505","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13496,""
"Treating from Afar: Mental Health Providers' Challenges and Concerns During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in increasing needs for mental health treatments and yet simultaneously posed great challenges to the delivery of in-person psychological services. The standard clinical practice suddenly shifted to the use of telepsychology. This study aimed to identify how therapists have been responding to the public health crisis and the rapid transition to telepsychology. We distributed a survey to 502 mental health providers to investigate the challenges and concerns of the delivery of clinical work during the pandemic. Our study found that most therapists (75.9%) transitioned to telepsychology without suspension of services. Therapists reported varied concerns regarding telepsychology, clinical practice, and their personal lives. The most common concerns identified were the use of therapeutic techniques in telepsychology, provision of remote services, and the practitioner's own health. Our findings also indicated that therapists who are students, female, sexual minorities, unpartnered, and working in public settings experienced relatively greater concerns. It may imperative to allocate more resources to those subgroups of therapists to facilitate their clinical work in telepsychology. This study contributed to our understanding of how the pandemic has impacted clinical work and may inform practitioners in coping with the current and any future public crises.","Lin, Stone, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2021.1908217","20210505","COVID-19; challenge; concern; crisis; telepsychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13497,""
"Evaluation of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical characteristics and psychological status in internet consultation respondents","COVID-19 is a sudden, infectious disease that can be life-threatening and may cause people to feel panic and anxiety. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and psychological status of a specific population using an internet consultation platform during the outbreak of COVID-19. The questionnaire survey included questions regarding basic information (e.g. area, sex, age, occupation, and education level), clinical characteristics, and cognitive and psychological status concerning COVID-19 from January 31, 2020 to March 31, 2020. There were 277 patients (43.49%) with three or more symptoms, 121 (12.11%) with a clinical questionnaire score Ã¢â€°Â¥8, and 6.81% who lived in Hubei in the previous 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. Of the respondents, 4.9% had contact fever or were confirmed to have COVID-19 in the previous 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. The respondents were mostly aware that COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person and via the respiratory tract, but awareness of general susceptibility and specific symptoms of COVID-19 was low. Multivariate analysis showed that urban residents, clerk/students and higher education groups were well aware of COVID-19. Regarding mental health, the anxiety score of the respondents was 7.12Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.32, and the proportion of anxiety was 54.15%. Younger women were more likely to have anxiety when they experienced positive symptoms. Individuals with a Hubei residence history and those who had contact with an individual with a fever or were confirmed patients in the previous 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°days were more likely to have moderate or severe anxiety. The COVID-19-related knowledge of the respondents was generally good but still could have been improved. Their psychological status was also affected by the pandemic. The internet consultation platform played a positive role in spreading pandemic-related information, providing medical help and psychological counseling, and strengthening early warning to the potential high-risk population.","Ouyang, Wen, Gu, Shen, Song","https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211014696","20210505","COVID-19; anxiety; cognition; internet consultation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13498,""

"Factors affecting Brazilians' self-rated health during the COVID-19 pandemic","This is a cross-sectional study investigating the factors affecting brazilians' self-rated health during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on data from the web-based behavior survey. Carried out from April 24 to May 24, 2020, the survey recruited participants by a chain sampling procedure. Its outcome was the worsening of self-rated health during the pandemic. Statistical analysis was based on a hierarchical model of determination. Logistic regression models were used to test the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, pre-existing health conditions, lifestyle indicators and intensity of social restraint measures, and biological and psychological issues during the pandemic. From the total sample of 45,161 participants, 29.4% reported worsening of health state during this period. After adjusting for hierarchical distal factors, the health problems mostly associated with worsening health state were: bad self-rated health (adjusted OR = 4.35, p &lt; 0.001), health care seeking for mental health problem (adjusted OR = 3.95, p &lt; 0.001), and for COVID-19 (adjusted OR = 3.60, p &lt; 0.001). People who experienced sleep problems, worsening of back pain, depression and at least one flu symptom during the pandemic were twice as likely to report worsening of health status. Sedentary and eating behaviors and adherence to social distancing measures showed significant correlation with the outcome. There exists a relation between social, biological, and psychological factors, mediated by lifestyles and variables pertaining to confinement. Altogether, these factors have negatively affected self-rated health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.","Szwarcwald, Damacena, Barros, Malta, Souza JÃƒÂºnior, Azevedo, Machado, Lima, Romero, Gomes, Werneck, Silva, Gracie, Pina","https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311X00182720","20210505","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13500,""
"Mental Health Status of Canadian Funeral Service Workers at the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic","To describe the mental health situation and job stress levels of Funeral Service Workers (FSW) during the first months of the pandemic.

"Priority Given to Technology in Government-Based Mental Health and Addictions Vision and Strategy Documents: Systematic Policy Review","The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to deliver mental health and addictions (MHA) services is a global priority, especially considering the urgent shift towards virtual delivery of care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to monitor the evolving role of technology in MHA services. Given that MHA policy documents represent the highest level of priorities for a government's vision and strategy for mental health care, one starting point is to measure the frequency with which technology is mentioned and the terms used to describe its use in MHA policy documents (before, during, and after COVID-19). Yet, to our knowledge, no such review of the extent to which ICTs are referred to in Canadian MHA policy documents exists to date. The objective of this systematic policy review was to examine the extent to which technology is addressed in Canadian government-based MHA policy documents prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to establish a baseline for documenting change. We reviewed 22 government-based MHA policy documents, published between 2011 and 2019 by 13 Canadian provinces and territories. We conducted content analysis to synthesize the policy priorities addressed in these documents into key themes, and then systematically searched for and tabulated the use of 39 technology-related keywords (in English and French) to describe and compare jurisdictions. Technology was addressed in every document, however, to a varying degree. Of the 39 searched keywords, we identified 22 categories of keywords pertaining to the use of technology to deliver MHA services and information. The 6 most common categories were tele (n=16/22), phone (n=12/22), tech (n=11/22), online (n=10/22), line (n=10/22), and web (n=10/22), with n being the number of policy documents in which the category was mentioned out of 22 documents. The use of terms referring to advanced technologies, such as virtual (n=6/22) and app (n= 4/22), were less frequent. Additionally, policy documents from some provinces and territories (eg, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador) mentioned a diverse range of ICTs, whereas others described only 1 form of ICT. This review indicates that technology has been given limited strategic attention in Canadian MHA policy. Policy makers may have limited knowledge on the evidence and potential of using technology in this field, highlighting the value for knowledge translation and collaborative initiatives among policy makers and researchers. The development of a pan-Canadian framework for action addressing the integration and coordination of technology in mental health services can also guide initiatives in this field. Our findings provide a prepandemic baseline and replicable methods to monitor how the use of technology-supported services and innovations emerge relative to other priorities in MHA policy during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lal, Siafa, Lee, Adair","https://doi.org/10.2196/25547","20210505","addictions; digital health; digital mental health; e-health; e-mental health; mHealth; mental health; policy; review; technology; tele; virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13502,""
"The hidden stigma of aging and COVID-19: aggravating factors and strategies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in older adults, a text mining analysis","To identify factors associated with mental health of older adults during the pandemic and to provide strategies to mitigate their psychosocial impact in the elderly. An integrative text mining analysis in Medline was performed to identify studies on the mental health of older adults during the pandemic. Subsequently, statistical topic modeling was performed to identify the most prevalent terms and topics discussed in included studies. A total of 29 studies were retrieved until July 1st 2020, including a majority of letters (12 studies) and commentaries (8 studies). The most frequent terms overall were: loneliness (<i>n</i> = 137), support (<i>n</i> = 132), home (<i>n</i> = 102), suicide (<i>n</i> = 96) and help (<i>n</i> = 94). The most prevalent terms were then divided in five topics: home (33%), suicide (32%), apps (15%), loneliness (12%) and physical activity (9%). Additionally, a section focused on low- and middle-income countries was included. A summary of strategies to mitigate the effects of pandemic in mental health of older adults was also provided. These factors demonstrate the importance of developing strategies for psychosocial support that take into consideration the particularities of the elderly.

"Suicidal ideation and thoughts of self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of COVID-19-related stress, social isolation, and financial strain","There are significant concerns about mental health problems occurring due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, there has been limited empirical investigation about thoughts of suicide and self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. A national survey was conducted May 2020 to investigate the association between mental health symptoms, social isolation, and financial stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic and thoughts of suicide and self-harm. A total of 6607 US adults completed an online survey; survey criteria included an age minimum of 22 years old and reported annual gross income of $75,000 or below. Statistical raking procedures were conducted to more precisely weight the sample using US Census data on age, geographic region, sex, race, and ethnicity. COVID-19-related stress symptoms, loneliness, and financial strain were associated with thoughts of suicide/self-harm in multivariable logistic regression analyses, as were younger age, being a military veteran, past homelessness, lifetime severe mental illness, current depressive symptoms, alcohol misuse, and having tested positive for COVID-19. Greater social support was inversely related to thoughts of suicide/self-harm whereas running out of money for basic needs (e.g., food), housing instability (e.g., delaying rent), and filing for unemployment or disability were positively related. Public health interventions to decrease risk of suicide and self-harm in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic should address pandemic-related stress, social isolation, and financial strain experienced including food insecurity, job loss, and risk of eviction/homelessness.","Elbogen, Lanier, Blakey, Wagner, Tsai","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23162","20210505","COVID-19 pandemic; financial strain; social isolation; stress; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13504,""
"Scaling Up Parenting Interventions is Critical for Attaining the Sustainable Development Goals","Of all the potentially modifiable influences affecting children's development and mental health across the life course, none is more important than the quality of parenting and family life. In this position paper, we argue that parenting is fundamentally linked to the development of life skills that children need in order to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We discuss key principles that should inform the development of a global research and implementation agenda related to scaling up evidence-based parenting support programs. Research over the past 50Ã‚Â years has shown that parenting support programs of varied intensity and delivery modality can improve a wide range of developmental, emotional, behavioral and health outcomes for parents and their children. Such findings have been replicated across culturally and socioeconomically diverse samples, albeit primarily in studies from Western countries. We highlight the evidence for the relevance of parenting interventions for attaining the SDGs globally, and identify the barriers to and strategies for achieving their scale-up. The implications of the global COVID-19 pandemic for the delivery of evidence-based parenting support are also discussed.","Sanders, Divan, Singhal, Turner, Velleman, Michelson, Patel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01171-0","20210505","Child development; Evidence-based parenting support; Parenting; Sustainable development goals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13505,""
"Anxiety, depression, and worries in advanced Parkinson disease during COVID-19 pandemic","The psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown on frail populations with advanced Parkinson disease (APD) and their caregivers may present with peculiar features and require specific interventions. We enrolled here 100 APD patients and 60 caregivers. Seventy-four patients were treated with device-aided therapies (DAT) and 26 with standard medical treatment (SMT). Through a telephonic interview, subjects underwent the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A; HADS-D), and an ad hoc questionnaire to explore thoughts and emotions related to the pandemic. Depression was observed in 35% of APD patients and anxiety in 39%, with a significant reduction of the latter after the lockdown (p= 0.023). We found a significant correlation between the type of therapy and the HADS-A score (p= 0.004). Patients' main worries were as follows: a possible higher risk of COVID-19 infection (25%), interruption of non-pharmacological treatments (35%), interruption of outpatient clinics (38%), PD complications related to COVID-19 (47%). Patients treated with DAT manifested worries about device-related issues and risk for caregivers' infection. The 40% of caregivers showed anxiety, while the 21.7% of them showed depression. Our study reveals a higher prevalence of anxiety and the presence of peculiar worries and needs in APD patients during the pandemic alongside psychological sequelae of their caregivers. These findings are important for neurologists and healthcare services to foster strategies for the management of psychological distress in both patients and caregivers.","Montanaro, Artusi, Rosano, Boschetto, Imbalzano, Romagnolo, Bozzali, Rizzone, Zibetti, Lopiano","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05286-z","20210505","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Parkinson disease; Worries","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13506,""
"Identifying the Factor Structure of the DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure","The DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure (DSM-XC) is a transdiagnostic mental health symptom measure that has shown promise in informing clinical diagnostic evaluations and as a screening tool for research. However, few studies have assessed the latent dimensionality of the DSM-XC or provided guidance on how to score the survey. In this report, we examined the factor structure of the DSM-XC in a sample of over 3500 participants enrolled in a protocol on the mental health impact of COVID-19 conducted through the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program (NIMH IRP) ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04339790 ). We began by conducting an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify the best solution for our data, and then employed a confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to evaluate the fit of the two-factor solution proposed by Lace and Merz (Lace &amp; Merz, 2020), the fit of our proposed solution, and the measurement invariance of our proposed solution across age, sex, and calendar time. We found a six-factor solution stemming from our EFAs to best fit our data. Each factor captures symptoms related to a specific construct of psychopathology: mood, worry, activation, somatic, confusion, and substance use. Future research should evaluate this six-factor structure using additional datasets to confirm its consistency across research populations and settings.","Gibbons, Farmer, Shaw, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.28.21256253","20210505","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13507,""
"Frontline interdisciplinary clinician perspectives on caring for patients with COVID-19: a qualitative study","To describe the drivers of distress and motivations faced by interdisciplinary clinicians who were on the frontline caring for patients with COVID-19. 50 semistructured interviews. Transcripts were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. A safety-net hospital in Denver, Colorado. Interdisciplinary frontline clinicians including physicians, advance practice providers, nurses, respiratory therapists and paramedics providing inpatient hospital care to patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Fifty clinicians (32 women and 18 men) participated. Five themes with respective subthemes (in parentheses) were identified: depersonalisation and barriers to care (impeding rapport and compassion, focusing on infection risk at the expense of high-quality care, grief from witnessing patients suffer in isolation), powerless in uncertainty (inescapable awareness of personal risk, therapeutic doubt in a void of evidence, confronting ethical dilemmas, struggling with dynamic and unfamiliar challenges), overwhelmed and exhausted (burden of personal protective equipment (PPE), information overload and confusion, overstretched by additional responsibilities at work, compounded by personal life stressors, feeling vulnerable and dispensable, compassion fatigue, distress from the disproportionate impact on socially oppressed communities), bolstering morale and confidence (motivated by community and family support, equipped with data), and driven by moral duty (responsibility to patient care and community, collegial solidarity and collaboration, contributing to the greater good). Frontline clinicians reported distress due to the challenges of PPE, uncertainty and powerlessness, new responsibilities at work and home, losing control of their schedules, grief from witnessing patients suffer in isolation and witnessing healthcare disparities exacerbated by this pandemic. Clinicians feel supported by their colleagues, families, and community and were driven by a sense of moral duty. Healthcare system should adopt strategies to minimise distress faced by interdisciplinary clinicians on the frontline of COVID-19.","Rao, Mancini, Tong, Khan, Santacruz Gutierrez, Mundo, Collings, Cervantes","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048712","20210505","COVID-19; accident &amp; emergency medicine; adult intensive &amp; critical care; health policy; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13508,""

"Impacts on Children and Adolescents' Lifestyle, Social Support and Their Association with Negative Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health-related behaviors among children and adolescents are likely to be profound and long-lasting. This study aimed to investigate the changes in lifestyle and social support and their associations with negative impacts due to the pandemic. A classroom survey using stratified random sampling and structured questionnaire was conducted among Hong Kong primary and secondary school students. The paper-and-pen survey, administered by well-trained research assistants, was completed by 2863 participants aged 9-17 years old (M = 12.6, SD = 1.3) at a brief school reopening six months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. About 48% and 37% of the participants stated that they paid increased attention to physical and mental health, respectively. About 20% to 40% stated that they found more support from their friends and family members; only a small percentage reported decreased social support. Around 25% to 50% spent more time to rest, relax, and exercise. The aforementioned changes varied among genders, education groups, and socio-economic status. In general, higher perceived vulnerability, feeling more stressed, apprehensive, and helpless were associated with more reported positive lifestyle changes, including more social/family support, increased mental health awareness, and a positive lifestyle. These positive changes serve as important cushions against the negative impacts of COVID-19.","Zhu, Zhuang, Ip","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094780","20210505","COVID-19; children and adolescents; lifestyle; mental health; school closure; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13510,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Mental Well-Being and Working Life among Faroese Employees","The societal changes caused by COVID-19 have been far-reaching, causing challenges for employees around the world. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 restrictions on mental well-being, working life, family life and social life among Faroese employees within a broad range of professions. A total of 1328 Faroese employees answered an anonymous self-report survey from 13 April to 4 May 2020. Employee mental well-being was only modestly affected by the restrictions and the respondents had a mean score of 50.7 on the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale where a score between 41-44 is found to correspond with possible depression. Work commitment, work and family life, work satisfaction and work ability were all rated significantly worse after the COVID-19 outbreak than before (all <i>p</i> values &lt; 0.005). Contrary to previous research, employees in health services assessed their work ability significantly higher than employees in teaching, and child and youth care (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Working parents had higher levels of stress and assessed their work ability significantly lower than employees without children (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and women tended to be more worried than men because of the pandemic.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Swimming Training: Practical Recommendations during Home Confinement/Isolation","The COVID-19 pandemic has had severe effects on communities globally, leading to significant restrictions on all aspects of society, including in sports. Several significant decisions were made to postpone or cancel major swimming events by FINA (FÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ration Internationale de Natation). Swimmers were no longer allowed to continue their usual training in swimming pools and were confined to their homes. These unusual circumstances may represent a good opportunity to strengthen different areas of swimmer preparation and potentially enhance performance when resuming regular aquatic training. We searched major databases for relevant information, and the present article provides practical information on home-based training for swimmers of all ages. The COVID-19 crisis and its consequences on the swimming community have created a myriad of challenges for swimmers around the world, including maintaining their fitness level and preparing to return optimally and safely to pool training and competitions. Unfortunately, the mental consequences that might arise after the pandemic may also have an impact. We strongly recommend encouraging the swimmers to consider quarantine as an opportunity for development in specific areas of preparation and learn how to best cope with this special situation of self-isolation and/or &quot;physical distancing&quot; for their mental health and in case a similar situation is faced again in the future.","Haddad, Abbes, Mujika, Chamari","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094767","20210505","COVID-19; confinement; detraining; dryland; swimming; training methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13512,""

In several countries, these emergencies combined the pandemic and other man-made and natural disasters: &quot;double disaster&quot;, which affected the health, safety, and well-being of both individuals and communities. Students are a particularly vulnerable population for mental health problems considering the challenges with their transitions to adulthood. Using narrative analysis, this study explored the impacts of a double disaster on the mental health of students and how they cope up with these emergencies. The results showed that the occurrence of natural disasters during the lockdowns from pandemic brought stress to students in adjusting to distance education, completing academic requirements, and accessing technology for online learning. Participants expressed their anxieties about the spread of the virus in the community, particularly in the disaster evacuation centers with less strictly observed social distancing, insufficient hygiene and sanitation facilities, and lack of basic needs. Participants described their learnings and coping strategies that included helping one another, following the government protocols, finding additional sources of income, using energy for important purposes only, and leaning on faith.

"If There's Something Strange in Your Neighbourhood, Who You Gonna Call? Perceived Mental Health Service User Suitability for Video Consultations","COVID-19 has placed additional challenges on mental health services. Video consultations (VCs) have provided a short-term solution to lockdown restrictions but could also increase long-term capacity to meet the anticipated rising demand. A total of 7752 VCs were conducted over six weeks. Thematic analysis of 474 online survey responses identified twenty patient attributes that influenced staffs' decisions to offer VCs. Their opinions were diverse, at times contradictory, and not always evidence based. There was reasonable consensus (and published evidence to support) of the probable suitability of VC for patients who: are IT savvy and suitably equipped; are teenagers; live in remote/rural locations; have caring responsibilities; have anxiety disorders or express a preference. No consensus was reached regarding eight attributes and there was a corresponding paucity of evidence, indicating the need for further research. Conversely, old age; paranoia, sensory impairment/communication difficulties; high risk and trauma/PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) were generally seen as contraindicated by staff, despite published evidence of success elsewhere. It may be possible to overcome staff's reticence to offer these groups VCs. As staff are effectively the gatekeepers to VC interventions, it is important to understand and support them to overcome reservations that are contrary to the empirical evidence base. This will ensure that their initial anxieties do not become unnecessary barriers to services for those most in need. As with all mental healthcare, such decisions should be made collaboratively, and on an individual basis.","Painter, Turner, Procter","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9050517","20210505","Skype; mental healthcare; nursing; telehealth; telepsychiatry; video consultation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13516,""
"COVID-19, Isolation, Quarantine: On the Efficacy of Internet-Based Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Ongoing Trauma","Literature points to cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) as evidence-based therapies for trauma-related disorders. Treatments are typically administered in a vis-ÃƒÂ -vis setting with patients reporting symptoms of a previously experienced trauma. Conversely, online-therapies and ongoing trauma have not received adequate attention. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of two brief treatments for health professionals and individuals suffering from the circumstances imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The EMDR and the trauma focused-CBT were administered online during the earliest stage of distress to manage the ongoing trauma associated to quarantine or disease. Thirty-eight patients satisfying the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for acute stress disorder were randomly assigned to the EMDR or CBT treatment. Both groups received a 7-session therapy, and psychometric tests were administered before, after the treatment and at one-month follow-up to assess traumatic symptoms, depression and anxiety. Results revealed that both treatments reduced anxiety by 30%, and traumatic and depressive symptoms by 55%. Present findings indicate the internet-based EMDR and CBT as equally effective brief treatments, also suggesting a maintenance of the effects as indicated by the follow-up evaluation. The EMDR and CBT might be considered as first line therapies to treat the ongoing trauma and to prevent the sensitization and accumulation of trauma memories.","Perri, Castelli, La Rosa, Zucchi, Onofri","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11050579","20210505","CBT; COVID-19; EMDR; online therapy; psychotherapy; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13517,""

However, the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have also had a major impact on social services. The pandemic increased service needs among those who were already adult social work clients before the pandemic; it also created needs among new groups of clients, while the operating environment for service provision changed dramatically. In our study we 1) analyse the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult social work clients in Finland, 2) examine the old and new practices in adult social work that were used and developed during the outbreak of the pandemic and 3) assess how well social services were able to respond to clientsâ€™ needs during the pandemic. For the analysis we use national survey data obtained from social workers in the Social Barometer survey collected in May 2020 (n=496) and in January 2021 (n=412). The findings show that social work in Finland succeeded in responding to rather clear and concrete problems such as difficulties in applying for social benefits and lack of housing while more complicated problems, such as unmanageable debts, loneliness and mental health problems were not adequately responded to. At the same time, social workers assessed that people suffering from these problems were the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Merita Jokela et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46097-28E-866","20210505","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13518,""
"Lifestyle Medicine for Treatmentâ€“Resistant Depression","The authors recommend that time, resources, and funding be allocated to support the costâ€“<U+2060>effective lifestyle medicine interventions for mental illness (and, in fact, all chronic illnesses, pain management, etc.). These interventions have positive results and seem to support true health and healing. In November 2020, Navarro et al10 published a paper regarding their promising onâ€“<U+2060>going clinical trial. The main aim of their study is to â€œevaluate the effectiveness of an Internetâ€“<U+2060>based adjuvant lifestyleâ€“<U+2060>based intervention for patients with TRD.â€10 Since TRD can be exacerbated by stressors that have become more common due to the COVIDâ€“<U+2060>19 pandemic, such as poor physical health and economic struggles, their study is an important one. Information and communications technologies and video conferencing will be used. The authors hypothesize that by the time of their 1â€“<U+2060>year followâ€“<U+2060>up, the lifestyle program group will show greater adherence and therefore benefits of the intervention. They said, â€œIf this Internetâ€“<U+2060>based multimodal lifestyle intervention program is useful as an adjunct to the pharmacological treatment of depression, this approach should be considered for the management of patients with TRD in similar emergency situations.â€10 This study is not only promising because of its novel approach to treating TRD, but also because this intervention may be duplicated and used almost anywhere in the world and at any time, even times of emergency. The idea that TRD could be successfully treated by combining lifestyle medicine with modernâ€“<U+2060>day technology rather than by administering drugs is hopeful.","Ponn Mahayosnand et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612A-66A-260","20210505","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Pain Management; treatment resistant depression; depression; lifestyle medicine; trd; religion health","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","",13519,""
