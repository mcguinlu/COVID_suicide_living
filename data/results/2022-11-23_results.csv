"It's poverty - not the pandemic: the impact of COVID-19 and socioeconomic status on psychological distress in cancer patients","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected psychological wellbeing in many aspects, but its influence on cancer patients it not yet clear, and studies show mixed results. Aims: We aimed to investigate the impact of the pandemic on psychological symptom burden against the socio-economic background of cancer patients using data from routine assessments before and during the pandemic. Methods: Standardised assessment instruments were applied in N = 1,329 patients to screen for symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and fatigue from 2018 to 2022. Two MANOVAs with separate ANOVAs and Bonferroni pairwise comparisons as post-hoc tests were computed. First, only time was included as predictor to examine the isolated impact of the pandemic. Second, income level and education level were included as further predictors to additionally test the predictive power of socioeconomic risk factors. All tests were two-sided. Results: Once indicators of socioeconomic status were included in the analysis, the seeming influence of the pandemic became negligible. Only income had a significant impact on all aspects of psychological symptom burden, with patients with low income being highly burdened (partial eta-squared = .01, p = .023). The highest mean difference was found for depressive symptoms (MD = 0.13, CI = [0.07; 0.19], p < .001). The pandemic had no further influence on psychological distress. Conclusions: Although the pandemic is a major stressor in many respects, poverty is by far the most important risk factor for psychological symptom burden in cancer outpatients and outweighs the impact of the pandemic.","Elisabeth Lucia Zeilinger; Matthias Knefel; Carmen Schneckenreiter; Jakob Pietschnig; Simone Lubowitzki; Matthias Unseld; Thorsten Fuereder; Rupert Bartsch; Eva Katharina Masel; Feroniki Adamidis; Lea Kum; Barbara Kiesewetter; Sabine Zoechbauer-Mueller; Markus Raderer; Maria Theresa Krauth; Philipp Staber; Peter Valent; Alexander Gaiger","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.21.22282580","20221122","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41395,""
"The parental perception of emotional-behavioral changes in children with autism spectrum disorder, 4 months after the onset of the pandemic period","Autism spectrum disorder refers to a neurodevelopment disorder that is cha ra c t e r i z e d by di f fi cul t i e s with social communication and social interaction and restricted and repetitive patterns in behaviors, interests, and activities. During the lockdown, when social isolation and distancing become mandatory for everyone, disruption of daily routines (school, therapy, free time) is a risk factor especially for families with a child with autism disorder, because their children may have a freeze in the progress they had painstakingly achieved up to that point. In this study, we monitored 81 families of children with autism disorder, assessed before the onset of the lockdown and approximately 4 months later, to see which children's behaviors had worsened and which had remained stable or improved. The families were interviewed, in February and July 2020, using standardized rating scales. The results showed an intensification in the children of motor restlessness, difficulty in sleep regulation, while there were no worsening in self-harming or hetero-aggressive behaviors, nor in personal autonomy. It should be considered that all the families involved in the present research were involved in therapeutic paths and did not interrupt the path of psychological support (online), with the specific objective of supporting them in their parental role in the most critical phases experienced by the children, and in making them more active in the processes of consolidation of the competences acquired by the children.","Di Renzo, M.; Pace, P.; di Castelbianco, F.

"Impact of statewide telemedicine support model in a community oncology practice","Background: While there was broad adoption of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, optimizing the interaction for patients and the clinical team remained a challenge. We sought to optimize delivery of telemedicine services to provide more efficient and effective patient care. Target areas of concern for improvement were scheduling, staffing, communication, technical challenges with operating the platform, a high cancellation rate, and limited copay collections. Method(s): A team of 8 virtual Patient Service Coordinators (VPSCs), 8 virtual Medical Assistants (VMAs), and an RN clinical manager was created to work remotely from home to serve Providers at 8 clinics. VPSCs performed check-in duties, demographics, copay collection and technology trouble-shooting with patients. VMAs performed medical intake (medication reconciliation, depression screenings, and vital signs) with realtime EMR input. VMAs stayed in-touch with patients to communicate Provider delays. Standardized communication pathways connected virtual teams with in-clinic teams. The clinics selected to participate in the TMS program were conducting 29% - 50% of E&M visits by telemedicine. The goal of the TMS program was to reduce stress and burnout, as well as relieve in-clinic staff of telemedicine duties giving them capacity to address in-clinic COVID related staff shortages. Result(s): The TMS Program supported 15,500 visits (11/15/21 - 5/31/22) and increased upfront expected copay collection from 9% pre-program to 100% post program. The program reduced the time for first contact on video from 18 minutes to 1 minute and reduced the telemedicine cancellation rate by 3%. The supported TM cancellation rate was 7% lower than in-person visit cancellation rate. A geographically distributed work from home team was able to support a 66% increase in visits during inclement weather days which allowed visits to be completed that would have otherwise been canceled due to clinic closures. Additionally, the TMS program relieved workload for in-clinic staff and the VPSC and VMA positions proved highly desirable to the eligible workforce. Conclusion(s): The TMS Program improved patient connectivity and experience, increased upfront co-pay collection, decreased burden on in-clinic staff, allowed continuity of care during inclement weather, and was an attractive work option for staff. Due to its success, the program moved past pilot phase into an operational program.","Townsend, S.; Hoegger, B.; Ortega, L.; Patt, D. A.; Books, H.; Mikan, S.

"Feasibility of large scale distress screening at an academic center and associated network sites using an adapted patient-reported outcome instrument and reflexive suicide screening","Background: Regular distress screening of patients with cancer is mandated by cancer care guidelines, with 25-50% of patients with cancer experiencing some level of distress. The COVID-19 pandemic amplified symptoms of distress and shifted oncologic care delivery towards telemedicine. In light of challenges faced with implementation of such screening, especially during this pandemic, we sought to assess the feasibility of implementing patient-focused distress screening at a large academic cancer center and its associated network sites. Method(s): We designed a modified distress screening tool with reflexive suicidality and mental health screening consisting of 1) Wellness Reflection, a questionnaire that incorporates questions from Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Global Health (PROMIS-GH) to monitor patients' physical, mental, and social health and to assess patients' needs for extra support, and 2) modified Patient Health Questionnaire 2+9 (PHQ 2+9) tool to screen for depression and suicide risk. This tool was used to triage patients in need of further assessment by the clinical team, including consideration for referrals to cancer supportive services. The two-tiered distress screening tool was delivered to patients at Stanford Cancer Center and 5 affiliate sites for inperson clinic visits starting September 2019. The Wellness Reflection was launched starting June 2020 for video visits. Result(s): From October 1, 2019 to May 14, 2021, 147,165 questionnaires representing 46,341 patients were collected. The overall Wellness Reflection questionnaire response rate was 55%;the video visit questionnaire response rate was ~70%, higher than the in-person visit response rate of ~50%. About 6% of questionnaires analyzed showed a request for more support, most commonly emotional and physical/symptom support, and this was consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic. 18.6% of questionnaire responses screened positive for further assessment, and those that triggered reflexive suicidality screening had a 17% positive PHQ 2+9 rate. Following assessment, 13,631 referrals to cancer supportive services were generated. Conclusion(s): The adoption of commonly available patient-reported outcome tools, including PROMIS-GH and PHQ 2+9, as a large-scale distress screening method for both in-person and tele-health clinic visits during the COVID-19 pandemic is feasible at a large academic cancer center and network sites. The volumes of positive screens and referrals were lower than expected despite broader implementation of distress screening and amplified symptoms of distress due to the pandemic.","Gupta, D.

"Perceived stress among university students in Oman during COVID-19-induced e-learning","BackgroundHigher education institutions across the world moved to e-learning in response to the disruptions caused by the pandemic. While e-learning has an advantage for students that they can attend to their courses from anywhere at their convenience, yet the sudden disruptive shift to e-learning during the pandemic saw students facing many challenges, which had strong ability to induce mental health issues among the students. This study aimed at examining the impact of COVID-19-induced e-learning on the university studentsâ€™ stress perceptions in Oman.ResultsA total of 966 usable responses were received. The results showed that 96.9% (moderate stress = 82.5% and high stress = 14.4%) reported having experienced stress through e-learning during COVID-19. The results further indicated that there was a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and the studentsâ€™ academic performance. The family support and institutional support were observed to have a significant effect on studentsâ€™ stress perception.ConclusionsStudents are away from the physical campuses over a year now, continuing their courses and programs online. The numerous challenges they are facing through e-learning, together with the prevailing uncertainty, have intensified stress among them. The continued stress over time will not only affect their academic performance, but their mental and physical health as well, as the stress has proven to be one of the major causes of various physical and mental disorders. While e-learning seems to emerge as a new normal, the students require proper attention, help, and support from their families and institutions. The institutions should revisit their online courses and program delivery mechanisms, methods, and practices to ensure that students are not over stressed.","Malik, Mustafa, Javed, Sarfaraz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s43045-021-00131-7","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Middle East Current Psychiatry; JOUR(1), 28.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41399,""
"Pandemic Grief Scale in detection of grief reaction among physicians in COVID-19 era","BackgroundPhysicians are considered one of the most vulnerable groups who might develop pandemic grief during this critical time of COVID-19 infection, and this grief reaction might have deleterious effects on their life. This cross-sectional observational online study aimed to investigate the pandemic grief reaction among physicians and its burden on their aspects of life.ResultsSocio-demographic characteristics of 900 physicians were collected. The Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) was used to detect the grief reaction among them and also Patient Health Depression Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to evaluate the depressive manifestations. Sheehan Disability Scale was considered to investigate the burden of this grief on different aspects of life. The study revealed high mean score of Pandemic Grief Scale: 11.12 Â± 2.34;the mean score of Sheehan Disability Scale was 17.63 Â± 5.17, and the mean score of Patient Health Depression Questionnaire-9 was 19.89 Â± 4.27.ConclusionPandemic grief is commonly experienced by the physicians during this COVID-19 era due to sudden loss of loved one or the cases themselves.

"COVID-19-associated PTSD in the elderlyâ€”lessons learned for the next global pandemic","BackgroundWhen COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic in March 2020, almost all countries implemented strict lockdowns and home quarantine orders in order to prevent spread of the virus. These implementations have severely affected the mental health of people all around the world especially the elderly, who are already physically and mentally fragile. There has been an escalation in the prevalence of depression, suicide, anxiety, substance abuse, domestic abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Main bodyThe aim of our review was to highlight PTSD in the elderly population who has recovered from COVID-19 infection and come up with some recommendations for the future. A thorough literature review was conducted focusing on the impact of COVID-19 on development and progression of PTSD during the pandemic.ConclusionIncreased allocation of resources by various government and private stakeholders is necessary to prepare for the long-term implications on mental health from the current and future pandemics.","Sarangi, Ashish, Javed, Sana, Karki, Kumar, Kaushal, Akshita","https://doi.org/10.1186/s43045-021-00119-3","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Middle East Current Psychiatry; JOUR(1), 28.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41401,""
"Experiences of healthcare workers of hospitalised individuals with COVID-19 in Kano, Nigeria: a qualitative study","Background: Management of patients with covid-19 needing hospitalisation is challenging worldwide. However, little or no information has been gathered regarding the experiences of healthcare workers (hcw s) involved in the care of patients with covid-19 in poorly resourced settings. This study explored the experiences of hcw s managing hospitalised patients with covid-19 in a treatment centre in Kano, Nigeria. Methods: hcw s directly or indirectly involved in managing patients with covid-19 in one of the two treatment centres in Kano, Nigeria, were sampled based on being information-rich cases. The study participants were interviewed individually via telephone using a semi-structured interview guide. Data collection was stopped when content saturation was attained. Data was analysed using thematic synthesis. Results: Eleven hcw s, comprising two medical doctors, five nurses, a laboratory staff member, a community health extension worker, an environmental health officer and a cleaner, participated in this study. Four major themes were generated: (i) the profile and readiness of hcw s prior to being engaged to work in a covid-19 treatment centre, (ii) the experience of hcw s while working in the covid-19 treatment wards, (iii) challenges with working in covid-19 treatment wards, and (iv) post-treatment support for covid-19 patients. The participants had variable prior experience in managing patients with infectious diseases. Interventions offered were mainly antiviral therapy, nursing care, counselling, nutritional interventions and toilet hygiene. Challenges encountered included insufficient cooperation from patients, poor personnel welfare, lack of human resources/equipment and issues interfering with wellbeing (stigma). Conclusion: The studied population exhibited professional competence and success in managing hospitalised patients with covid-19 during hospitalisation, despite existing challenges.","Abba, M.

"The synergy between two threats: Disinformation and COVID-19","The breakdown of trusted sources of information is probably one of the most serious problems today, since in the absence of a common ground, it will be impossible to address the problems that trouble our contemporary world. The COVID-19 pandemic is just a recent situation where the lack of agreed stances has led to failure and hopelessness. In fact, disinformation surrounding the COVID-19 has been a distinctive feature of this pandemic since its very beginning and has hampered what is perhaps the most important initiative to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, viz., an effective communication between scientifically minded health authorities and the general public. To investigate how disinformation threatens epistemic security, here we propose and solve analytically an evolutionary game-theoretic model where the individuals must accurately estimate some property of their hazardous environment. They can either explore the environment or copy the estimate from another individual, who may display a distorted version of its estimate. We find that the exploration-only strategy is optimal when the environment is relatively safe and the individuals are not reliable. In this doomsday scenario, disinformation erodes trust and suppresses the ability of the individuals to share information with one another.

"Agriculture, COVID-19 and mental health: Does gender matter?","Agriculture is one of the most precarious professions, being vulnerable to weather extremes and animal disease. As crises hit the agricultural sector, a growing awareness and concern for the mental wellbeing of farmers developed. Economic decline, climate change and culling animals all have a profound impact on affected farmers. To date, research has tended to focus on the farmer, typically a man, and not the farm family. This article considers the impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19)Â on men and women on farms. Using qualitative interviews and focus groups, the impact of the pandemic on men's and women's work and social life within the family is explored. We found a differential impact. For farmers, usually men, COVID-19 was generally a positive experience both in terms of work and social life. For women, on the other hand, COVID-19 was found to have a negative impact on their work and social life. While gender equality in agriculture persists, women's equality in the workplace has advanced. However, with the pandemic, women worked from home on the farm. They experienced a regression in gender equality with traditional expectations of responsibility for childcare and housework returning. In addition, their emotional and â€˜mentalâ€™ labour increased. We conclude that in the future, the mental health of men and women on farms needs to be considered when crises occur. Crises impact the farm family and different members of the family in dissimilar ways.

"Psychological factors responsible for low adherence to mask-wearing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to &gt;6 million deaths. Anti-mask movements may decrease the effects of preventive measures. Psychological factors that may be related to anti-mask behaviour are not well researched. This study aims to determine the psychological correlates of anti-mask attitudes and behaviour in an online general population sample, focusing on the possible role of claustrophobia. Data on attitudes and behaviour toward mask-wearing were collected from an online sample of 3709 people. Predictors of both anti-mask attitudes and behaviour were assessed with linear and logistic regression analyses. Few people (3.3%) were overtly opposed to mask-wearing; mask opposition was more common in men than women. Predictors of negative attitude toward mask-wearing and low adherence to mask-related measures were similar and included male gender, lower education, lower income, being employed, having had COVID-19 and lower COVID-19-related anxiety. Psychopathology measures did not show a prediction, whereas claustrophobia had a significant prediction that was over and above those of other predictors. Avoidance behaviour had similar predictors, except for higher COVID-19-related anxiety. Although low adherence to mask-wearing during the pandemic was not related to having a mental disorder, it may partly be caused by psychological factors. Those who had a negative attitude also reported lower adherence behaviour, and were characterised by being male, having lower education, being employed and having lower COVID-19-related anxiety; claustrophobia was a strong predictor of attitude. Understanding psychological factors responsible for low adherence may help to decrease morbidity and mortality in future pandemics.","K&#x131;l&#x131;&#xe7;, Y&#x131;ld&#x131;z, Emekli, G&#xfc;l&#x15f;en, Alp","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.603","20221123","COVID-19; Phobias; anxiety disorders; epidemiology; face masks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41406,""
"Perspectives of Nursing Home Administrators across the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To characterize the experiences of nursing home administrators as they manage facilities across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 156 interviews, consisting of four repeated interviews with administrators from 40 nursing homes in eight healthcare markets across the country from July 2020 through December 2021. We subjected the interview transcripts to a rigorous qualitative analysis to identify overarching themes using a modified grounded theory approach to applied thematic analysis. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted virtually or by phone, and audio-recorded, with participants' consent. Audio recordings were transcribed. Interviews with nursing home administrators revealed a number of important cross-cutting themes. In interviewing each facility's administrator four times over the course of the pandemic, we heard perspectives regarding stages of the pandemic, and how they varied by facility and changed over time. We also heard how policies implemented by federal, state, and local governments to respond to COVID-19 were frequently changing, confusing, and conflicting. Administrators described the effect of COVID-19 and efforts to mitigate it on residents, including how restrictions on activities, communal dining, and visitation resulted in cognitive decline, depression, and weight loss. Administrators also discussed the impact of COVID-19 on staff and staffing levels, reporting widespread challenges in keeping facilities staffed as well as strategies used to hire and retain staff. Administrators described concerns for the sustainability of the nursing home industry resulting from the substantial costs and pressures associated with responding to COVID-19, the reductions in revenue, and the negative impact of how nursing homes appeared in the media. Findings from our research reflect nursing home administrator perspectives regarding challenges operating during COVID-19 and have substantial implications for policy and practice.","Gadbois, Brazier, Meehan, Rafat, Rahman, Grabowski, Shield","https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.14104","20221123","COVID-19; nursing homes; pandemic; qualitative; residents; skilled nursing facilities; staffing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41407,""

Numerous investigations about liposome uses were conducted in different treatment fields, including anti-tumor, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and clinical analgesia, owing to liposome's ability to reduce drug cytotoxicity and improve the therapeutic efficacy and combinatorial delivery. In particular, two liposomal vaccines were approved in 2021 to combat COVID-19. Herein, the clinically used liposomes are reviewed by introducing various liposomal preparations in detail that are currently proceeding in the clinic or on the market. Finally, we will discuss the challenges of developing liposomes and cutting-edge liposomal delivery for biological drugs and combination therapy.","He, Zhang, Xiao, Fan, Huang, Chen, He","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajps.2022.11.002","20221123","COVID-19 pandemic; Clinical application; Drug delivery; Liposomes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41410,""
"Relationship between Participation in Physical Activity and Subjective Well-Being: Evidence from Korea during the Pandemic","The lack of physical activity because of restrictions from the pandemic has increased interest in the deterioration of mental and physical health. This is the first study in Korea to investigate how participation in physical activity is correlated with subjective well-being among Koreans in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was conducted among those aged &gt;13 years, from August 24 to September 7, 2020. The process included self-reported surveys, telephone surveys, and face-to-face household interviews; 11,604 people (men=7,758 and women=3,846) participated. Frequency, correlation, and one-way analysis of variance were performed to identify differences between age and sex groups according to the physical activity level, while post-hoc Scheffe tests to examine between-group differences when significant results were observed. Statistically significant correlations were observed between life satisfaction, living environment satisfaction, and levels of happiness and anxiety based on sex and age (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). There were significant differences between frequency and time spent on physical activity and subjective well-being according to sex and age (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The study results are highly generalizable considering the analysis of a large-scale sample within a big area in Korea. The findings emphasize that subjective well-being is influenced by sex, age, frequency, and time spent engaged in physical activity. Such basic data can be helpful for establishing policies related to physical activity.","Bae","https://doi.org/10.18502/ijph.v51i10.10984","20221123","Life satisfaction; Mental health; Pandemic; Physical activity; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41411,""
"Are remote psychotherapy/remediation efforts accessible and feasible in patients with schizophrenia? A narrative review","Cognitive remediation (CR) therapy provides an effective way to improve cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. With the advent of telehealth services, especially during COVID 19 pandemic, a suitable alternative can be found in computer and cell phone-based mental health interventions. Previous studies have proven that remote mental health interventions have by and large been successful. Remote psychotherapy/CR services can now be accessed through smartphone apps, iPads, laptops and wearable devices. This has the advantage of reaching a wider population in resource-limited settings. The lack of access to technology, difficulty in using these online interventions and lack of privacy provide impediments to the delivery of care through these online platforms. Further, as some previous studies have shown, there may be a high rate of dropout in people using remote mental health resources. We aim to look at the factors, which influence the accessibility of remote mental health interventions in schizophrenia. Additionally, we test the feasibility of these interventions and look at how they compare and the potential they hold for implementation in future clinical settings. We found remote cognitive remediation to be both accessible and feasible. Concerning features, however, are the high attrition rates and the concentration of the studies in Western populations. Remote interventions are a viable alternative to in-person psychotherapy when in-person resources may not always be present. They are efficacious in improving health outcomes among patients with schizophrenia. Further research into the widespread implementation of remote CR will be beneficial in informing clinical decision-making.","Datta, Vishwanath, Shenoy","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41983-022-00574-7","20221123","Cognitive therapy; Psychotherapy; Remote cognitive remediation; Remote interventions; Schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41412,""

"Ischemic stroke of unclear aetiology: a case-by-case analysis and call for a multi-professional predictive, preventive and personalised approach","Due to the reactive medical approach applied to disease management, stroke has reached an epidemic scale worldwide. In 2019, the global stroke prevalence was 101.5 million people, wherefrom 77.2 million (about 76%) suffered from ischemic stroke; 20.7 and 8.4 million suffered from intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage, respectively. Globally in the year 2019 - 3.3, 2.9 and 0.4 million individuals died of ischemic stroke, intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage, respectively. During the last three decades, the absolute number of cases increased substantially. The current prevalence of stroke is 110 million patients worldwide with more than 60% below the age of 70&#xa0;years. Prognoses by the World Stroke Organisation are pessimistic: globally, it is predicted that 1 in 4 adults over the age of 25 will suffer stroke in their lifetime. Although age is the best known contributing factor, over 16% of all strokes occur in teenagers and young adults aged 15-49&#xa0;years and the incidence trend in this population is increasing. The corresponding socio-economic burden of stroke, which is the leading cause of disability, is enormous. Global costs of stroke are estimated at 721 billion US dollars, which is 0.66% of the global GDP. Clinically manifested strokes are only the ""tip of the iceberg"": it is estimated that the total number of stroke patients is about 14 times greater than the currently applied reactive medical approach is capable to identify and manage. Specifically, lacunar stroke (LS), which is characteristic for silent brain infarction, represents up to 30% of all ischemic strokes. Silent LS, which is diagnosed mainly by routine health check-up and autopsy in individuals without stroke history, has a reported prevalence of silent brain infarction up to 55% in the investigated populations. To this end, silent brain infarction is an independent predictor of ischemic stroke. Further<b>,</b> small vessel disease and silent lacunar brain infarction are considered strong contributors to cognitive impairments, dementia, depression and suicide, amongst others in the general population. In sub-populations such as diabetes mellitus type 2, proliferative diabetic retinopathy is an independent predictor of ischemic stroke. According to various statistical sources, cryptogenic strokes account for 15 to 40% of the entire stroke incidence. The question to consider here is, whether a cryptogenic stroke is fully referable to unidentifiable aetiology or rather to underestimated risks. Considering the latter, translational research might be of great clinical utility to realise innovative predictive and preventive approaches, potentially benefiting high risk individuals and society at large. In this position paper, the consortium has combined multi-professional expertise to provide clear statements towards the paradigm change from reactive to predictive, preventive and personalised medicine in stroke management, the crucial elements of which are:Consolidation of multi-disciplinary expertise including family medicine, predictive and in-depth diagnostics followed by the targeted primary and secondary (e.g. treated cancer) prevention of silent brain infarctionApplication of the health risk assessment focused on sub-optimal health conditions to effectively prevent health-to-disease transitionApplication of AI in medicine, machine learning and treatment algorithms tailored to robust biomarker patternsApplication of innovative screening programmes which adequately consider the needs of young populations.","Golubnitschaja, Potuznik, Polivka, Pesta, Kaverina, Pieper, Kropp, Thumann, Erb, Karabatsiakis, Stetkarova, Polivka, Costigliola","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-022-00307-z","20221123","Blood pressure; Blood&#x2013;brain barrier breakdown; Body mass index; COVID-19; Cancer; Coagulation; Connective tissue impairments; Diabetes comorbidities; Endothelial dysfunction; Endothelin-1; Flammer Syndrome phenotype; Health policy; Health risk assessment; Health-to-disease transition; Hypoxia-reperfusion; Individualised protection; Ischemic stroke; Lacunar stroke; Mental health; Metastasis; Normal-tension glaucoma; Optic nerve degeneration; Paradigm change; Pre-pregnancy check-up; Predictive preventive personalised medicine (PPPM&#xa0;/&#xa0;3PM); Primary care; Pro-inflammation; Retinal microvascular abnormalities; Screening; Secondary care; Silent brain infarct; Small vessel disease; Stress; Sub-optimal health; Systemic effects; Thromboembolism; Vascular stiffness; Vasospasm; Young populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41414,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the oncology services demand in a middle-income setting with universal health insurance","We analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncology service demand in a middle-income country with universal health coverage. We collected data from January 1<sup>st</sup>-2017 to December 31<sup>th</sup>-2021 at a reference center in Bogot&#xe1;-Colombia regarding first-time consultations of cross-cutting services (clinical oncology, hematology, palliative care, radiation oncology); specialized multidisciplinary units (breast, prostate, lung, stomach); inpatient and outpatient systemic therapy; radiotherapy; oncology surgery; and bone marrow transplant. A descriptive time series analysis was performed, estimating monthly percent change and endemic channels. Starting the confinement (April 2020), a general decrease in service demand was observed (R: -14.9% to -90.0%), with an additional but lower decrease in August 2020 coinciding with the first pandemic wave (R: -11.3% to -70.0%). Follow-up visits and ambulatory treatment showed no consistent reductions. New patients' consultations for cross-cutting services had a speedy recovery (1 month), but clinical oncology, specialized units, and in-hospital treatment resumed more slowly. Only breast and stomach cancer showed a sustained reduction in early-stage disease. Women and older patients had a more significant reductionin service demand. Conclusion: Despite no changes in service supply, the confinement induced a significant reduction in service demand. Variations by cancer type, service type, and population demographics deserve careful consideration for a suitable response to the emergency. The speedy recovery and the absence of a significant decrease during subsequent waves of the pandemic suggest patient resiliency and a lower impact than expected in middle-income settings in the presence of universal health insurance.

"The experiences of nursing students using virtual education during the COVID-19 pandemic","Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, virtual education was proposed globally. This study aimed to examine the views and experiences of nursing students regarding quality, quantity, e-learning challenges, and solutions. This is a qualitative study using a purposive sampling method in which 42 nursing students were included. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews and analyzed using content analysis. Concepts that were raised in the experience of nursing students were: ""Incompatibility of educational processes"", including ineffective teaching methods, limited interaction, limited feedback, low creativity, and educational injustice. ""Loss of opportunities"" including lack of clinical competence, concern for job opportunities, and lack of time management. ""Imposed burnout"", including forced labor and personal protection. ""Personal helplessness"", including lack of access to electronic facilities, struggles with the coronavirus, unemployment, and family conflicts. The enforcement of e-learning imposed restrictions on students with different conditions. Older students, those living in rural areas, students with work and family responsibilities, and people with limited electronic resources experienced challenges that require educational management based on challenges. Because e-learning goes beyond COVID-19 and given the continuing trend in e-learning in the coming years, it is necessary to address these challenges.","Mousavizadeh","https://doi.org/10.25122/jml-2021-0315","20221123","Covid-19; educational management; nursing students; pandemic; virtual education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41416,""
"Attachment and Sexuality: Impact of Confinement by COVID-19","This study examined attachment style and its relationship with sexual self-esteem during COVID-19 confinement. COVID-19 has caused changes in the way couples interact intimately and sexually around the world; some have found improvements and others an increase in difficulties. This article uses a retrospective pre post approach to evaluate 120 men and 89 women who were part of a couple at the time of confinement in Spain and completed an online survey. The sample was obtained during the de-escalation months, from May 9th until July 1st, 2020. Through an online survey we collected the data using the Spanish version of the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR-S) to measure attachment and the Brief Sexuality Scale (SS) to measure aspects related to the participants sexuality (sexual self-esteem, sexual depression, and sexual preoccupation), as well as a scale designed post hoc on other aspects related to sexuality. Overall, the t-test results suggest that confinement had a negative effect on sexuality because sexual depression (SD) had a small increased in our sample. Multiple regression analysis showed that FSI, and ANXS attachment style were able to predict sexual depression during confinement. The results also showed a decrease in the strength of the relationship between sexual self-esteem (SSE) and attachment styles during confinement. However, sexual preoccupation (SP) and sexual self-esteem (SSE) remained relatively stable. Based on the results obtained, we conclude that there is an association between an increase in participants' sexual depression and being confined due to COVID-19.","Torres-Cruz, Aznar-Mart&#xed;nez, P&#xe9;rez-Testor","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-022-10039-x","20221123","Attachment; COVID-19; Intimacy; Sexual self-esteem; Sexuality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41417,""
"Exploring the pathway from seeking to sharing social support in e-learning: an investigation based on the norm of reciprocity and expectation confirmation theory","E-learning is increasingly evidenced as a conduit for social support exchange among students and protects them against mental health issues, however, the cognitive process of how social support is exchanged remains unclear. This study uses a cognitive theory approach to achieve a more nuanced explanation of students sharing or giving social support in e-learning. Specifically, we adopted the Norm of Reciprocity and Expectation Confirmation Theory to reveal the interconnection between students' perceived social support and giving social support in learning. The model is empirically validated based on survey data of 512 respondents from college students across China regarding their e-learning experience during the first wave of Covid-19. Our findings suggest that the relationship between perceived social support and giving social support is significant and positive, and this relationship is partially mediated by confirmation of social support. These findings imply that e-learning can foster a self-reliant environment for social support exchange among college students. Under such an environment, students' cognitive process in their seeking and sharing social support is majorly following the norm of reciprocity and secondary expectation confirmation theory.","Hu, Zhang, Shen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03982-3","20221123","E-learning; Expectation confirmation theory; Social support; The norm of reciprocity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41418,""
"Management of Obese Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (Double Diabetes) Through Telemedicine During COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: A Case Report","Metabolic syndrome in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has been shown to be an independent risk factor for macro-vascular and micro-vascular complications. Obesity also affects many people with T1DM across their lifetime with an increasing prevalence in recent decades. Individuals with T1DM who are overweight, have a family history of type 2 diabetes, and/or have clinical features of insulin resistance, are known as ""double diabetes"". It is challenging for a person with double diabetes to achieve reasonable glycemic control, avoid insulin-related weight gain, and prevent hypoglycaemia. This was especially true during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic lockdown. The aim of this report is to show that lifestyle modification through telemedicine can immensely help in managing uncontrolled T1DM&#xa0;with associated morbid obesity in lockdown situations, with the help of the diabetes educator. In this case, the complicated history of double diabetes was taken through telephonic and online consultations with the help of a nutritionist and diabetes educator, and the treating clinician supervised the insulin doses and frequency. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 questionnaire was used to assess depression. Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) was given through online consultations, where the patient was reoriented to carbohydrate counting, insulin&#xa0;dose adjustment, along with modifications in the diet. Regular exercise was advised along with frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Moreover, the diet order was changed to eat protein and fibre first, followed by carbohydrates, later. The three-tier system of the medical expert, clinical dietitian, and diabetes educator was applied. The subject was trained for carbohydrate counting and insulin dose adjustment by teaching her about the insulin-to-carb ratio and insulin sensitivity factor (ISF). She was asked to examine her insulin injection sites by visual and palpatory methods for lipohypertrophy. Once a week, the diabetes educator and nutritionist did telephonic follow-up and counselling, while online consultation was done by the treating clinician once a month. As a result, her weight, BMI, and waist circumference were reduced drastically, and there was an improvement in haemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), lipid parameters, and blood pressure after the intervention. Thus, implementing diabetes education via telemedicine&#xa0;in circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic can help achieve the best possible compliance for strict diet adherence, regular exercise and monitoring, reducing obesity, glycosylated HbA1c, insulin doses, and risk of depression in a person with double diabetes.","Gupta, Totade, Gupta, Bamrah, Gupta, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.30533","20221123","covid-19 retro; covid-19 telemedicine; double diabetes; medical nutrition therapy; national lockdown; previous gestational diabetes mellitus; type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1d); weight loss and obesity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41419,""
"Lifestyle behaviors and mental health during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic among college students: a web-based study","After emerging in China, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly spread to all parts of the country and became a global public health emergency. The Chinese government immediately took a series of protective and quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the virus, and these measures may have negative effects on behavior and psychological health. This study aimed to examine the associations between factors related to COVID-19 measures and mental health symptoms among Chinese college students in different pandemic areas. An online survey was administered to 14,789 college students from February 4 to 12, 2020. After excluding the participants who did not complete the questionnaire, the quality of the questionnaire was checked. Finally, the sample included 11,787 college students from 16 cities and 21 universities in China. The areas included the city of Wuhan (Area 1), the neighboring province of Hubei (Area 2), first-tier cities (Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou [Area 3]), and other provinces (Area 4). The average age of the participants was 20.51&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.88&#x2009;years. One-third of the participants were men. In total, 25.9 and 17.8% reported depression and anxiety, respectively. We also explored COVID-19-related factors, such as infection risk, perceived resistance to COVID-19 (or susceptibility to COVID-19 infection), perceived physical symptoms, family or friends, direct or indirect contact with confirmed cases, and having sought psychological counseling, which were significantly associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. Higher screen time, lower physical activity, higher soda and tea beverages (also called sugar sweetened beverages intake), use of alternative medicines or food supplements (including Chinese herbal medicines and vitamins), and decreased meal frequency were all correlated with higher depression and anxiety symptoms (depression: &#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#x2009;25.57 and anxiety: &#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#x2009;39.42). Coping with COVID-19 partially mediated the associations between some related lifestyle behaviors, anxiety, and depression. The conditional process model analysis results supported our hypotheses that lifestyle health behaviors and coping style were both predictors of anxiety and depression symptoms, and their direct and indirect effects were moderated by sex. Compared with the city of Wuhan, other epidemic areas had a lower risk of mental health problems. Lifestyle health behaviors and coping styles alleviated mental health symptoms. COVID-19-related social stressors were positively associated with mental health symptoms.","Zhang, Tao, Qu, Mou, Gan, Zhou, Zhu, Wu, Tao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14598-4","20221122","Aanxiety; Ccollege students; Ccoronavirus disease 2019; Ddepression; Lifestyle health behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41420,""

"Determinants of depressive symptoms increase in older persons during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from Czech cohort study using repeated assessments","Numerous studies reported higher levels of mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic but only a minority used repeated measurements. We investigated change in depressive symptoms in the Czech ageing cohort and the impact of pre-existing and COVID-19-related stressors. We used data on 2853 participants (mean age 73.4 years) from the Czech part of the prospective Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe cohort that participated in postal questionnaire surveys before (September 2017-June 2018) and during the pandemic (October 2020-April 2021). Participants reported their depressive symptoms using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale including 10 (CESD-10) tool. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to create representative components of the pandemic-related stressors. The impact of the stressors on change in depressive symptoms was tested using multivariable linear regression, after adjustment for age and potential confounders. Three patterns of the pandemic-related stressors ('financial stressors', 'social and perception stressors' and 'death and hospitalisation stressors') were extracted from the PCA. The mean CESD-10 score increased from 4.90 to 5.37 (p&lt;0.001). In fully adjusted models, significantly larger increases in depression score were reported by older people (&#x3b2;=0.052; p=0.006), those with poor self-rated health (&#x3b2;=0.170; p&lt;0.001), those who experienced death or hospitalisation of a close person (&#x3b2;=0.064; p&lt;0.001), social deprivation (&#x3b2;=0.057; p&lt;0.001), delays in healthcare (&#x3b2;=0.048; p=0.005) and those who suffered from COVID-19 (&#x3b2;=0.045; p=0.008). This study confirms an increase in depressive symptoms in older persons during the pandemic and identified several pandemic-related risk factors suggesting that public health policies should address this vulnerable group by adopting the preventing strategies.","Daleck&#xe1;, Pikhart, Barto&#x161;kov&#xe1;, &#x10c;apkov&#xe1;, Bob&#xe1;k","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2022-219412","20221122","COVID-19; aging; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41423,""
"'All we've ever known is Covid': A follow-up study with newly qualified nurses who worked as student nurses during the pandemic","To explore the experiences of nursing students in England who had worked through the first wave and transitioned to qualification in the ongoing pandemic. Experiences of health professionals and student nurses during the pandemic are now well documented, but the transition of students to qualification is less well understood. In Summer 2020, we interviewed 16 student nurses who had worked as health care assistants on paid extended placements as part of the COVID-19 response in the East of England, finding surprisingly positive experiences, including perceived heightened preparedness for qualification. A year later, we re-interviewed 12 participants from the original study to hear about transitioning to qualification during the ongoing pandemic. This study provides novel insights into their experiences. A qualitative study design was used. Twelve newly qualified nurses who had participated in the original study took part in qualitative, online interviews where they shared their experiences of working and transitioning to qualification during the ongoing pandemic since we spoke to them a year earlier. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. COREQ guidelines were used in developing and reporting this study. Three themes were identified. Constant change: in the clinical environment and arising out of the transition to newly qualified nurse, mental health and well-being and reflecting on the past to learn for the future. Participants experienced a unique transition to qualification. The perceived heightened preparedness for qualification that participants who had worked as students during the first wave of the pandemic had become a reality, ameliorating some of the known effects of transition. However, increased expectations and added responsibilities in extremely busy, fluctuating clinical environments with minimal support add weight to calls for mandatory preceptorship programmes. While heightened resilience was evident, provision of ongoing mental health and well-being support is strongly recommended. We need a partnership approach with nurse educators and practice colleagues which ensures preparation for qualified practice is appropriate. If we do not effectively prepare students for qualified nurse posts, patient care will almost certainly be compromised.","Godbold, Whiting, Adams, Chokeepermal-Naidu","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16591","20221122","COVID-19; interviews; mental health; nursing graduate; nursing student; preceptorship; qualitative research; registered nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41424,""
"Aetiological and prognostic roles of frailty, multimorbidity and socioeconomic characteristics in the development of SARS-CoV-2 health outcomes: protocol for systematic reviews of population-based studies","There is growing evidence that the impact of COVID-19 crisis may be stronger for individuals with multimorbidity, frailty and lower socioeconomic status. Existing reviews focus on few, mainly short-term effects of COVID-19 illness and patients with single chronic disease. Information is also largely missing for population representative samples.Applying population-based approach, the systematic reviews will have two objectives: (1) to evaluate the aetiological roles of frailty, multimorbidity and socioeconomic status on SARS-CoV-2 infection probability, hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and COVID-19 related mortality among general population and (2) to investigate the prognostic roles of frailty, multimorbidity and socioeconomic characteristics on the risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, COVID-19 mortality, functioning, quality of life, disability, mental health and work absence. For this ongoing work, four databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease and PsycINFO, for the period between January 2020 and April 7 2021. Peer-reviewed published literature in English and all types of population-based studies will be considered. Studies using standard tools to assess multimorbidity such as disease count, comorbidity indices or disease combinations will be retained, as well as studies with standard scales and scores for frailty or measurement of a socioeconomic gradient. Initial search included 10 139 articles, 411 for full-text reading. Results will be summarised by risk factor, objective and outcome. The feasibility of meta-analysis will be determined by the findings and will aim to better understand uncertainties of the results. Quality of studies will be assessed using standardised scales. The study will be based on published evidence, and it is exempt from the ethical approval. This work is part of the Population Health Information Research Infrastructure (PHIRI) project.

"Selling one's future: over-indebtedness and the risk of poor mental health and the role of precarious employment - results from the Scania Public Health Cohort, Sweden","The credit market has expanded rapidly, increasing the risk of over-indebtedness among those who lack secure employment or adequate income, an issue of concern in the COVID-19 aftermath. We investigated the role of over-indebtedness for developing poor mental health, and whether this impact is modified by age, gender, educational level or being in precarious employment. This is a cohort study using data from the Swedish Scania Public Health Cohort, based on individuals randomly selected from the general adult population in Scania, southern Sweden, initiated in 1999/2000 (response rate 58%) with follow-ups in 2005 and 2010. Over-indebtedness was assessed by combining information on cash margin and difficulty in paying household bills. Mental health was assessed by General Health Questionnaire-12. Those with poor mental health at baseline were excluded, and the analyses were further restricted to vocationally active individuals with complete data on main variables, resulting in 1256 men and 1539&#x2009;women. Over-indebtedness was more common among women, among persons with a low educational level, born abroad and with a precarious employment at baseline. The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for poor mental health in 2010 among individuals exposed to over-indebtedness in 1999/2000 or 2005 was 2.2 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.8). Adjusting for educational level, country of origin and precarious employment in 1999/2000 or 2005, yielded an IRR of 2.0 (95%&#x2009;CI 1.6 to 2.6). An interaction analysis indicated that a high level of education may act synergistically with over-indebtedness, regarding poor mental health among men. Over-indebtedness was related to unfavourable societal power relations, regarding social class, gender and foreign birth. Precarious employment was independently linked to poor mental health and may also mediate the effect by over-indebtedness. The COVID-19 pandemic might entail increased over-indebtedness, which should be acknowledged in policies aiming at buffering social effects of the pandemic.","&#xd6;stergren, Bodin, Canivet, Moghaddassi, Vilhelmsson","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061797","20221122","EPIDEMIOLOGY; Health policy; MENTAL HEALTH; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41426,""
"Chatbot-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Adolescents With Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Feasibility and Acceptability Study","Symptoms of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm have escalated among adolescents to crisis levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, primary care providers (PCPs) are often called on to provide first-line care for these youth. Digital health interventions can extend mental health specialty care, but few are evidence based. We evaluated the feasibility of delivering an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) app with an embedded conversational agent to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to symptomatic adolescents presenting in primary care settings during the pandemic. In this 12-week pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering the app-based intervention to adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with moderate depressive symptoms who were treated in a practice-based research network (PBRN) of academically affiliated primary care clinics. We also obtained preliminary estimates of app acceptability, effectiveness, and usability. This small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated depressive symptom severity in adolescents randomized to the app or to a wait list control condition. The primary end point was depression severity at 4-weeks, measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data on acceptability, feasibility, and usability were collected from adolescents and their parent or legal guardian. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PCPs from 11 PBRN clinics to identify facilitators and barriers to incorporating mental health apps in treatment planning for adolescents with depression and anxiety. The pilot randomized 18 participants to the app (n=10, 56%) or to a wait list control condition (n=8, 44%); 17 participants were included in the analysis, and 1 became ineligible upon chart review due to lack of eligibility based on documented diagnosis. The overall sample was predominantly female (15/17, 88%), White (15/17, 88%), and privately insured (15/17, 88%). Mean PHQ-9 scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 points in the active treatment group (representing a shift in mean depression score from moderate to mild symptom severity categories) and 2 points in the wait list control group (no shift in symptom severity category). Teen- and parent-reported usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the app was high. PCPs reported preference for introducing mHealth interventions like the one in this study early in the course of care for individuals presenting with mild or moderate symptoms. In this small study, we demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of using a CBT-based chatbot for adolescents presenting with moderate depressive symptoms in a network of PBRN-based primary care clinics. This pilot study could not establish effectiveness, but our results suggest that further study in a larger pediatric population is warranted. Future study inclusive of rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and underrepresented communities is needed to establish generalizability of effectiveness and identify implementation-related adaptations needed to promote broader uptake in pediatric primary care.

"Pandemic Loneliness in Healthcare Workers Does It Predict Later Psychological Distress?","Increased loneliness associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has been widely reported, with healthcare workers at increased risk compared to the general population. Pre-pandemic research indicates that loneliness has long-term detrimental effects on mental well-being, but the effect of loneliness in the context of COVID-19 is not clear. We conducted an online survey of healthcare workers (HCWs) at a large teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia after the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. Over one-third experienced loneliness at the peak of the first wave. An observed association with high psychological distress in subsequent months was attenuated after adjusting for status of mental well-being during the peak and before the pandemic. Mental well-being during the peak of the pandemic and, to a lesser extent, mental well-being before the pandemic were the strongest predictors of later distress. Increased conflict at home was also predictive of later distress. The mental health of HCWs is an important consideration at any time and is especially so in the face of crises such as the current global pandemic. Strategies to enhance baseline mental well-being and bolster well-being during crisis situations should assist HCWs cope with unexpected stressors and reduce the associated detrimental psychological consequences.","Stubbs, Achat","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221139719","20221122","COVID-19 pandemic; loneliness; mental health; mental well-being; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41428,""
"Mental Health of Nurses Working in a Judicial Psychiatry Hospital during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy: An Online Survey","The onset of this new pandemic has highlighted the numerous critical issues at the organizational level, which involve both national healthcare and the judicial system. For this reason, nurses working in prisons may exhibit a poor quality of life, mainly related to their high level of work stress. This cross-sectional survey aimed to assess the emotional state of nurses working in the Judicial Psychiatry Hospital of Barcellona PG (Messina, Italy) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection occurred twice: from 1 April to 20 May 2020 (i.e., during the Italian lockdown) and from 15 October to 31 December 2021 (during the second wave). At baseline, the 35 enrolled nurses presented medium to high levels of stress. At T1, they had a reduction in perceived personal achievement (MBI-PR <i>p</i> = 0.01), an increase in emotional exhaustion (MBI-EE <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), and stress (PSS <i>p</i> = 0.03), as well as anxiety (STAI Y1/Y2 <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Most participants underlined the high usability of the online system (SUS: 69.50/SD 19.9). We also found increased stress, anxiety, and burnout risk in nursing staff. The study clearly demonstrates that the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy caused a worsening of mental health among nurses working in prisons. We believe that monitoring the mental state of healthcare professionals is fundamental to improving their quality of life and healthcare services.","La Rosa, Maggio, Cannav&#xf2;, Tripoli, Di Mauro, Casella, Rao, Manuli, Calabr&#xf2;","https://doi.org/10.3390/medsci10040061","20221123","Maslach Burnout Inventory; burnout; prisons; work stress; Humans; Mental Health; COVID-19; Pandemics; Quality of Life; Cross-Sectional Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Surveys and Questionnaires; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41429,""
"Effectiveness of an Advanced Naloxone Training, Simulation, and Assessment of Second-Year Pharmacy Students","<i>Background:</i> Opioid overdoses continue to be one of the most urgent public health priorities. In 2020, reported overdose deaths in the United States reached a high of over 93,000 cases. As the COVID-19 pandemic and opioid crisis continues to be addressed, life-saving agents must be more widely accessible to those with a high overdose risk. An essential step to increasing access is to train student pharmacists to dispense naloxone. Once licensed, the number of personnel authorized to dispense naloxone can increase. <i>Objectives:</i> To design a training program to educate second-year pharmacy (P2) students on furnishing naloxone under a state protocol. <i>Methods:</i> A multi-phased curriculum-based naloxone training program was delivered to P2 students and included lecture-based education, team-based learning (TBL) applications, case-based scenarios, and summative assessments to improve student knowledge and confidence in furnishing naloxone. Students were surveyed on their knowledge and confidence with naloxone prior to training, after the in-class training and TBL applications and after three assessments. Assessments included simulated patient counseling, case-based scenarios, and proper dispensing of naloxone in a community pharmacy simulation lab. <i>Results:</i> A total of 185 student pharmacists completed the naloxone training program and 68 completed all three surveys. Average scores for naloxone assessments were 83% for the APPS lab patient case, 90.5% for the prescription label typed for the naloxone product, and 88.5% for patient counseling. Statistically significant increases in knowledge-based quiz-like scores (42.1% after training vs. 7.2% after assessment) and in the proportion of students affirmatively answering survey questions after training and assessment was observed. <i>Conclusion:</i> Multi-phase curriculum-based naloxone training program improved pharmacy student knowledge and confidence in furnishing naloxone under a state BOP protocol.","Courtney, Kreys, Luu, Kreys, Vinall, Quang, Titus-Lay","https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy10060153","20221122","curriculum; naloxone; opioids; overdose; pharmacy students; protocol; team-based learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41430,""

The so-called long or post-COVID syndrome affects the quality of life of patients and can lead to severe physical impairments. There are currently no suitable therapies for the treatment of long/post-COVID. A 49-year-old patient with post-COVID was admitted to a specialized clinic to carry out a multimodal therapy approach in the event of a therapy-resistant course. In addition to pronounced fatigue, sleep disorders, inner restlessness, and depression were seen in the patients' high levels of suffering. A naturopathic complex therapy including systemic whole-body hyperthermia was carried out. Well-being and physical well-being were recorded using the visual analog scale, and depression was recorded using the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-D). There was close monitoring of the vital parameters, and an evaluation of the therapy result was performed. The implementation of a naturopathic complex therapy including systemic whole-body hyperthermia was able to significantly improve the mental state, physical well-being, and mood of the patient.

In this study, we present people's perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), level of government trust, and their psychological distress during the pandemic for examining the impact of peoples' COVID-19 perceptions on their mental health. This cross-sectional study was conducted through a telephone survey in Taiwan in April 2020. Participants were randomly selected for telephone screening using a computer-assisted telephone interviewer system. A total of 1098 participants aged more than 20 years participated in the survey. The mean age of participants was 47.7 &#xb1; 16.4 years. After controlling for covariates, participants who were worried about contracting COVID-19, those who believed that they had a chance of being infected with COVID-19, those who were reluctant to visit the hospital for fear of contracting the virus, those who felt that the pandemic had affected their daily life, and those with low levels of trust in the government's capacity to manage the pandemic had anxiety, hostility, depression, interpersonal sensitivity/inferiority, and psychological symptoms. People's perception of COVID-19 and public's trust in the government's ability to respond to the pandemic are related to psychological distress. Although the Taiwanese government may have undertaken effective epidemic control measures to address with the COVID-19 pandemic, this crisis may have still caused mental health problems in the general population.

"An exploratory study of a hands-on naloxone training for rural clinicians and staff","Since the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in fentanyl-combined drugs has led to a surge in opioid overdose deaths in the United States. Higher opioid overdose mortality rates are problematic in rural communities, and there are few prevention, treatment, and recovery resources for individuals experiencing opioid use disorder. This exploratory project aimed to investigate a hands-on naloxone training for rural clinicians and staff. Rural clinicians and staff at two behavioral health centers were recruited to participate in a 30-min lecture and 30-min hands-on intranasal naloxone training using a low-fidelity mannequin. A pre-post opioid knowledge questionnaire, rubric based on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration toolkit, and investigator-generated survey were used to evaluate opioid knowledge and response, demonstration of intranasal naloxone administration, and participants' perceptions of the training. Enrollment characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were used to assess mean differences. Of the nine participants in the project, seven (87.5%) were female and six (75.0%) were Black. Four participants assumed a therapist role, attained a MS or MA degree, and had 5 or more years of experience working in healthcare. The total mean rubric score for all participants was 96.0 (SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.8). No significant pre-post mean differences among opioid knowledge, overdose risk, and overdose response categories were found, all p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05. However, post-intervention mean scores were slightly higher in all categories except overdose risk. Most participants (77.8%) responded that they felt comfortable handling an opioid situation and teaching the training to community members. Open-ended responses indicated that participants liked the demonstrations, examples used, hands-on nature of the training, and the presentation materials. A hands-on naloxone training is beneficial for training rural clinicians and staff to respond to opioid overdose. This training may be a promising solution to reduce response time between recognition of opioid symptoms and administration of the life-saving medication, naloxone.

"Factors associated with insomnia and suicidal thoughts among outpatients, healthcare workers, and the general population in Taiwan during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","Insomnia and suicidal thoughts are two of the negative impacts that have been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying the factors that contribute to these psychological problems may help develop strategies to sustain the&#xa0;mental health of the public. The present study examined the psychosocial impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic among different populations in Taiwan, and investigated the relationships between these psychosocial variables, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts. Between September 2020 and May 2021, online questionnaires including psychometrically validated scales were distributed to a convenience sample of outpatients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;205), healthcare workers (HCWs) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;500), and individuals in the general population (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1200) in Taiwan to collect data regarding their insomnia severity, suicidal thoughts, fear of COVID-19, trust of information, and resilience. Multivariate logistic regression methods were used to identify variables associated with suicidal thoughts and insomnia. Greater fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with suicidal thoughts: odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.155 (1.002-1.330) for outpatients; 1.127 (1.035-1.228) for HCWs; and 1.100 (1.130-1.222) for those in the general population. Higher resilience was significantly associated with lower insomnia: OR (95% CI)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.819 (0.725-0.926) for outpatients; 0.803 (0.728-0.887), for HCWs; 0.829 (0.785-0.875), and for those in the general population. In addition, there was a statistically significant association between insomnia diagnosis and greater fear of COVID-19 among HCWs (OR [95% CI]&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.102 [1.062-1.144]) and those in the general population (OR [95% CI]&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.079 [1.053-1.106]). Among outpatients, there was a statistically significant association between suicidal thoughts and lower trust of information (OR [95% CI]&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.794 [0.646-0.976]), while among those in the general population there was a statistically significant association between suicidal thoughts and higher insomnia severity (OR [95% CI]&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.175 [1.13-1.222]). A statistically significant association was also found between insomnia diagnosis and higher suicidal thoughts among those in the general population (OR [95% CI]&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.455 [2.338-5.106]). Trust of information, fear, and resilience were important factors for suppressing suicidal thoughts&#xa0;and insomnia among the three study populations.

"Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Epidemiology, Mechanism, and Treatment","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an adverse impact on the physical and mental health of the public worldwide. In addition to illness in patients with COVID-19, isolated people and the general population have experienced mental health problems due to social distancing policies, mandatory lockdown, and other psychosocial factors, and the prevalence of depression and anxiety significantly increased during the pandemic. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the epidemiology, contributing factors, and pathogenesis of depression and anxiety. during the pandemic. These findings indicate that physicians and psychiatrists should pay more attention to and identify those with a high risk for mental problems, such as females, younger people, unmarried people, and those with a low educational level. In addition, researchers should focus on identifying the neural and neuroimmune mechanisms involved in depression and anxiety, and assess the intestinal microbiome to identify effective biomarkers.

"[Consequences of the COVID-19 measures for wellbeing aspects of long-term care residents]","To examine the impact of COVID-19 measures on residents of long-term care institutions, two surveys were conducted in the spring of 2020. Leontjevas et al. (study 1) inventoried practitioners' opinions, Van der Roest et al. (study 2) opinions of care workers, family, and residents without severe cognitive impairments. This article describes the combined results on social interaction and loneliness, challenging behaviour and mood, and lessons learned. In study 1, an online survey distributed to nursing home psychologists, they were asked to complete it anonymously and share the link with their fellow elderly care physicians and nurse specialists. 16 participants were then interviewed via video calling. In study 2, three hundred and fifty-seven care organizations were invited to recruit residents without severe cognitive impairments, family members and care workers for participating in a digital, anonymous survey (Study 2). The completed surveys of 323 practitioners (study 1) and 193 residents, 1609 family members and 811 employees (study 2) were included in the analyses. Social contacts of residents had changed in frequency and form compared to before the COVID-measures. Many residents experienced some loneliness during the visit ban, especially residents without cognitive impairments. There were both an increase and a decrease in challenging behaviour and affect. Several strategies used to reduce the effects of COVID-19 measures on well-being, were considered maintainable. Our studies confirmed a major impact of the COVID-19 measures on the wellbeing of long-term care residents, but also showed successful strategies of practitioners that can benefit future practice.

"Water Poverty Index: a Tool for Water Resources Management in Jordan","In terms of water resources, Jordan is considered one of the poorest countries in the world. Water resources management is one of the available options to decrease the gap between demand and resources. Water resources management requires optimum use of the available water resources taking into consideration resources availability, resources reliability, water use pattern, in addition to the socioeconomic issues. One of the most important aspects is human behaviour which has a strong impact on water management and on the ecosystem. Therefore, there is a need to follow a sustainable approach to improve the management and the understanding of the difficulties of water issues by integrating the physical, social, economic, and environmental aspects, as well as linking water issues to poverty indicator. In this paper, Water Poverty Index (WPI) will be used as a tool for water resources management. WPI was calculated based on five parameters: resources, access to water, capacity, use, and the environment. The Jordanian water strategy targets will be used to forecast the water situation in 2025 and calculate WPI. In 2002, the WPI was calculated and found at 46.3%, in comparison with higher figures for other countries. WPI was calculated for the year 2018, and the results showed a value of 50.7%. If the national water strategy targets and improvements will be successfully implemented, by 2025, the value is expected to be increased to 56.38%. Water resources are the most sensitive component of WPI. COVID-19 increased the rate of unemployment and poverty ratio which will affect WPI negatively. It's concluded that WPI could be used as a valuable indicator to help evaluate the running plans and monitor the management performance.","Alqatarneh, Al-Zboon","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05892-3","20221122","Consumption; Jordan; Water Poverty Index; Water budget; Water scarcity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41440,""
"Delta and Omicron: protective measures and SARS-CoV-2 infections in day care centres in Germany in the 4th and 5th wave of the pandemic 2021/2022","During the five waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic so far, German early childhood education and care (ECEC) centres implemented various protective measures, such as wearing a face mask, fixed children-staff groups or regular ventilation. In addition, parents and ECEC staff were increasingly vaccinated throughout 2021. During the 4th wave, variant of concern (VOC) Delta-driven transmission indicators reached record values at the end of 2021. Those values were even exceeded in the 5th wave at the beginning of 2022 when Omicron dominated. We examine which factors facilitated or prevented infection with SARS-CoV-2 in ECEC centres, and if these differed between different phases within wave 4 (Delta) and 5 (Omicron). Since August 2020, a weekly online survey among approximately 8000 ECEC managers has been conducted, monitoring both incident SARS-CoV-2 infections and protective measures taken. We included data from calendar week 26/2021 to 05/2022. We estimate the probability of any infections and the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, parents and staff using random-effect-within-between (REWB) panel models for binomial and count data. While children, parents and staff of ECEC centres with a high proportion of children from families with low socioeconomic status (SES) have a higher risk of infections in the beginning of wave 4 (OR up to 1.99 [1.56; 2.56]), this effect diminishes for children and parents with rising incidences. Protective measures, such as wearing face masks, tend to have more extensive effects with rising incidences in wave 5 (IRR up to 0.87 [0.8; 0.93]). Further, the protective effect of vaccination against infection among staff is decreasing from wave 4 to wave 5 (OR 0.3 [0.16; 0.55] to OR 0.95, [0.84; 1.07, n.s.]). The degree of transmission from staff to child and from staff to parent is decreasing from wave 4 to wave 5, while transmission from child to staff seems to increase. While Omicron seems to affect children and parents from ECEC centres with families with all SES levels more equally than Delta, the protective effect of vaccination against infection is decreasing and the effect of protective measures like face masks becomes increasingly important. In order to prevent massive closures of ECEC centres due to infection of staff, protective measures should be strictly adhered to, especially to protect staff in centres with a high proportion of children from families with low socioeconomic status.","Neuberger, Grgic, Buchholz, Maly-Motta, Fackler, Lehfeld, Haas, Kalicki, Kuger","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14521-x","20221121","COVID-19; Early childhood education and care (ECEC); Germany; SARS-CoV-2; Child; Humans; Child, Preschool; Pandemics; COVID-19; Day Care, Medical; SARS-CoV-2; Germany","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41441,""
"COVID-19-related anxiety and lifestyle changes","This study aimed to identify factors that affect lifestyle changes and focused on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related anxiety since the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. Data from 213,848 individuals from the 2020 Korean Community Health Survey were analyzed using a complex sampling design. Descriptive statistics, <i>t</i>-tests, one-way ANOVA, and multiple regression analyses were performed. Participants reported a high level of COVID-19-related anxiety, with a score of 19.28 out of 25. The score of healthy behavioral change index was -0.51, indicating negative changes in physical activity, dietary habits, and sleep patterns. A slight positive change was reported for addictive behavioral change index, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, at 0.27 scores, indicating a decrease in these behaviors. COVID-19-related anxiety was an important factor that negatively affected health behavior. The high-risk groups that were vulnerable to anxiety included older adults and those who have little social support or few social encounters. Thus, identifying high-risk groups with the potential for worsened health behavior and providing interventions to reduce the anxiety caused by COVID-19 are necessary.","Han, Jang, Ko","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.886137","20221121","addictive behavior; anxiety; coronavirus (COVID-19); healthy behavior; lifestyle; Humans; Aged; COVID-19; Life Style; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Health Behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41442,""
"COVID-19 mortality rate determinants in selected Eastern European countries","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused increased mortality worldwide. We noticed a tendency for higher number of deaths in Eastern European countries. Therefore, we decided to investigate whether any common factor that might be responsible for the increased COVID-19 mortality exists. In our cross-sectional study, we conducted the correlation and multiple regression analysis using R basing on the data gathered in publicly available databases. In the analysis, we included variables such as: number of deaths, number of new cases, number of hospitalizations, number of ICU (intensive care units) patients, number of vaccinations, number of boosters, number of fully vaccinated individuals, stringency index, number of reported COVID-19 variant cases, and number of flights. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of population density and median age in particular European countries on total number of COVID-19 deaths. Analyzed data represents periods from start of the COVID-19 pandemic in particular Eastern European Countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, while as the end of the study the day of January 31, 2022 is considered. Results were considered statistically significant at p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05. Our study showed that mortality rate reflects the number of COVID-19 cases (e.g. for Poland was 0.0058, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), number of hospitalized patients (e.g. for Poland 0.0116, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and patients in intensive care (e.g. for Slovakia 0.2326, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Stringency index corresponding to level of introduced restrictions and vaccination can affect the mortality rate of COVID-19 in a country-dependent manner: e.g. for Romania 0.0006, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; whereas in Lithuania -&#x2009;0.0002, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001. Moreover, occurrence of B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 variants increased COVID-19 mortality rates.

Additionally, our study shows that COVID-19 vaccination proven successful in COVID-19 mortality prevention.","Sobczak, Pawliczak","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14567-x","20221121","COVID-19; Coronavirus disease 2019; Eastern Europe; Mortality; Multivariable regression; SARS-CoV-2; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; COVID-19 Vaccines; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41443,""
"AMPK directly phosphorylates TBK1 to integrate glucose sensing into innate immunity","Nutrient sensing and damage sensing are two fundamental processes in living organisms. While hyperglycemia is frequently linked to diabetes-related vulnerability to microbial infection, how body glucose levels affect innate immune responses to microbial invasion is not fully understood. Here, we surprisingly found that viral infection led to a rapid and dramatic decrease in blood glucose levels in rodents, leading to robust AMPK activation. AMPK, once activated, directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511, which triggers IRF3 recruitment and the assembly of MAVS or STING signalosomes. Consistently, ablation or inhibition of AMPK, knockin of TBK1-S511A, or increased glucose levels compromised nucleic acid sensing, while boosting AMPK-TBK1 cascade by AICAR or TBK1-S511E knockin improves antiviral immunity substantially in various animal models. Thus, we identify TBK1 as an AMPK substrate, reveal the molecular mechanism coupling a dual sensing of glucose and nuclei acids, and report its physiological necessity in antiviral defense.","Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Wu, Yu, Zhou, Meng, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Wang, Li, Huang, Huang, Zou, Qin, Liang, Feng, Lin, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2022.10.026","20221117","AMPK; TBK1; antiviral immunity; cGAS-STING; coronavirus; glucose metabolism; hyperglycemia; innate immunity; viral infection; virus-host interactions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41444,""
"Stability Study of mRNA-Lipid Nanoparticles Exposed to Various Conditions Based on the Evaluation between Physicochemical Properties and Their Relation with Protein Expression Ability","Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently in the spotlight as delivery systems for mRNA therapeutics and have been used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. mRNA-LNP formulations have been indicated to require strict control, including maintenance at fairly low temperatures during their transport and storage. Since it is a new pharmaceutical modality, there is a lack of information on the systematic investigation of how storage and handling conditions affect the physicochemical properties of mRNA-LNPs and their protein expression ability. In this study, using the mRNA-LNPs with standard composition, we evaluated the effects of temperature, cryoprotectants, vibration, light exposure, and syringe aspiration from the vials on the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles in relation to their in vitro/in vivo protein expression ability. Among these factors, storage at -80 &#xb0;C without a cryoprotectant caused a decrease in protein expression, which may be attributed to particle aggregation. Exposure to vibration and light also caused similar changes under certain conditions. Exposure to these factors can occur during laboratory and hospital handling. It is essential to have sufficient knowledge of the stability of mRNA-LNPs in terms of their physical properties and protein expression ability at an early stage to ensure reproducible research and development and medical care.","Kamiya, Matsumoto, Yamashita, Izumi, Kawaguchi, Mizukami, Tsurumaru, Mukai, Kawakami","https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics14112357","20221111","mRNA-LNP; stability; storage condition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41445,""
"Antiviral Potential of Plants against COVID-19 during Outbreaks-An Update","Several human diseases are caused by viruses, including cancer, Type I diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the past, people have suffered greatly from viral diseases such as polio, mumps, measles, dengue fever, SARS, MERS, AIDS, chikungunya fever, encephalitis, and influenza. Recently, COVID-19 has become a pandemic in most parts of the world. Although vaccines are available to fight the infection, their safety and clinical trial data are still questionable. Social distancing, isolation, the use of sanitizer, and personal productive strategies have been implemented to prevent the spread of the virus. Moreover, the search for a potential therapeutic molecule is ongoing. Based on experiences with outbreaks of SARS and MERS, many research studies reveal the potential of medicinal herbs/plants or chemical compounds extracted from them to counteract the effects of these viral diseases. COVID-19's current status includes a decrease in infection rates as a result of large-scale vaccination program implementation by several countries. But it is still very close and needs to boost people's natural immunity in a cost-effective way through phytomedicines because many underdeveloped countries do not have their own vaccination facilities. In this article, phytomedicines as plant parts or plant-derived metabolites that can affect the entry of a virus or its infectiousness inside hosts are described. Finally, it is concluded that the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants must be analyzed and evaluated entirely in the control of COVID-19 in cases of uncontrollable SARS infection.","Jamal","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232113564","20221114","COVID-19; MERS; SARS; antiviral; medicinal plants; Humans; COVID-19; Antiviral Agents; SARS-CoV-2; Disease Outbreaks; Virus Diseases; Plants, Medicinal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41446,""
"Cellular Immuno-Profile in Septic Human Host: A Scoping Review","Innate and adaptive immune system cells play a critical role in the host response to sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening disease characterized by apoptosis-induced depletion of immune cells and immunodepression, which contribute to morbidity and mortality. Many alterations in the expression of surface markers of neutrophils and monocytes have been described in septic patients. The aim of this study was to inspect the recently published literature to inform the clinician about the most up-to-date techniques for the study of circulating leukocytes. The impact on cell phenotypes and on the function of leukocytes of extracorporeal and non-blood purification treatments proposed for sepsis were also analyzed. We conducted a systematic review using Pubmed/Medline, Ovid/Willey, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and EMBASE, combining key terms related to immunological function in sepsis and selected the most relevant clinical trials and review articles (excluding case reports) published in the last 50 years. The most important alteration in neutrophils during sepsis is that they activate an anti-apoptotic survival program. In septic monocytes, a reduced characteristic expression of HLA-DR is observed, but their role does not seem to be significantly altered in sepsis. As regards adaptive immunity, sepsis leads to lymphopenia and immunosuppression in patients with septic shock; this process involves all types of T cells (CD4, CD8 and Natural Killer), except for regulatory T cells, which retain their function. Several promising therapies that target the host immune response are currently under evaluation. During the worldwide pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, it was useful to study the ""cytokine storm"" to find additional treatments, such as the oXiris<sup>&#xae;</sup> filter. This therapy can decrease the concentration of inflammatory markers that affect the severity of the disease.","Zanza, Caputo, Tornatore, Romenskaya, Piccioni, Franceschi, Artico, Taurone, Savioli, Longhitano","https://doi.org/10.3390/biology11111626","20221111","COVID-19; blood purification; flow cytometry; immune cells; inflammation; lymphocytes; monocytes; neutrophils; sepsis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41447,""
"Occupational balance, changes in occupations and psychological well-being of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Occupational balance (OB) is related to physical health as well as physical and psychological well-being (PWB). The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the occupations of people probably affecting their OB and PWB. The aim of the study was to determine OB of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and establish relationships between a. OB and changes in occupations in comparison with the pre-pandemic period as perceived by the study group, b. OB and PWB. An exploratory study was performed using a cross-sectional research design during the second wave of the pandemic in November 2020. 1,330 university students aged 18-30 took part in the study. The Occupational Balance Questionnaire and the Psychological General Well-Being Index were used. Three-Way ANOVA as well as Forward Stepwise Regression analyses were used, and &#x3c1; Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated. A greater OB was found in men, people studying in a small city and first year students. The respondents declared changes in the time spent on almost all occupations, especially an increase in the time spent on using the Internet and passive resting, but a decrease in the time of meetings friends. OB positively correlated with the increase in time spent on almost all occupations, except for the Internet and with PWB. Polish university students observe that the COVID-19 pandemic has changed their daily occupations. Some of these changes may adversely affect their OB and, consequently, PWB. Occupational therapists should increase students' awareness of the importance of OB, support them in pursuing their hobbies, meeting friends, and getting sufficient sleep and physical activity.","Guszkowska, D&#x105;browska-Zimakowska","https://doi.org/10.1080/11038128.2022.2143892","20221110","Balance in daily activities; coronavirus; mental state; undergraduate and graduate student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41448,""
"The Impact of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) on Bone Remodeling Marker Osteoprotegerin (OPG) in Post-COVID-19 Iraqi Patients","Introduction As COVID-19&#xa0;affects human genes in several types of peripheral tissue, numerous disorders occur after recovery. The virus enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors that affect bone remodeling, leading to osteopenia or osteoporosis, which is characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD). The adult skeleton undergoes about 10% remodeling annually, which is crucial for preventing fatigue damage and preserving calcium homeostasis. An imbalance in the rates of bone production and resorption causes bone loss. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is one of the regulators involved in the bone remodeling mechanism, it decreases the activity of NF-B receptors that activates the receptor activators of NF-B ligand (RANKL) pathway, which maintains the bone homeostasis balance. This study aims to find out the disruption of bone homeostasis balance in Iraqi post-COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods It is a case-control study that includes 130 Iraqi subjects enrolled. They were divided into two groups - the first group consisted of 80 post-COVID-19 infection patients, while the second group consisted of 50 who were not infected with COVID-19. Also, the levels of ACE-2 and OPG&#xa0;were measured in the serum by the ELISA technique. The BMD was measured&#xa0;by the DEXA scan technique. Results This study found that there is an effect of coronavirus infection on the bone strength measured by the Mean of the OPG&#xa0;level, which was found to be highly significant in the serum of post-COVID-19 patients when compared with non-COVID-19 subjects (P-value = 0.001), but the Mean of ACE-2 level was statistically non-significant between the two groups (P-value = 0.13). Also, the BMD of post-COVID-19 patients that was measured by DEXA scan had a statistically highly significant T-score% between the two groups. Conclusion The current study found that there was an effect of COVID-19 on the bone remodeling mechanism, which may be causing osteopenia or osteoporosis for Iraqi subjects enrolled in the current study. Also, analyzing the OPG level in the serum could be helpful in predicting low BMD.","Al-Azzawi, Mohammed","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29926","20221110","ace-2; covid-19; dexa scan; opg; osteoporosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41449,""
"CEO duality and firm performance during the 2020 coronavirus outbreak","Stewardship theory suggests that CEO duality can provide strong leadership and facilitate the development and coordination of firm strategy. These benefits should affect firm risk and financial performance, particularly when the firm has high information-gathering costs. We use the 2020 coronavirus outbreak as a natural experiment to determine whether CEO duality is beneficial during crisis periods. We find that in 2020, S&amp;P 1500 firms with CEO duality exhibit smaller increases in default probability risk than firms with non-duality in the presence of high information costs. Firms with CEO duality experience a smaller decrease in profitability when information costs are high. We also find that firms with CEO duality offer cumulative abnormal returns significantly higher than those of other firms. CEO duality is more valuable in firms with higher information costs. Our results indicate that CEO duality is valuable during crisis periods, particularly when information costs are high. These results are consistent with stewardship theory and indicate that the concentration of power from CEO duality is beneficial during crisis periods.","Hassan, Houston, Karim, Sabit","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeca.2022.e00278","20221110","CEO duality; COVID-19; Default probability; Firm performance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41450,""
"The resurgence risk of COVID-19 in China in the presence of immunity waning and ADE: A mathematical modelling study","The mass vaccination program has been actively promoted since the end of 2020. However, waning immunity, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and increased transmissibility of variants make the herd immunity untenable and the implementation of dynamic zero-COVID policy challenging in China. To explore how long the vaccination program can prevent China at low resurgence risk, and how these factors affect the long-term trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemics, we developed a dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 incorporating vaccination and waning immunity, calibrated using the data of accumulative vaccine doses administered and the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 in mainland China. The prediction suggests that the vaccination coverage with at least one dose reach 95.87%, and two doses reach 77.92% on 31 August 2021. However, despite the mass vaccination, randomly introducing infected cases in the post-vaccination period causes large outbreaks quickly with waning immunity, particularly for SARS-CoV-2 variants with higher transmissibility. The results showed that with the current vaccination program and 50% of the population wearing masks, mainland China can be protected at low resurgence risk until 8 January 2023. However, ADE and higher transmissibility for variants would significantly shorten the low-risk period by over 1&#xa0;year. Furthermore, intermittent outbreaks can occur while the peak values of the subsequent outbreaks decrease, indicating that subsequent outbreaks boosted immunity in the population level, further indicating that follow-up vaccination programs can help mitigate or avoid the possible outbreaks. The findings revealed that the integrated effects of multiple factors: waning immunity, ADE, relaxed interventions, and higher variant transmissibility, make controlling COVID-19 challenging. We should prepare for a long struggle with COVID-19, and not entirely rely on the COVID-19 vaccine.","Zhou, Tang, Bai, Shao, Xiao, Tang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.10.043","20221121","Antibody-dependent enhancement; COVID-19; Immunity waning; Mathematical model; Resurgence risk; Vaccination; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Antibody-Dependent Enhancement; COVID-19 Vaccines; Vaccination; China","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41451,""
"I have decided about my COVID-19 vaccine, what about my child?","Vaccination has been instrumental in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, with numbers of new cases decreasing rapidly even as restrictions to control the spread of the virus were removed. The first stage of the vaccination campaign in Israel covered individuals aged 16 and older, following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of the vaccine. While the campaign was later extended to those aged 12 and older, some parents continue to have doubts and concerns about the vaccine. Data were collected via an online questionnaire during April 2021; 516 parents participated. This research adopted a holistic approach that combines factors relating to vaccine acceptance previously reported in the literature. The acceptance of pediatric COVID-19 vaccination among parents varied by their children's age groups, at 44.7%, 53.2%, and 66.4% among parents with children aged 0-6, 6-12, and 12-16, respectively. The results of this study indicate that different sets of variables affect the willingness of parents to vaccinate their children, depending on their child's age. Moreover, a holistic approach is necessary in order to correctly verify the significant variables. Parents who evaluate the vaccine as more beneficial have a higher probability of being willing to vaccinate. In addition, for ages 12-16, parental willingness to vaccinate is associated with access to information, trust, and neighborhood norms. Those evaluating information about the vaccine as more fake news show higher probability to vaccinate their children. The timing of the survey is highly relevant, especially considering the uncertainty about the effectiveness and side effects of the vaccine.","Hon Snir, Teitler Regev","https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2022.2129929","20221031","COVID-19; Child; health belief model; parental vaccination; type of vaccine information; willingness to vaccinate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41452,""
"Post COVID-19 pandemic assessment of quality of life of dental students using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire","COVID-19 bitterly jolted the lives of masses around the globe, and affected the physical, mental, health, and quality of life of majority of individuals. The aim of the study was to assess the quality of life of dental students of public and private colleges and those residing in college accommodation and own home using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. This cross-sectional study was conducted amongst 402 dental students of a private and public university. Students' T-test was used to compare the data. Relationship between gender, institute and accommodation (college accommodation or own home) was assessed by multiple linear regression. P-value of&#x200a;&lt;&#x200a;0.05 was taken significant. The participants rated their quality of life to be good (mean Score 3.99&#xb1;SD 0.93) during the post COVID-19 pandemic, while satisfaction with health was neutral to satisfactory (3.77&#xb1;SD 0.87). A significant difference regarding physical health and social relationship domains was observed between the private and public university students. Significant differences in all domains of QOL was also reported among students living in own homes verses those students utilizing college accommodation. The post COVID-19 quality of life of dental students in both private and public institutes differed with respect to physical and environmental domains. The difference was more significant among the student living in college accommodation and those living at home, which underscores that effort should be made to facilitate the students to improve their quality-of-life post pandemic so that they may be more focused on studies and perform better.","Bashir, Alam, Nayab, Fahim","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-211351","20221031","Social domain; environmental domain; health domain; mental well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41453,""
"How the COVID-19 Pandemic and its Consequences Affect the Presence of and Search for Meaning of Life: A Longitudinal Study","The presence of meaning in life (PML) and the search for meaning in life (SML) are crucial when facing difficult times. Although several theoretical frameworks have tried to explain the dynamics of meaning in life during adversity, empirical evidence about interactions among both constructs using longitudinal designs is scarce. This study examined the trajectories of both PML and SML during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Spain. In total, 220 adults fulfilled an online survey during two periods: a strict and a relaxed lockdown period. Latent growth models showed that both PML and SML declined slightly during the strict lockdown, but they reached a plateau during the relaxed lockdown. Results also showed that age and having a partner predicted higher PML and lower SML at baseline, whereas being male predicted higher scores on PML. PML and SML were negatively associated at baseline, higher SML at baseline was related to a steeper decreasing PML slope during the strict lockdown, and the PML and SML slopes in the relaxed lockdown period were negatively related.

"How long and effective does a mask protect you from an infected person who emits virus-laden particles: By implementing one-dimensional physics-based modeling","SARS-CoV-2 spreads <i>via</i> droplets, aerosols, and smear infection. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, using a facemask in different locations was recommended to slow down the spread of the virus. To evaluate facemasks' performance, masks' filtration efficiency is tested for a range of particle sizes. Although such tests quantify the blockage of the mask for a range of particle sizes, the test does not quantify the cumulative amount of virus-laden particles inhaled or exhaled by its wearer. In this study, we quantify the accumulated viruses that the healthy person inhales as a function of time, activity level, type of mask, and room condition using a physics-based model. We considered different types of masks, such as surgical masks and filtering facepieces (FFPs), and different characteristics of public places such as office rooms, buses, trains, and airplanes. To do such quantification, we implemented a physics-based model of the mask. Our results confirm the importance of both people wearing a mask compared to when only one wears the mask. The protection time for light activity in an office room decreases from 7.8 to 1.4 h with surgical mask IIR. The protection time is further reduced by 85 and 99% if the infected person starts to cough or increases the activity level, respectively. Results show the leakage of the mask can considerably affect the performance of the mask. For the surgical mask, the apparent filtration efficiency reduces by 75% with such a leakage, which cannot provide sufficient protection despite the high filtration efficiency of the mask. The facemask model presented provides key input in order to evaluate the protection of masks for different conditions in public places. The physics-based model of the facemask is provided as an online application.","Bahrami, Batt, Schudel, Annaheim, He, Wang, Rossi, Defraeye","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.991455","20221101","COVID-19; airway protection; facemask; pandemic; physics-based modeling; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemics; COVID-19; Respiratory Aerosols and Droplets; Masks; Physics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41455,""

"BCG and SARS-CoV-2-What Have We Learned?","Despite controversy over the protective effect of the BCG (Bacille Calmette-Gu&#xe9;rin) vaccine in preventing pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in adults, it has been used worldwide since 1921. Although the first reports in the 1930s had noted a remarkable decrease in child mortality after BCG immunization, this could not be explained solely by a decrease in mortality from TB. These observations gave rise to the suggestion of nonspecific beneficial effects of BCG vaccination, beyond the desired protection against <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. The existence of an innate immunity-training mechanism based on epigenetic changes was demonstrated several years ago. The emergence of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 revived the debate about whether the BCG vaccine can affect the immune response against the virus or other unrelated pathogens. Due to the mortality of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is important to verify each factor that may have a potential protective value against the severe course of COVID-19, complications, and death. This paper reviews the results of numerous retrospective studies and prospective trials which shed light on the potential of a century-old vaccine to mitigate the pandemic impact of the new virus. It should be noted, however, that although there are numerous studies intending to verify the hypothesis that the BCG vaccine may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19, there is no definitive evidence on the efficacy of the BCG vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Kulesza, Kulesza, Kozi&#x144;ski, Karpik, Broncel, Fol","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10101641","20221030","COVID-19; Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu&#xe9;rin (BCG); SARS-CoV-2; immunity; non-specific protection; trained immunity; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41457,""
"Relationship between Humoral Response in COVID-19 and Seasonal Influenza Vaccination","There is evidence that vaccination against seasonal influenza can improve innate immune responses to COVID-19 and decrease disease severity. However, less is known about whether it could also impact the humoral immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The present study aimed to compare the SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral responses (IgG antibodies against nucleocapsid; anti-N, receptor binding domain; anti-RBD, subunit S2; anti-S2, and envelope protein; anti-E) between non-hospitalized, COVID-19 unvaccinated, and mild COVID-19 convalescent patients who were and were not vaccinated against influenza during the 2019/2020 epidemic season (<i>n</i> = 489 and <i>n</i> = 292, respectively). The influenza-vaccinated group had significantly higher frequency and titers of anti-N antibodies (75 vs. 66%; mean 559 vs. 520 U/mL) and anti-RBD antibodies (85 vs. 76%; mean 580 vs. 540 U/mL). The prevalence and concentrations of anti-S2 and anti-E antibodies did not differ between groups (40-43%; mean 370-375 U/mL and 1.4-1.7%; mean 261-294 U/mL) and were significantly lower compared to those of anti-RBD and anti-N.

"Inhibition of the Cell Uptake of Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 Pseudoviruses by <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine Irrespective of the Oxidoreductive Environment","The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spikes to the cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a crucial target both in the prevention and in the therapy of COVID-19. We explored the involvement of oxidoreductive mechanisms by investigating the effects of oxidants and antioxidants on virus uptake by ACE2-expressing cells of human origin (ACE2-HEK293). The cell uptake of pseudoviruses carrying the envelope of either Delta or Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by means of a cytofluorimetric approach. The thiol <i>N</i>-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) inhibited the uptake of both variants in a reproducible and dose-dependent fashion. Ascorbic acid showed modest effects. In contrast, neither hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) nor a system-generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play an important role in the intracellular alterations produced by SARS-CoV-2, were able to affect the ability of either Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses to be internalized into ACE2-expressing cells. In addition, neither H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> nor the ROS generating system interfered with the ability of NAC to inhibit that mechanism. Moreover, based on previous studies, a preventive pharmacological approach with NAC would have the advantage of decreasing the risk of developing COVID-19, irrespective of its variants, and at the same time other respiratory viral infections and associated comorbidities.","La Maestra, Garibaldi, Balansky, D'Agostini, Micale, De Flora","https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11203313","20221028","COVID-19; N-acetyl-L-cysteine; SARS-CoV-2; ascorbic acid; cell internalization; hydrogen peroxide; reactive oxygen species; Humans; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; SARS-CoV-2; Acetylcysteine; COVID-19; Hydrogen Peroxide; Reactive Oxygen Species; Antioxidants; HEK293 Cells; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Ascorbic Acid; Oxidants; Sulfhydryl Compounds","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41459,""
"Acoustic Characteristics of Cantonese Speech Through Protective Facial Coverings","Protective facial coverings (PFCs) such as surgical masks attenuate speech transmission and affect speech intelligibility, which is reported in languages such as English and German. The present study intended to verify the detrimental impacts on production of tonal languages such as Cantonese, by examining realization of speech correlates in Cantonese under PFCs including facial masks and shields. We recorded scripted speech in Hong Kong Cantonese produced by three adult speakers who wore various PFCs, including surgical masks, KF94 masks, and face shields (with and without surgical masks). Spectral and temporal parameters were measured, including mean intensity, speaking rate, long-term amplitude spectrum, formant frequencies of vowels, and duration and fundamental frequency (F0) of tone-bearing parts. Significant changes were observed in all acoustic correlates of Cantonese speech under PFCs. Sound pressure levels were attenuated more intensely at ranges of higher frequencies in speech through face masks, whereas sound transmission was affected more at ranges of lower frequencies in speech under face shields. Vowel spaces derived from formant frequencies shrank under all PFCs, with the vowel /aa/ demonstrating largest changes in the first two formants. All tone-bearing parts were shortened and showed increments of F0 means in speech through PFCs. The decrease of tone duration was statistically significant in High-level and Low-level tones, while the increment of F0 means was significant in High-level tone only. General filtering effect of PFCs is observed in Cantonese speech data, confirming language-universal patterns in acoustic attenuation by PFCs. The various coverings lower overall intensity levels of speech and degrade speech signal in higher frequency regions. Modification patterns specific to Hong Kong Cantonese are also identified. Vowel space area is reduced and found associated with increased speaking rates. Tones are produced with higher F0s under PFCs, which may be attributed to vocal tension caused by tightened vocal tract during speaking through facial coverings.","Zhang, He, Li, Zhang, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2022.08.029","20221020","Acoustic correlates; COVID-19; Cantonese; Lexical tones; Protective facial coverings; Vowel space Introduction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41460,""
"Effects of natural polymorphisms in SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase on its activity and sensitivity to inhibitors in vitro","SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the key enzyme required for viral replication and mRNA synthesis. RdRp is one of the most conserved viral proteins and a promising target for antiviral drugs and inhibitors. At the same time, analysis of public databases reveals multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 genomes with substitutions in the catalytic RdRp subunit nsp12. Structural mapping of these mutations suggests that some of them may affect the interactions of nsp12 with its cofactors nsp7/nsp8 as well as with RNA substrates. We have obtained several mutations of these types and demonstrated that some of them decrease specific activity of RdRp in vitro, possibly by changing RdRp assembly and/or its interactions with RNA. Therefore, natural polymorphisms in RdRp may potentially affect viral replication. Furthermore, we have synthesized a series of polyphenol and diketoacid derivatives based on previously studied inhibitors of hepatitis C virus RdRp and found that several of them can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Tested mutations in RdRp do not have strong effects on the efficiency of inhibition. Further development of more efficient non-nucleoside inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp should take into account the existence of multiple polymorphic variants of RdRp.","Miropolskaya, Kozlov, Petushkov, Prostova, Pupov, Esyunina, Kochetkov, Kulbachinskiy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2022.10.007","20221122","Non-nucleoside inhibitors; RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase; RdRp mutations; SARS-CoV-2; Viral replication","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41461,""
"COVID-19-related anxieties do not decrease support for liberal democracy","The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread fear among the population. Early studies suggested that this resulted in exclusionary attitudes and increased support for discriminatory policy measures. We still lack an understanding of the longer-term, potentially erosive consequences that COVID-19-specific anxieties may carry for citizens' commitment to liberal democratic norms. In this research note, we present evidence from an original experiment in which we manipulate individuals' cognitive accessibility of their fears related to COVID-19. We implemented this experiment in Hungary and Romania - two cases where illiberal attitudes are most likely to amplify under conditions of fear - a year and a half after the outbreak of the pandemic. The results show that our intervention is successful in elevating respondents' levels of worry, anxiety and fear when thinking about infectious diseases like COVID-19. However, these emotions do not carry secondary effects on individuals' levels of right-wing authoritarianism, nationalism or outgroup hostility, nor do they affect preferences for specific discriminatory policy measures aimed to fight a potential resurgence of COVID-19.

"Association of Residence Type on Smoking in South Korean Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a National Survey","The closure of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced adolescents to stay home.

This study identified the association between the adolescents' type of residence and tobacco product use. A cross-sectional study (using data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey) examined 3774 students in 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2575 students in 2020 (during the pandemic). The participants were South Korean middle and high school students aged 13-19 years. Using multinomial logistic regression, it was shown that adolescents who lived alone or in a boarding house had a higher risk of being an e-cigarette smoker compared with those who lived with family or relatives (OR = 6.49, CI = 2.06-20.45). Living in a dormitory or orphanage also increased the risk of dual tobacco use compared with living with family (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.13-3.84). With the advent and continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, this effect became more significant in 2020 than in 2019.

"Naturally occurring spike mutations influence the infectivity and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2","Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion with respect to current vaccines and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). How naturally occurring spike mutations affect the infectivity and antigenicity of VOCs remains to be investigated. The entry efficiency of individual spike mutations was determined in vitro using pseudotyped viruses. BALB/c mice were immunized with 2-dose DNA vaccines encoding B.1.1.7, B.1.351,&#xa0;B.1.1.529&#xa0; and their single mutations. Cellular and humoral immune responses were then compared to determine the impact of individual mutations on immunogenicity. In the B.1.1.7 lineage, Del69-70 and Del 144 in NTD, A570D and P681H in SD1 and S982A and D1118H in S2 significantly increased viral entry, whereas T716I resulted in a decrease. In the B.1.351 lineage, L18F and Del 242-244 in the NTD, K417N in the RBD and A701V in S2 also increased viral entry. S982A weakened the generation of binding antibodies. All sera showed reduced cross-neutralization activity against B.1.351, B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron BA.1). S982A, L18F, and Del 242-244 hindered the induction of cross-NAbs, whereas Del 69-70, Del144, R246I, and K417N showed the opposite effects. B.1.351 elicited adequate broad cross-NAbs against both B.1.351 and B.1.617.2. All immunogens tested, however, showed low neutralization against circulating B.1.1.529. In addition, T-cell responses were unlikely affected by mutations tested&#xa0;in the spike. We conclude that&#xa0;individual spike mutations influence viral infectivity and vaccine immunogenicity. Designing VOC-targeted vaccines is likely necessary to overcome immune evasion from current vaccines and neutralizing antibodies.","Peng, Zhou, Liu, Wang, Xu, Zhao, Yang, Au, Huang, Liu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-022-00924-8","20221103","SARS-CoV-2; Single mutation; T cell responses; Variants of Concern; neutralizing antibody; vaccine immunogenicity; Animals; Humans; Mice; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; COVID-19; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mutation; Neutralization Tests; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41464,""
"COVID-19 Whole-Genome Resequencing with Redundant Tiling PCR and Subtract-Based Amplicon Normalization Successfully Characterized SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Clinical Specimens","With an increasing number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences gathered worldwide, we recognize that deletion mutants and nucleotide substitutions that may affect whole-genome sequencing are accumulating. Here, we propose an additional strategy for tiling PCR for whole-genome resequencing, which can make the pipeline robust for mutations at the primer annealing site by a redundant amplicon scheme. We further demonstrated that subtracting overrepresented amplicons from the multiplex PCR products reduced the bias of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) library, resulting in decreasing required sequencing reads per sample. We applied this sequencing strategy to clinical specimens collected in Bangladesh. More than 80% out of the 304 samples were successfully sequenced. Less than 5% were ambiguous nucleotides, and several known variants were detected. With the additional strategies presented here, we believe that whole-genome resequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples can be optimized.","Sugi, Rahman, Rahim, Hasan, Kawai, Hayashida, Yamagishi","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2109641","20221011","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41465,""
"A five-year review of prevalence and treatment outcomes of pre-extensively drug-resistant plus additional drug-resistant tuberculosis in the Henan Provincial Tuberculosis Clinical Medicine Research Centre","This study investigated the prevalence and significant clinical outcomes of pre-extensively drug-resistant plus additional drug-resistant tuberculosis (pre-XDR-plus) in Henan Provincial Chest Hospital between 2017 and 2021. We analysed and summarized the drug sensitivity test (DST) results of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains in TB patients seeking care in the Tuberculosis Clinical Medical Research Centre of Henan Province between 2017 and 2021. Medical records of pre-extensively drug-resistant plus additional drug-resistant TB patients were statistically analysed, including demographic characteristics, regimens, and outcomes. Of the 3689 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, 639 (17.32%), 353 (9.56%), and 109 (2.95%), multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (pre-XDR), and pre-XDR-plus, respectively. The proportion of MDR decreased from 19.1% in 2017 to 17.5% in 2021 (&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.686, P = 0.407), the proportion of pre-XDR from 11.4% in 2017 to 9.0% in 2021 (&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.39, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.122), and pre-XDR-plus from 4.7% in 2017 to 1.8% in 2020, with the declining trend was significant (&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;9.348, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002). The most commonly used anti-TB drugs were pyrazinamide (PZA, 37/46, 80.43%) and cycloserine (CS, 32/46, 69.57%), followed by linezolid (LZD, 25/46, 54.35%), protionamide (TH, 25/46, 54.35%), and para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS, 23/46, 50.00%).

"Calcium dobesilate reduces SARS-CoV-2 entry into endothelial cells by inhibiting virus binding to heparan sulfate","Recent reports demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes cell surface heparan sulfate as an attachment factor to facilitate the initial interaction with host cells. Heparan sulfate interacts with the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, and blocking this interaction can decrease cell infection. We and others reported recently that the family of compounds of 2,5-dihydroxyphenylic acid interferes with the binding of the positively charged groove in growth factor molecules to negatively charged cell surface heparan sulfate. We hypothesized that Calcium Dobesilate (CaD)-calcium salt of 2,5-dihydroxyphenylic acid-may also interfere with the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to heparan sulfate. Using lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped particles we show that CaD could significantly reduce pseudovirus uptake into endothelial cells. On the contrary, CaD did not affect cell infection with VSVG-expressing lentivirus. CaD could also prevent retention of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in ex vivo perfused mouse kidney. Using microfluidic culture of endothelial cells under flow, we show that CaD prevents spike protein interaction with heparan sulfate glycocalyx. Since CaD has no adverse side effects and is approved in humans for other medical indications, our findings can rapidly translate into clinical studies.","Kiyan, Schultalbers, Chernobrivaia, Tkachuk, Rong, Shushakova, Haller","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20973-3","20221011","Animals; COVID-19; Calcium; Calcium Dobesilate; Endothelial Cells; Heparitin Sulfate; Humans; Mice; Protein Binding; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Virus Attachment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41467,""
"Immune-related molecular changes in the olfactory epithelium, structural alteration in the olfactory bulb, and psychosis","Olfactory dysfunction has been reproducibly reported in patients with psychosis. Consistently, some studies have reported structural abnormalities in the olfactory bulb (OB) in psychotic disorders with modest sample size. Air pollution and viral infections in the upper respiratory tract, including those of SARS-CoV-2, are reportedly risk factors for brain dysfunction and mental disorders. These risk factors can disturb the olfactory epithelium (OE) that is connected with the OB via direct neuronal projections. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether and how a disturbance of the OE could possibly affect the structure of OB in the pathophysiological context of psychotic disorders. To address this knowledge gap, we first utilized an inducible OE inflammation mouse model (IOI model) and found that OE inflammation could induce a significant reduction in the OB volume, shrinkage of the glomerular layer and the external plexiform layer of OB, and decrease in the immunoreactivity of OMP (olfactory sensory neuron marker), Vglut2 (glutamatergic presynaptic marker), CCK8 (tufted cell marker), and PGP9.5 (mitral cell marker) in the glomerular layer of OB in IOI mice compared to control mice. We then analyzed 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and molecular expression profiles of olfactory neuronal cells (ONCs) biopsied from living human subjects. Interestingly, we also observed a significant reduction in the OB volume, as well as alterations in the expression profiles in ONCs in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients compared to healthy controls. Higher expression levels of IOI immune genes (genes coding immune-related transcription factors up-regulated in IOI mice) in ONCs was significantly associated with smaller volumes of the OB in FEP patients. The subgroup of FEP patients with an up-regulation of IOI immune genes had significantly smaller OB volumes than other FEP patients. Together, our study implied the existence and connections between OE and OB pathologies in psychotic disorders.","Yang, Hasegawa, Hua, Dower, Etyemez, Prasad, Duvall, Paez, Smith, Lane, Ishizuka, Kamath, Kamiya, Sawa","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.23.509224","20221007","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41468,""
"ACE2 Affects the Expression and Function of IFITM3 During SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus Infection in Vero E6 Cells","COVID-19 is a globally infectious viral epidemic of great public health concern caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays its role as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 through binding with S protein and the binding results in ACE2 expression decrease. The change of ACE2 is supposed to elicit a series of cellular and molecular events. Other than as the receptor, ACE2's roles on infection by regulating other molecules need to be further studied during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, we established the ACE2 knockdown model using Vero E6 cells to study how ACE2 influenced the downstream signaling molecules. Analysis of transcriptome sequencing discovered that ACE2 alteration <i>per se</i> caused the alteration of immune factors, including some related to the viral infection-related signaling pathways. We found that ACE2 silencing induced the reduced interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) expression. Overexpression of IFITM3 promoted the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of Vero E6 cells lacking the ACE2. It indicates that ACE2 can affect IFITM3 expression and function to affect the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results reveal possible mechanisms influencing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and contribute to explaining the rapid spread and pathogenesis especially in the case of ACE2 low expression.","Long, Li, Zhang, Peng, Chen, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2022.0042","20220930","ACE2; COVID-19; IFITM3; SARS-CoV-2; type I interferon","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41469,""
"Older Adults' Biobehavioral Fall Risks Were Affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned for Future Fall Prevention Research to Incorporate Multilevel Perspectives","Examining the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on fall risks may provide insight into how multilevel factors as described in National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR's) draft strategic plan can guide future fall prevention research. This article describes the affect of COVID-19 on fall risks from the perspective of older adults who live in assisted living facilities (ALFs), and explores the needs and approaches to implement fall prevention interventions at individual, social, community, and policy levels. Exploratory survey study. Participants from a fall prevention study at 2 ALFs in Oregon were invited to the study. Survey questions asked about COVID experience, and changes in fall risks and day-to-day activities in Spring 2020. Quantitative responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Cohen's <i>d</i> effect sizes. Qualitative responses were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Thirteen participants (age: <i>M =</i> 87.08, standard deviation = 6.52) responded. More participants reported feeling unsteady compared to pre-COVID data (38% vs. 62%), while the proportion of those worried about falling remained the same at 38%. Participants reported negligible decreases in importance of fall prevention and small decreases in confidence of fall prevention (Cohen's <i>d</i> = -0.13 and -0.21, respectively). The themes related to the affect of COVID on fall risks were: <i>not to worry about fall risks but be cautious</i> and <i>physical activity is important, but it's hard during COVID</i>. Impact of COVID on day-to-day activities were: <i>varying degrees of concern for COVID, lack of social and community support</i>, and <i>finding unique ways to cope with COVID.</i> These individual-level perspectives suggest that older adults were at increased risk for falling. Results exemplify the influence of broader-level factors (e.g., social, community, and policy) on individual biobehavioral factors (e.g., fall risks and health behaviors), and illustrate the value of examining multilevel factors in future fall prevention research.","Kiyoshi-Teo, Izumi, Stoyles, McMahon","https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igac033","20220928","Biobehavioral; Health behaviors; Injury prevention; Pandemic; Socioecological framework","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41470,""
"Connecting to Nature through 360&#xb0; Videos during COVID-19 Confinement: A Pilot Study of a Brief Psychological Intervention","Psychological interventions have been shown to be beneficial in mitigating stress related to COVID-19 confinement. According to theories of restorative environments, exposure to natural surroundings has positive effects on well-being and stress through its restorative qualities. With 360&#xb0; video-based Virtual Reality (VR), people can be exposed to nature and so better manage the consequences associated with mobility restrictions during confinement. The main aim of this pilot study was to examine whether a 360&#xb0; video-based VR intervention composed of five 13-minute sessions (once a day) has positive effects on affect, well-being, and stress. The sample was made up of 10 participants (4 men and 6 women; age&#x2009;:&#x2009;M&#x2009;=&#x2009;46.5, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.7) who were confined at home (voluntarily or not) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were instructed to watch a 360&#xb0; video each day (of a ""beach"" or ""lake"" environment) using their smartphone and VR glasses sent to them by mail. Participants responded with several self-reports before and/or after each session (emotions and sense of presence) and before and/or after the intervention (affect, well-being, perceived stress, perceived restorativeness of nature, and the usefulness and acceptability of the intervention). Results showed a tendency to improve positive (e.g., happiness) and negative (e.g., anxiousness) emotions and experience a high sense of presence after each session. Moreover, perceived restorative qualities of the environment and their cognitive and behavioral effects were high. A significant decrease in negative affect was found after the intervention. Usefulness and acceptability were also high. This is the first study to show that an affordable and accessible technology can be used to overcome the negative consequences of confinement and counteract its harmful psychological effects.","Navarrete, Navarro-Siurana, Herrero, Vara, Miragall, Ba&#xf1;os","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/4242888","20220928","COVID-19; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pilot Projects; Psychosocial Intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41471,""

"COVID-19, Overzealous Sanitizer Use, and Hair Discoloration: Case Reports","Proper hand hygiene is one of the top preventive measures against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we report the cases of four patients who presented with blonde discoloration of hair of the dorsal hands and distal forearms during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean age of participants was 41.25&#xb1;4.35 years, and 75% percent of them were men. Three patients were medical staff who had to use antiseptics frequently, and one of them was a housewife. In all participants, the primary color of hand hair was black. The duration of sanitizer use was approximately four months (Table 1). One of the patients, a 42-year-old male ophthalmologist, was examined due to the blonde discoloration of hairs of the dorsal hands and distal forearms (Figure 1). The color of the hand and forearms hair had changed to blonde. However, the underlying skin was unaffected. A dermoscopy examination showed lighter hair compared with the natural black hair of unaffected parts. In addition, the hair color of the scalp, upper arms, and other body parts was normal. The patient had frequently used a hand sanitizer that contained 70% ethanol and didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) for the past five months. The three other patients also had blonde discoloration observable on the hair of dorsal hands. They all reported excessive use of various alcoholic sanitizers. However, they were unaware of other ingredients. In addition, the examination of hair shafts and underlying skin was normal. The COVID-19 pandemic caused an abrupt increase in the use of sanitizers. Hand disinfectants consist of two main categories: non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers and alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The alcohol-based type is an effective measure for the inactivation of enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses (1). It has been shown that percutaneous absorption of alcohol is possible through intact skin. The use of ethanol as a penetration enhancer for pharmaceutical purposes also confirms that ethanol can be absorbed via the skin and be systematically distributed in the body (2). Reisfield et al. observed that intensive use of ethanol-based sanitizers led to an increase in urinary ethanol biomarkers concentrations (3). Alcohols used in various types of gels and solutions are easily released during hand rubbing (4). Ethanol absorption by inhalation should therefore also be taken into account (5). Different pathways of ethanol metabolism can produce free radicals, which affect the antioxidant system (6). In addition, DDAC is also associated with cell growth inhibition and stress oxidative induction (7). Hair discoloration may be a voluntary cosmetic change or a result of chemical or metal exposure. Most unwanted hair discolorations are blonde or white (8). Previous data suggested that an increase in pro-oxidants and a decrease in antioxidants play an important role in hair discoloration. A study performed by Akin Belli et al. demonstrated that hair discoloration is closely related to factors such as emotional stress and alcohol consumption, which cause oxidative stress (9). Hair discoloration might therefore result from oxidative stress induced by ethanol and DDAC used in sanitizers. Golden hair discoloration has been associated with chloride in water. Hypochlorous acid in swimming pool water can penetrate the hair cortex through the cuticle, where it can oxidize and degenerate melanosomes (10). Another possible hypothesis is that the chloride compound in DDAC might be the culprit in sanitizer hair discoloration. Additionally, the bleaching compounds used in some hand disinfectants could be another possible cause of hair discoloration. To the best of our knowledge, this observation of hair discoloration was not previously reported during the COVID-19 outbreak. It is also noteworthy that most hair discoloration normalizes over time (8). The limitations of our study included the fact that the hand sanitizers used by the patients were unavailable and thus their ingredients could not be examined. Furthermore, as most of the sanitizers in this current pandemic are not standardized, they may have unknown ingredients with discoloration properties. Due to the overzealous use of various antiseptics during the pandemic, it is expected that this side-effect will be observed more and more often. Therefore, physicians must be aware of this presentation and reassure the patient regarding this phenomenon. Additionally, products free of such agents should be prescribed to avoid hair discoloration.","Sadat Sadati, Nozari","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19,+Overzealous+Sanitizer+Use,+and+Hair+Discoloration:+Case+Reports.","20220928","Adult; Ammonium Chloride; Anti-Infective Agents, Local; Antioxidants; COVID-19; Chlorides; Ethanol; Female; Gels; Hair; Hair Diseases; Hand Sanitizers; Humans; Hypochlorous Acid; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Water","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41473,""

The impact of fluorine atoms on <i>meso</i>-aryl-corrole structure was also evaluated in terms of binding affinity and physical-chemical properties by two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR). The presence of phenyl moieties increased the binding capacity of corrole for both proteases and depending on the position of fluorine atoms might impact positively or negatively the binding capacity. For M<sup>pro</sup> the <i>para</i>-fluorine atoms might decrease drastically the binding capacity, while for PL<sup>pro</sup> there was a certain increase in the binding affinity of fluorinated-corroles with the increase of fluorine atoms into <i>meso</i>-aryl-corrole structure mainly from tri-fluorinated insertions.

"Overcrowding in Emergency Department: Causes, Consequences, and Solutions-A Narrative Review","Overcrowding in Emergency Departments (EDs) is a phenomenon that is now widespread globally and causes a significant negative impact that goes on to affect the entire hospital. This contributes to a number of consequences that can affect both the number of resources available and the quality of care. Overcrowding is due to a number of factors that in most cases lead to an increase in the number of people within the ED, an increase in mortality and morbidity, and a decrease in the ability to provide critical services in a timely manner to patients suffering from medical emergencies. This phenomenon results in the Emergency Department reaching, and in some cases exceeding, its optimal capacity. In this review, the main causes and consequences involving this phenomenon were collected, including the effect caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in recent years.

"Effects of healthcare system transformations spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic on management of stroke and STEMI: a registry-based cohort study in France","To assess the impact of changes in use of care and implementation of hospital reorganisations spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic (first wave) on the acute management times of patients who had a stroke and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Two cohorts of patients who had an STEMI and stroke in the Aquitaine Cardio-Neuro-Vascular (CNV) registry. 6 emergency medical services, 30 emergency units (EUs), 14 hospitalisation units and 11 cathlabs in the Aquitaine region. This study involved 9218 patients (6436 patients who had a stroke and 2782 patients who had an STEMI) in the CNV Registry from January 2019 to August 2020. Hospital reorganisations, retrieved in a scoping review, were collected from heads of hospital departments. Other data were from the CNV Registry. Associations between reorganisations, use of care and care management times were analysed using multivariate linear regression mixed models. Interaction terms between use-of-care variables and period (pre-wave, per-wave and post-wave) were introduced. STEMI cohort, first medical contact-to-procedure time; stroke cohort, EU admission-to-imaging time. Per-wave period management times deteriorated for stroke but were maintained for STEMI. Per-wave changes in use of care did not affect STEMI management. No association was found between reorganisations and stroke management times. In the STEMI cohort, the implementation of systematic testing at admission was associated with a 41% increase in care management time (exp=1.409, 95% CI 1.075 to 1.848, p=0.013). Implementation of plan blanc, which concentrated resources in emergency activities, was associated with a 19% decrease in management time (exp=0.801, 95% CI 0.639 to 1.023, p=0.077). The pandemic did not markedly alter the functioning of the emergency network. Although stroke patient management deteriorated, the resilience of the STEMI pathway was linked to its stronger structuring. Transversal reorganisations, aiming at concentrating resources on emergency care, contributed to maintenance of the quality of care.

"Why the complications of COVID-19 patients differ in elderly and young cancer patients","Zhang et&#xa0;al. reported the impact of different risk factors and comorbidities in COVID-19 lethality. The authors observed that the odds of dying by COVID-19 in cancer patients decrease with age and cancer becomes a non-significant factor above 80 years. We speculate on the possible causes for the different COVID-19 severity between elderly and young patients. Several factors that can have a different impact on young and elderly have to be taken into account such as inflammation, microbiota and anti-cancer therapies. Inflammaging is a complex process that characterizes elderly people and it is believed to contribute to the severity of COVID-19 associated with old age. Cancer and related therapies may alter the process of inflammaging both quantitatively and qualitatively and could impact on COVID-19 severity. Moreover, therapies used in elderly cancer patients are usually different from that used for young people where the presence of comorbidities and the mechanisms of action of the different drugs both on the susceptibility genes and on other factors have to be considered. Sex hormones and anti-estrogen therapies affect significantly gene expression in target cells thereby modulating the susceptibility of the tissues to SARS-CoV-2 infection and as a consequence the extent of the symptoms. The concentration of sex hormones varies with aging and among sexes. Interestingly, recent evidences, further corroborate the hypothesis that also sex hormones or anti-estrogen therapies impact the susceptibility to COVID-19 and its severity.","Bravaccini, Nicolini, Zanoni, Gaimari, Cerchione, Maltoni, Pirini, Mazzotti, Cortesi, Ravaioli, Tumedei, Mazza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranon.2022.101541","20221016","COVID-19 symptomatology; Cancer; Comorbidities; Elderly patients; Inflammation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41477,""
"Lessons from a large-scale COVID-19 vaccine trial","Global vaccination coverage remains indispensable in combatting the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Safety, efficacy, and durability of immune protection are the key parameters of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and are essential for vaccine approvals, global distribution, and comprehensive population-vaccination programs. Immune protection from either vaccination or natural infection decreases over time, further challenged by rapid viral evolution. In this issue of the JCI, Sobieszczyk and colleagues report an update on the safety, efficacy, and durability of immune protection of AZD12222 in a large-scale, multinational, Phase III RCT. They report that protection lasted through 6 months, with immunity waning after 180 days. The study also highlights challenges facing vaccine trials, including the need for early unblinding for vulnerable participants, which may affect outcome measurements. Another challenge is to ensure fair representation of marginalized and minority ethnic groups in vaccine safety and efficacy studies worldwide.","Mahla, Dustin","https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI163202","20220916","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41478,""
"COVID-led consumption displacement: A longitudinal analysis of hotel booking patterns","This research contributes to the literature on <i>consumption displacement</i> by exploring the pandemic-led shifts in hotel booking patterns. We perform a longitudinal analysis and a critical comparison of bookings before and after COVID-19 outbreak, focusing on the <i>booking window</i>, <i>length of stay</i>, and <i>booking channel</i>. Data include weekly bookings of a representative sample of Balearic Islands' hotels between 2018 and 2021. Results indicate that the pandemic has led to a drop in the volume of bookings and a remarkable change in booking patterns. Specifically, we find a temporal shift in booking behavior, characterized by a lower anticipation and a change in the tourism supply chain, namely a decrease in the share of intermediated bookings. The expected increase in the frequency of exogenous shocks, such as weather-related and sanitary crises, could affect purchasing behaviors, thus enhancing the relevance of this study, with managerial implications for industry and destination managers.","Dey&#xe1;-Tortella, Leoni, Ramos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2022.103343","20220920","Booking patterns; COVID-19; Consumption displacement; Hotel bookings; Hotel management; Tourists&#x2019; behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41479,""
"The sources of the Kuznets relationship between the COVID-19 mortality rate and economic performance","This paper discusses the findings of an empirical analysis of the Kuznets, or reverse U-shaped relationship, between the COVID-19 mortality rate and economic performance. In the early stages of economic development, the COVID-19 mortality rate is anticipated to rise with rising economic activity and urbanization. Eventually, the mortality rate decreases at higher economic development levels as people and the government are more capable of investing in disease abatement measures. The quality of political institutions, wealth distribution, urbanization, vaccination rate, and improvements in healthcare systems are hypothesized to affect the COVID-19 mortality rate. Examining this relationship can be effective in understanding the change in the COVID-19 mortality rate at different economic performance stages and in identifying appropriate preventive measures. This study employed the negative binomial regression to model a cross-sectional dataset of 137 countries. Results indicated that the relationship between the per-head gross domestic product (GDP) level and the COVID-19 mortality rate appeared to follow a pattern like the Kuznets curve, implying that changes in institutional quality, healthcare advancements, wealth distribution, urbanization, vaccination rate, and the percentage of the elderly population were significant in explaining the relationship. Improvement of the healthcare system has a notable effect on lowering the COVID-19 mortality rate under more effective government conditions. Additionally, the results suggested that a higher per-head GDP is required to reverse the rising trend of the mortality rate under higher income inequality. Based on these results, preventive measures, and policies to reduce COVID-19 mortalities were recommended in the conclusion section.","Law, Ng, Poi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103233","20221019","COVID-19; Economic performance; Infectious disease; Kuznets relationship; Vaccination rate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41480,""
"Saliva testing among teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Effects on health concerns, well-being, and precautionary behavior","At the start of 2021, several SARS-CoV-2 cluster outbreaks in schools threatened in-person education and created a fairly chaotic and frightening environment for school personnel. To keep the schools open while preventing COVID-19 outbreaks, intensive diagnostic testing in teachers and school personnel was strongly recommended but missing at the time. A project was launched in Belgian schools to weekly analyze the morning saliva of school personnel using PCR-testing to detect and prevent COVID-19 positive cases. In this quasi-experimental study, we aimed to examine whether the implementation of this saliva testing project impacted school personnel's pandemic-related health concerns, well-being, and adherence to the health-protective measures, contrasting experimental with control schools. The data were collected during the third wave (Alpha-wave, February-March 2021) of the pandemic. The sample consisted of 435 participants from 34 different schools across Flanders (Belgium) (78.8% female; M age&#xa0;=&#xa0;43.87 years, range&#xa0;=&#xa0;21-67) of which 82% participated in the weekly saliva tests (i.e., experimental group) and 18% took part in the control group. Results from a series of linear mixed regression models showed that saliva testing buffered against an increase in health concerns among tested school personnel but did not affect participants' general well-being. Slight declines in adherence to the health-protective behaviors were observed, yet this was only the case for participants who felt less supported by their school principal. High degrees of principals' support also fostered the sharpest decreases in school staff's pandemic-related health concerns. When keeping the schools open in unstable pandemic times, weekly saliva testing is a promising strategy to prevent cluster outbreaks while simultaneously safeguarding health concerns among school personnel. School principals appear to play a critical role in the implementation of saliva testing to secure positive effects.","Van de Casteele, Waterschoot, Anthierens, DeSmet, Galand, Goossens, Morb&#xe9;e, Vansteenkiste","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115295","20221003","Adherence; COVID-19; Health concerns; Saliva testing; School principal support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41481,""
"Fetoplacental transmission and placental response to SARS-CoV-2: Evidence from the literature","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a dreadful novel coronavirus with global health concerns among pregnant women. To date, the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy remains controversial. We briefly report recent findings of placental response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and updates on vertical transmission. We systematically searched PubMed and Google Scholar databases according to PRISMA guidelines for studies reporting the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the placenta and possibility of vertical transmission. We identified 45 studies reporting 1,280 human placentas that were analyzed by molecular pathology methods and 11,112 placenta-derived cells from a publicly available database that was analyzed using bioinformatics tools. The main finding of this study is that the SARS-CoV-2 canonical entry receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) are abundantly expressed on the placenta during the first trimester, and this expression diminishes across gestational age. Out of 45 eligible studies identified, 24 (53.34%) showed no evidence of vertical transmission, 15 (33.33%) supported the hypothesis of very rare, low possibility of vertical transmission and 6 (13.33%) were indecisive and had no comment on vertical transmission. Furthermore, 433 placentas from 12 studies were also identified for placental pathology investigation. There was evidence of at least one form of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), 57/433 (13.1%), fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM), 81/433 (18.7%) and placental inflammation with excessive infiltration of CD3+ CD8+ lymphocytes, CD68+ macrophages and CD20+ lymphocytes in most of the eligible studies. Decidual vasculopathy (3.2%), infarction (3.2%), chronic histiocytic intervillositis (6.0%), thrombi vasculopathy (5.1%) were also observed in most of the MVM and FVM reported cases. The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 induces placenta inflammation, and placenta susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 decreases across the pregnancy window. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy may adversely affect the developing fetus.","Ezechukwu, Shi, Fowora, Diya, Elfaki, Adegboye","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.962937","20220907","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; maternal-child; placenta; vertical transmission","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41482,""
"COVID-19 triggered a physically active lifestyle of people with cardiovascular diseases: Results of a small Austrian qualitative study","This paper explores physical activity patterns and compensation strategies of people with cardiovascular diseases. The aim is to provide insights into the factors and their relationships that may affect physical activity levels positively or negatively during the pandemic. We adopted a qualitative approach with 35 participants who were purposively sampled from different provinces in Austria, including rural and urban areas. Semi-structured interviews were conducted during the second COVID-19 wave in autumn/winter 2020 and the fourth wave in autumn/winter 2021. Content analysis was applied to explore physical activity patterns, the perceived impact of the pandemic on physical activity as well as strategies adopted by participants to maintain physically active during the pandemic waves. Results show encouraging signs of a recovery or even increase in physical activity during the pandemic waves. The main drivers for maintaining or even increasing physical activity were intrinsic motivation and self-determined motivation relating to the pursue of individual health goals. Furthermore, analysis suggests a reinforcing effect of exercising in green natural areas by decreasing perception of effort and increasing motivation. There was also one group who experienced difficulties in adapting physical activity behaviors. Study participants who were used to exercise indoors struggled to replace accustomed activity patterns with alternatives that were not impacted by lockdown restrictions. This study provides novel qualitative evidence on the effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on physical activity patterns of people with cardiovascular diseases. Public health interventions to enhance a physically active lifestyle during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic are recommended to target moderate outdoor exercising and enhance adaptive capacities of people with cardiovascular diseases.","Krczal, Hyll","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.947250","20220830","COVID-19; cardiovascular diseases; coping strategies; intrinsic motivation; lockdown; outdoor exercise; physical activity (exercise); Austria; COVID-19; Cardiovascular Diseases; Communicable Disease Control; Humans; Life Style; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41483,""
"Farmer surveys in Europe suggest that specialized, intensive farms were more likely to perceive negative impacts from COVID-19","It has been shown that the COVID-19 pandemic affected some agricultural systems more than others, and even within geographic regions, not all farms were affected to the same extent. To build resilience of agricultural systems to future shocks, it is key to understand which farms were affected and why. In this study, we examined farmers' perceived robustness to COVID-19, a key resilience capacity. We conducted standardized farmer interviews (<i>n</i> = 257) in 15 case study areas across Europe, covering a large range of socio-ecological contexts and farm types. Interviews targeted perceived livelihood impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on productivity, sales, price, labor availability, and supply chains in 2020, as well as farm(er) characteristics and farm management. Our study corroborates earlier evidence that most farms were not or only slightly affected by the first wave(s) of the pandemic in 2020, and that impacts varied widely by study region. However, a significant minority of farmers across Europe reported that the pandemic was ""the worst crisis in a lifetime"" (3%) or ""the worst crisis in a decade"" (7%). Statistical analysis showed that more specialized and intensive farms were more likely to have perceived negative impacts. From a societal perspective, this suggests that highly specialized, intensive farms face higher vulnerability to shocks that affect regional to global supply chains. Supporting farmers in the diversification of their production systems while decreasing dependence on service suppliers and supply chain actors may increase their robustness to future disruptions.

"COVID-19 Vaccination in China: Adverse Effects and Its Impact on Health Care Working Decisions on Booster Dose","Although many research studies have concentrated on people's willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine, little attention has been paid to the underlying mechanism of consent. An understanding of potential factors and mechanisms that affect the willingness to receive a vaccination can contribute information critical for containing the pandemic. This study explored the effects of post-vaccination adverse reactions on the willingness to take the booster dose and the role of decision regret. A self-administered online survey was carried out in Taizhou, China. Questionnaires were completed by 1085 healthcare workers (HCWs), 1054 (97.1%) of whom had completed two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Mediation analysis methodology was applied in this study. Our study showed that post-vaccination adverse reactions in HCWs could decrease their willingness to take the booster dose. Of note, HCWs who experienced adverse reactions after vaccination would be more likely to regret their previous vaccination decisions, which, in turn, further reduced their willingness to receive a booster shot. Decision regret mediated the relationship between adverse post-vaccination reactions and a willingness to take the booster dose. The findings implied inextricable relationships among post-vaccination adverse reactions, decision regret, and willingness to take the booster dose. It is suggested that notice of these post-vaccination adverse reactions should be further incorporated into vaccine communication campaigns and policy interventions advocating booster doses to improve vaccine uptake intent and increase the willingness to receive booster doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.","Luo, Chen, Tung","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10081229","20220830","COVID-19 booster vaccine; decision regret; healthcare workers; vaccination adverse reaction; willingness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-23","",41485,""
"Association between Burnout, Job Dissatisfaction and Intention to Leave among Medical Researchers in a Research Organisation in Malaysia during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Employee turnover could affect the organisation's performance. Job dissatisfaction and burnout have been identified as factors influencing the intention to leave. Thus, this study aimed to determine the level of intent to leave, and predictors associated with intention to leave among medical researchers in Malaysia. A cross-sectional, stratified random sampling study was conducted among researchers in a research organisation under the Ministry of Health. Respondents answered an online questionnaire that included sociodemographic information, job dissatisfaction, burnout, and intention to leave. A total of 133 researchers participated. More than one-third (41.4%) of the researchers had a moderate and high level of intention to leave. Burnout and job dissatisfaction were identified as significant predictors. Burnout was noted to have a positive relationship with the intent to leave (&#x3b2; = 0.289, 95% CI (B): 0.287, 1.096). Meanwhile, job satisfaction was found to have a negative relationship with the intention to leave (&#x3b2; = -0.348, 95% CI (B): -0.768, -0.273). Burnout among researchers is quite worrisome as more than two-thirds of the researchers experienced moderate to high burnout.

"Psychological Impact during Confinement by COVID-19 on Health Sciences University Students-A Prospective, Longitudinal, and Comparative Study","The objective was to analyze the factors that influence reactions to confinement situations, such as personality, humor, coping with stressors, and resilience, and to compare this population with a normal situation of exposure to an intense academic stressor such as a partial test, and with the confinement situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A longitudinal study was performed involving 116 health sciences students from Spain. Three situations were evaluated: a basal situation of normality at the beginning of the course, situation facing an academic stressor (partial test), and confinement situation due to COVID-19. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and NEO-FFI scale were used. Significant differences were observed in the increase in negative humor and decrease in positive one, as well as decrease in ""Focus on and Venting of Emotions"". Personality factors that better predict humor at confinement were ""conscientiousness"" for having positive humor and low ""extraversion"" for negative humor. The confinement situation due to COVID-19 has caused changes in predominant humor, as well as in coping strategies.
