"Remote working in mental health services: a rapid umbrella review of pre-COVID-19 literature","Background: Tele-mental health care has been rapidly adopted to maintain services during the pandemic, and there is now substantial interest in its future role. Service planning and policy making for recovery from the pandemic and beyond should draw not only on COVID-19 experiences, but also on the substantial research evidence accumulated prior to this. Aims: to conduct an umbrella review of systematic reviews of research literature and evidence-based guidance on remote working in mental health, including both qualitative and quantitative literature. Method: Three databases were searched between January 2010 and August 2020 for systematic reviews meeting pre-defined criteria. Reviews retrieved were independently screened and those meeting inclusion criteria were synthesised and assessed for risk of bias. Narrative synthesis was used to report findings Results: Nineteen systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. Fifteen examined clinical effectiveness, eight reported on aspects of tele-mental health implementation, ten reported on acceptability to service users and clinicians, two on cost-effectiveness and one on guidance. Most reviews were assessed as low quality. Findings suggested that video-based communication could be as effective and acceptable as face-face formats, at least in the short-term. Evidence was lacking on extent of digital exclusion and how it can be overcome, or on significant context such as children and young people and inpatient settings. Conclusions: This umbrella review suggests that tele-mental health has potential to be an effective and acceptable form of service delivery. However, we found limited evidence on impacts of large-scale implementation across catchment areas. Combining previous evidence and COVID-19 experiences may allow realistic planning for future tele-mental health implementation.","Phoebe Barnett; Lucy Goulding; Cecilia Casetta; Harriet Jordan; Luke Sheridan Rains; Thomas Steare; Julie Williams; Lisa Wood; Fiona Gaughran; Sonia Johnson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.30.20240721","20201130","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-01","",7621,""

"Caught between Scylla and Charybdis: How economic stressors and occupational risk factors influence workersâ€™ occupational health reactions to COVID-19","Abstract Workers and their families bear much of the economic burden of COVID-19  Even though they have declined somewhat, unemployment rates are considerably higher than before the start of the pandemic  Many workers also face uncertainty about their future employment prospects and increasing financial strain  At the same time, the workplace is a common source of transmission of COVID-19 and many jobs previously seen as relatively safe are now viewed as potentially hazardous  Thus, many workers face dual threats of economic stress and COVID-19 exposure  This paper develops a model of workers? responses to these dual threats, including risk perception and resource depletion as mediating factors that influence the relationship of economic stress and occupational risk factors with COVID-19 compliance-related attitudes, safe behavior at work, and physical and mental health outcomes  The paper also describes contextual moderators of these relationships at the individual, unit, and regional level  Directions for future research are discussed","Sinclair, Robert R.; Probst, Tahira M.; Watson, Gwendolyn Paige, Bazzoli, Andrea","https://doi.org/10.1111/apps.12301","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Applied Psychology;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication details: Applied Psychology;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-01","",7639,""

"Evaluating risk to people with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic: preliminary findings from the COV-E study","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global anguish unparalleled in recent times  As cases rise, increased pressure on health services, combined with severe disruption to peopleâ€™s everyday lives, can adversely affect individuals living with chronic illnesses, including people with epilepsy  Stressors related to disruption to healthcare, finances, mental well-being, relationships, schooling, physical activity, and increased isolation could increase seizures and impair epilepsy self-management  We aim to understand the impact that COVID-19 has had on the health and well-being of people with epilepsy with a focus on exposure to increased risk of seizures, associated comorbidity, and mortality  We designed two online surveys with one addressing people with epilepsy directly and the second for caregivers to report on behalf of a person with epilepsy  The survey is ongoing and has yielded 463 UK-based responses by the end of September 2020  Forty percent of respondents reported health changes during the pandemic (n=185)  Respondents cited a change in seizures (19%, n=88), mental health difficulties (34%, n=161) and sleep disruption (26%, n=121) as the main reasons  Thirteen per cent found it difficult to take medication on time  A third had difficulty accessing medical services (n=154), with 8% having had an appointment canceled (n=39)  Only a small proportion reported having had discussions about epilepsy related risks, such as safety precautions (16%, n=74);mental health (29%, n=134);sleep (30%, n=140);and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP;15%, n=69) in the previous 12 months  These findings suggest that people with epilepsy are currently experiencing health changes, coupled with inadequate access to services  Also, there seems to be a history of poor risk communication in the months preceding the pandemic  As the UK witnesses a second COVID-19 wave, those involved in healthcare delivery must ensure optimal care is provided for people with chronic conditions, such as epilepsy, to ensure that avoidable morbidity and mortality is prevented during the pandemic, and beyond","Thorpe, Jennifer, Ashby, Samantha, Hallab, Asma, Ding, Ding, Andraus, Maria, Dugan, Patricia, Perucca, Piero, Costello, Daniel, French, Jacqueline A.; O'Brien, Terence J.; Depondt, Chantal, Andrade, Danielle M.; Sengupta, Robin, Delanty, Norman, Jette, Nathalie, Newton, Charles R.; Brodie, Martin J.; Devinsky, Orrin, Helen Cross, J.; Sander, Josemir W.; Hanna Obe, Jane, Sen, Arjune","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107658","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Epilepsy & Behavior;: 107658, 2020.; Publication details: Epilepsy & Behavior;: 107658, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-01","",7643,""

DESIGN: Anonymous online survey. SETTING: Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged over 18 years living in Australia were eligible and 13 829 contributed complete data. Of these, 13 762 identified as female (10 434) or male (3328) and were included in analyses. INTERVENTIONS: None. OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinically significant symptoms of depression (&#8805;10 on Patient Health Questionnaire 9) or anxiety (&#8805;10 on Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 7 (GAD-7)), and experiences of irritability (GAD-7 item 6). RESULTS: Women were more likely than men to have clinically significant symptoms of depression (26.3% (95% CI 25.4 to 27.1) vs 20.1% (95% CI 18.7 to 21.5), p<0.001) and anxiety (21.8% (95% CI 21.0 to 22.6) vs 14.2% (95% CI 13.0 to 15.4), p<0.001) and to have experienced irritability in the previous fortnight (63.1% (95% CI 62.1 to 64.0) vs 51.4% (95% CI 49.7 to 53.2), p<0.001). They were also more likely than men to be doing unpaid work caring for children (22.8% (95% CI 22.0 to 23.6) vs 8.6% (95% CI 7.7 to 9.6), p<0.001) and dependent relatives (9.8% (95% CI 9.2 to 10.3) vs 5.7% (95% CI 4.9 to 6.5), p<0.001) which made significant contributions to the mental health outcomes of interest. Loss of employment, fear of contracting COVID-19 and feeling a severe impact of the restrictions were associated with poorer mental health in women and men of all ages. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety were higher among women than men. Rather than being intrinsically more vulnerable to mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, the higher risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression among women may in part be explained by their disproportionate burden of unpaid caregiving.","Hammarberg, Karin; Tran, Thach; Kirkman, Maggie; Fisher, Jane","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042696","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(11): e042696, 2020 Nov 24.; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(11): e042696, 2020 Nov 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-01","",7702,""

"Generation Covid-19 -- should the fetus be worried?","The aim of this narrative review was to evaluate the risks, both direct and indirect, to the fetus from the Covid-19 pandemic. Direct and indirect risks were defined as a) vertical infection (congenital or intrapartum), b) maternal infection and its sequelae, and c) sources of maternal stress during lockdown, including social isolation and altered healthcare provision. Early studies suggest that vertical viral transmission is low; however, there may be an important effect of maternal infection on fetal growth and development. The impact of various degrees of lockdown on prospective mothers' health, habits and healthcare provision is of concern. In particular, increased maternal stress has been shown to have a significant effect on fetal brain development increasing the risk of mental health, cognitive and behavioural disorders in later life. From the evidence available to date, direct risks to the fetus from the SARS-CoV2 virus are low. Indirect effects of the pandemic, particularly resulting from the effect of maternal stress on the developing brain can have lifelong detrimental impacts for this generation of children.","Iqbal, Burrin, Aydin, Beardsall, Wong, Austin","https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15693","20201130","Covid-19; SARS-CoV2; fetus; lockdown; neurodevelopment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-01","",7707,""
"Dreaming during the Covid-19 pandemic: Computational assessment of dream reports reveals mental suffering related to fear of contagion","The current global threat brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic has led to widespread social isolation, posing new challenges in dealing with metal suffering related to social distancing, and in quickly learning new social habits intended to prevent contagion. Neuroscience and psychology agree that dreaming helps people to cope with negative emotions and to learn from experience, but can dreaming effectively reveal mental suffering and changes in social behavior? To address this question, we applied natural language processing tools to study 239 dream reports by 67 individuals, made either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during the months of March and April, 2020, when lockdown was imposed in Brazil following the WHO's declaration of the pandemic. Pandemic dreams showed a higher proportion of anger and sadness words, and higher average semantic similarities to the terms &quot;contamination&quot; and &quot;cleanness&quot;. These features seem to be associated with mental suffering linked to social isolation, as they explained 40% of the variance in the PANSS negative subscale related to socialization (p = 0.0088). These results corroborate the hypothesis that pandemic dreams reflect mental suffering, fear of contagion, and important changes in daily habits that directly impact socialization.","Mota, Weissheimer, Ribeiro, de Paiva, Avilla-Souza, Simabucuru, Chaves, Cecchi, Cirne, Cecchi, Rodrigues, Copelli, Ribeiro","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242903","20201130","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-01","",7708,""
"Aligning dissemination and implementation science with health policies to improve children's mental health","The prevalence of mental health problems among children (ages 0-21) in the United States remains unacceptably high and, post-COVID-19, is expected to increase dramatically. Decades of psychological knowledge about effective treatments should inform the delivery of better services. Dissemination and implementation (D&amp;I) science has been heralded as a solution to the persistent problem of poor quality services and has, to some extent, improved our understanding of the contexts of delivery systems that implement effective practices. However, there are few studies demonstrating clear, population-level impacts of psychological interventions on children. Momentum is growing among communities, cities, states, and some federal agencies to build &quot;health in all policies&quot; to address broad familial, social, and economic factors known to affect children's healthy development and mental health. These health policy initiatives offer a rare opportunity to repurpose D&amp;I science, shifting it from a primary focus on evidence-based practice implementation, to a focus on policy development and implementation to support child and family health and well-being. This shift is critical as states develop policy responses to address the health and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on already-vulnerable families. We provide a typology for building research on D&amp;I and children's mental health policy.

"Health psychology in the time of COVID-19","<i>Health Psychology</i> has received numerous papers over the past several months on topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of them concern depression, anxiety, stress, or other forms of distress in the general population or in health care workers. We have received far fewer papers on COVID-related health behaviors and health communications-factors that have played central roles in the spread of the pandemic and that are major topics in health psychology. Our experience is consistent with the published scientific literature on the pandemic. A Medline search that we conducted in late September yielded over 23,000 English-language articles pertaining to COVID-19. Over 1,400 of them concerned topics that are within the scope of <i>Health Psychology</i>. As shown in Table 1, COVID-related mental disorders comprised the largest category. Many other studies concerned other forms of stress or emotional distress. At least 248 articles addressed the profound ethnic and racial disparities in COVID-19 infection and death rates and in access to health care that are accentuating longstanding health inequities; 22 (9%) of these articles addressed behavioral or psychosocial aspects of COVID-19 health disparities. Thus, the literature on the behavioral and psychosocial aspects of the pandemic has been dominated, so far at least, by research on stress or distress. Fewer reports have been published so far on critical COVID-related health behaviors, health communication, or health disparities.

"Pre-COVID-19 deterrents to practicing with videoconferencing telepsychology among psychologists who didn't","Telepsychology has the potential to help mental health service providers reach millions of people in rural areas or those limited by other factors. This study examined pre-COVID-19 deterrents reported by psychologists who did not use telepsychology. Participants were 1,400 psychologists with an average of 26.3 (<i>SD</i> = 11.18) years in practice who were currently practicing within the United States but did not currently use telepsychology. All 50 states were represented as well as Washington, DC. The most commonly reported deterrents, from most to least frequent, were insufficient training, client safety/crisis concerns, privacy, legality, ethics, reimbursement, efficacy, prohibitive organizational policies/culture, and insufficient demand. Logistic regression analyses suggested that psychologists' deterrents varied based in part on demographic and practice characteristics. Psychologists practicing within medical centers or Veterans Affairs facilities were less likely to indicate safety, privacy, legal issues, ethics, and efficacy as a concern. Older psychologists were less deterred by reimbursement issues and more concerned about effectiveness. Those using cognitive-behavioral approaches were less likely to report efficacy and safety concerns. Cisgender men were less likely to be deterred by safety or privacy issues, and White psychologists were less likely to indicate safety as a deterrent. Additional telepsychology training and information for psychologists may increase its use and foster improved mental health care access for populations unable to attend in-person sessions. A more focused approach to training and implementation of telepsychology that considers the needs and concerns of the target psychologist group could benefit organizations promoting its use.

"[Do COVID-19 restrictions lead to aÃ‚Â decrease in severely injured patients at aÃ‚Â levelÃ‚Â 1 trauma center in Germany?]","Intensive care and ventilator capacities are essential for treatment of COVID-19Ã‚Â patients. Severely injured patients are often in continuous need of intensive care and ventilator treatment. The question arises, whether restrictions related to COVID-19 have led to aÃ‚Â decrease in severely injured patients and thus to an increase in intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. AÃ‚Â retrospective analysis of all seriously injured patients with an injury severity score (ISS) Ã¢â€°Â¥16 was performed between 17 March and 30 April 2020 at aÃ‚Â levelÃ‚Â 1 trauma center in Germany. The mechanism of injury and the ISS were recorded. Further data were collected as to whether it was aÃ‚Â work-related accident, aÃ‚Â documented suicide attempt and if surgery was necessary in the first 24Ã¢â‚¬Â¯h after arrival in hospital. Data from 2018 and 2019 served as aÃ‚Â control group. There was no substantial difference in the total number of seriously injured patients (2018 nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30, 2019 nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°23, 2020 nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°27). Furthermore, there was no relevant difference in the number of patients needing intensive care or ventilator treatment when leaving the shock room. The number of patients needing an operative intervention within the first 24Ã¢â‚¬Â¯h after arriving at hospital was slightly higher in 2020. The mean ISS was at aÃ‚Â constant level during all 3 years. In 2020 there was no polytraumatized motorbike rider, who did not have aÃ‚Â work-related accident (2018 nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5, 2019 nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4, 2020 nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0). AÃ‚Â noticeable increase in work-related accidents was observed (2018: 10%, 2019: 26.1%, 2020 44.4%). Restrictions related to COVID-19 did not lead to aÃ‚Â reduction in seriously injured patients needing ICU care. Due to the monocentric data analysis there is room for misinterpretation. In general, intensive care and operating capacities should be managed with adequate consideration for seriously injured patients even in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Confirmation through the German Trauma Register is pending.","Fuchs, Eden, Gilbert, Bernuth, Wurmb, Meffert, Jordan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00113-020-00924-1","20201130","Corona virus; ICU capacities; Injury severity score; Pandemic; Polytrauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-01","",7712,""

"The Precision Health and Everyday Democracy (PHED) Project: Protocol for a Transdisciplinary Collaboration on Health Equity and the Role of Health in Society","The project &quot;Precision Health and Everyday Democracy&quot; (PHED) is a transdisciplinary partnership that combines a diverse range of perspectives necessary for understanding the increasingly complex societal role played by modern health care and medical research. The term &quot;precision health&quot; is being increasingly used to express the need for greater awareness of environmental and genomic characteristics that may lead to divergent health outcomes between different groups within a population. Enhancing awareness of diversity has parallels with calls for &quot;health democracy&quot; and greater patient-public participation within health care and medical research. Approaching health care in this way goes beyond a narrow focus on the societal determinants of health, since it requires considering health as a deliberative space, which occurs often at the banal or everyday level. As an initial empirical focus, PHED is directed toward the health needs of marginalized migrants (including refugees and asylum seekers, as well as migrants with temporary residency, often involving a legally or economically precarious situation) as vulnerable groups that are often overlooked by health care. Developing new transdisciplinary knowledge on these groups provides the potential to enhance their wellbeing and benefit the wider society through challenging the exclusions of these groups that create pockets of extreme ill-health, which, as we see with COVID-19, should be better understood as &quot;acts of self-harm&quot; for the wider negative impact on humanity. We aim to establish and identify precision health strategies, as well as promote equal access to quality health care, drawing upon knowledge gained from studying the health care of marginalized migrants. The project is based in Sweden at MalmÃƒÂ¶ and Lund Universities. At the outset, the network activities do not require ethical approval where they will not involve data collection, since the purpose of PHED is to strengthen international research contacts, establish new research within precision strategies, and construct educational research activities for junior colleagues within academia. However, whenever new research is funded and started, ethical approval for that specific data collection will be sought. The PHED project has been funded from January 1, 2019. Results of the transdisciplinary collaboration will be disseminated via a series of international conferences, workshops, and web-based materials. To ensure the network project advances toward applied research, a major goal of dissemination is to produce tools for applied research, including information to enhance health accessibility for vulnerable communities, such as marginalized migrant populations in Sweden. There is a need to identify tools to enable the prevention and treatment of a wide spectrum of health-related outcomes and their link to social as well as environmental issues. There is also a need to identify and investigate barriers to precision health based on democratic principles.

An electronic survey (NCT04400942) was e-mailed between April and June 2020 to couples whose IVF treatments have been interrupted or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The presence and severity of symptoms suggestive of anxiety and/or depression were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Subjects with preexisting psychiatric disorders were excluded. Overall, 524 out of 646 patients completed the survey. The prevalence of anxiety and/or depression feelings was significantly higher in women, mainly if aged more than 35Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and with a previous IVF attempt. The occurrence of these psychological symptoms was significantly associated with the time spent on COVID-19 related news per day and partner with evidence of psychological disorder and, in females, with a diagnosis of poor ovarian reserve, diagnosis of endometriosis or uterine fibroids. The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the infertile couples who should have undergone IVF treatment has been significant.

Finally, we conducted a moderation analysis to examine the interaction of trust in the healthcare system and COVID-19 related risk factors. A linear regression showed that female gender, younger age, lower level of education, being infected with COVID-19, being medically vulnerable, working in the healthcare system, being in voluntary quarantine and having an immigrant background predicted mean HSCL-10 scores. The moderation analysis revealed that people in the medically vulnerable group, those below 61, and those in quarantine reported higher psychological distress when they also had lower trust in the healthcare system. Findings indicate important groups to take into consideration in mental healthcare strategies and policies. However, most participants in the current study reported psychological distress levels that were below the clinical cut-off, suggesting that the majority may have coped relatively well in the early stages of the pandemic.","Harris, Sandal","https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494820971512","20201130","COVID-19; Norway; anxiety; corona; depression; health system trust; pandemics; psychological distress; quarantine; risk factors; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-01","",7716,""

However, not much is known of the mental health of people with pre-existing mental illness during a pandemic. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates, whether people with pre-existing mental illness experience an increase in mental health symptoms and experience more hospitalizations during a pandemic. A systematic search was conducted in the EMBASE, OVID-MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases to identify potentially eligible studies. Data were extracted independently and continuous data were used in calculating pooled effect sizes of standardized mean difference (SMD) using the random-effects model. Of 1791 records reviewed 15 studies were included. People with pre-existing mental illness have significantly higher psychiatric symptoms, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms compared to controls during a pandemic with pooled effect sizes (SMD) of 0.593 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.72), 0.616 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.73) and 0.597 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.80) respectively. Studies also found a reduction in psychiatric hospitalizations and utilization of psychiatric services during pandemics. The review highlights the need for mental health services to address the increased mental health symptoms in people with pre-existing mental illnesses during a pandemic. Future research should focus on better designed controlled studies of discrete illness groups, so as to provide a robust basis for policy makers to plan appropriate level of support and care for people with mental illness during a pandemic.","Neelam, Duddu, Anyim, Neelam, Lewis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100177","20201130","Anxiety; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-01","",7718,""

"Heterogeneity in SIR epidemics modeling: superspreaders and herd immunity","Deterministic epidemic models, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, are immensely useful even if they lack the nuance and complexity of social contacts at the heart of network science modeling. Here we present a simple modification of the SIR equations to include the heterogeneity of social connection networks. A typical power-law model of social interactions from network science reproduces the observation that individuals with a high number of contacts, &quot;hubs&quot; or &quot;superspreaders&quot;, can become the primary conduits for transmission. Conversely, once the tail of the distribution is saturated, herd immunity sets in at a smaller overall recovered fraction than in the analogous SIR model. The new dynamical equations suggest that cutting off the tail of the social connection distribution, i.e., stopping superspreaders, is an efficient non-pharmaceutical intervention to slow the spread of a pandemic, such as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Szapudi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-020-00336-5","20201130","COVID-19; Disease dynamics; Epidemiology; Herd immunity; Network science; SIR equations; Superspreaders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-01","",7720,""

In this article we outline how an anesthesia department can design and implement a framework for wellbeing, regardless of resources and financial constraints. We use the example of a free online toolkit developed in Australia for anesthetists. The &quot;Long lives, Healthy Workplaces toolkit&quot; is a framework which has been specifically developed by mental health experts for anesthetists, and does not require departments to pay for external experts.1 Departments can design a long-term model of evidence-based mental health strategies to meet their unique needs using five steps outlined in the toolkit and detailed in this article. The framework uses cycles of assessment and review to create an adaptable approach to incorporate emerging evidence. We explain how culture can impact the implementation of a well-being framework and we outline how departments can set goals and priorities. Departments have different constraints which will alter how they approach supporting anaesthetists' wellbeing. Regardless of location or funding all departments should explicitly address anesthetists well-being.

"The Mental Health Effects of Living with Close Others Before, During, and After the Onset of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic not only threatens physical health, but is also a multi-faceted stressor that threatens mental health. Given the public health focus on staying home to stem the tide of COVID-19, it is crucial to determine how the close others we live with (i.e., romantic partners or children) affect our mental health, for better or worse. We examined the month-to-month mental health (i.e., well-being and ill-being) of parents living with child(ren) and people living with romantic partners (versus people not living with these close others) from February through September 2020 in two diverse samples of U.S. adults (N=656; N=544). This longitudinal approach distinguishes three unique effects: differences existing before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, differences due to the onset of the pandemic, and differences that persisted across the first six months of the pandemic. In both samples, living with child(ren) or living with a romantic partner were both protective for mental health, before and during the first six months of the pandemic. Some evidence suggests these groups experienced unique increases in ill-being during the onset of the pandemic, but their ill-being also recovered more quickly. These findings highlight the crucial protective function of close relationships for mental health both in general and amidst a pandemic, suggesting that people living without these close others may need additional support.","Natalie M.
