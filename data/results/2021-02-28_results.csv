"Persistent psychopathology and neurocognitive impairment in COVID-19 survivors: effect of inflammatory biomarkers at three-month follow-up","COVID-19 outbreak is associated with mental health implications during viral infection and at short-term follow-up. Data on psychiatric and cognitive sequelae at medium-term follow-up are still lacking. During an ongoing prospective cohort study, the psychopathological and cognitive status of 226 COVID-19 pneumonia survivors (149 male, mean age 58) were prospectively evaluated one and three months after hospital discharge. Psychiatric clinical interview, self-report questionnaires, and neuropsychological profiling of verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor coordination, executive functions, attention and information processing, and verbal fluency were performed. Three months after discharge from the hospital, 35.8% still self-rated symptoms in the clinical range in at least one psychopathological dimension. We observed persistent depressive symptomatology, while PTSD, anxiety, and insomnia decreased during follow-up. Sex, previous psychiatric history, and the presence of depression at one month affected the depressive symptomatology at three months. Regardless of clinical physical severity, 78% of the sample showed poor performances in at least one cognitive domain, with executive functions and psychomotor coordination being impaired in 50% and 57% of the sample. Baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which reflects the immune response and systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, predicted self-rated depressive symptomatology and cognitive impairment at three-months follow-up; and changes of SII predicted changes of depression during follow-up. Neurocognitive impairments associated with severity of depressive psychopathology, and processing speed, verbal memory and fluency, and psychomotor coordination were predicted by baseline SII. We hypothesize that COVID-19 could result in prolonged systemic inflammation that predisposes patients to persistent depression and associated neurocognitive dysfunction. The linkage between inflammation, depression, and neurocognition in patients with COVID-19 should be investigated in long-term longitudinal studies, to better personalize treatment options for COVID-19 survivors.","Gennaro, Mariagrazia, De Lorenzo, Cristiano, Sara, Roberto, Fabio, Patrizia, Francesco","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.02.021","20210227","COVID-19; Depression; Follow-up; Inflammation; Mental health; Psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-28","",11307,""
"COVID-19 mental health impact and responses in low-income and middle-income countries: reimagining global mental health","Most of the global population live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), which have historically received a small fraction of global resources for mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly in many of these countries. This Review examines the mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs in four parts. First, we review the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic on mental health, which shows high rates of psychological distress and early warning signs of an increase in mental health disorders. Second, we assess the responses in different countries, noting the swift and diverse responses to address mental health in some countries, particularly through the development of national COVID-19 response plans for mental health services, implementation of WHO guidance, and deployment of digital platforms, signifying a welcome recognition of the salience of mental health. Third, we consider the opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine global mental health, especially through shifting the balance of power from high-income countries to LMICs and from narrow biomedical approaches to community-oriented psychosocial perspectives, in setting priorities for interventions and research. Finally, we present a vision for the concept of building back better the mental health systems in LMICs with a focus on key strategies; notably, fully integrating mental health in plans for universal health coverage, enhancing access to psychosocial interventions through task sharing, leveraging digital technologies for various mental health tasks, eliminating coercion in mental health care, and addressing the needs of neglected populations, such as children and people with substance use disorders. Our recommendations are relevant for the mental health of populations and functioning of health systems in not only LMICs but also high-income countries impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with wide disparities in quality of and access to mental health care.","Kola, Kohrt, Hanlon, Naslund, Sikander, Balaji, Benjet, Cheung, Eaton, Gonsalves, Hailemariam, Luitel, Machado, Misganaw, Omigbodun, Roberts, Salisbury, Shidhaye, Sunkel, Ugo, van Rensburg, Gureje, Pathare, Saxena, Thornicroft, Patel","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(21)00025-0","20210227","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-28","",11308,""
"Google search behaviour relating to perinatal mental wellbeing during the United Kingdom's first COVID-19 lockdown period: a warning for future restrictions","Infodemiological studies derive public health information from internet activity. Here we compare Google searches of perinatal mental health-related terms during the U.K.'s first COVID-19 lockdown with the corresponding period in 2019. We report evidence of reduced pathologising/recognition of perinatal mental illness; increased perceivedÃ‚Â maternal inadequacy and estrangement from newborn baby; increased maternal domestic abuse; and increasedÃ‚Â domestic and substance abuse generally. These insights offer important population-level considerations ahead of further U.K. restrictions, and should be imminently confirmed with epidemiological work.","Chapman, Ishlek, Spoors","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-021-01110-x","20210227","Coronavirus; Infodemiology; Perinatal psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-28","",11309,""
"Anxiety and depression in allergic rhinitis patients during COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China","During COVID-19 pandemic, many allergic rhinitis (AR) patients stopped their treatment including pharmacotherapy and allergen immunotherapy. This study aimed to investigate the anxiety and depression and general effect of COVID-19 pandemic on AR patients' psychological status in Wuhan, China. In October 2019, 222 outpatients suffering from AR in our department and 133 healthy controls were enrolled. All participants were asked to finish the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire. The demographic characteristics and the severity of AR symptoms were recorded. In April 2020, the AR patients and healthy controls were re-contacted to finish the questionnaires by telephone or online. The SAS and SDS scores in AR patients and healthy controls and the correlation with other variables were analyzed. For AR patients, the SAS and SDS scores were significantly higher than healthy controls. Meanwhile, the rates of anxiety and depression were 24.8% and 19.4% respectively. The education level and symptoms severity were correlated with SAS and SDS scores. Ninety-eight AR patients and 56 healthy controls finished the questionnaires after COVID-19 pandemic. The AR patients' SAS and SDS scores were lower than before COVID-19 pandemic and were correlated with AR symptom scores. The scores of healthy controls were not different with before COVID-19 pandemic. The occurrence of anxiety and depression is common in AR patients. Severity of symptoms and low education level are the risk factors causing anxiety and depression. COVID-19 pandemic has no significant negative impact on the AR patients' psychological status.","Wang, Shi, Yang, Zhang, Li, Huang, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.12932/AP-140820-0941","20210227","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-28","",11310,""
"Mostly worse, occasionally better: impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Canadian children and adolescents","This large cross-sectional study examined the impact of COVID-19 emergency measures on child/adolescent mental health for children/adolescents with and without pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses. Using adapted measures from the CRISIS questionnaire, parents of children aged 6-18 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1013; 56% male; 62% pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis) and self-reporting children/adolescents aged 10-18 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°385) indicated changes in mental health across six domains: depression, anxiety, irritability, attention, hyperactivity, and obsessions/compulsions. Changes in anxiety, irritability, and hyperactivity were calculated for children aged 2-5Ã‚Â years using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. COVID-19 exposure, compliance with emergency measures, COVID-19 economic concerns, and stress from social isolation were measured with the CRISIS questionnaire. Prevalence of change in mental health status was estimated for each domain; multinomial logistic regression was used to determine variables associated with mental health status change in each domain. Depending on the age group, 67-70% of children/adolescents experienced deterioration in at least one mental health domain; however, 19-31% of children/adolescents experienced improvement in at least one domain. Children/adolescents without and with psychiatric diagnoses tended to experience deterioration during the first wave of COVID-19. Rates of deterioration were higher in those with a pre-exiting diagnosis. The rate of deterioration was variable across different age groups and pre-existing psychiatric diagnostic groups: depression 37-56%, anxiety 31-50%, irritability 40-66%, attention 40-56%, hyperactivity 23-56%, obsessions/compulsions 13-30%. Greater stress from social isolation was associated with deterioration in all mental health domains (all ORs 11.12-55.24). The impact of pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis was heterogenous, associated with deterioration in depression, irritability, hyperactivity, obsession/compulsions for some children (ORs 1.96-2.23) but also with improvement in depression, anxiety, and irritability for other children (ORs 2.13-3.12). Economic concerns were associated with improvement in anxiety, attention, and obsessions/compulsions (ORs 3.97-5.57). Children/adolescents with and without pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses reported deterioration. Deterioration was associated with increased stress from social isolation. Enhancing social interactions for children/adolescents will be an important mitigation strategy for current and future COVID-19 waves.","Cost, Crosbie, Anagnostou, Birken, Charach, Monga, Kelley, Nicolson, Maguire, Burton, Schachar, Arnold, Korczak","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01744-3","20210227","COVID-19; Child and adolescent psychiatry; Neurodevelopmental disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-28","",11311,""
"Living with COVID-19: a phenomenological study of hospitalised patients involved in family cluster transmission","To describe experiences of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 following family cluster transmission of the infection and the meaning of these experiences for them. A descriptive phenomenological design was used to construct themes depicting patients' experiences of living with COVID-19. This study was conducted in a major teaching hospital in Wuhan, China, in March 2020. Fourteen patients involved in family cluster transmission of COVID-19 were recruited into the study. The participants consisted of seven males and seven females. Data were collected through semistructured, in-depth, face-to-face interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Colaizzi's approach. Six themes emerged from data analysis during two distinct phases of patients going through COVID-19: the early outbreak phase and the later hospitalisation phase. Early in the outbreak, patients experienced life imbalances between individual well-being and family responsibilities. While facing widespread prejudice and rejection, patients dealt with the heavy toll that the illness had left on their body and mind. After being hospitalised, patients described feelings of living with uncertainty, sadness, fear of death and concerns about family, while simultaneously hoping for a better life after recovery. Our findings suggest that living with COVID-19 is an emotionally and physically challenging experience for patient participants in the study. Psychological evaluations need to be routinely carried out with patients in a public health crisis. Interprofessional and interorganisational collaborative efforts should be made to examine the physical and psychological sequelae of COVID-19, as well as investigate outcomes of existing intervention programmes.","Liu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046128","20210227","COVID-19; infectious diseases; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-28","",11312,""
"Experiences of healthcare providers during the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on them: protocol for a mixed-methods systematic review","Frontline healthcare providers are redeployed to areas outside their clinical expertise and assigned high-loading workload to address the surge of patients with each coronavirus outbreak. Their importance in crisis is not in doubt. However, they experienced considerable physical distress and psychological stressors, even leading to psychological illness and infection in this environment. There is an urgent need to accurately, comprehensively and objectively understand their experiences, perceptions and current situation of burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, insomnia and coronavirus infection. Therefore, this protocol is to conduct a mixed-methods systematic review to summarise the evidence on the experiences of healthcare providers and impacts of the coronavirus on their psychological status and infection during the pandemics. Published studies on experience, perspective, impact, burnout, PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and infection of healthcare providers with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and COVID-19, and written in English and Chinese will be accepted. Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, PubMed, Psychology Information, WanFang and SinoMed) from inception until 30 July 2020 will be searched. Two reviewers will select, screen, extract data and assess the risk of bias independently. Risk of bias of results will be using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Using a convergent integrated approach on qualitative/quantitative studies, we will synthesise qualitative and quantitative data separately. The incidence and number of cases about burnout, PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia and coronavirus infection among medical staff will be extracted. Then we will transform quantitative data to synthesise narrative findings. This protocol will be reported per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. Ethical assessment is not required due to the nature of the proposed systematic review. Findings of our research will be disseminated at conferences related to this field and through publication in peer-reviewed journals.

"A longitudinal study monitoring the quality of life in a national cohort of older adults in Chile before and during the COVID-19 outbreak","Confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic has placed great stress on older adults, which may be affecting their quality of life. Thus, this study aims to describe the changes in mental and physical health, isolation and loneliness, residence and socioeconomic resources in a national cohort of Chilean older adults before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. It also analyzes the changes in depressive symptoms by changes in the other quality of life indicators before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Possible methodological biases of telephone surveys in older adults living in non-developed countries are also discussed. Between June and September 2020, a random subsample of 720 people who had participated in the face-to-face V National Survey on Quality of Life in Older Adults in Chile conducted at the end of 2019 was followed up by telephone. Descriptive bivariate analyses were performed using t-test and non-parametric tests for independent variables, comparing the baseline sample with the current 2020 follow-up sample during the peak of the pandemic outbreak in Latin America. Furthermore, descriptive bivariate analysis through t-test and non-parametric test for paired samples compared the follow-up subsample at baseline with the not-included sample, examining possible biases of the telephone interview compared with the face-to-face interview. In the panel, there was no variation in self-rated health. The health symptoms that worsened were memory, stomach, and mood problems. Depressive symptoms and anxiety increased; similarly, smartphone users, social contacts, intergenerational co-residence and resilience increased. The telephone follow-up sample had a higher educational level and greater smartphone use than those not included in the subsample. Although some physical and mental health indicators have worsened during the pandemic, older adults mobilized resources that could allow them to maintain their quality of life, such as improved resilience. Thus, these findings can guide future research and the development of efficient strategies to improve these resources among older adults to ensure wellbeing.","Herrera, Elgueta, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Giacoman, Leal, Marshall, Rubio, Bustamante","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02110-3","20210227","COVID-19; Confinement, depressive symptoms, resilience, connectedness, loneliness; Health problems; Smartphone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-28","",11315,""
