"Ontario's response to COVID-19 shows that mental health providers must be integrated into provincial public health insurance systems","The fear, grief, social isolation, and financial and occupational losses from COVID-19 have created a mental health crisis. Ontario's response highlights the shortcomings of its physician-only public healthcare system that limits public access to appropriate and sustainable mental healthcare. Specifically, Ontario's attempt to rapidly expand mental healthcare access in response to COVID-19 includes new Ontario Health Insurance Program (OHIP) billing codes that enable physicians to provide telephonic trauma counselling and patient self-serve online tools while psychologist and other registered mental health provider services have been largely left out of the provincial response. Why? Non-physician mental health providers operate outside of the provincial healthcare infrastructure, including the provincial payer (i.e., OHIP) that facilitated the provincial physician response. A physician-centric mental healthcare system limits public access to quality, sustainable, evidence-based mental health services because most physicians do not have the capacity, training, or desire to provide mental health services. To improve public access to needed mental health services, provinces should integrate psychologists and other registered mental health providers directly into their public health insurance systems. Integrated providers can be strategically and sustainably mobilized to respond to COVID-19 and future mental health crises.","Scharf, Oinonen","https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00397-0","20200808","COVID-19; Equity; Mental health; Physicians; Public health insurance; Sustainability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-09","",3723,""
"Prevalence and Influencing Factors on Fatigue of First-line Nurses Combating with COVID-19 in China: A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study","Nurses' work-related fatigue has been recognized as a threat to nurse health and patient safety. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of fatigue among first-line nurses combating with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and to analyze its influencing factors on fatigue. A multi-center, descriptive, cross-sectional design with a convenience sample was used. The statistical population consisted of the first-line nurses in 7 tertiary general hospitals from March 3, 2020 to March 10, 2020 in Wuhan of China. A total of 2667 samples from 2768 contacted participants completed the investgation, with a response rate of 96.35%. Social-demographic questionnaire, work-related questionnaire, Fatigue Scale-14, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Chinese Perceived Stress Scale were used to conduct online survey. The descriptive statistic of nurses' social-demographic characteristics was conducted, and the related variables of work, anxiety, depression, perceived stress and fatigue were analyzed by t-tests, nonparametric test and Pearson's correlation analysis. The significant factors which resulted in nurses' fatigue were further analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. The median score for the first-line nurses' fatigue in Wuhan was 4 (2, 8). The median score of physical and mental fatigue of them was 3 (1, 6) and 1 (0, 3) respectively. According to the scoring criteria, 35.06% nurses (n=935) of all participants were in the fatigue status, their median score of fatigue was 10 (8, 11), and the median score of physical and mental fatigue of them was 7 (5, 8) and 3 (2, 4) respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed the participants in the risk groups of anxiety, depression and perceived stress had higher scores on physical and mental fatigue and the statistically significant positive correlation was observed between the variables and nurses' fatigue, the frequency of exercise and nurses' fatigue had a statistically significant negative correlation, and average daily working hours had a significantly positive correlation with nurses' fatigue, and the frequency of weekly night shift had a low positive correlation with nurses' fatigue (P&lt;0.01). There was a moderate level of fatigue among the first-line nurses fighting against COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China. Government and health authorities need to formulate and take effective intervention strategies according to the relevant risk factors, and undertake preventive measures aimed at reducing health hazards due to increased work-related fatigue among first-line nurses, and to enhance their health status and provide a safe occupational environment worldwide. Promoting both medical and nursing safety while combating with the pandemic currently is warranted.","Zhan, Zhao, Yuan, Liu, Liu, Gui, Zheng, Zhou, Qiu, Chen, Yu, Li","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11596-020-2226-9","20200808","COVID-19; Chinese nurses; anxiety; cross-sectional study; depression; fatigue; pandemic; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-09","",3724,""
"Communicating Mental Health Support to College Students During COVID-19: An Exploration of Website Messaging","College counseling centers are assumed to play a vital role in addressing students' mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to characterize the extent to which NYC metropolitan area school websites communicated to students their updated mental health service offerings, psychoeducational information related to COVID-19, and community-based resources after the abrupt end to on-campus services during the Spring semester. A total ofÃ‚Â 138 websites were analyzed. Overall, only half of the surveyed web pages provided information about remote counseling, and just under two thirds of schools (57.97%) had directions for students experiencing a mental health emergency. As predicted, enrollment size was associated with whether psychoeducation about mental health and COVID-19 and information about remote counseling were available on a school's website. In both cases, medium-sized schools were the most likely to have these resources available on their websites as compared to small and large-sized schools. College counseling center web pages should include robust and current information that targets schools' diverse student bodies.","Seidel, Mohlman, Basch, Fera, Cosgrove, Ethan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00905-w","20200808","COVID-19; College students; Mental health; Website messaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-09","",3725,""
"Challenges and management of neurological and psychiatric manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) patients","COVID-19 is a pandemic caused by human coronavirus (HCoV) SARS-CoV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and spread globally during 2020. Due to the difficulty of clinical decision-making during this period, our study group reviewed current literature focusing on the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. Despite the knowledge on this newly discovered virus which is constantly evolving, different pieces of evidence reported an association between COVID-19 and neurological symptoms like headache, dizziness, taste and smell disorders and complications involving the nervous system eventually triggered by the pathologic processes elicited by SARS-CoV-2. It seems that younger patients are less prone to develop severe forms of COVID-19. However, neurological signs have been reported in paediatric patients as well, and in some cases, the infection presented neurological sequelae. Furthermore, children with particular neurological diseases or treated with specific drugs (e.g. immune-suppressant therapies) must be carefully monitored during this pandemic. Neurologists should be aware of the main drug-drug interactions and the neurological side effects of COVID-19 treatments. Notably, adverse mental health impact has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2, which could be related either to the social strain or to the eventual neurotropic effects of the virus, which in other infections have been proven to promote the onset of psychiatric symptoms. Further, psychiatric population may be more vulnerable to the infection and at higher risk for adverse outcomes.","Orsini, Corsi, Santangelo, Riva, Peroni, Foiadelli, Savasta, Striano","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04544-w","20200808","Brain; CNS; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Neurologic; Psychiatric; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-09","",3726,""
"Psychological burden of healthcare professionals in Germany during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: differences and similarities in the international context","Healthcare professionals (HPs) are the key figures to keep up the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic and thus are one of the most vulnerable groups in this. To this point, the extent of this psychological burden, especially in Europe and Germany, remains unclear. This is the first study investigating German HPs after the COVID-19 outbreak. We performed an online-based cross-sectional study after the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany (10-31 March 2020). In total, 2224 HPs (physicians nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 492, nursing staff nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1511, paramedics nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 221) and 10Ã‚Â 639 non-healthcare professionals (nHPs) were assessed including generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), current health status (EQ-5D-3L), COVID-19-related fear, subjective level of information regarding COVID-19. HPs showed less generalized anxiety, depression and COVID-19-related fear and higher health status and subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 than the nHPs. Within the HP groups, nursing staff were the most psychologically burdened. Subjective levels of information regarding COVID-19 correlated negatively with generalized anxiety levels across all groups. Among HPs, nursing staff showed the highest and paramedics the lowest generalized anxiety levels. In the context of COVID-19, German HPs seem to be less psychological burdened than nHPs, and also less burdened compared with existing international data.","Skoda, Teufel, Stang, JÃƒÂ¶ckel, Junne, WeismÃƒÂ¼ller, Hetkamp, Musche, Kohler, DÃƒÂ¶rrie, Schweda, BÃƒÂ¤uerle","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa124","20200808","COVID-19; generalized anxiety; healthcare professionals; information; psychological burden","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-09","",3727,""
"Accounting for external factors and early intervention adoption in the design and analysis of stepped-wedge designs: Application to a proposed study design to reduce opioid-related mortality","Stepped-wedge designs (SWDs) are currently being used to investigate interventions to reduce opioid overdose deaths in communities located in several states. However, these interventions are competing with external factors such as newly initiated public policies limiting opioid prescriptions, media awareness campaigns, and social distancing orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, control communities may prematurely adopt components of the proposed intervention as they become widely available. These types of events induce confounding of the intervention effect by time. Such confounding is a well-known limitation of SWDs; a common approach to adjusting for it makes use of a mixed effects modeling framework that includes both fixed and random effects for time. However, these models have several shortcomings when multiple confounding factors are present. We discuss the limitations of existing methods based on mixed effects models in the context of proposed SWDs to investigate interventions intended to reduce mortality associated with the opioid epidemic, and propose solutions to accommodate deviations from assumptions that underlie these models. We conduct an extensive simulation study of anticipated data from SWD trials targeting the current opioid epidemic in order to examine the performance of these models under different sources of confounding. We specifically examine the impact of factors external to the study and premature adoption of intervention components. When only external factors are present, our simulation studies show that commonly used mixed effects models can result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, but have inflated Type 1 error and result in under coverage of confidence intervals. These models are severely biased when confounding factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters; premature adoption of intervention components is an example of this scenario. In these scenarios, models that incorporate fixed intervention-by-time interaction terms and an unstructured covariance for the intervention-by-cluster-by-time random effects result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, reach nominal confidence interval coverage, and preserve Type 1 error, but may reduce power. The incorporation of fixed and random time effects in mixed effects models require certain assumptions about the impact of confounding by time in SWD. Violations of these assumptions can result in severe bias of the intervention effect estimate, under coverage of confidence intervals, and inflated Type 1 error. Since model choice has considerable impact on study power as well as validity of results, careful consideration needs to be given to choosing an appropriate model that takes into account potential confounding factors.","Rennert, Heo, Litwin, de Grutolla","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162297","20200808","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-09","",3728,""
"Emotional responses and coping strategies in nurses and nursing students during Covid-19 outbreak: A comparative study","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in December has seen more than 76,000 cases in China, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections. As the disease is highly contagious, can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses, leading to a severe impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Therefore, this study will investigate nurses' emotional responses and coping styles, and conduct a comparative study with nursing college students. This study was conducted through the online survey 'questionnaire star' from February 1st to February 20th, 2020 in Anhui Province, using the snowball sampling method to invite subjects. The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities exhibited these symptoms more than participants from rural areas, however rural participants experienced more sadness than urban participants. The nearer a COVID-19 zone is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. The COVID-19 outbreak has placed immense pressure on hospitals and those nurses at the frontline are more seriously affected. Hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses and training in coping strategies.","Huang, Lei, Xu, Liu, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237303","20200808","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-09","",3729,""
"Mental Health of Medical and Non-Medical Professionals during the Peak of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Nationwide Study","The study aimed to compare psychopathological expressions during the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, as declared on March 11th 2020 by the World Health Organization, with respect to which institutional variables might distinguish the impact of COVID-19 in medical and non-medical professionals. A cross-sectional study was performed nationwide between 16th March and the 26th April 2020 in Poland. A total of 2039 respondents representing all healthcare providers (59.8%) as well as other professionals filled in the sociodemographic section, the General Health Questionnaire-28 and the author's questionnaire with questions related to exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the availability of protective measures, quarantine, change of working hours and place of employment during the pandemic, as well as feelings associated with the state of the pandemic. Medical professionals more often presented with relevant psychopathological symptoms (GHQ-28 (General Health Questionnaire-28) total score &gt;24) than the non-medical group (60.8% vs. 48.0%, respectively) such as anxiety, insomnia and somatic symptoms even after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Male sex, older age and appropriate protective equipment were associated with significantly lower GHQ-28 total scores in medical professionals, whereas among non-medical professionals, male sex was associated with significantly lower GHQ-28 total scores. Somatic and anxiety symptoms as well as insomnia are more prevalent among medical staff than workers in other professions. Targeting the determinants of these differences should be included in interventions aimed at restoring psychological well-being in this specific population. Apparently, there are present gender differences in psychological responses that are independent of profession.","Maciaszek, Ciulkowicz, Misiak, Szczesniak, Luc, Wieczorek, Fila-Witecka, Gawlowski, Rymaszewska","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9082527","20200808","SARS-CoV-2; healthcare personnel; infectious disease; psychiatry; psychopathological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-09","",3730,""

"Work-related and Personal Factors Associated with Mental Well-being during COVID-19 Response: A Survey of Health Care and Other Workers","Background: Response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an unprecedented disruption in work conditions. This study describes the mental health and well-being among workers both with and without clinical exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Objective: Measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work-exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and describe work-related and personal factors associated with their mental health and well-being. Methods: All faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows of a university, including its medical school, were invited in April 2020 to complete an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. We examined associations between these outcomes and factors including work in high-risk clinical settings, and family/home stressors. Results: There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). 38% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 57% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. Among all workers, anxiety, depression, and high work exhaustion were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19 [Prevalence Ratios and 95% confidence intervals 1.37 (1.09 - 1.73), 1.28 (1.03 - 1.59), and 1.24 (1.13 - 1.36) respectively]. Poor family supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes [1.40 (1.21 - 1.62), 1.69 (1.48 - 1.92), 1.54 (1.44 - 1.64)]. Age below 40 and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with these poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and work in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health and well-being of both clinical and non-clinical employees. Mitigating exposure to COVID-19 and increasing supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being for all workers.","Evanoff, Strickland, Dale, Hayibor, Page, Duncan, Kannampallil, Gray","https://doi.org/10.2196/21366","20200808","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-09","",3732,""

A total of 612 volunteers between the ages of 18-38 enrolled in the study, 418 of them were athletes engaged in team sports or individual sports and 194 of them were non-athletes. Participants completed the Depression - Anxiety - Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ). Non-parametric methods were used for comparisons between groups. The presence of a linear relationship was tested with the Spearman Correlation Test. A value of p&lt;0.05 was accepted statistically significant. A total of 571 participants, 372 males and 199 females, completed the study. Depression and anxiety symptoms were lower in athletes compared to non-athletes (p&lt;0.05). Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were similar in team athletes and individual athletes (p=0.232, p=0.444, p=0.116; respectively).

"Fear and Psychopathology During the COVID-19 Crisis: Neuroticism, Hypochondriasis, Reassurance-Seeking, and Coronaphobia as Fear Factors","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a rise in psychological distress worldwide. Although fear appears to be a major contributing factor, there has been no systematic research to determine which specific facets of fear predict psychopathology during the coronavirus crisis. The present study is the first to examine which fear factors uniquely predict clinical levels of depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety. Data were collected from 256 adults in the United States recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) during the coronavirus pandemic. The results from logistic regression analyses demonstrated that neuroticism, coronaphobia, and hypochondriasis were fear factors that predicted pandemic-related psychopathology in adults.

"Functional and Dysfunctional Fear of COVID-19: A Classification Scheme","Worry about COVID-19 is a central topic of research into the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worry can be a negative and debilitating experience that damages mental health and discourages healthy re-engagement with the world, but it can also be a problem-solving activity, directing peopleâ€™s attention to problems, and encouraging them to act accordingly. We present in this paper a way of measuring worry about catching COVID-19 that distinguishes between â€œfunctional fearâ€ and â€œdysfunctional fear.â€ Drawing on work into fear of crime, our classification divides people into three groups: (1) the unworried, (2) the functionally worried (adaptive emotions encourage proactive behaviours to reduce the chance of infection) and (3) the dysfunctionally worried (quality of life is damaged by the emotional experience or taking ineffective or damaging precautions). Analysing data from two waves of a longitudinal panel study of over 1,000 individuals living in ten cities in England, Scotland and Wales, we find differing levels of negative anxiety, anger, loneliness, unhappiness and life satisfaction for each of the three groups, with dysfunctionally worried experiencing the most negative outcomes and functionally worried experiencing less negative outcomes than unworried. We find no difference between groups in compliance and willingness to re-engage in social life. Finally, we compare perceptions of risk (differentiating between likelihood, control and consequence) for each group, and find a difference between the dysfunctionally worried compared with functional and unworried groups. Our findings inform what sort of content-targeted messaging aimed at reducing dysfunctional worry might wish to promote. We conclude with some thoughts on the applicability of our measurement scheme for future research.","Reka Solymosi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46108-D58-862","20200808","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; risk; wellbeing; worry; covid-19; precautions; re-engagement","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-09","",3737,""
