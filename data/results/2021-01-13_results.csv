"Rates and predictors of uptake of formal and informal mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic: an analysis of 26,740 adults in the UK in lockdown","Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put a great strain on people's mental health. A growing number of studies have shown worsening mental health measures globally during the pandemic. However, there is a lack of empirical study on how people support their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine a number of formal and informal mental health supports. Further, it explored factors that might be associated with the use of different types mental health support. Method: Data from 26,740 adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study were analysed between 13th April, 2020 and 3rd July, 2020. Data were analysed using logistic and Poisson regression models. Results: About 45% of people reported talking to friends or family members to support their mental health, 43% engaging in self-care activities, 20% taking medication, 9% speaking to mental health professionals, 8% talking to a GP or other health professional, and another 8% using helpline or online services. Gender, education, living status, loneliness, pre-existing mental health conditions, general depression and anxiety, coping and personality were found to be associated with the use of mental health support. Conclusion: While the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are inevitable, people can play an active role in managing their mental health. Understanding the patterns and predictors of various kinds of mental health support during the pandemic is crucial for future service planning and delivery through recognising potential barriers to mental health care faced by certain groups.","Feifei Bu; Hei Wan Mak; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249509","20210113","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9304,""
"Impact of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) on the Mental Health and Physical Activity of Pharmacy Students at the University of Zambia: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a serious global health problem that has negatively impacted the mental health of students. Methods: We conducted an online descriptive cross-sectional study among 273 undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. A partial proportional odds regression model was used to determine the predictors of anxiety. All statistical tests were set at 95% confidence level (p<0.05). Results: A response rate of 70% was obtained with the majority of the students being female 51.6%. Of the 273 respondents, 23.8% did not experience anxiety, 34.4% experienced mild anxiety, 24.9% experienced moderate anxiety while 16.9% experienced severe anxiety about COVID-19. It was also found that 61.2% of students reported that their attention to mental health increased during the COVID-19 pandemic whereas 44.3% reported an increased resting time with a significant reduction in relaxation 51.3% and physical activity 45.4% time. Factors that affected mental health included; reduced family care (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.09-4.74 ), not changing attention to mental health (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.18-0.62), being in the final year of study (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13-0.84), reduced time of resting (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.26-3.50) and feeling helpless (OR: 0.42; 95% CI:0.23-0.75). Conclusion: COVID-19 negatively impacted the mental health and physical activity of pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. This can have negative health and academic outcomes for students going forward. Higher learning institutions and key stakeholders should implement measures to aid students to recover from the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health and physical activity.

"Association of Social Media Use With Mental Health Conditions of Nonpatients During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Insights from a National Survey Study","BACKGROUND: Considerable research has been devoted to examining the mental health conditions of patients with COVID-19 and medical staff attending to these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are few insights concerning how the pandemic may take a toll on the mental health of the general population, and especially of nonpatients (ie, individuals who have not contracted COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between social media use and mental health conditions in the general population based on a national representative sample during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: We formed a national representative sample (N=2185) comprising participants from 30 provinces across China, who were the first to experience the COVID-19 outbreak in the world. We administered a web-based survey to these participants to analyze social media use, health information support received via social media, and possible psychiatric disorders, including secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious trauma (VT). RESULTS: Social media use did not cause mental health issues, but it mediated the levels of traumatic emotions among nonpatients. Participants received health information support via social media, but excessive social media use led to elevated levels of stress (ÃŸ=.175; P<.001), anxiety (ÃŸ=.224; P<.001), depression (ÃŸ=.201; P<.001), STS (ÃŸ=.307; P<.001), and VT (ÃŸ=.688; P<.001). Geographic location (or geolocation) and lockdown conditions also contributed to more instances of traumatic disorders. Participants living in big cities were more stressed than those living in rural areas (P=.02). Furthermore, participants from small cities or towns were more anxious (P=.01), stressed (P<.001), and depressed (P=.008) than those from rural areas. Obtaining more informational support (ÃŸ=.165; P<.001) and emotional support (ÃŸ=.144; P<.001) via social media increased their VT levels. Peer support received via social media increased both VT (ÃŸ=.332; P<.001) and STS (ÃŸ=.130; P<.001) levels. Moreover, geolocation moderated the relationships between emotional support on social media and VT (F2=3.549; P=.029) and the association between peer support and STS (F2=5.059; P=.006). Geolocation also interacted with health information support in predicting STS (F2=5.093; P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has taken a severe toll on the mental health of the general population, including individuals who have no history of psychiatric disorders or coronavirus infection. This study contributes to the literature by establishing the association between social media use and psychiatric disorders among the general public during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study findings suggest that the causes of such psychiatric disorders are complex and multifactorial, and social media use is a potential factor. The findings also highlight the experiences of people in China and can help global citizens and health policymakers to mitigate the effects of psychiatric disorders during this and other public health crises, which should be regarded as a key component of a global pandemic response.","Zhong, Bu; Jiang, Zhibin; Xie, Wenjing; Qin, Xuebing","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23696","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e23696, 2020 12 31.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e23696, 2020 12 31.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9306,""
"Nurse-led PrEP-RN clinic: a prospective cohort study exploring task-Shifting HIV prevention to public health nurses","OBJECTIVE: To report the results of a nurse-led pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) delivery service. DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study conducted from 5 August 2018 to 4 March 2020. It involved manual chart review to collect data. Variables were described using frequencies and percentages and analysed using &#967;2 testing. Those significant in bivariate analysis were retained and entered into a binary multiple logistic regression. Hierarchical modelling was used, and only significant factors were retained. SETTING: This study occurred in an urban public health unit and community-based sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in Ottawa, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Of all persons who were diagnosed with a bacterial STI in Ottawa and everyone who presented to our STI clinic during the study period, there were 347 patients who met our high-risk criteria for PrEP; these criteria included patients who newly presented with any of the following: HIV contacts, diagnosed with a bacterial STI or single use of HIV PEP. Further, eligibility could be determined based on clinical judgement. Patients who met the foregoing criteria were appropriate for PrEP-RN, while lower-risk patients were referred to elsewhere. Of the 347 patients who met our high-risk criteria, 47% accepted and 53% declined. Of those who accepted, 80% selected PrEP-registered nurse (RN). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Uptake, acceptance, engagement and attrition factors of participants who obtained PrEP through PrEP-RN. FINDINGS: 69% of participants who were eligible attended their intake PrEP-RN visit. 66% were retained in care. Half of participants continued PrEP and half were lost to follow-up. We found no significant differences in the uptake, acceptance, engagement and attrition factors of participants who accessed PrEP-RN regarding reason for referral, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, annual income, education attainted, insurance status, if they have a primary care provider, presence or absence of depression or anxiety and evidence of newly acquired STI during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-led PrEP is an appropriate strategy for PrEP delivery.","O'Byrne, Patrick; Vandyk, Amanda; Orser, Lauren; Haines, Marlene","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040817","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(1): e040817, 2021 Jan 07.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(1): e040817, 2021 Jan 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9307,""
"""It seems like COVID-19 now is the only disease present on Earth"": living with a rare or undiagnosed disease during the COVID-19 pandemic","PURPOSE: Patients with rare and undiagnosed diseases (RUDs) face significant health challenges, which may be exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this study was to identify specific impacts of the pandemic on RUD patients, and targets for improving support and health-care access. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of RUD patients and their family members from 21 April to 8 June 2020, recruited from 76 Facebook groups for RUDs. Questions assessed patient characteristics and impacts of the pandemic on RUD diagnosis and management. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 413), including 274 RUD patients and 139 family members, were predominantly female and white, though income varied. Impacts of the pandemic included (1) barriers to accessing essential health care, (2) specific impacts of restrictive COVID-19 visitation policies on ability to advocate in health-care settings, (3) uncertainty and fear regarding COVID-19 risk, (4) exacerbated physical and mental health challenges, (5) magnified impacts of reduced educational and therapeutic services, and (6) unexpected positive changes due to the pandemic. CONCLUSION: There are specific, serious challenges affecting RUD patients and families during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to develop approaches to mitigate these challenges both during and beyond the pandemic.","Halley, Meghan C; Stanley, Talia; Maturi, Jay; Goldenberg, Aaron J; Bernstein, Jonathan A; Wheeler, Matthew T; Tabor, Holly K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41436-020-01069-7","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Genet Med;2021 Jan 08.; Publication details: Genet Med;2021 Jan 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9308,""

"What Happens When Training Goes Virtual? Adapting Training and Technical Assistance for the School Mental Health Workforce in Response to COVID-19","The Northwest Mental Health Technology Transfer Center (MHTTC) provides workforce training and technical assistance (TA) to support evidence-based school mental health practices. Historically, this support targeted school professionals through in-person and online trainings, workshops, and coaching. However, in response to COVID-19 restrictions, all support moved to online formats, and the Center introduced trainings for families and caregivers. The purpose of this article is to present preliminary process and outcome data that compare the reach and impact of support before and following COVID-19-related restrictions. Results suggest that transition to online support resulted in a wider reach and a more diverse audience, with no decrease in trainee satisfaction and perceived impact. Furthermore, families and caregivers reported positive gains in knowledge and behaviors following participation in a virtual youth suicide prevention training. Together, these findings suggest that online training and TA can provide tangible benefits to professionals and family members who support student mental health.","Olson, Jonathan R; Lucy, Megan; Kellogg, Marianne A; Schmitz, Kelcey; Berntson, Taylor; Stuber, Jennifer; Bruns, Eric J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12310-020-09401-x","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: School Ment Health;: 1-14, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication details: School Ment Health;: 1-14, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9310,""
"Mental Health Status, Anxiety, and Depression Levels of Bangladeshi University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected people of all ages across the world both physically and psychologically. Understanding COVID-19's impact on university students' mental health status in Bangladesh has been limited, yet is a necessary population to study, since they are particularly vulnerable to stress and mental health issues. This study assessed anxiety, depressive symptoms, and mental health status among university students in Bangladesh. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Revised Scale, and Mental Health Inventory-5 were translated into Bangla and administered to university students (N = 874) online. In total, 40% of the participants had moderate to severe anxiety, 72% had depressive symptoms and 53% had moderate to poor mental health status. Moreover, path analysis showed worrying about COVID-19 and knowledge about the virus predicted anxiety and moderate to poor mental health status; knowledge and belief about COVID-19's severity in Bangladesh predicted depressive symptoms. Thus, revealing that mental health issues were high and COVID-19 worry predicted psychopathology symptoms among Bangladeshi university students. Overall, these results, examining students' mental health during COVID-19, in April 2020, can be helpful to compare how students have adjusted over the pandemic's progression.","Faisal, Rajib Ahmed; Jobe, Mary C; Ahmed, Oli; Sharker, Tanima","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00458-y","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-16, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-16, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9311,""
"Changes in Alcohol Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact of the Lockdown Conditions and Mental Health Factors","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to governments taking a number of restrictive measures. Confinement at home during the COVID-19 crisis could have major implications on mental health and alcohol use behaviors among the whole population. The present study focuses on the role of individual characteristics, contextual factors, and mental health variables on alcohol consumption. A sample of 2871 adults (79% women) were recruited from the general population through an online self-report questionnaire. Sociodemographic data, lockdown conditions, occupational/physical activity, proximity of contamination, mental health (anxiety, depression, and intolerance of uncertainty), and alcohol consumption (frequency, quantity, and changes) have been assessed. Among participants, 49.1% of the population reported stable alcohol consumption, 24.5% reported a decreased in alcohol consumption since the beginning of the lockdown and 26.4% reported an increase in consumption. Our findings indicate that those individuals who increased their alcohol consumption during the lockdown are often older, working from home, more likely to have children, higher educated, and consume alcohol more frequently and in higher quantities. They also have a greater proximity to contamination and higher levels of anxiety and depression. Our results are discussed in terms of preventive implications.","Schmits, E; Glowacz, F","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00432-8","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-12, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Addict;: 1-12, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9312,""

An Italian field study","Since the early months of the COVID-19 epidemic, a large number of scientific papers have considered the possibility that healthcare professionals (HCWs) were affected by depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and psychological distress  The abundance of research has also made it possible to produce several systematic reviews and meta-analyzes  All the studies retrieved in these reviews, however, were cross-sectional  Depressive symptoms and anxiety in HCWs were compared to â€œnormal valuesâ€, administrative staff, or external sample;moreover, some studies had no control group  No longitudinal study has been produced so far  Some studies had negative results  Overall, there is still little evidence of an increase in mental health problems and sleep disturbances in HCWs during the outbreak  To fill this gap, we investigated the mental health of workers who have been monitored for many years in an Italian local health unit  Mental health was investigated with standardized questionnaires  82 HCWs who tested positive at the COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab, 152 exposed workers who tested negative and 361 unexposed controls participated in the survey  Anxiety was reported by 16 6% of COVID-19 cases and depression by 20 3%, with a significant increase in the estimated risk (OR = 4 3;CI95%=2 4-7 4 for anxiety, OR = 3 5;CI95% =2 0-6 0 for depression)  In test-positive cases, sleep was a significant moderating factor in the relationship between occupational stress or PJ and anxiety  Exposed, negative HCWS also had an increased OR for anxiety (1 84, CI95% 1 1-3 1) and depression (2 2 CI95% 1 4-3 5)  The frequency of anxiety and depression disorders in the population examined was not higher than that recorded in the years preceding the epidemic during periodic occupational health checks in the workplace  Mental health support and organizational interventions must mainly concern workers with positive tests and should also tend to improve sleep quality  Key messages Health care workers who have had unprotected exposure to COVID-19 patients, and even more those who have contracted the infection, have sleep problems, anxiety and depression  The psychological support intervention for health care workers should include the promotion of sleep hygiene","Magnavita, N.; Di Prinzio, R.

"Mental health of staff working in intensive care during COVID-19","Staff working in intensive care units (ICUs) have faced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic which have the potential to adversely affect their mental health. To identify the rates of probable mental health disorder in staff working in ICUs in nine English hospitals during June and July 2020. An anonymized brief web-based survey comprising standardized questionnaires examining depression, anxiety symptoms, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), well-being and alcohol use was administered to staff. Seven hundred and nine participants completed the surveys comprising 291 (41%) doctors, 344 (49%) nurses and 74 (10%) other healthcare staff. Over half (59%) reported good well-being; however, 45% met the threshold for probable clinical significance on at least one of the following measures: severe depression (6%), PTSD (40%), severe anxiety (11%) or problem drinking (7%). Thirteen per cent of respondents reported frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or of hurting themselves in the past 2 weeks. Within the sample used in this study, we found that doctors reported better mental health than nurses across a range of measures. We found substantial rates of probable mental health disorders, and thoughts of self-harm, amongst ICU staff; these difficulties were especially prevalent in nurses. Whilst further work is needed to better understand the real level of clinical need amongst ICU staff, these results indicate the need for a national strategy to protect the mental health, and decrease the risk of functional impairment, of ICU staff whilst they carry out their essential work during COVID-19.","Greenberg, Weston, Hall, Caulfield, Williamson, Fong","https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqaa220","20210112","COVID-19; PTSD; doctors; intensive care; mental health; nurses; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9354,""

"Spread, Scale-up and Sustainability of Video Consulting in Health Care: A Systematic Review and Synthesis Guided by the NASSS Framework","Covid-19 has thrust video consulting into the limelight, as health care practitioners around the world shift to delivering care remotely. Evidence suggests that video consulting is acceptable, safe and effective in selected conditions and settings. However, research to date has mostly focused on initial adoption with limited consideration of how video consulting can be mainstreamed and sustained. The study sought to (a) review and synthesize reported opportunities, challenges and lessons learnt in the scale-up, spread, and sustainability of video consultations, and (b) identify transferable insights that can inform policy and practice. We identified papers through systematic searches in PubMed, CINAHL and Web of Science. Included articles reported on synchronous, video-based consultations that had spread to more than one setting beyond an initial pilot or feasibility stage, and were published since 2010. We used the Non-adoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to synthesise findings relating to 7 domains: an understanding of the health condition(s) for which video consultations were being used, the material properties of the technological platform and relevant peripherals, the value proposition for patients and developers, the role of the adopter system, organisational factors, wider macro-level considerations, as well as emergence over time. We identified 13 papers describing 10 different video consultation services in 6 regions, covering (i) video-to-home services, connecting providers directly to the patient; (ii) hub-and-spoke models, connecting a provider at a central hub to a patient at a rural centre; and (iii) large-scale top-down evaluations scaled-up or spread across a national health administration. Services covered rehabilitation, geriatrics, cancer surgery, diabetes, and mental health, and general specialist care and primary care. Potential enablers to spread and scale-up included embedded leadership and the presence of a telehealth champion, appropriate reimbursement mechanisms, user-friendly technology, pre-existing staff relationships, and adaptation (of technology and services) over time. Challenges tended to focus on service development, such as the absence of a long-term strategic plan, resistance to change, cost and reimbursement issues and technical experience of staff. There was limited articulation of the challenges to scale-up and spread of video consultations. This was combined with a lack of theorization, with papers tending to view spread and scale-up as the sum of multiple technical implementations, rather than theorising the distinct processes required to achieve widespread adoption. There remains a significant lack of evidence that can support spread and scale-up of video consulting. Given the recent pace of change due to Covid-19, a more definitive evidence base is urgently needed that can support global efforts and match enthusiasm for extending use.","James, Papoutsi, Wherton, Greenhalgh, Shaw","https://doi.org/10.2196/23775","20210112","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9356,""

The current pandemic also triggers several psychological changes. Uncertainties and changes in health practices may cause anxiety, depression, and concerns on vulnerable populations such as pregnant. This study aims to survey the pregnant women to capture the psychological impact and perceptions during the pandemic. A total of 297 pregnant women agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years were enrolled in May 2020. We evaluated the hard-copy survey included questions about demographic and clinical information of patients, 95% confidence intervals of a COVID-19-related questionnaire in a Likert scale and 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A total of 297 pregnant women were included in this study with a mean age of 27.64. Most patients (82.5%) had concerns about infecting their babies during delivery. The fear of infection of the fetus during delivery revealed elderly age and having anxiety as the unique significant risk factors. Mean HADS-A and HADS-D scores were 7.94 (Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.03) and 7.23 (Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.84), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed having anxiety was associated with a high HADS-D score and concern about the inability to reach obstetrician, and being in advanced age, having a high HADS-A score, and concern about the inability to reach obstetrician demonstrated significant effects on HADS-D score. We conclude that in future pandemics, communications and reassurance of the patients should be prioritized upon their routine ante-natal care to avoid increased levels of anxiety and even depression.","Akgor, FadÃ„Â±loglu, Soyak, Unal, Cagan, Temiz, Erzenoglu, Ak, Gultekin, Ozyuncu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-020-05944-1","20210112","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Pandemic; Pregnancy; Psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9358,""

The current study is the first, to our knowledge, to document the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of undergraduates in a heavily impacted area in the United States. Cross-sectional, self-report data on psychological distress and COVID-19 exposure were collected from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of 641 undergraduates between April 7-9 May 2020. Nearly half of the students reported elevated psychological distress, including health anxiety, general anxiety, and depression. Heightened risk of psychological distress was associated with female sex, a COVID-19 case in one's immediate social network, underlying medical vulnerabilities, and recent experience of Ã¢â€°Â¥3 viral symptoms. Vigilance to viral symptoms and worry about coronavirus were also factors associated with more severe psychological distress. The current study highlights some of the factors associated with a greater risk of developing psychological distress due to COVID-19 and can be used to inform the dissemination of psychological interventions.","Kibbey, Fedorenko, Farris","https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2020.1853805","20210112","COVID-19; illness anxiety; mental health; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9360,""

The purpose of this research was to determine anxiety and depression levels, clinical features, and the connections between demographic variables and depression prevalence as well as anxiety prevalence among reported COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh. For the purpose of data collection, an online cross-sectional survey was carried out from May 26 to June 27, 2020, utilizing a Google adapted preformed questionnaire. The form was shared with a short overview and justification through Facebook, Twitter, Facebook messenger, Viber, and What's App. The Google form contains five parts: a brief introduction, an approval statement, demographics, clinical and radiological data, and mental health assessment by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Formal ethical clearance was taken from the Institute of Biological Science (IBSc), Bangladesh. Informed consent was ensured before participation. One hundred and fifty-three (153) patients with COVID-19 who had an average age of 39.43Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.59Ã‚Â years with male predominance (72%) were included. A total of 32.7% were doing health-care related jobs, and 17.7% lost their jobs due to COVID-19. Patients had a median income of 30,000 Bangladesh taka (BDT). Of all, 12.4% of the participants showed asymptomatic features, whereas 87.6% of patients were symptomatic and presented with fever (79%), cough (58.8%), myalgia (24.2%), breathlessness (23.5%), sore throat (21.6%), fatigue (19.6%), headache (13.7%), nausea and/or vomiting (11.8%), runny nose (9.8%), chest pain (9.2%), diarrhea (8.5%), stuffy nose (3.2%), ARDS (2.6%), oral ulcer (2.6%), and conjunctivitis (1.9%). Overall, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 63.5% and 56.6%, respectively. Among the participants, 13.2% had only anxiety, 6.3% had only depression, and 50.3% had both. In most cases, middle age, male, and healthy workers were patients. Fever and cough were the standard presentations. Approximately two-thirds or 66.67% of patients had anxiety and depression, one or both.","Mina, Billah, Karmakar, Das, Rahman, Hasan, Acharjee","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-020-01445-2","20210112","Anxiety; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Clinical characteristics; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9363,""
"Employment Uncertainty and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic Initial Social Distancing Implementation: a Cross-national Study","Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in the work environment and employment uncertainty. This paper reports on a cross-national comparison of four countries (Norway, UK, USA and Australia) and examines the differences in mental health between those individuals employed and those not employed during the social distancing implementation. Participants (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3,810) were recruited through social media in April/May 2020 and were invited to complete a self-administered electronic survey over a 3-week period. Differences between those employed and those not employed with regard to their sociodemographic characteristics and mental health were investigated with chi-square tests, independent <i>t</i> tests, and one-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs). Compared with their counterparts, participants who were employed reported lower levels of mental health distress (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), higher levels of psychosocial well-being (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), better overall quality of life (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and lower levels of overall loneliness, social loneliness, and emotional loneliness (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Small to medium but consistent differences (Cohen's <i>d</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.23-0.67) in mental health favor those with employment or those who were retired. Further study is needed to assess mental health over time as the COVID-19 pandemic and employment uncertainty continues.","Ruffolo, Price, Schoultz, Leung, Bonsaksen, Thygesen, Geirdal","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40609-020-00201-4","20210112","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Economic uncertainty; Employment; Mental health; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9364,""
"Fear of COVID-19 in Romania: Validation of the Romanian Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale Using Graded Response Model Analysis","One of the basic emotions generated by the COVID-19 pandemic is the fear of contacting this disease. The main aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Romanian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), based on classical test theory and item response theory, namely, graded response model. The FCV-19S was translated into Romanian following a forward-backward translation procedure. The reliability and validity of the instrument were assessed in a sample of 809 adults (34.6%Ã‚Â males; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°32.61; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±11.25; age range from 18 to 68Ã‚Â years). Results showed that the Romanian FCV-19S had very good internal consistency (Cronbach's alphaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.88; McDonald's omegaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.89; composite reliabilityÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.89). The confirmatory factor analysis for one-factor FCV-19S based on the maximum likelihood estimation method with Satorra-Bentler correction for non-normality proved that the model fitted well (CFIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.99, TLIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.97, RMSEAÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.06, 90% CI [.05, .09], SRMRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). As for criterion-related validity, the fear of COVID-19 score correlated with depression (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.25, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), stress (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.45, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), resilience (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°.22, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and happiness (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.33, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). The heterotrait-monotrait criteria less than .85 certified the discriminant validity of the FCV-19S-RO. The GRM analysis highlighted robustÃ‚Â psychometric properties of the scale and measurement invariance across gender. These findings emphasized validity for the use of Romanian version of FCV-19S and expanding the existing body of research on the fear of COVID-19.Ã‚Â Overall, the current research contributes to the literature not only by validating the FCV-19S-RO but also by considering the positive psychology approach in the study of fear of COVID-19, emphasizing a negative relationship among resilience, happiness and fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","StÃ„Æ’nculescu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00428-4","20210112","COVID-19 pandemic; Coronavirus; Depression; Graded response model; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9365,""
"Assessment of Fear of COVID-19 in Older Adults: Validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale","There is no information in Peru on the prevalence of mental health problems associated with COVID-19 in older adults. In this sense, the aim of the study was to gather evidence on the factor structure, criterion-related validity, and reliability of the Spanish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in this population. The participants were 400 older adults (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°68.04, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.41), who were administered the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Revised Mental Health Inventory-5, Patient Health Questionnaire-2 items, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 2 items. Structural equation models were estimated, specifically confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), bifactor CFA, and structural models with latent variables (SEM). Internal consistency was estimated with composite reliability indexes (CRI) and omega coefficients. A bifactor model with both a general factor underlying all items plus a specific factor underlying items 1, 2, 4, and 5 representing the emotional response to COVID better represents the factor structure of the scale. This structure had adequate fit and good reliability, and additionally fear of COVID had a large effect on mental health. In general, women had more fear than men, having more information on COVID was associated to more fear, while having family or friends affected by COVID did not related to fear of the virus. The Spanish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale presents evidence of validity and reliability to assess fear of COVID-19 in the Peruvian older adult population.","Caycho-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, TomÃƒÂ¡s, Barboza-Palomino, Ventura-LeÃƒÂ³n, Gallegos, Reyes-Bossio, Vilca","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00438-2","20210112","Bifactor model; Fear of COVID-19; Older adults; Reliability; Validity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9366,""

"Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders: narrative review","COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, by the World Health Organization. The pandemic has had unprecedented worldwide implications, in particular on marginalized populations. The aim of this study is to review the impact of the pandemic on patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. A number of databases were searched for this review, including PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Search terms included psychosis and COVID-19, schizophrenia and COVID-19, and severe mental illness and COVID-19. We included all English language papers and preprints. The final search was done on 15 July 2020. Forty-seven relevant studies were identified and included in this review. Studies were summarised into five main subcategories: potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical health outcomes of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, impact on mental health outcomes, review of case reports and case series to date, treatment recommendation guidelines and risk of increased prevalence of psychosis. Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This patient population has a number of risk factors, including psychosocial adversities and illness related factors. Continuous monitoring and long-term studies of the impact of the pandemic on this patient population are required.","Zhand, Joober","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.157","20210112","COVID-19; psychosis; schizophrenia; serious mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9368,""
"Fear at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: validation of the Arabic version of the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire among Saudi-based respondents","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented stress and fear throughout the world. To evaluate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Saudi public, and to examine the performance of the Arabic version of the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) scale. We conducted an online questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey of a sample of the Saudi public. The study included 347 participants, who reported significantly higher levels of distress, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and somatisation compared with a normative sample. Females scored higher in terms of somatisation, depression and anxiety symptoms, and distress. Obtaining COVID-19 information from friends and relatives was associated with higher levels of somatisation, depression and anxiety symptoms, and distress. Cronbach's alpha was 0.93 for the distress scale, 0.88 for the depression scale, 0.88 for the anxiety scale and 0.86 for the somatisation scale. Levels of psychological distress were high among the Saudi public during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found high reliability for the Arabic version of the 4DSQ scale. However, three items did not conform to the four-factor structure, namely, item 1: 'During the past week, did you suffer from dizziness or feeling light-headed?', item 20: 'During the past week, did you suffer from disturbed sleep?' and item 46: 'During the past week did you ever think I wish I was dead?'.","Aljemaiah, Osman, Alharbi, Alshehri, Aldggag, Aljoudi, Abdulsomad, Abdulghani, Alotaibi","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.166","20210112","4DSQ test; Arabic; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9369,""
"Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of adult patients with Covid-19 infection in a primary care setting (LIBERTY): A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of adult patients with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 infection in a primary open-care setting, as compared to placebo. The study hypothesis is that treatment with HCQ will reduce the risk of hospitalization because of Covid-19 infection, and the sample size estimate of the study is based on the need to test this hypothesis. The secondary objectives of the study are: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HCQ in the treatment of adult patients with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 infection in a primary open-care setting, as compared to placebo; to collect experience of the use of HCQ in the treatment of Covid-19 infection in outpatients, in order to be able to identify patient characteristics that predict specific treatment responses (favourable or unfavourable); this objective will also be addressed by post-hoc subgroup analysis of the study results and by meta-analysis of pooled patient data from other clinical trials of HCQ in outpatients; and to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 infection and its treatment on the mental health and well-being of the study participants. In addition, if the data allow, the study has the following exploratory objectives: to evaluate the extent and duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding by PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples in study subjects treated with HCQ, as compared to placebo; to evaluate the extent and time course of SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific antibody responses in serum of study subjects treated with HCQ, as compared to placebo; to evaluate other possible biomarker changes in blood in study subjects treated with HCQ, as compared to placebo; to explore the possible effects of genetic variation in drug metabolizing enzymes on HCQ-related outcomes in the study population; to explore the associations of HCQ-related outcome variables with other patient characteristics, e.g. HLA haplotypes, HCQ concentrations, demographic variables, disease history and concomitant medications. This is a phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group treatment trial comparing HCQ with placebo in outpatients with Covid-19 infection. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment arms. Main inclusion criteria: 1. Males and females &gt;40 years of age, or 18-40 years of age with one or both of the following: i. diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2); ii. BMI &gt; 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 2. Valid independent informed consent obtained; 3. Symptoms typical of Covid-19 infection, according to criteria specified in the study protocol. The onset of symptoms must be within 5 days of enrolment; 4. Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Main exclusion criteria: 1. Suspected severe or moderately severe pneumonia, presenting with any of the following: respiratory rate &gt; 26 breaths/min; significant respiratory distress; or SpO<sub>2</sub> Ã¢â€°Â¤94% on room air; 2. Requiring treatment in the hospital, according to the treating physician's judgement; 3. Any contraindication to treatment with HCQ; 4. Pregnancy or lactation. The trial will be conducted at seven study sites in a primary public health care setting in the region of Satakunta, Finland. Participants will be randomized to receive either HCQ capsules at 300 mg twice a day for one day and then 200 mg twice a day for 6 days, or placebo capsules for 7 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the number of hospitalizations due to Covid-19 infection within four weeks of entry into the study. The secondary endpoints of the study include the following: duration and severity of Covid-19-related symptoms, as reported by daily self-assessments; number of Intensive Care Unit treatment episodes due to Covid-19 infection within four weeks of entry into the study; number of deaths due to Covid-19 infection within four weeks of entry into the study; number of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs); all-cause hospitalizations and mortality within six months of entry into the study; and self-assessed symptoms of anxiety, as assessed with repeated administration of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). The exploratory endpoints of the study include the following: extent and duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding and virus-specific antibody responses in serum; and possible other blood biomarker changes. Eligible study participants are randomly allocated into two treatment arms (1:1 ratio). The randomization list has been generated using ViedocÃ¢â€žÂ¢ (Viedoc Technologies AB, Uppsala, Sweden) that is used as an electronic data capture system for this study. The participants and all study personnel remain blinded to the treatment allocation by having both IMPs packed in identical containers. Masking of the treatments was performed by re-formulation of the IMPs so that the HCQ capsules and the placebo capsules have identical appearance. 600 participants are to be randomised with 300 in each arm.

"Marine Waste-Sources, Fate, Risks, Challenges and Research Needs","The article presents a comprehensive and cross-cutting review of key marine waste issues, taking into account: sources, fate, risks, transport pathways, threats, legislation, current challenges, and knowledge gaps. The growing amount of both human-created waste in seas and oceans and waste reaching marine ecosystems from land is one of today's challenges for the global economy and the European Union. It is predicted that if no decisive steps are taken to limit the amount of this type of waste, there may be more plastic waste than fish in the oceans after 2050. The influence of microplastics and nanoplastics on living organisms remains undiagnosed. Within the international and EU law, solutions are being developed to properly manage waste on board ships and to reduce the impact of processes related to the recycling of the vessels on the environment. Currently, over 80% of ships are dismantled in the countries of South Asia, in conditions that threaten the environment and the safety of workers. After World War 2, large quantities of chemical weapons were deposited in the seas. Steel containers with dangerous substances residing in the sea for over 70 years have begun leaking, thus polluting water. For many years, radioactive waste had also been dumped into marine ecosystems, although since 1993 there has been a total ban on such disposal of radionuclides. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marine waste generation has also been presented as a significant factor influencing marine waste generation and management.","DÃ„â€¦browska, Sobota, Ã…Å¡wiÃ„â€¦der, Borowski, Moryl, Stodolak, Kucharczak, ZiÃ„â„¢ba, Kazak","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020433","20210112","MARPOL; SARS-CoV-2; chemical weapon; marine ecosystems; marine transport; microplastics; nanoplastics; radioactive waste; ship recycling; sustainable waste management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9371,""
"Mental health impact of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on Spanish healthcare workers: A large cross-sectional survey","Healthcare workers are vulnerable to adverse mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors during the first wave of the pandemic among healthcare professionals in Spain. All workers in 18 healthcare institutions (6 AACC) in Spain were invited to web-based surveys assessing individual characteristics, COVID-19 infection status and exposure, and mental health status (May 5 - September 7, 2020). We report: probable current mental disorders (Major Depressive Disorder-MDD- [PHQ-8Ã¢â€°Â¥10], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD- [GAD-7Ã¢â€°Â¥10], Panic attacks, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder -PTSD- [PCL-5Ã¢â€°Â¥7]; and Substance Use Disorder -SUD-[CAGE-AIDÃ¢â€°Â¥2]. Severe disability assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale was used to identify probable &quot;disabling&quot; current mental disorders. 9,138 healthcare workers participated. Prevalence of screen-positive disorder: 28.1% MDD; 22.5% GAD, 24.0% Panic; 22.2% PTSD; and 6.2% SUD. Overall 45.7% presented any current and 14.5% any disabling current mental disorder. Workers with pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders had almost twice the prevalence than those without. Adjusting for all other variables, odds of any disabling mental disorder were: prior lifetime disorders (TUS: OR=5.74; 95%CI 2.53-13.03; Mood: OR=3.23; 95%CI:2.27-4.60; Anxiety: OR=3.03; 95%CI:2.53-3.62); age category 18-29 years (OR=1.36; 95%CI:1.02-1.82), caring &quot;all of the time&quot; for COVID-19 patients (OR=5.19; 95%CI: 3.61-7.46), female gender (OR=1.58; 95%CI: 1.27-1.96) and having being in quarantine or isolated (OR= 1.60; 95CI:1.31-1.95). One in seven Spanish healthcare workers screened positive for a disabling mental disorder during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Workers reporting pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders, those frequently exposed to COVID-19 patients, infected or quarantined/isolated, female workers, and auxiliary nurses should be considered groups in need of mental health monitoring and support.","Alonso, Vilagut, Mortier, Ferrer, Alayo, AragÃƒÂ³n-PeÃƒÂ±a, AragonÃƒÂ¨s, Campos, Cura-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Emparanza, Espuga, Forjaz, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Pinto, Haro, LÃƒÂ³pez-FresneÃƒÂ±a, SalÃƒÂ¡zar, Molina, OrtÃƒÂ­-Lucas, Parellada, Pelayo-TerÃƒÂ¡n, PÃƒÂ©rez-Zapata, Pijoan, Plana, Puig, Rius, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-BlÃƒÂ¡zquez, Sanz, Serra, Kessler, Bruffaerts, Vieta, PÃƒÂ©rez-SolÃƒÂ ","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.12.001","20210112","Adverse Mental Health; COVID-19 pandemic; Disability; Discapacidad; Healthcare Workers; Mental Disorders; Necesidad de atenciÃƒÂ³n; Need for Care; Pandemia de COVID-19; Salud mental adversa; Trabajadores de la salud; Trastornos mentales","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9372,""

"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdowns: A Review and Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Studies and Natural Experiments","Lockdowns to control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have had profound effects on everyday life worldwide, but their effect on mental health remains unclear because available meta-analyses and reviews rely mostly on cross-sectional studies. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies and natural experiments investigating the relationship between COVID-19 lockdowns and mental health. A total of 25 studies involving 72,004 participants and 58 effect sizes were analyzed. Using a random effects model, we found that lockdowns had small effects on mental health symptoms, g = 0.17, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.06, 0.24], p = .001, but the effects on positive psychological functioning, g = -0.12, SE = 0.11, 95% CI [-0.33, 0.09], p = .27, were not significant. Multivariate analysis of effect sizes revealed significant and relatively small effect sizes for anxiety and depression, while those for social support, loneliness, general distress, negative affect, and suicide risk were not significant. Results indicated substantial heterogeneity among studies, but meta-regression analyses found no significant moderation effects for mean age, gender, continent, COVID-19 death rate, days of lockdown, publication status or study design. The psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdowns is small in magnitude and highly heterogeneous, suggesting that lockdowns do not have uniformly detrimental effects on mental health and that most people are psychologically resilient to their effects.","Gabriele Prati et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46168-5AA-9DE","20210113","PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; natural experiment; anxiety; longitudinal; mental health; meta-analysis; covid-19; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-13","",9374,""
