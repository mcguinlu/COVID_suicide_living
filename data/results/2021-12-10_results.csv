"Stranded abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic: examining the psychological and financial impact of border restrictions","Objective: With the easing of COVID-19-related international travel restrictions in late 2021 it is time to consider the direct and indirect social, emotional, and financial impacts that these border closures have had. The study aims to evaluate the psychological and financial distress reported by people stranded abroad due to international travel restrictions introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Between July and September 2021, we implemented a cross-sectional online survey targeting individuals stranded abroad due to international travel restrictions. The survey collected data about COVID-19 travel restriction-related travel impacts; personal stress, anxiety, and depression (using the validated DASS-21tool); as well as impacts on housing and financial security; and demographic data. Findings: We had 1054 participants complete the survey; most were trying to return to the Oceania region (75.4%), with 45% stranded in Europe. Overall, 64.2% reported financial distress while stranded abroad. 64.4% ([x] =9.43, SD=5.81) reported either a moderate or severe (based on the DASS-21 classification) level of depression, 41.7% for anxiety ([x] =5.46, SD=4.74), and 58.1% for stress ([x] =10.64, SD=5.26). Statistically significant factors associated with moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress were financial stress, an employment change, being <30yrs, having a high perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 abroad and being stranded for >2 months. Conclusion: The study is among the first to explore the psychological and financial distress-related impacts associated with being stranded abroad due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. It highlights a range of unintended consequences that arise from pandemic-related travel restriction, identifies the health and social needs for a particularly vulnerable population, and provides clues as to the types of support that may be adopted to best support them. This research will assist policymakers in identifying support packages for people stranded abroad due to global disaster.","Pippa McDermid; Adam Craig; Meru Sheel; Katrina Blazek; Siobhan Talty; Holly Seale","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.08.21267218","20211209","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-10","",23435,""

They are expected to promote health protocol against COVID-19 in their service area. This study aims to discover health workers ability and attitude in promoting health protocol against COVID-19 among the public in their service area. This study employed quantitative research method using cross-sectional design. Primary data was gathered through questionnaire administered via google form to 126 active health workers who satisfied the inclusion criteria which included having been serving for at least 6 consecutive months in Soreang Sub-district and being able to fill in google form questionnaire. The results of the study showed that most health workers knowledge about health protocol was in sufficient and good categories. However, there were some health workers who demonstrated negative attitude towards promoting health protocol against COVID-19.

"Effects of music therapy as a distance therapeutic technique for cancer patients Pilot test with a relaxing music model","Little is known about the effects of listening to recorded therapeutic music on the mood of cancer patients. A pilot music therapy study is presented here, in which a relaxing music (RM) protocol was applied to heterogeneous oncology patients in the follow-up care phase. The individual intervention protocol was applied in a Telehealth mode, and its therapeutic efficacy was verified during the health emergency caused by the Covid-19 crisis. The main objective here is to complete the definitive design of the protocol so that it can be used to treat these patients or those with other clinical diagnoses. The results show an improvement in patients' capacity for relaxation and a greater degree of relief from negative emotional responses. The cognitive responses suggest that listening to music facilitates improvements in emotions and positive ideations. It is suggested that the use of the RM protocol in cancer patients may have positive effects by relieving negative moods, and that the protocol may protect against depression and / or anxiety. In this article, the protocol is reviewed and proposals for improvement are offered. It is suggested that future research should take a broader and deeper look at the variables of the patients' context and environment, as well as at aspects of the therapeutic relationship between the music therapist, the clinical psychologist and the patient.","Casellas, M.; Segura, J.; Andres, C.; Berbel, P.; Lopez, Y.","https://doi.org/10.51698/aloma.2021.39.2.21-34","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Aloma-Revista De Psicologia Ciencies De L Educacio I De L Esport; 39(2):21-34, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-10","",23480,""

Three-hundred and six subjects from the general population were included during 2020 after having signed informed consent. Barlett and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) sphericity tests were applied. Reliability was calculated with Cronbach's alpha, and external validity, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Pearson's correlation coefficient for retest. Results: The general population sample included 306 participants;64.4% were women (n = 197), mean age was 32 years (18-68). We obtained a KMO = 0.848, internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha = 0.870 (95% CI: 0.848-0.891), a rho coefficient of 0.508 (p &lt;= 0.001) and external validity of 0.151 (p = 0.008). Confirmatory analysis showed: (sic)2 = 22.802 (df = 13) with CMIN-DF = 1.900 (p &lt;= 0.001), GFI = 0.972, CFI = 0.901, RMSEA = 0.062 (90% CI: 0.019-0.100) and TLI = 0.827. Conclusions: According to our findings, the scale shows adequate psychometric properties: reliability, internal consistency, correlation of subsequent measurements and convergence validity, for initial screening of Mexican general population.","Soto-Briseno, A.

"Distanced behind the mask: The use of non-verbal communication when counselling the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic","The stressors caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have influenced both the physical and the mental health of the elderly, increasing their vulnerability. Counselling by the mental healthcare nurse is a critical protective factor in mitigating the mental health effects of COVID-19. However, counselling is unintentionally interrupted by the effects of the mask as a barrier to non-verbal communication. This commentary aims at conscientisation of mental healthcare nursing practice interruptions to non-verbal communication, brought upon by the pandemic. Practice recommendations focus on mask wearing becoming less of a stressor to offset the challenges experienced by both the elderly and the mental healthcare nurses. Contribution: The authors conclude that a need exists to revisit the fundamentals of counselling, and show initiative to addressing the practice challenges created by the wearing of masks yet simultaneously contribute to #flatten_the_mental_illness_curve.","Jarvis, M.

"The CRISIS Survey: The Catholic Church's Work with Immigrants in a Period of Crisis","Over the last five years, the Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS) has conducted four surveys of Catholic immigrant-serving institutions, programs, and ministries in the United States. These surveys identify the multi-faceted needs of immigrants and refugees, and examine the successes and challenges of Catholic institutions in responding to them. CMS administered its most recent survey, the Catholic Refugee and Immigrant Service Integration Survey (the â€œCRISIS Surveyâ€) from December 14, 2020 through February 5, 2021. This survey explored the work of Catholic institutions during the Trump administration and the COVID-19 pandemic.The CRISIS Survey documents the reach, diversity, and productivity of Catholic institutions that worked with immigrants and refugees during a pandemic that particularly devastated their communities and an administration whose policies and rhetoric made their work far more difficult. At a time of rampant â€œCatholic declineâ€ narratives, the survey also documents the reach, vitality, and relevance of Catholic immigrant-serving institutions. It identifies the obstacles encountered by immigrants in accessing Catholic programs and ministries â€” both organizational (funding, staffing, and siting) and exogenous (federal policies, the pandemic, and community opposition). It underscores the threat posed by US immigration policies to immigrants and to the work of Catholic institutions.Survey respondents reported that they offered new services during this period, such as: Financial assistance for families, particularly those at risk of losing housing or utilities. COVID-19 testing, education, contact tracing, and quarantine services. Mental health services. Grief support and assistance with funeral expenses. Delivery of food and sanitation supplies for infected and other homebound persons. Voter registration and Census promotion activities. Virtually all respondents provided services remotely during the pandemic. Many reported on difficulties faced by immigrants in accessing their services, due to poor internet connections, limited computer access, and lack of communications technology and training. Respondents identified several factors that negatively affected immigrantsâ€™ access to their services pre-pandemic. As in previous CMS surveys, these factors included lack of immigration status, negative community attitudes toward immigrants, fear of apprehension (particularly after traffic stops) and deportation, public transportation deficiencies, stigma over receipt of mental health services, and identification requirements to access public benefits. Respondents also reported on obstacles in working with immigrants during the pandemic. These included the pandemic itself, limited funding, demand that outpaced resources, government restrictions on relief and benefit eligibility, and (particularly for students) living arrangements, work, and family caretaking responsibilities. Respondents overwhelmingly believed that immigration enforcement, tied to fear of deportation, very negatively or somewhat negatively affected participation in their services and programs. In Catholic terms, they reported that nativist immigration policies, rhetoric, and media sources interfered with their practice of discipleship. One respondent stated, â€œFear of ICE and round-ups, locally in our state and nationally, along with negative immigration rhetoric from the out-going president have made our clients very fearful to access services they rightly qualify for.â€ A healthcare provider reported that immigrants were â€œavoiding or delaying seeking treatment for COVID-19 for fear of apprehension and/or deportation.â€ Many said that enforcement partnerships between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and states and localities made immigrants fearful of reporting crimes or accessing government facilities. One said that potential sponsors feared coming forward to reunify with children. Respondents also cited as problems delays in family eunification, barriers to asylum-seekers entering the United States, decreased refugee admissions, and the Trump administration's rule on the public charge ground of inadmissibility. The report recommends that Catholic institutions take stock of the creative new programs, skills and capacities that they have developed during the pandemic and build on them. It also recommends that scholars and researchers prioritize independent, person-centered research that critically analyzes the work of Catholic immigrant-serving institutions. Such research would ask whether these institutions, in the words of Pope Francis, are putting â€œthe person at the center, in his or her many aspectsâ€ and honoring the â€œfundamental equalityâ€ of every person. It would draw on the perspectives of immigrants served by Catholic institutions to examine the degree to which these institutions advance the rights, participation, and wellbeing of immigrants and their families in US society. Finally, it would analyze how Catholic institutions work with each other â€” within Arch/dioceses, regionally, nationally, and across these realms â€” in response to the cross-cutting needs of immigrants. The report recommends that Catholic institutions develop programmatic plans to ensure that immigrants can return to or can continue to access their programs and ministries as the pandemic subsides. These plans will need to combine communication strategies, financial support, and services such as transportation and childcare. In addition, Catholic institutions should make it a high priority to ensure that immigrants can access the infrastructure, platforms, and training that will allow them to access virtual services. They should also develop strategies to engage Catholics who do not understand, who ignore, or who work at cross-purposes to Catholic teaching and policy positions in this area. Finally, they should redouble their work with the administration and Congress to reform US immigration laws, and with states and localities to promote welcoming and inclusive communities.","Kerwin, Donald, Alulema, Daniela","https://doi.org/10.1177/23315024211035726","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal on Migration and Human Security; 9(4):271-296, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-10","",23483,""
"Severe Anxiety Post-COVID-19 Infection","COVID-19 infection is linked to increased risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as psychosis and suicidal ideation/behavior. After further review of the literature, there is not a large body of data on anxiety following COVID-19 infection. Most literature found is related to fear/anxiety of contracting and dying from COVID-19. We illustrate a case of a 27-year-old male with no previous psychiatric treatment history or symptomology, who developed severe anxiety with intrusive thoughts of self-harm via firearm after COVID-19 infection. Given the severe nature of the anxiety and intrusive thoughts, the patient feared for his safety and sought acute inpatient admission. The patient was effectively treated with group therapy and psychotropic medications and was able to be discharged in a timely manner with outpatient psychiatric follow-up. Much is still unknown of COVID-19. With this case report, we discuss a potential relationship between anxiety and COVID-19 infection.

"Selective exposure to COVID-19 vaccination information: the influence of prior attitude, perceived threat level and information limit","Purpose The massive amount of available information and functionality of the Internet makes selective information seeking effortless. This paper aims to understand the selective exposure to information during a health decision-making task. Design/methodology/approach This study conducted an experiment with a sample of 36 students to examine the influence of prior attitude, perceived threat level and information limit on users' selective exposure to and recall of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination information. Participants were assigned to two conditions with or without an upper limit of the number of articles to be examined, and this study collected the number of articles read, the number of articles included in the report and recall score of the articles after one day of the experiment. Findings This study found that (1) participants with a negative attitude were more inclined to view attitude-consistent information and recalled attitude-consistent information more accurately, while participants with a positive attitude viewed more balanced information;(2) participants perceiving higher health threat level recalled attitude-consistent information more accurately;and (3) an upper limit on the number of articles to be viewed does not have any impact on selective exposure. Research limitations/implications The findings of this paper pinpoint the disparity of influence of positive and negative attitudes on selective exposure to and selective recall of health information, which was not previously recognized. Practical implications Vaccination campaigns should focus on reaching people with negative attitudes who are more prone to selective exposure to encourage them to seek more balanced information. Originality/value This is the first paper to explore selective exposure to COVID-19 vaccination information. This study found that people with a negative attitude and a higher level of perceived health threat are more prone to selective exposure, which was not found in previous research.","Li, K.; Li, Y.
