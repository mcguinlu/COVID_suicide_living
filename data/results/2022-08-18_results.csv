"Risk Factors Associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 in an EHR Cohort: A National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Analysis as part of the NIH RECOVER program","Background: More than one-third of individuals experience post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC, which includes long-COVID). Objective: To identify risk factors associated with PASC/long-COVID. Design: Retrospective case-control study. Setting: 31 health systems in the United States from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Patients: 8,325 individuals with PASC (defined by the presence of the International Classification of Diseases, version 10 code U09.9 or a long-COVID clinic visit) matched to 41,625 controls within the same health system. Measurements: Risk factors included demographics, comorbidities, and treatment and acute characteristics related to COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost were used to determine the associations between risk factors and PASC. Results: Among 8,325 individuals with PASC, the majority were >50 years of age (56.6%), female (62.8%), and non-Hispanic White (68.6%). In logistic regression, middle-age categories (40 to 69 years; OR ranging from 2.32 to 2.58), female sex (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.33-1.48), hospitalization associated with COVID-19 (OR 3.8, 95% CI 3.05-4.73), long (8-30 days, OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.31-2.17) or extended hospital stay (30+ days, OR 3.38, 95% CI 2.45-4.67), receipt of mechanical ventilation (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.18-1.74), and several comorbidities including depression (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.40-1.60), chronic lung disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.53-1.74), and obesity (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.16-1.3) were associated with increased likelihood of PASC diagnosis or care at a long-COVID clinic. Characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of PASC diagnosis or care at a long-COVID clinic included younger age (18 to 29 years), male sex, non-Hispanic Black race, and comorbidities such as substance abuse, cardiomyopathy, psychosis, and dementia. More doctors per capita in the county of residence was associated with an increased likelihood of PASC diagnosis or care at a long-COVID clinic. Our findings were consistent in sensitivity analyses using a variety of analytic techniques and approaches to select controls. Conclusions: This national study identified important risk factors for PASC such as middle age, severe COVID-19 disease, and specific comorbidities. Further clinical and epidemiological research is needed to better understand underlying mechanisms and the potential role of vaccines and therapeutics in altering PASC course.","Elaine L Hill; Hemalkumar B Mehta; Suchetha Sharma; Klint Mane; Catherine Xie; Emily Cathey; Johanna Loomba; Seth Russell; Heidi Spratt; Peter E DeWitt; Nariman Ammar; Charisse Madlock-Brown; Donald Brown; Julie A McMurry; Christopher G Chute; Melissa A Haendel; Richard Moffitt; Emily R Pfaff; Tellen D Bennett; - The N3C Consortium; - The RECOVER Consortium","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.08.15.22278603","20220817","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","",36177,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the socioeconomic inequality of health behavior among Japanese adolescents: a two-year-repeated cross-sectional survey","Background: Although disparities in socioeconomic status in health behaviors have been highlighted globally, they are not well understood in Japanese adolescents. The purpose of this study was to clarify the changes in socioeconomic disparities in adolescents' fundamental health behaviors, such as physical activity, screen time (ST), sleep, breakfast intake, and bowel movement before and during COVID-19. Methods: This was a repeated cross-sectional study which used data from the 2019 and 2021 National Sports-Life Survey of Children and Young in Japan. Data of 766 and 725 participants in 2019 and 2021, respectively, were analyzed. Favorable health behaviors were defined as daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) of at least 60 minutes, ST of less than 2 hours, sleep of 8 to 10 hours, daily breakfast intake, and bowel movement frequency of at least once in every 3 days. We calculated the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) in each health behavior for equivalent household income levels for assessing absolute and relative economic inequalities. Results: Compliance with MVPA and ST recommendation significantly declined from 20.1% and 23.0% in 2019 to 11.7% and 14.9% in 2021, respectively. The SII and RII increased in MVPA for income levels, but decreased in daily breakfast in 2019 to 2021. Although the widening and narrowing of the disparity was inconclusive for ST, it exacerbated for the higher income groups. Conclusions: Our study revealed widening of economic disparities in the achievement of recommended MVPA and narrowing of it in breakfast intake among adolescents before and during COVID-19.","Akira Kyan; Minoru Takakura","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.08.11.22278499","20220817","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","",36178,""
"Public views of and reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic in England: a qualitative study with diverse ethnicities","To explore public reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic across diverse ethnic groups. Remote qualitative interviews and focus groups in English or Punjabi. Data were transcribed and analysed through inductive thematic analysis. England and Wales, June to October 2020. 100 participants from 19 diverse 'self-identified' ethnic groups. Dismay, frustration and altruism were reported across all ethnic groups during the first 6-9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dismay was caused by participants' reported individual, family and community risks, and loss of support networks. Frustration was caused by reported lack of recognition of the efforts of ethnic minority groups (EMGs), inaction by government to address COVID-19 and inequalities, rule breaking by government advisors, changing government rules around: border controls, personal protective equipment, social distancing, eating out, and perceived poor communication around COVID-19 and the Public Health England COVID-19 disparities report (leading to reported increased racism and social isolation). Altruism was felt by all, in the resilience of National Health Service (NHS) staff and their communities and families pulling together. Data, participants' suggested actions and the behaviour change wheel informed suggested interventions and policies to help control COVID-19. To improve trust and compliance future reports or guidance should clearly explain any stated differences in health outcomes by ethnicity or other risk group, including specific messages for these groups and concrete actions to minimise any risks. Messaging should reflect the uncertainty in data or advice and how guidance may change going forward as new evidence becomes available. A contingency plan is needed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 across all communities including EMGs, the vulnerable and socially disadvantaged individuals, in preparation for any rise in cases and for future pandemics. Equality across ethnicities for healthcare is essential, and the NHS and local communities will need to be supported to attain this.","McNulty, Sides, Thomas, Kamal, Syeda, Kaissi, Lecky, Patel, Campos-Matos, Shukla, Brown, Pareek, Sollars, Nellums, Greenway, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061027","20220817","COVID-19; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","",36179,""
"Universal healthcare reform for community treatment of eating disorders in Australia: report of the first 2 years of operation","The Australian Government's landmark 2019 implementation of dedicated Medicare items for people with eating disorders was the first of its kind for a mental illness. We investigate the first 24 months of uptake of these items across regions, settings and healthcare disciplines, including intermediate changes to the program prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a descriptive study using item data extracted from the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule database for November 2019 to October 2021. Data were cross-tabulated by discipline, setting, consultation type and region. During the first 24 months of implementation of the scheme, 29 881 Eating Disorder Treatment and Management Plans (or care plans) were initiated, mostly by general practitioners with mental health training. More than 265 000 psychotherapy and dietetic sessions were provided, 29.1% of which took place using telehealth during the pandemic. Although the program offers up to 40 rebated psychological sessions, fewer than 6.5% of individuals completed their 20-session review under the scheme. Uptake of the Medicare item for eating disorders was swift, and the item was used broadly throughout the pandemic. Although feedback from those with lived experience and experts has been overwhelmingly positive, data show that strategic adjustment may be needed and further evaluation conducted to ensure that the reform achieves the best outcomes for patients and families, and its policy intent.

"Mental Health of Guatemalan Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Baseline Findings From the HEROES Cohort Study","<b>Objectives.</b> To assess the baseline prevalence of mental health conditions and associated exposures in a cohort of health care workers (HCWs) in Guatemala. <b>Methods.</b> We analyzed baseline information from the 2020 Web-based COVID-19 Health Care Workers Study (HEROES)-Guatemala. Outcomes included mental distress and depressive symptoms. Exposures included COVID-19 experiences, sociodemographic characteristics, and job characteristics. We used crude and adjusted Poisson regression models in our analyses. <b>Results.</b> Of the 1801 HCWs who accepted to participate, 1522 (84.5%) completed the questionnaire; 1014 (66.8%) were women. Among the participants, 59.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°56.6, 61.5) screened positive for mental distress and 23% (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.9, 25.2) for moderate to severe depressive symptoms. COVID-19 experiences, sociodemographic characteristics, and job characteristics were associated with the study outcomes.

"Trends in Engagement With Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Among Medicaid Beneficiaries During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Disruptions in care during the COVID-19 pandemic may have decreased access to care for patients with opioid use disorder. To examine trends in opioid use disorder treatment including buprenorphine possession, urine drug testing, and opioid treatment program services during the COVID-19 public health emergency. This cohort study included 6453 parent and childless adult Medicaid beneficiaries, aged 18 to 64 years, with opioid use disorder and continuous enrollment from December 1, 2018, to September 30, 2020, in Wisconsin. Logistic regression compared differences in study outcomes before, early, and later in the COVID-19 public health emergency. Analyses were conducted from January 2021 to October 2021. Early (March 16, 2020, to May 15, 2020) and later (May 16, 2020, to September 30, 2020) in the public health emergency. Person-week outcomes included possession of buprenorphine, completion of outpatient urine drug testing, and receipt of opioid treatment program services. The final cohort of 6453 participants included 3986 (61.8%) childless adults; 5741 (89%) were younger than 50 years, 3435 (53.2%) were women, 5036 (78.0%) White, and 22.0% were racial and ethnic minority groups (American Indian, 269 [4.2%]; Asian, 26 [0.4%]; Black, 458 [7.1%]; Hispanic, 292 [4.5%]; Pacific Islander, 1 [.02%]; Multiracial, 238 [3.7%]). Overall, 2858 (44.3%), 5074 (78.6%), and 2928 (45.4%) received buprenorphine, urine drug testing, or opioid treatment program services during the study period, respectively. Probability of buprenorphine possession did not change in the early or later part of the public health emergency. Probability of urine drug testing initially decreased (marginal effect [ME], -0.04; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.03; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and then partially recovered in the later public health emergency (ME, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.03 to -0.02; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Probability of opioid treatment program services followed a similar pattern, with an early decrease (ME, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.05 to -0.04; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) followed by partial recovery (ME, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.03 to -0.02; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In a sample of continuously enrolled adult Medicaid beneficiaries, the COVID-19 public health emergency was not associated with decreased probability of buprenorphine possession, but was associated with decreased probability of urine drug testing and opioid treatment program services. These findings suggest patients in office-based settings retained access to buprenorphine despite decreased on-site services like urine drug tests, whereas patients at opioid treatment programs experienced greater disruption in care. Given the importance of medications for opioid use disorder in preventing overdose, policy makers should consider permanent policy changes based on lessons learned from the public health emergency to enable ongoing enhanced access to these medications.","Tilhou, Dague, Saloner, Beemon, Burns","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2022.0093","20220817","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","",36182,""
"Barriers and enablers to implementation of the therapeutic engagement questionnaire in acute mental health inpatient wards in England: A qualitative study","A strong association exists between the quality of nurse-service user therapeutic relationship and care outcomes on acute mental health inpatient wards. Despite evidence that service users desire improved therapeutic engagement, and registered mental health nurses recognize the benefits of therapeutic relationships, such interactions remain sub-optimal. There is a dearth of evidence on factors influencing implementation of interventions to support and encourage therapeutic engagement. This study aimed to understand the barriers and enablers to implementation of the Therapeutic Engagement Questionnaire (TEQ), across fifteen acute inpatient wards in seven English mental health organizations. Qualitative methods were used in which data were collected from ethnographic field notes and documentary review, coded, and analysed using thematic analysis. Theoretical framing supported data analysis and interpretation. Reporting adheres to the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research. The TEQ as an evidence-based intervention co-produced with service users and nurses was valued and welcomed by many nurse directors, senior clinicians, and ward managers. However, a range of practical and perceptual factors impeded implementation. Furthermore, many existing contextual challenges for intervention implementation in acute inpatient wards were magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Suitable facilitation to address these barriers can help support implementation of the TEQ, with some transferability to implementation of other interventions in these settings. Our study suggests several facilitation methods, brought together in a conceptual model, including encouragement of reflective, facilitative discussion meetings among stakeholders and researchers, effort put into winning nurse 'buy-in' and identifying and supporting ward-level agents of change.","Taylor, Galloway, Irons, Mess, Pemberton, Worton, Chambers","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13047","20220817","COVID-19; inpatient care; mental health nursing; therapeutic engagement; therapeutic intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","",36183,""
"The mental health of Brazilian students during the Covid-19 pandemic: the role of gratitude, optimism, and hope in reducing anxiety","To investigate the role of optimism, hope, and gratitude as psychosocial factors for healthy development, especially with regard to anxiety in college students in the context of COVID-19. This is a quantitative and descriptive cross-sectional research. The sociodemographic questionnaire and the Brazilian versions of the anxiety scale B-GRAT, LOT-R, Hope Index, and BIG-FIVE were applied. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney correlation, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman, and hierarchical linear regression. A total of 297 students were assessed. In the hierarchical linear analysis, the relationship of gratitude with anxiety becomes positive, contradicting the negative association of these variables in Spearman's correlation. The contradictions may result from the suppression effect. When gratitude was added to the model, these three variables together accounted for 38% of the variance in anxiety. This indicates that optimism, hope, and gratitude together are significant predictors, but optimism alone accounts for a large part of the variance for decreased anxiety. The data confirm that family and religiosity are protective factors against mental illness, specifically non-adaptive anxiety. Furthermore, developing optimism as a protective factor makes it possible to experience less anxiety while hope has the potential to provide the individual with multiple pathways to healthy development. This study has highlighted that gratitude plays a dual role in these relationships as it has the potential to be associated with anxious feelings with likely negative outcomes while at the same time it can drive positive psychosocial factors of optimism and hope in decreasing anxiety.","Almansa, Trivilin, Hutz, Almeida, Vazquez, Freitas","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2022-0496","20220817","Anxiety; college students; pandemic; positive psychology; protective factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","",36184,""
"Longitudinal changes in wellbeing amongst breastfeeding women in Australia and New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted new mothers' wellbeing and breastfeeding experience. Women have experienced changes in birth and postnatal care and restricted access to their support network. It is unclear how these impacts may have changed over time with shifting rates of infection and policies restricting movement and access to services in Australia and New Zealand. This study investigated the longitudinal effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on breastfeeding and maternal wellbeing in Australia and New Zealand. Mothers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°246) completed an online survey every 4Ã‚Â weeks for 6Ã‚Â months that examined feeding methods, maternal mental wellbeing, worries, challenges, and positive experiences during the pandemic. Mothers maintained high full breastfeeding rates at 4Ã‚Â months (81%) which decreased to 37% at 6Ã‚Â months. Perceived low milk supply contributed to the earlier cessation of full breastfeeding. Poor infant sleep was associated with stress, perinatal anxiety, mental wellbeing, and breastfeeding status. Although mothers initially reported that lockdowns helped with family bonding and less pressure, prolonged lockdowns appeared to have adverse effects on access to social networks and extended family support. Ã‚ Ã‚Â Conclusion: The results highlight the changing dynamic of the pandemic and the need for adaptable perinatal services which allow mothers access to in-person services and their support network even in lockdowns. Similarly, access to continuous education and clinical care remains critical for women experiencing concerns about their milk supply, infant sleep, and their own wellbeing. What is Known: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown restrictions have significantly affected perinatal mental health, disrupted maternal services, and subsequent breastfeeding. What is New: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â In Australia and New Zealand, breastfeeding women experienced challenges to their mental wellbeing, sleep, and breastfeeding, which was likely exacerbated over time by the pandemic. Lockdowns, while initially beneficial for some families, became detrimental to maternal support and wellbeing.","Sakalidis, Rea, Perrella, McEachran, Collis, Miraudo, Prosser, Gibson, Silva, Geddes","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-022-04580-y","20220817","Anxiety; Breastfeeding; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","",36185,""
"Covid-19 phobia in prehospital emergency medical services workers in Turkey","The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) outbreak has its social, economic, and political effects on wider society, as well as physical and mental health effects on individuals.

"NUTRITIONAL HABITS, COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTHY DIET AND INSULIN THERAPY, DEPRESSION AND FAMILY FUNCTIONALITY IN CHILDREN WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PERIOD","The relationship between life changes and glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes during the pandemic period was examined. We aimed to investigate the effect of the pandemic period on 66 children (aged 5-18 years) with type 1 diabetes using scales evaluating family functionality, nutritional habits, adherence to treatment and depression status. It is a cross-sectional clinical and laboratory study using certain scales for its descriptive features. Demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, laboratory investigations were evaluated. Family functionality of the patients were evaluated with Smilkstein's family APGAR scale, motivation and knowledge levels were evaluated with the 6-item Morisky medication adherence scale (MMAS-6), nutritional habits were evaluated with the Mediterranean diet quality index (KIDMED), and depression status was evaluated with the children depression inventory (CDI). The mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level increased significantly in the first year of the pandemic compared to the onset of the pandemic period (8.5% <i>vs</i>. 8.9%, p: 0.003). In the responses to these scales, children with diabetes have high family functionality (89.4%), high motivation (90.9%) and high knowledge level about adherence to treatment (97%).

"Designing a Tool to Address the Depression of Children During Online Education","Advances in communication and information technology have changed the way humans interact. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the technology for communication has caused depression and anxiety, including among children and teens. Depression among children and teens may go unrecognized and untreated, as parents and teachers may have difficulty recognizing the symptoms. COVID-19 has changed traditional learning methods, forcing children to stay home and connect through online education. Although some children may function reasonably well in less-structured environments, many children with significant depression suffer a noticeable change in social activities, loss of interest in an online school, poor online academic performance, or changes in appearance. Home quarantine has affected children's mental health, and it has become challenging for school counselors to predict depression in many children participating in online education. This study aims to design and develop a tool for predicting depression among children aged 7 to 9 years old by recording students' online classes and sending a note to the child's academic file. The idea of needing this tool arose as an output for applying the design thinking approach to the online education website during COVID-19. This inspired the authors to combine the lecture recordings and the prediction of depression into one tool.

"Shouldering the load yet again: Black women's experiences of stress during COVID-19","Black women in the United States experience considerable amounts of stress, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior studies have linked stress to adverse mental and physical outcomes for Black women and, moreover, shown that Black women are more susceptible to maladaptive coping, which compounds these risks. Research on the Superwoman Schema and Sojourner's Syndrome, for instance, shows how Black women are compelled to portray strength and resilience while suffering internally and experiencing poor health outcomes. These phenomena can be attributed to the historical expectations of Black women to be pillars of their families and sources of strength despite adversity and persistent institutional discrimination. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Black women's greater likelihood of holding ""essential worker"" roles has further increased their risk of both COVID-19 exposure and heightened stress. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated long standing structural inequities and disparities between Black women and other racial/ethnic groups. Drawing on journal entries submitted by Black women participating in the Pandemic Journaling Project (PJP), a combined online journaling platform and interdisciplinary research study, this paper illuminates the voices of Black women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy-two Black women created journal entries using the PJP platform. We analyze the stories, idioms, and feelings they recorded during a global pandemic. We identify three prominent domains of stress: work and school, caregiving, and social (dis)connectedness. In addition to exploring manifestations of stress across these domains, we, discuss some of the mental health implications of COVID-19 and explore the potential for regular journaling as a possible mode of stress management among Black women.","Kalinowski, Wurtz, Baird, Willen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100140","20220817","Black women; COVID-19; Discrimination; Health disparities; Racism; Stress; Women's health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","",36189,""
"Operational challenges in the pre-intervention phase of a mental health trial in rural India: reflections from SMART Mental Health","Availability of mental health services in low- and middle-income countries is largely concentrated in tertiary care with limited resources and scarcity of trained professionals at the primary care level. SMART Mental Health is a strategy that combines a community anti-stigma campaign with a primary health care workforce strengthening initiative, using electronic decision support with the goal of better identifying and supporting people with common mental disorders in India. We describe the challenges faced and lessons learnt during the pre-intervention phase of SMART Mental Health cluster Randomised Controlled Trial. Pre-intervention phase includes preliminary activities for setting-up the trial and research activities prior to delivery of the intervention. Field notes from project site visit, project team meetings and detailed follow-up discussions with members of the project team were used to document operational challenges and strategies adopted to overcome them. The socio-ecological model was used as the analytical framework to organise the findings. Key challenges included delays in government approvals, addressing community health worker needs, and building trust in the community. These were addressed through continuous communication, leveraging support of relevant stakeholders, and addressing concerns of community health workers and community. Issues related to use of digital platform for data collection were addressed by a dedicated technical support team. The COVID-19 pandemic and political unrest led to significant and unexpected challenges requiring important adaptations to successfully implement the project. Setting up of this trial has posed challenges at a combination of community, health system and broader socio-political levels. Successful mitigating strategies to overcome these challenges must be innovative, timely and flexibly delivered according to local context. Systematic ongoing documentation of field-level challenges and subsequent adaptations can help optimise implementation processes and support high quality trials.

"Decreased daily exercise since the COVID-19 pandemic and the deterioration of health-related quality of life in the elderly population: a population-based cross-sectional study","The current prolonging state of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), could affect many aspects of people's lives, especially the elderly population who experience a decrease in regular exercise. However, whether this decrease in regular exercise affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the elderly population, remains unclear. The current population-based cross-sectional survey aimed to identify the relationship between the decrease in regular exercise since the COVID-19 pandemic and any changes in the HRQOL in the general elderly Japanese population. This study was conducted as a part of the COVID-19 vaccination program in Habikino city in Japan, between June and July 2021 using printed questionnaires. The participants included residents of the city who were agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°65Ã‚Â years, and were being vaccinated for COVID-19 at the city's center. The EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) was assessed at two different time points (pre-pandemic and current). Data on lifestyle changes, including their regular exercise routine since the pandemic, were collected. Finally, 14,494 participants (45.3% of the city's total elderly residents) were enrolled. Among them, 4321 participants (29.8%) had experienced a decrease in regular exercise since the pandemic. These participants showed a significantly higher rate of deterioration in all the EQ-5D-5L domains than the participants who did not experience a decrease in regular exercise. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, participants with a decrease in regular exercise were significantly related to the EQ-5D-5L index deterioration compared to those with an unchanged regular exercise routine (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, adjusted odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.60) independent of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and the existence of back pain, joint pain, and/or numbness of extremities. The current survey that included 45% of the elderly people living in a city revealed that up to 30% of them had experienced a decrease in the regular exercise since the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease was significantly related to HRQOL deterioration independent of age, sex, BMI, baseline activities of daily living status, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Our data could be useful for understanding the current problem and provide a strong basis for the creation of exercise guidelines for the post-COVID-19 era.","Tamai, Terai, Takahashi, Katsuda, Shimada, Habibi, Nakamura","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-03316-9","20220816","COVID-19; Exercise; Health-related quality of life; Physical activity; Residents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","",36191,""
"Effectiveness of mindful walking intervention in nature on sleep quality and mood among university student during Covid-19: A randomised control study","The aim of this project was to conduct a randomised control study to examine whether outdoor mindful walking in nature can effectively improve university students' sleep quality, mood, and mindfulness during the lockdown of Covid-19 pandemic in the U.K. Participants were measured at T<sub>0</sub> (pre-study baseline), T<sub>1</sub> (pre-intervention), T<sub>2</sub> (post-intervention), and T<sub>3</sub> (follow-up). A total of 104 participants (femaleÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 94) who were experiencing sleep difficulties were randomly allocated to either an experimental (i.e., nature) or control (i.e., urban) walking environments. Participants in each walking condition independently undertook a daily 35-minute walk for a week (7 days). Subjective sleep quality, total mood disturbance, mindfulness, and degree of nature, and participants' perspectives and suggestions about the intervention, were collected. Findings suggest that both groups exhibited significant improvements on participant's trait mindfulness, sleep quality and mood after the intervention. However, mindful walking in nature did not bring additional mental health benefits to participants than those who walked in urban environment. Participants reflected their perspectives about the intervention, which will assist with further intervention development. Findings contribute to the evidence base for the effectiveness of outdoor mindful walking interventions on mental health. Especially these findings add new knowledge of how mindful walking outdoors reduces university students' mood disturbances and improves their sleep quality and mindfulness level during the pandemic.","Ma, Williams, Morris, Chan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.explore.2022.08.004","20220816","Covid-19; Mindful walking intervention; Nature; RCT; Sleep quality; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","",36192,""
