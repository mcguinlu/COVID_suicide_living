"Development Of The Inactivated QazCovid-In Vaccine: Protective Efficacy Of The Vaccine In Syrian Hamsters","In March 2020, the first cases of human coronavirus infection COVID-19 were registered in Kazakhstan. We isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the clinical material from the patients. Subsequently, a whole virion inactivated candidate vaccine, QazCovid-in, was developed based on this virus. To obtain the vaccine, a virus grown in Vero cell culture was used, which was inactivated with formaldehyde, purified, concentrated, sterilized by filtration, and then sorbed on aluminum hydroxide gel particles. The formula virus and adjuvant in buffer saline solution was used as a vaccine. The safety and protective effectiveness of the developed vaccine was studied on Syrian hamsters. The results of the studies showed the absolute safety of the candidate vaccine on the Syrian hamsters. When studying the protective effectiveness, the developed vaccine with an immunizing dose of 5 mcg/dose of a specific antigen protected animals from wild virus at a dose of 104.5 TCID50/ml. The candidate vaccine formed virus-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated hamsters in titers from 3.3 {+/-} 1.45 log2 to 7.25 {+/-} 0.78 log2, which were retained for 6 months (observation period) in the indicated titers. The candidate vaccine suppressed the replication of the wild virus in the body of vaccinated hamsters, protected against the development of acute pneumonia and ensured 100% survival of the animals. At the same time, no replicative virus was isolated from the lungs of vaccinated animals. At the same time, a virulent virus was isolated from the lungs of unvaccinated animals in relatively high titers, reaching 4.5 {+/-} 0.7 lg TCID50/ml. After challenge infection, 100% of unvaccinated hamsters became ill with clinical signs (stress state, passivity, tousled coat, decreased body temperature and body weight, and the development of acute pneumonia), of which 25 {+/-} 5% were fatal. The findings paved the way for testing the candidate vaccine in humans in clinical trials.","Kuandyk Zhugunissov; Kunsulu Zakarya; Berik Khairullin; Mukhit Orynbayev; Yergali Abduraimov; Markhabat Kassenov; Kulyaisan Sultankulova; Aslan Kerimbayev; Sergazy Nurabayev; Balzhan Myrzhakhmetova; Aziz Nakhanov; Ainur Nurpeisova; Olga Chervyakova; Nurika Assanzhanova; Yerbol Burashev; Muratbay Mambetaliev; Moldir Azanbekova; Syrym Kopeyev; Nurlan Kozhabergenov; Aisha Issabek; Moldir Tuyskanova; Lespek Kutumbetov","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.13.452175","20210713","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15933,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide ideation and suicide attempts in a sample of psychiatric inpatients","There has been little research reported regarding both suicide ideation and suicide attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic and government lockdown restrictions in Italy, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic. We investigated whether the frequency of suicide ideation and suicide attempts differed between psychiatric patients admitted to a psychiatric unit before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and government lockdown restrictions. We also assessed psychiatric diagnosis, length of hospitalization, and types of admission. We collected data on 632 psychiatric patients admitted to a public psychiatric clinic. Patients were divided into two different groups according to their admission before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results showed that only suicide attempts, but not suicide ideation, were more frequent in psychiatric patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. Furthermore, mood disorder diagnoses were more frequent during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic. The types of admission and the mean length of hospitalization did not differ between the two groups. In conclusion the present study results adds consistent knowledge on the phenomenon of suicide during the challenging time of the pandemic, pointing to continuing effort in suicide prevention measures.","Berardelli, Sarubbi, Rogante, Cifrodelli, Erbuto, Innamorati, Lester, Pompili","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114072","20210713","COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Suicide attempts; Suicide ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15934,""
"Challenges faced by people with epilepsy on ketogenic diet therapy and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil","Although ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) is a well-established, nonpharmacologic therapeutic option for patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, its availability is still not widespread. The COVID-19 pandemic may have further restricted the access of people with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (PWE) to KDT. Thus, we evaluated the experiences of Brazilian PWE and their caregivers during the first year of the pandemic. An online self-assessed survey containing 25 questions was distributed via social media to be answered by PWE treated with KDT or their caregivers through Google Forms from June 2020 to January 2021. Mental health was assessed using the DASS and NDDI-E scales. Fifty adults (&gt;18 yo), of whom 68% were caregivers, answered the survey. During the pandemic, 40% faced adversities in accessing their usual healthcare professionals and 38% in obtaining anti-seizure medication (ASM). Despite these issues, 66% of those on KDT could comply with their treatment. Those struggling to maintain KDT (34%) named these obstacles mainly: diet costs, social isolation, food availability, and carbohydrate craving due to anxiety or stress. An increase in seizure frequency was observed in 26% of participants, positively associated with difficulties in obtaining ASM [X<sup>2</sup> (1, NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯48)Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯6.55; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01], but not with KDT compliance issues. People with pharmacoresistant epilepsy and undergoing KDT, as well as their caregivers, faced additional challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, not only difficulties in accessing healthcare and KDT maintenance but also on seizure control and mental health.","Alencastro Veiga Domingues Carneiro, Dos Santos Lunardi, Matheus Uberna Giacomini, Kurrle Rieger, Dubois Moreira, Carina Ribeiro da Silva, Pereira Brito Sampaio, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108193","20210713","COVID-19; Epilepsy; Ketogenic diet; Online survey; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15935,""
"Social Isolation and Anxiety Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown in China","The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures have had a profound impact on the emotions, anxiety, and mental health of affected communities. Despite this, there is a lack of knowledge about the possible generational and geographical differences in the effects on the mental health of individuals. This study examines the impact of COVID-19 related quarantine on symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) among parents and children (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4503). It also compares the outcomes of residents from the initial COVID-19 epicenter of Wuhan to those in surrounding areas. Subgroup analyses were conducted by child and parent samples, and by Wuhan city and other cities in the Hubei province. Propensity score radius matching and ordinary least squares regressions were used to examine the relationship between quarantine and GAD symptoms. Results showed that quarantine had more psychological impact on parents than children, regardless of geographic location. Parents that experienced quarantine in Wuhan city, reported a significantly higher level of symptoms of GAD than those that did not. Parents from other cities showed no such difference. For both children and parents, interpersonal communication about COVID-19 and social media exposure to pandemic-related information were linked to GAD symptoms. Targeted policies and interventions are needed to address the psychological impacts of COVID-19 lockdown.","Wu, Yao, Deng, Marsiglia, Duan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.067","20210713","Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Quarantine; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15936,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health and Distress of Community-Dwelling Older Adults","The purpose of this study was to examine the mental health of community-dwelling older adults as they adapted their everyday health behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to a telephone survey, 126 older adults described perceived changes in physical and mental health, and adaptations in their everyday health behaviors. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and multiple regressions revealed that participants experienced changes in mental and physical health, reduced health service access, lower social engagement, and increased coping behaviors. Greater negative social impact of the pandemic wasÃ‚Â associated withÃ‚Â higher levels of COVID-19 distress. Reduced mental health was significantly related to reductions in health service access, health changes, and fewer adaptive coping behaviors. Adaptive coping behaviors were helpful, just as reduced health access and social contact added risk for mental health problems. Suggestions were provided for alleviating mental health needs by increasing social contact and engaging in adaptive coping behaviors.","Scott, Yun, Qualls","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2021.06.020","20210713","Covid-19 distress; Health; Health service access; Older adults; Social impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15937,""
"Acceptability of Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adults: Umbrella Review","Mental ill-health presents a major public health problem. A potential part solution that is receiving increasing attention is computer-delivered psychological therapy, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic as health care systems moved to remote service delivery. However, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) requires active engagement by service users, and low adherence may minimize treatment effectiveness. Therefore, it is important to investigate the acceptability of cCBT to understand implementation issues and maximize potential benefits. This study aimed to produce a critical appraisal of published reviews about the acceptability of cCBT for adults. An umbrella review informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology identified systematic reviews about the acceptability of cCBT for common adult mental disorders. Acceptability was operationalized in terms of uptake of, dropping out from, or completion of cCBT treatment; factors that facilitated or impeded adherence; and reports about user, carer, and health care professional experience and satisfaction with cCBT. Databases were searched using search terms informed by relevant published research. Review selection and quality appraisal were guided by the JBI methodology and the AMSTAR tool and undertaken independently by 2 reviewers. The systematic searches of databases identified 234 titles, and 9 reviews (covering 151 unique studies) met the criteria. Most studies were comprised of service users with depression, anxiety, or specifically, panic disorder or phobia. Operationalization of acceptability varied across reviews, thereby making it difficult to synthesize results. There was a similar number of guided and unguided cCBT programs; 34% of guided and 36% of unguided users dropped out; and guidance included email, telephone, face-to-face, and discussion forum support. Guided cCBT was completed in full by 8%-74% of the participants, while 94% completed one module and 67%-84% completed some modules. Unguided cCBT was completed in full by 16%-66% of participants, while 95% completed one module and 54%-93% completed some modules. Guided cCBT appeared to be associated with adherence (sustained via telephone). A preference for face-to-face CBT compared to cCBT (particularly for users who reported feeling isolated), internet or computerized delivery problems, negative perceptions about cCBT, low motivation, too busy or not having enough time, and personal circumstances were stated as reasons for dropping out. Yet, some users favored the anonymous nature of cCBT, and the capacity to undertake cCBT in one's own time was deemed beneficial but also led to avoidance of cCBT. There was inconclusive evidence for an association between sociodemographic variables, mental health status, and cCBT adherence or dropping out. Users tended to be satisfied with cCBT, reported improvements in mental health, and recommended cCBT. Overall, the results indicated that service users' preferences were important considerations regarding the use of cCBT. The review indicated that ""one size did not fit all"" regarding the acceptability of cCBT and that individual tailoring of cCBT is required in order to increase population reach, uptake, and adherence and therefore, deliver treatment benefits and improve mental health.","Treanor, Kouvonen, Lallukka, Donnelly","https://doi.org/10.2196/23091","20210713","acceptability; cCBT; computerized/internet cognitive behavioral therapy; iCBT; mental health; umbrella review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15938,""
"High risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury in COVID-19 with frequently encountered spontaneous breathing patterns: a computational modelling study","There is on-going controversy regarding the potential for increased respiratory effort to generate patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. However, direct clinical evidence linking increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce. We adapted a computational simulator of cardiopulmonary pathophysiology to quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to P-SILI at different levels of respiratory effort. In accordance with recent data, the simulator parameters were manually adjusted to generate a population of 10 patients that recapitulate clinical features exhibited by certain COVID-19 patients, i.e., severe hypoxaemia combined with relatively well-preserved lung mechanics, being treated with supplemental oxygen. Simulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7Ã‚Â ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 7/20, 7/30, 10/14, 10/20 and 10/30Ã‚Â ml/kg / breaths/min. While oxygenation improved with higher respiratory efforts, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from 12.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.3 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at baseline to 33.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at VT/RR of 7Ã‚Â ml/kg/30 breaths/min and to 46.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at 10Ã‚Â ml/kg/30 breaths/min. Transpulmonary pressure swing increased from 4.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.1 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at baseline to 17.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.3 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at VT/RR of 7Ã‚Â ml/kg/30 breaths/min and to 24.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.3 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at 10Ã‚Â ml/kg/30 breaths/min. Total lung strain increased from 0.29Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006 at baseline to 0.65Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.016 at 10Ã‚Â ml/kg/30 breaths/min. Mechanical power increased from 1.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.1Ã‚Â J/min at baseline to 12.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2Ã‚Â J/min at VT/RR of 7Ã‚Â ml/kg/30 breaths/min, and to 24.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.3Ã‚Â J/min at 10Ã‚Â ml/kg/30 breaths/min. Driving pressure increased from 7.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at baseline to 19.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at VT/RR of 7Ã‚Â ml/kg/30 breaths/min, and to 26.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.3 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at 10Ã‚Â ml/kg/30 breaths/min. Our results suggest that the forces generated by increased inspiratory effort commonly seen in COVID-19 acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure are comparable with those that have been associated with ventilator-induced lung injury during mechanical ventilation. Respiratory efforts in these patients should be carefully monitored and controlled to minimise the risk of lung injury.","Weaver, Das, Saffaran, Yehya, Scott, Chikhani, Laffey, Hardman, Camporota, Bates","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-021-00904-7","20210713","Acute respiratory failure; COVID-19; Computational modelling; Hypoxaemia; Patient self-inflicted lung injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15939,""

"Factors associated with psychological disturbances during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multi-country online study","Accumulating evidence suggests that the Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of individuals. However, the susceptibility of individuals to be impacted by the pandemic is variable suggesting potential influences of specific factors related to participants' demographics, attitudes, and practices. To identify the factors associated with psychological symptoms related to the effects of the first wave of pandemic in a multi-country cohort of internet users. This study anonymously screened 13,332 internet users worldwide for acute psychological symptoms related to COVID-19 pandemic from March 29th to April 14th, 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic amidst strict lockdown conditions. A total of n=12,817 responses were considered valid. n=1077 participants from Europe were screened a second time during May 15th to May 30th to ascertain the presence of psychological effects after the ease down of restrictions. Female gender, pre-existing psychiatric condition, and prior exposure to trauma were identified as notable factors associated with increased psychological symptoms during the first wave of COVID-19 (P &lt;.001). The same factors, in addition to being related to someone who demised due to COVID-19 and using social media more than usual, were associated with persistence of psychological disturbances in the limited second assessment of European participants after the restrictions had relatively eased (P &lt;.001). Optimism, ability to share concerns with family and friends like usual, positive prediction about COVID-19, and daily exercise were related to fewer psychological symptoms in both assessments (P &lt;.001).

"Does time change the anxiety and depression scores for pregnant women on Covid-19 pandemic?","Post-traumatic stress disorder, the tip form of stress disorder, is considered as delayed onset if the symptoms occur at least 6Ã‚Â months after the main effect. The aim of our study was to evaluate the severity of anxiety and depression in pregnant women during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, in addition to investigating the demographic and economic aspects affecting maternal anxiety and depression scores, 6Ã‚Â months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study was a cross-sectional descriptive study. Pregnant women who had presented to the Akdeniz University, Gynecology and Obstetrics Department, Pregnancy Outpatient Clinic, and Kepez State Hospital, Pregnancy Outpatient Clinic between September 2020 and October 2020 were included in the study. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to evaluate the state of anxiety, and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was used to assess the state of depression. Patients who had encountered any obstetric and/or fetal abnormality that could cause anxiety and depression during pregnancy follow-up and pregnant women previously diagnosed with a psychiatric disease were not included in the study. A total of 322 pregnant women who agreed to participate in the study and fulfilled the study criteria within the afore-mentioned timeframe were included in the study and the relevant forms were filled out. The mean age of the pregnant women was found to be 29Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.64Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, the mean number of gravida was 1.84Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.86, and the mean gestational age was 29.06Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.80Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. The mean score of the state anxiety scale was 41.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.56 and the mean trait anxiety score was 47.68Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.85. The mean state-trait anxiety score was determined as 42.5 in primigravid women and as 41.1 in multigravid women. The State-trait anxiety score was statistically significantly higher in primigravid women compared to multigravid women (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.027). The mean state-trait anxiety score did not demonstrate a significant difference according to the occupational status, having a chronic disease, educational level, and the income level. The mean trait anxiety score did not differ statistically and significantly according to the occupational status, having a chronic disease, being primigravid, educational status, and the income level. According to BDI-II, 69.3% of pregnant women were evaluated to have minimal depression, 12.4% as mild depression, 12.4% as moderate depression, and 5.9% as severe depression. Although more than 6Ã‚Â months have passed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women still have increased anxiety and depression scores. In addition, it should be kept in mind that pregnant women are at risk in terms of post-traumatic stress disorder during the antenatal and the postnatal periods, and it should be considered that psychological and social support should be provided.","Geren, Birge, BakÃ„Â±r, SakÃ„Â±ncÃ„Â±, Sanhal","https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14935","20210713","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; coronavirus; depression; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15943,""
"Effectiveness of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation as an alternative to Phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation of coronary heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic saw the suspension of centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) and has underscored the need for home-based cardiac telerehabilitation (HBCTR) as a feasible alternative rehabilitation delivery model. Yet, the effectiveness of HBCTR as an alternative to Phase 2 CBCR is unknown. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to quantitatively appraise the effectiveness of HBCTR. PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to January 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HBCTR to Phase 2 CBCR or usual care in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Out of 1588 studies, 14 RCTs involving 2869 CHD patients were included in this review. When compared with usual care, participation in HBCTR showed significant improvement in functional capacity {6-min walking test distance [mean difference (MD) 25.58Ã¢â‚¬â€°m, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.74-36.42]}; daily step count (MD 1.05Ã¢â‚¬â€°K, 95% CI 0.36-1.75) and exercise habits [odds ratio (OR) 2.28, 95% CI 1.30-4.00)]; depression scores (standardized MD -0.16, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.01) and quality of life [Short-Form mental component summary (MD 2.63, 95% CI 0.06-5.20) and physical component summary (MD 1.99, 95% CI 0.83-3.16)]. Effects on medication adherence were synthesized narratively. HBCTR and CBCR were comparably effective. In patients with CHD, HBCTR was associated with an increase in functional capacity, physical activity (PA) behaviour, and depression when compared with UC. When HBCTR was compared to CBCR, an equivalent effect on functional capacity, PA behaviour, QoL, medication adherence, smoking behaviour, physiological risk factors, depression, and cardiac-related hospitalization was observed.","Ramachandran, Jiang, Tam, Yeo, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjpc/zwab106","20210713","Cardiac rehabilitation; Coronary heart disease; Home-based; Mobile application; Telerehabilitation; Web-based ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15944,""

In total, 86 trainees (females: 55%; mean age: 32.5 years [SD Ã‚Â±4.57 years]; mean training duration of 2.68 years [SD Ã‚Â±1.63]) from 22 different countries were recruited. From the cohort, 10.5% were considered as vulnerable for acquiring COVID-19. During their job, 4.7% acquired the infection and 26.7% were placed in quarantine. Most trainees noted that their various aspects of gastroenterology training were moderately or severely affected during the initial height of the pandemic: clinical gastroenterology training (67.4%), outpatients (75.5%), didactic teaching (88.3%), multidisciplinary team meetings (65.2%) and endoscopy training (75.6%). Later, when the number of COVID-19-related infections decreased across Europe, the above modalities returned to normal for &lt;50% of the trainees. This European-wide survey has demonstrated that gastroenterology training has been severely impacted during both the initial height of the pandemic and afterwards. Furthermore, the psychological impact on trainees, in terms of training quality, duration and exposure to COVID-19, is unknown. A re-assessment of each centre training programme should be done as to ensure that a high standard of training is still being delivered. A pandemia SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) trouxe uma mudanÃƒÂ§a radical nas nossas rotinas de trabalho. Estas mudanÃƒÂ§as afetaram a formaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o dos internos de gastroenterologia, em particular nas tÃƒÂ©cnicas endoscÃƒÂ³picas, uma vez que se tratam de procedimentos geradores de aerossÃƒÂ³is. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi avaliar o efeito da pandemia COVID-19 na formaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o gastrenterolÃƒÂ³gica em todos os paÃƒÂ­ses europeus. Foi elaborado um questionÃƒÂ¡rio onde foram analisados dos diferentes componentes da formaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o. O questionÃƒÂ¡rio (online) foi distribuÃƒÂ­do entre os internos de gastrenterologia atravÃƒÂ©s dos Representantes Nacionais do European Board de Gastroenterologia e Hepatologia. No total, obtivemos respostas de 86 internos (mulheres: 55%; idade mÃƒÂ©dia: 32,5 anos (DP Ã‚Â±4,57 anos); duraÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o mÃƒÂ©dia de internato complementar de 2,68 anos (DP Ã‚Â±1,63), provenientes de 22 paÃƒÂ­ses, dos quais 10,5% foram considerados de risco para adquirir COVID-19. Durante a sua prÃƒÂ¡tica clÃƒÂ­nica, 4,7% contraÃƒÂ­ram a infeÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o e 26,7% foram colocados em quarentena. A maioria dos internos respondeu que vÃƒÂ¡rios aspetos da sua formaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o gastrenterolÃƒÂ³gica foram moderada ou gravemente afetados durante a altura inicial da pandemia: formaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o gastrenterolÃƒÂ³gica clÃƒÂ­nica (67,4%), consulta externa (75,5%), formaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o teÃƒÂ³rica (88,3%), reuniÃƒÂµes multidisciplinares (65,2%) e ensino em endoscopia (75,6%). Mais tarde, quando o nÃƒÂºmero de infeÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes relacionadas com COVID-19 diminuiu em toda a Europa, as atividades acima descritas voltaram Ãƒ normalidade para menos de 50% dos internos. Esta pesquisa em toda a Europa demonstrou que a formaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o dos internos em gastrenterologia foi gravemente afetada durante a fase inicial da pandemia e nos meses seguintes. AlÃƒÂ©m disso, o impacto psicolÃƒÂ³gico nos internos, em termos de qualidade de treino, duraÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o e exposiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o ao COVID-19, ÃƒÂ© desconhecido.

"Reflections on a pandemic: Disruptions, distractions and challenges of a clinical social worker on the frontline in New York City","For many of us, COVID-19 markedly changed our world and how we operate in it daily. While the behavioral health ramifications of this pandemic are not fully known, they have clearly had an impact. For weeks, we all watched in disbelief as COVID-19 ambushed China, Italy, and other countries. When President Trump implemented the March 16, 2020, live broadcast detailing plans of how our nation would address COVID-19, we knew that it was just a matter of time before we began to experience what we saw happening around the world. Quickly, the escalation of COVID-19 in the United States caused a major shift for social work education, practice, and research. Social workers are serving in critical roles during this pandemic and providing care for COVID-19 patients and their families. The purpose of this article is to provide reflection on the disruptions, distractions, and challenges of a social worker serving in a leadership role on the frontlines at the Javits Center in New York during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Felder","https://doi.org/10.1177/1473325020981076","20210713","Mental health; critical reflection; reflective practice; reflexivity; social work practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15946,""
"Mindful energy and information flow: A reflective account of SELF connection during COVID-19","Life during the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, intense, and traumatic. At the same time, there is room for hope, inspiration, and meaning for social workers through mindfully connecting with energy-information flow as it influences our Safety, Emotions, Loss, and Future - S.E.L.F. As adapted from the Sanctuary ModelÃ‚Â®, this S.E.L.F connection is an opportunity to discover within ourselves our unwavering core that is grounded, present, and connected and sustain an ethical and compassionate approach to social work practice, education, and research during this time of pandemic. The aim in this reflective essay is to provide an example of S.E.L.F. connection from the perspective of a Buddhist and social work academic at an Australian university during the COVID-19 pandemic. While beneficial, ongoing S.E.L.F. connections are necessary for social workers if we are to stay mindful of energy-information flow and steer this flow towards the creation of a story of relationship, compassion, and connection into the future.","Lucas","https://doi.org/10.1177/1473325020973302","20210713","Mental health; emotions; loss; reflective practice; social work education; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15947,""
"Mental health status and psychosocial issues during Nationwide COVID-19 quarantine in Iran in 2020: A cross-sectional study in Mazandaran Province","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is spreading rapidly, and its psychosocial impact remains a big challenge. In this respect, quarantine has been recommended, as a significant practice, to prevent the given condition. Therefore, the present study was to determine the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress and to reflect on the impact of COVID-19, as a traumatic stressor event, on individuals. This web-based survey was fulfilled via an online questionnaire, completed by respondents selected through the cluster sampling technique, from March 24 to April 10, 2020, living in Mazandaran Province, Northern Iran. Accordingly, the data regarding demographic characteristics, physical health status, quarantine compliance, contact with COVID-19, and additional information were collected. The psychosocial impact of the pandemic was then assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the respondents' mental health status was evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Data analysis was further performed by linear regression. The study findings, from 1075 respondents, revealed that 22.5% of the cases had moderate-to-severe depression, 38.5% of the individuals were suffering from moderate-to-severe anxiety, and 47.2% of the participants were experiencing moderate-to-severe stress. In 14.5% of the respondents, the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 also varied from the possibility of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to immunosuppression (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). With the high prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress, mental health professionals are suggested to develop psychosocial interventions and support plans for the general population to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health status.","Reskati, Shafizad, Aarabi, Hedayatizadeh-Omran, Khosravi, Elyasi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02011-z","20210713","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Impact of event; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15948,""
"How have journalists been affected psychologically by their coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic? A descriptive study of two international news organisations","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented healthcare challenges. Journalists covering the pandemic at close quarters are working in ways akin to first responders, but nothing to date is known of the psychological distress this is potentially causing them. This study aims to determine whether journalists reporting on the COVID-19 crisis have been affected emotionally, and if so to assess the severity of their distress. It also investigates potential demographic and work-related predictors and whether news organisations had provided counselling to their journalists. A total of 111 journalists working for two international news organisations were approached of which 73 (66%) participated in the study. Symptoms of anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7)), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)), overall psychological distress (12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)), and treatment. The percentages of journalists exceeding threshold scores for clinically significant anxiety, depression, PTSD and psychological distress were: GAD-7, 26%; PHQ-9, 20.5%; PCL-5, 9.6%; GHQ-12, 82.2%. Journalists assigned to cover the pandemic (n=54 (74%)) were significantly more anxious (p&lt;0.05). Journalists who received counselling (n=38 (52%)) following the onset of the pandemic reported significantly fewer symptoms of anxiety (p&lt;0.01), depression (p&lt;0.01) and overall psychological distress (p&lt;0.01). Journalists covering the COVID-19 pandemic are experiencing levels of anxiety and depression similar to those seen in first responders. Psychological therapy provided in a timely manner can significantly alleviate emotional distress.","Osmann, Selva, Feinstein","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045675","20210713","adult psychiatry; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15949,""
"Needs, gaps and opportunities for standard and e-mental health care among at-risk populations in the Asia Pacific in the context of COVID-19: a rapid scoping review","The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have profound mental health impact, including in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region. Some populations might be at higher risk of experiencing negative mental health impacts and may encounter increased barriers to accessing mental health care. The pandemic and related restrictions have led to changes in care delivery, including a rapid shift to the use of e-mental health and digital technologies. It is therefore essential to consider needs and opportunities for equitable mental health care delivery to the most at-risk populations. This rapid scoping review: 1) identifies populations in the APEC region that are at higher risk of the negative mental health impacts of COVID-19, 2) identifies needs and gaps in access to standard and e-mental health care among these populations, and 3) explores the potential of e-mental health to address these needs. We conducted a rapid scoping review following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We searched Medline, Embase and PsychInfo databases and Google Scholar using a search strategy developed in consultation with a biomedical librarian. We included records related to mental health or psychosocial risk factors and COVID-19 among at-risk groups; that referred to one or more APEC member economies or had a global, thus generalizable, scope; English language papers, and papers with full text available. A total of 132 records published between December 2019 and August 2020 were included in the final analysis. Several priority at-risk populations, risk factors, challenges and recommendations for standard and e-mental health care were identified. Results demonstrate that e-mental health care can be a viable option for care delivery but that specific accessibility and acceptability considerations must be considered. Options for in-person, hybrid or ""low-tech"" care must also remain available. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for equitable standard and e-mental health care. It has also highlighted the persistent social and structural inequities that contribute to poor mental health. The APEC region is vast and diverse; findings from the region can guide policy and practice in the delivery of equitable mental health care in the region and beyond.","Murphy, Khan, Sun, Minas, Hatcher, Ng, Withers, Greenshaw, Michalak, Chakraborty, Sandanasamy, Ibrahim, Ravindran, Chen, Nguyen, Lam","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01484-5","20210713","Asia Pacific; At-risk populations; COVID-19; E-mental health; Equity; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15950,""
"Covid-19 fear, happiness and stress in adults: the mediating role of psychological resilience and coping with stress","The aim of this study is to examine the mediating role of coping with stress and psychological resilience in the relationship between happiness and perceived stress of COVID-19 fear in Turkish adults. 827 individuals (516 females, 311 males) above 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age and living in Turkey participated in this research. The data of the research was collected through the COVID-19 Fear Scale, Depression-Happiness Scale Short Form, Perceived Stress Scale and Psychological Resilience Scale Short Form. The results show that fear of COVID-19 negatively predicts happiness and positively predicts perceived stress. According to the results, psychological resilience and coping with perceived stress mediate the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and happiness and stress. Moreover, psychological resilience and coping with perceived stress mitigate the impact of COVID-19 fear on happiness and stress. The findings provide evidence as to how to reduce the negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health. In addition, the results provide information to improve mental health during the pandemic period.KEY POINTSPsychological resilience reduces the effect of COVID-19 on stress and increases happiness levels.Coping with stress reduces the impact of COVID-19 on stress and increases happiness levels.","Peker, Cengiz","https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2021.1937656","20210713","COVID-19; coping with stress; happiness; mediation; mental health; psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15951,""

"The Psychosocial Impacts of COVID-19 on a Sample of Australian Adults: Cross-sectional Survey and Sentiment Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has had enormous impacts on people's lives, including disruptions to their normal ways of behaving, working, and interacting with others. Understanding and documenting these experiences is important to inform the ongoing response to COVID-19 and disaster preparedness efforts. The aim of this study was to examine the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 on a sample of Australian adults. The data analyzed were derived from a larger cross-sectional survey of Australian adults that was administered during the month of May 2020. Participants (N=3483) were asked in which ways COVID-19 had most greatly impacted them; the responses produced a text data set containing 1 COVID-19 impact story for each participant, totaling 86,642 words. Participants also completed assessments of their sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, financial stress), level of concern related to COVID-19, personality trait profile, and satisfaction with life. Impact stories were analyzed using sentiment analysis and compared against the Theoretical Domains Framework to determine the most frequently impacted life domains. Finally, a multinomial regression analysis, stratified by participant sex, was conducted to identify the associations of psychological and demographic socializations with sentiment toward COVID-19. In total, 3483 participants completed the survey, the majority of whom were female (n=2793, 80.2%). Participants' impact stories were most commonly categorized as neutral (1544/3483, 44.3%), followed by negative (1136/3483, 32.6%) and positive (802/3483, 23.1%). The most frequently impacted life domains included behavioral regulation, environmental context and resources, social influences, and emotions, suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic was impacting these areas of participants' lives the most. Finally, the regression results suggested that for women, lower satisfaction with life and higher financial stress were associated with increased likelihood of negative, rather than positive, sentiment (P&lt;.001); however, the proportion of variance in the sentiment that was explained was very small (&lt;5%). Participant sentiment toward COVID-19 varied. High rates of neutral and negative sentiment were identified. Positive sentiment was identified but was not as common. Impacts to different areas of people's lives were identified, with a major emphasis on behavioral regulation and related domains such as social influences, environmental context and resources, and emotions. Findings may inform the development of mental health and social support resources and interventions to help alleviate the psychosocial consequences of disaster response measures.","Ryan, Sellak, Brindal","https://doi.org/10.2196/29213","20210713","Australia; COVID-19; NLP; behavior; behavioural science; community; data set; impact; machine learning; natural language processing; sentiment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-14","",15954,""
