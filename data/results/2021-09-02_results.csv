"Predicting transitions between longitudinal classes of posttraumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder, and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: Protocol of a latent transition model in a general Dutch sample","Background A growing body of literature shows profound effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, among which increased rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adjustment disorder (AD). However, current research efforts have largely been unilateral, focusing on psychopathology and not including well-being, and are dominated by examining average psychopathology levels or on disorder absence/presence, thereby ignoring individual differences in mental health. Knowledge on individual differences, as depicted by latent subgroups, in the full spectrum of mental health may provide valuable insights in how individuals transition between health states and factors that predict transitioning from resilient to symptomatic classes. Our aim is to (1) identify longitudinal classes (i.e., subgroups of individuals) based on indicators of PTSD, AD, and well-being in response to the pandemic and (2) examine predictors of transitioning between these subgroups. Methods and analysis We will conduct a three-wave longitudinal online survey-study of n [&ge;] 2000 adults from the general Dutch population. The first measurement occasion takes place six months after the start of the pandemic, followed by two follow-up measurements with six months intervals. Latent transition analysis will be used for data-analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from four Dutch universities. Longitudinal study designs are vital to monitor mental health (and predictors thereof) in the pandemic to develop preventive and curative mental health interventions. This study is carried out by researchers who are board members of the Dutch Society for Traumatic Stress Studies and is part of a pan-European study (initiated by the European Society for Traumatic Stress Studies) examining the impact of the pandemic in eleven countries. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at conferences, via newsletters, and media-appearance among (psychotrauma-)professionals and the general public.","Lonneke I. M.

"Lifestyle changes and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A repeated, cross-sectional web survey","This study aimed to compare self-reported changes on lifestyle behaviors during two phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, and to evaluate clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with lifestyles. Two cross-sectional web surveys were conducted during lockdown (April 15-May 15, 2020) and seven months later (November 16-December 16, 2020). Lifestyle behaviors were self-reported by a multidimensional scale (SMILE-C). Two separate samples of respondents were analyzed. A multivariate regression model was performed to evaluate the association of SMILE-C scores with demographic and clinical variables. The sample comprised, 3412 participants from the first survey (S1) and in the S1 and 3635 from the second (S2). SMILE-C score decreased across surveys (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). The rates of positive screenings for depression and anxiety were similar between the surveys, whereas those for alcohol abuse decreased (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Most participants in S2 reported that their lifestyle had not changed compared to those before the pandemic. Variables independently associated with an unhealthier lifestyle were working as an essential worker, lower educational level, previous mental disease, worse self-rated health, totally/moderate changes on diet, sleep or social support, as well as positive screenings for alcohol abuse, anxiety and depression. The cross-sectional design and recruitment by non-probabilistic methods limit inferring causality and the external validity of the results. Overall lifestyle worsened seven months after the lockdown in Spain. Several demographic and clinical factors were associated with lifestyle scores. The contribution of common mental disorders to unhealthier lifestyles should be considered in order to prevent the negative impact of the pandemic.","Cervera-MartÃƒÂ­nez, Atienza-Carbonell, Mota, Bobes-BascarÃƒÂ¡n, Crespo-Facorro, Esteban, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Portilla, Gomes-da-Costa, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Pinto, JaÃƒÂ©n-Moreno, Sarramea, Vieta, Zorrilla, TabarÃƒÂ©s-Seisdedos, Kapczinski, De Boni, BalanzÃƒÂ¡-MartÃƒÂ­nez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.020","20210901","COVID-19; General population; Lifestyle; Mental health; Web survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17598,""

"We're Stronger Together: A Collaboration to Support Military Families During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for every segment of the U.S. population, including military personnel and their families. The TriService Nursing Research Program's Military Family Research Interest Group (FIG) formed a collaboration with Blue Star Families, a civilian non-profit organization, to identify potential issues faced by military families during the pandemic. The Pain Points Poll was introduced online by Blue Star Families, and findings were aggregated weekly between March 18 and May 26, 2020. Volunteer poll respondents were mainly recruited through social media outreach. FIG-informed questions were incorporated in week 4 of polling and focused on workplace environment, financial health, social support, physical and mental health, child behavior, utilization of family care plans, and general well-being. Data were collected to gain real-time insights into the major challenges posed by the pandemic. Findings from FIG-informed questions were collaboratively reviewed and analyzed by FIG and BSF teams. Data-driven recommendations were made to stakeholders to improve processes and reprioritize investments for services that aim to alleviate the impact of COVID-19 on military families. A total of 2,895 military family units (i.e., service members and spouses) responded to the poll, a majority of which (88%) represented active duty family units. Although the majority of families (range: 59%-69%) noted no impact to their finances, approximately one in five families endorsed dipping into their savings during the pandemic. A majority of respondents (69.5%) reported taking active measures to support their mental health, endorsing various strategies. Among parents of special needs children, 45% of active duty families and 60% of single-parent service members reported the inability to maintain continued services for their children. A majority of parents with school-aged children (65%) reported child behavioral changes due to their child's inability to socialize with peers. Among military service members, 41% were concerned about obtaining fair performance evaluations during the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic produced significant challenges for military families. Collaboration between military and civilian partners can inform policies and appropriate strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 for military families. The findings presented here provide insight into areas where military families can be supported for optimal outcomes during unprecedented times.","Urbieta, Akin, Hamilton, Brock, Yablonsky","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab213","20210901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17601,""

"Describing cognitive function and psychosocial outcomes of COVID-19 survivors: A cross-sectional analysis","Neurological and psychological symptoms are increasingly realized in the post-acute phase of COVID-19. To examine and characterize cognitive and related psychosocial symptoms in adults (21-75 years) who tested positive for or were treated as positive for COVID-19. In this cross-sectional study, data collection included a cognitive testing battery (Trails B; Digit Symbol; Stroop; Immediate and Delayed Verbal Learning) and surveys (demographic/clinical history; self-reported cognitive functioning depressive symptoms, fatigue, anxiety, sleep disturbance, social role performance, and stress). Results were compared with published norms, rates of deficits (more than 1 standard deviation (SD) from the norm) were described, and correlations were explored. We enrolled 52 participants (mean age 37.33 years; 78.85% female) who were, on average, 4 months post illness. The majority had a history of mild or moderate COVID-19 severity. Forty percent of participants demonstrated scores that were 1 SD or more below the population norm on one or more of the cognitive tests. A subset had greater anxiety (21.15%), depressive symptoms (23.07%), and sleep disturbance (19.23%) than population norms. Age differences were identified in Stroop, Digit Symbol, and Trails B scores by quartile (p &lt; .01), with worse performance in those 28-33 years old. Cognitive dysfunction and psychological symptoms may be present in the weeks or months after COVID-19 diagnosis, even in those with mild to moderate illness severity.

"Emotional Analysis of the COVID-19 First Flow in Greece Based on Twitter Posts","The effectiveness of public health measures depends upon a community's compliance, as well as on its positive or negative emotions. The purpose of this study was to perform an analysis of expressed emotions in Greek Twitter during the first flow of COVID-19. The study period was January 25th to June 30th, 2020. The data collection was performed via the Twitter filter streaming API using appropriate search keywords. The emotional analysis of the tweets that satisfied the inclusion criteria was achieved using a deep learning approach (suggested by ColneriÃ„Â and DemÃ…Â¡ar 2020) that performs better by utilizing recurrent neural networks on sequences of characters. Emotional epidemiology tools like the six basic emotions (joy, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger) based on the Paul Eckman classification were adopted. Surprise at the emerging contagion was the most frequent emotion detected, while the imposed isolation resulted mostly in anger (OR=2.108). Yet, Greeks felt rather safe during the first COVID-19 flow, while their positive and negative emotions reflected a masked ""flight or fight"" or fear vs. anger response to the epidemic contagion. The emotional analysis emerges as a valid tool for epidemiology evaluations, design and public health strategy and surveillance.

"Does COVID-19 count?: Defining Criterion A trauma for diagnosing PTSD during a global crisis","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a globally significant crisis with a rapid spread worldwide, high rates of illness and mortality, a high degree of uncertainty, and a disruption of daily life across the sociodemographic spectrum. The clinically relevant psychological consequences of this catastrophe will be long-lasting and far-reaching. There is an emerging body of empirical literature related to the mental health aspects of this pandemic and this body will likely expand exponentially. The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of a historic catastrophe from which we can learn much and from which the field will need to archive, interpret, and synthesize a multitude of clinical and research observations. In this commentary, we discuss situations and contexts in which a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may or may not apply within the context of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria. Our consensus is that a COVID-related event cannot be considered traumatic unless key aspects of DSM-5's PTSD Criterion A have been established for a specific type of COVID-19 event (e.g., acute, life-threatening, and catastrophic). The application of a more liberal interpretation of Criterion A will dilute the PTSD diagnosis, increase heterogeneity, confound case-control research, and create an overall sample pool with varying degrees of risk and vulnerability factors.","Norrholm, Zalta, Zoellner, Powers, Tull, Reist, Schnurr, Weathers, Friedman","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23209","20210901","DSM; PTSD phenomenology; anxiety; diagnosis; etiology; peritraumatic reactions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17606,""
"Emergency Department Encounters Among Youth With Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Population-level reports of suicide-related emergency department (ED) encounters among youth during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking, along with youth characteristics and preexisting psychiatric service use. To characterize population-level and relative change in suicide-related ED encounters among youth during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 2019. This cross-sectional study evaluated ED encounters in 2019 and 2020 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California-a large, integrated, community-based health system. Youth aged 5 to 17 years who presented to the ED with suicidal thoughts or behaviors were included. The COVID-19 pandemic. Population-level incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and percent relative effects for suicide-related ED encounters as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes in 4 periods in 2020 compared with the same periods in 2019. There were 2123 youth with suicide-related ED encounters in 2020 compared with 2339 in 2019. In the 2020 group, 1483 individuals (69.9%) were female and 1798 (84.7%) were aged 13 to 17 years. In the 2019 group, 1542 (65.9%) were female, and 1998 (85.4%) were aged 13 to 17 years. Suicide-related ED encounter incidence rates were significantly lower in March through May 2020 compared with this period in 2019 (IRR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.51-0.63; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), then returned to prepandemic levels. However, suicide-related ED visits among female youth from June 1 to August 31, 2020, and September 1 through December 15, 2020, were significantly higher than in the corresponding months in 2019 (IRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.04-1.35; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04 and IRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.35; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, respectively), while suicide-related ED visits for male youth decreased from September 1 through December 15, 2020 (IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.94). Youth with no history of outpatient mental health or suicide encounters (129.4%; 95% CI, 41.0-217.8) and those with comorbid psychiatric conditions documented at the ED encounter (6.7%; 95% CI, 1.0-12.3) had a higher risk of presenting with suicide-related problems from September to December 2020 vs the same period in 2019. In this cross-sectional study of youth experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviors, suicide-related presentations to the ED initially decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely owing to shelter-in-place orders, then were similar to 2019 levels. However, a greater number of female youth, youth with no psychiatric history, and youth with psychiatric diagnoses at the time of the ED encounter presented for suicide-related concerns during the pandemic, suggesting these may be vulnerable groups in need of further interventions. Adjustments in care may be warranted to accommodate these groups during periods of crisis.","Ridout, Alavi, Ridout, Koshy, Awsare, Harris, Vinson, Weisner, Sterling, Iturralde","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.2457","20210901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17607,""
"Mental disorders among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic A cross-sectional study","Pregnancy is the most important event in women's lives and can lead to psychological lability. Several risk factors (such as disasters, events and pandemics) have been correlated with greater prevalence of mental disorders during pregnancy. To research how pregnant women have been affected by the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic process, in order to contribute to the limited literature. Cross-sectional survey study conducted at the Training and Research Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Ordu, Ordu, Turkey, from February 1 to March 1, 2021. In total, 356 pregnant women were enrolled and completed the survey. Intention of going to hospital and the Beck anxiety, Beck depression, Beck hopelessness and Epworth sleepiness scales were applied to detect mental disorders. Among the participants, the anxiety, depression, hopelessness and sleepiness scores were 29.2%, 36.2%, 58.1% and 11.8%, respectively. The pregnant women stated that they avoided going to hospital in unnecessary situations by obeying the 'stay at home' calls, but also stated that they were afraid of the potential harmful effects of inadequate physician control. However, most of them stated that they would go to the hospital in emergencies. This paper illustrated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnant women and emphasized their high rates of anxiety, depression, hopelessness and sleepiness. Since presence of mental disorders is indirectly related to poor pregnancy outcomes, preventive strategies should be developed, especially during this pandemic process.","Keskin, Keskin, Bostan","https://doi.org/10.1590/1516-3180.2021.0356.27052021","20210901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17608,""
"Virtual Event ""Skip the Small Talk"" Intended to Promote Social Connection During a Global Pandemic: An Online Evaluation","Social distancing measures meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the past year have exacerbated loneliness and depression in the United States. While virtual tools exist to improve social connections, there have been limited attempts to assess community-based, virtual methods to promote new social connections. In this proof-of-concept study, we examined the extent to which Skip the Small Talk (STST), a Boston-based business dedicated to hosting events to facilitate structured, vulnerable conversations between strangers, helped reduce loneliness in a virtual format in the early months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. We predicted that participants who attended STST virtual events would show a reduction in loneliness, improvement in positive affect, and reduction in negative affect after attending an event. We were also interested in exploring the role of depression symptoms on these results as well as the types of goals participants accomplished by attending STST events. Adult participants who registered for a STST virtual event between March 25 and June 30, 2020 completed a survey before attending the event (pre-event survey; n=64) and a separate survey after attending the event (post-event survey; n=25). Participants reported on their depression symptoms, loneliness, and positive and negative affect. Additionally, participants reported the goals they wished to accomplish as well as those they actually accomplished by attending the STST event. The four most cited goals that participants hoped to accomplish before attending the STST event included to make new friends, have better/deeper conversations with people, feel less lonely, and to practice social skills. Thirty-one percent of participants who completed the pre-event survey reported depression symptoms that indicated a high risk of a major depressive episode in the preceding two weeks. Of the 25 participants who completed the pre- and post-event surveys, participants reported a significant reduction in loneliness (P = .03, Cohen's d = 0.48) and negative affect (P &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 1.52) after attending the STST event compared to before the event. Additionally, depressive symptoms were significantly positively correlated with change in negative affect (P = .03), suggesting that the higher the depression score was prior to attending the STST event, the higher the reduction in negative affect was following the event. Finally, 100% of participants who wished to reduce their loneliness or feel less socially anxious prior to attending the STST event reported that they accomplished those goals after the event. Our preliminary assessment suggests that the virtual format of STST was helpful for reducing loneliness and negative affect for participants, including those experiencing depression symptoms, during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. While encouraging, additional research is necessary to demonstrate whether STST has benefits when compared to other social events and interventions and whether such benefits persist beyond the events themselves.","Mote, Gill, Fulford","https://doi.org/10.2196/28002","20210901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17609,""
"COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home mandates promote weight gain in US adults","The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the effect of state stay-at-home mandates on weight of US adults and by BMI over 3 months during COVID-19. US adults completed an online questionnaire containing demographics, weight, physical activity, sedentary time, fruit/vegetable intake, depressive symptoms, stress, and sleep at baseline (May 2020) and after 3-months (August 2020).

"Pediatric hematology/oncology healthcare professional emotional health during COVID-19","Little is known about the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on healthcare professional emotional health in pediatric hematology/oncology. Primary objective was to describe anxiety, depression, positive affect, and perceived stress among pediatric hematology/oncology healthcare professionals following a COVID-19 outbreak. Secondary objectives were to compare these outcomes based on contact with a positive person, and to identify risk factors for worse outcomes. We included 272 healthcare professionals working with pediatric hematology/oncology patients. We determined whether respondents had direct or indirect contact with a COVID-19-positive individual and then measured outcomes using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) depression, anxiety, and positive affect measures, and the Perceived Stress Scale. Among eligible respondents, 205 agreed to participate (response rate 75%). Sixty-nine (33.7%) had contact with a COVID-19-positive person. PROMIS anxiety, depression, and positive affect scores were similar to the general United States population. Those who had contact with a COVID-19-positive individual did not have significantly different outcomes. In multiple regression, non-physicians had significantly increased anxiety (nurses: pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.013), depression (nurses: pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.002, pharmacists: pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.038, and other profession: pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.021), and perceived stress (nurses: pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.002 and other profession: pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.011) when compared to physicians. Pediatric hematology/oncology healthcare professionals had similar levels of anxiety, depression, and positive affect as the general population. Contact with a COVID-19-positive individual was not significantly associated with outcomes. Non-physician healthcare professionals had more anxiety, depression, and perceived stress when compared to physicians. These findings may help to develop programs to support healthcare professional resilience.","Schechter-Finkelstein, Plenert, La Rosa, McLean, Chiang, Krueger, Hearne, Sung","https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.4253","20210901","clinical guidelines; clinical management; pediatric cancer; psychosocial studies; quality of life; viral infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17611,""

"Becoming a mother during the COVID-19 national lockdown in Italy: Issues linked to the wellbeing of pregnant women","The COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown represent risk factors for the mental health of pregnant women. We explored the impact of COVID-19 restriction policies on psychological health, analysing the predictive role of social support on maternal wellbeing. A total of 212 pregnant women recruited from two public hospitals in Italy were divided into two groups: (a) a pre-COVID-19 group composed of 141 expectant women (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 34.6; SDÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.3) at their third trimester before the national lockdown period; (b) a COVID-19 group composed of 71 pregnant women (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 33.3; SDÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.5) at their third trimester during the COVID-19 national lockdown. Participants completed two self-report questionnaires: the Profile of Mood States and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Moreover, the COVID-19 group was asked to respond to an open question concerning worries about their pregnancies and COVID-19. Results showed that pregnant women during COVID-19 presented higher anxiety, depression and hostility, and lower vigour, than the pre-COVID-19 group. The main concerns were related to the effect of hospital restriction policies on childbirth and fears of contracting COVID-19. Perceived partner social support represented a protective factor only for the pre-COVID-19 women. Limitations, strengths, and theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.","Smorti, Ponti, Ionio, Gallese, Andreol, Bonassi","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12806","20210901","COVID-19; Pregnancy; Pregnancy-related concerns; Psychological well-being; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17613,""

Consuming homemade foods drops by 8.63% at post lockdown than lockdown period<b>.</b> At post lockdown, 26.67% of students gained weight whereas 47.46% of respondents never engaged in any physical works. There has been a significant correlation between weight gain and physical activities (p = 0.007). Not continuing the academic activities from home was significantly associated with weight changes (AOR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.95), meals per day (AOR = 3.25; 95% CI: 1.79, 5.92), screen time for entertainment (AOR = 3.08; 95% CI: 1.78, 5.33), sleeping hours (AOR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.83), and sleep quality (AOR = 2.38; 95% CI: 1.35, 4.23) whereas female gender was related to meals per day (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.95) and sleep quality (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.85). However, 43.91% of respondents never felt any sleep disturbances. The rates of students who always experienced mentally tired, resentment, and sadness at post lockdown was lower than lockdown period. All of these changes were significant (p &lt; 0.000) in terms of the lockdown situation.

"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Practice Patterns and Psychological Status of Ophthalmologists in Turkey","To investigate the changes in ophthalmologists' working conditions and mental health status in Turkey during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and reveal the relevant individual and workplace-related factors. This cross-sectional, nationwide, the survey-based study collected data between June and September 2020. Demographic characteristics, working conditions, precautionary measures in the workplace, and participants' Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) ratings were investigated. This study included 360 actively working ophthalmologists. While 64% of them worked in the pandemic hospitals, 44% were actively involved in COVID-related departments. Among those, 56 (35%) declared that they had all personal protective equipment in sufficient quantity in their COVID department. Despite the restrictions, 32% reported continuing to see 25 to 50 patients per day in ophthalmology clinics, with the most common complaint being the ocular ""itching and burning"" sensation. 53% stated that they did not perform any surgeries. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia were present in 65%, 56.9%, and 43% and 46.9% of participants, respectively. All DASS-21 subscales and ISI scores were found to be significantly higher during the pandemic. Female gender, older age, and lower satisfaction levels of hygiene conditions in COVID clinics were independent predictors of higher DASS-21 subscale scores in multivariate analysis. Being a resident was a major predictor of depression. Ophthalmologists working in a pandemic hospital were more likely to experience insomnia. Ophthalmologists have actively worked in COVID departments during the pandemic. Increased psychological distress among ophthalmologists compared to the pre-pandemic period is caused by personal factors and many determinants related to the workplace and practice patterns. Therefore, decreasing the transmission risk by creating a protective workplace and developing psychological support policies should be considered to minimize adverse psychological effects.","Durmaz Engin, Senel Kara, Ozturk, Dadas","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16614","20210901","anxiety; coronavirus; covid-19; depression; insomnia; ophthalmologists; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17615,""
"Psychometric Properties of the Coronavirus Stress Measure with Malaysian Young Adults: Association with Psychological Inflexibility and Psychological Distress","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in multiple physical and psychological stressors, which require quantification and establishment of association with other psychological process variables. The Coronavirus Stress Measure (CSM) is a validated instrument with acceptable validity and reliability. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the CSM in a Malaysian population. University participants were recruited via convenience sampling using snowball methods. The reliability and validity of the Malay CSM (CSM-M) were rigorously evaluated, utilising both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis, in relation to sociodemographic variables and response to the depression, anxiety, and stress subscales of the Malay validation of the DASS-21, and also perceived stress (measured by the PSS) and psychological flexibility (AAQ-II). The sample comprised of 247 Malaysian participants. The McDonald's omega value for the Malay CSM was 0.935 indicating very good internal reliability. The CSM was significantly correlated with stress, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and psychological flexibility. The Malay CSM properties were examined also with Rasch analysis, with satisfactory outcomes. There was positive correlated error between items 1 and 3, as well as negative correlated error between items 1 and 4. Hence, item 1 was excluded, leaving with 4 items. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated good data-model fit, and model fit statistics confirmed that Malay CSM showed a single-factor model. The Malay CSM hence demonstrates good validity and reliability, with both classical and modern psychometric methods demonstrating robust outcomes. It is therefore crucial in operational and research settings in establishing the true extent of stress levels as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kassim, Pang, Kamu, Arslan, Mohamed, Zainudin, Ayu, Ho","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00622-y","20210901","Anxiety; Coronavirus stress; Depression; Psychological flexibility; Validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17616,""

"Adolescents amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a prospective study of psychological functioning","The spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the accompanying countermeasures can significantly impact the wellbeing of adolescents. There is a lack of longitudinal studies that can shed light on potential social, emotional, and behavioral development in adolescents. We aimed to identify potential changes in adolescent psychosocial functioning from pre-pandemic to peri-pandemic assessment, and secondly, to identify specific patterns of change. This longitudinal study was based on a Lithuanian community sample of 331 adolescents aged 12-16 at T1 (MÃ¢â‚¬â€° =Ã¢â‚¬â€° 13.87, SD Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€° 1.59). T1 data collected before the pandemic (March-June, 2019) was compared with T2 data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak (October 2020). Psychosocial functioning was assessed by The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Multivariate latent change modeling and latent class change approaches were used to identify patterns of change. We found a small but significant increase in hyperactivity/inattention, emotional symptoms, but also prosocial behavior from before to during the pandemic, even adjusting for resilience, lifetime abuse experience, and socio-demographic situation. Three change profiles were identified in the latent change analysis: (1) a majority (70.7%) experienced a significant increase in psychosocial problems; (2) a smaller sub-group (19.6%) with increased peer problems only; (3) a small group (9.7%) showing no negative change and an increase in prosocial behavior. The study found a significant negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the majority of adolescents, as well as indications of positive social development in a small group. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and supporting adolescents in the time of the pandemic more effectively. Accumulating knowledge about human responses to the coronavirus, particularly in young people, is pivotal to societal preparedness for future pandemics.","Daniunaite, Truskauskaite-Kuneviciene, Thoresen, Zelviene, Kazlauskas","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00397-z","20210901","Adolescents; COVID-19; Lithuania; Psychosocial functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17618,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic Mental Health Questionnaire (CoPaQ): psychometric evaluation and compliance with countermeasures in psychiatric inpatients and non-clinical individuals","The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted people's lives across a broad spectrum of psychosocial domains. We report the development and psychometric evaluation of the self-report COVID-19 Pandemic Mental Health Questionnaire (CoPaQ), which assesses COVID-19 contamination anxiety, countermeasure necessity and compliance, mental health impact, stressor impact, social media usage, interpersonal conflicts, paranoid ideations, institutional &amp; political trust, conspiracy beliefs, and social cohesion. Further, we illustrate the questionnaire's utility in an applied example investigating if higher SARS-Cov-2 infection rates in psychiatric patients could be explained by reduced compliance with preventive countermeasures. A group of 511 non-clinical individuals completed an initial pool of 111 CoPaQ items (Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/3evn9/ ) and additional scales measuring psychological distress, well-being, and paranoia to assess construct validity and lifetime mental health diagnosis for criterion validity. Factor structure was determined by exploratory factor analyses and validated by conducting confirmatory factor analysis in the accompanying longitudinal sample (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°318) and an independent psychiatric inpatient sample primarily admitted for major depressive-, substance abuse-, personality-, and anxiety disorders (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°113). Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's Alpha and McDonald's Omega. For the applied research example, Welch t-tests and correlational analyses were conducted. Twelve out of 16 extracted subscales were retained in the final questionnaire version, which provided preliminary evidence for adequate psychometric properties in terms of factor structure, internal consistency, and construct and criterion validity. Our applied research example showed that patients exhibited greater support for COVID-19 countermeasures than non-clinical individuals. However, this requires replication in future studies. We demonstrate that the CoPaQ is a comprehensive and valid measure of the psychosocial impact of the pandemic and could allow to a degree to disentangle the complex psychosocial phenomena of the pandemic as exemplified by our applied analyses.","Rek, BÃƒÂ¼hner, Reinhard, Freeman, Keeser, Adorjan, Falkai, Padberg","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03425-6","20210901","Coronavirus; Factor analysis; Preventive countermeasures; Psychosocial impact; Questionnaire validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17619,""
"Postpartum stress and protective factors in women who gave birth in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable stress throughout the world. Little is known about how postpartum women who gave birth during the early months of the pandemic were impacted. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the associations between potential risk, protective factors, and psychological distress among postpartum women who gave birth during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Postpartum women over the age of 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years who gave birth in the US hospitals between March and July of 2020 and spoke English completed a survey about their experiences. Demographic and health variables were measured via self-report. Stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale-10. Mastery was measured with the Pearlin Mastery Scale. Resilience was measured with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2. This study included 885 women. Participants had higher stress and lower resilience relative to pre-pandemic norms. Participants had high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Women who had an infant admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit had more stress. Income, full-time employment, and partnered relationships were associated with lower stress. Resilience and mastery were related to lower stress, depression, and anxiety. Black, Indigenous, or People of Color women showed higher stress and lower resiliency. Single women were likely to report lower levels of mastery than partnered women. Stress, depression, and anxiety were high in postpartum women in this study. Income, partnered relationships, and employment security, along with protective traits such as mastery and resilience, may reduce the impact of stress on postpartum women in a pandemic. Care models should be modified to support women during a pandemic. Health disparities exist in postpartum stress. Future interventions should focus on building resiliency and mastery and ensuring appropriate resources are available to postpartum women in a pandemic.","Mollard, Kupzyk, Moore","https://doi.org/10.1177/17455065211042190","20210901","COVID; birth; mastery; pregnancy; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-02","",17620,""

Open-ended questionnaires were sent to all adult patients awaiting cochlear implantation surgery. Qualitative analysis was performed using a grounded theory approach. Participants described a primarily negative impact on wellbeing from the surgery delay, expressing feelings of isolation or loneliness. Low mood, depression or hopelessness were commonly expressed by elderly participants; frustration and anxiety were described by young adults. Participants described a negative impact on their general daily life, describing difficulties communicating with facemasks and struggles with reliance on telephone communication because of social distancing. Despite these significant psychosocial challenges, only a minority described adaptive coping strategies. Profoundly deaf patients may be at greater psychosocial risk because of unique challenges from their hearing disability.
