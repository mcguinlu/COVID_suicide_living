"The CopeNYP program: A model for brief treatment of psychological distress among healthcare workers and hospital staff","In the midst of the Spring 2020 initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, members of the Psychiatry Department of Weill Cornell Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital rapidly created and implemented a brief, behavioral skills-based intervention program, ""CopeNYP"", to address the immediate mental health needs of the employees of the hospital and medical school. We describe the development, implementation and evolution of this telehealth-delivered program staffed primarily by in-house clinical psychologists, postdoctoral fellows, pre-doctoral interns and counselors who were redeployed or volunteered their time to provide urgent support for employees. We discuss the challenges and lessons learned in providing brief, skills-based psychological interventions for employees subjected to chronic stress. As the impact of the pandemic became prolonged, employees faced compounding stressors including social isolation, fear of infection, grief and loss, and sequelae of COVID-19-related illness combined with work-related demands. Our goal is to present our program design, implementation, and utilization as a blueprint for other institutions that would like to develop an evidence-based clinician-staffed psychological intervention program to support ongoing employee mental health needs.","Kanellopoulos, Solomonov, Ritholtz, Wilkins, Goldman, Schier, Oberlin, Bueno-Castellano, Dargis, Cherestal, Gunning","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2021.09.002","20210918","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18078,""

"Clinical perception and management of Parkinson's disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: A Canadian experience","The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the social isolation of the population and the rapid implementation of remote care for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The objective of this study was to explore the perceived impact of confinement in patients with Parkinson's disease and document the effects of gender and living environment. We recruited two cohorts from the Canadian provinces of QuÃƒÂ©bec and Alberta, which differed in the dynamics of COVID-19 spreading at the time of the study, and administered a questionnaire on the perceived effects of confinement on daily living and disease management. The data reveals that approximately half of the patients experienced a change in one or more clinical symptoms, with differences observed between gender (e.g. day-to-day changes in slowness in men, aggravated headaches in women) and geographic location (e.g. increased depression in Alberta but reduced sleep quality in QuÃƒÂ©bec). Furthermore, participants identifying as women or living in Alberta implemented more frequently home or online exercise. Lastly, high levels of satisfaction with phone or video consultations did not translate into a sustained interest to pursue this mode of healthcare. This study suggests that COVID-19-related confinement affected Parkinson's disease manifestation and management. Patients also reported varying levels of interest to continue remote care. A number of differences reported in our study were seemingly related to gender and living environment.","de Rus Jacquet, Bogard, Normandeau, Degroot, Postuma, DuprÃƒÂ©, Miyasaki, Monchi, Martino, Fon, Cicchetti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parkreldis.2021.08.018","20210918","Gender effect; Isolation; Neurodegenerative diseases; Pandemic; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18080,""
"Distress in a Pandemic - The Association of the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic with Distress and Quality of Life in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)","The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically disrupted cancer care, potentially exacerbating patients' distress levels. Patients undergoing HSCT may be especially vulnerable to this pandemic stress. However, the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic with distress, fatigue, and QOL are not well understood in this population. In a cross-sectional analysis of data from 205 patients undergoing HSCT enrolled in a supportive care trial, we compared baseline pre-HSCT distress (depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) symptoms, fatigue, and QOL between enrollees pre- (i.e., 03/2019-01/2020) and during (i.e., 03/2020-01/2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. We used linear regression models adjusting for sociodemographics and cancer diagnosis to examine the associations between enrollment period and patient-reported outcomes. We used semi-structured qualitative interviews in 20 allogeneic HSCT recipients who were Ã¢â€°Â¥3-months post-HSCT to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their recovery post-HSCT. Prior to COVID-19, 124 participants enrolled, while 81 participants enrolled during the pandemic. The cohorts had similar baseline demographics and disease risk factors. In multivariate regression models, enrollment during COVID-19 was not associated with pre-HSCT symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, fatigue, or QOL impairment. COVID-19-era participants reported themes of negative (e.g., increased isolation) and positive (e.g., engagement with meaningful activities) implications of the pandemic on HSCT recovery. We found no differences in pre-HSCT distress, fatigue or QOL in patients undergoing HSCT prior to or during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients in early recovery post-HSCT, however, report both negative and positive implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives.","Amonoo, Topping, Clay, Reynolds, Rice, Harnedy, Longley, LeBlanc, Greer, Chen, DeFilipp, Lee, Temel, El-Jawahri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtct.2021.09.001","20210918","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Distress; Patient-reported outcomes; Quality of Life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18081,""

"The COVID-19 pandemic: a new epoch and fresh challenges for cancer patients and caregivers-a descriptive cross-sectional study","Cancer patients and their caregivers are overwhelmed with features of uncertainty, fear, shock, worry, anxiety, sadness, and grief. To add on to their misery, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely afflicted the cancer care delivery. The study was conducted to observe the challenges faced by cancer patients and their caregivers and to formulate strategies for oncological setups to overcome those challenges. After obtaining institutional ethical clearance, a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to observe the challenges faced by patients and their caregivers at the level of various domains (physical, logistic, psychological, socioeconomic, and spiritual) who visited the outpatient and inpatient department of cancer pain and palliative care unit. The results were expressed in absolute numbers. Major challenges encountered were suffering from physical symptoms like pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea (90%), postponement of cancer treatment (80%), fear of contracting COVID infection due to hospital visit (93.5%), lack of accommodation (70%), and lack of spiritual clarity and hope (50%). Major challenges faced by patients were in physical and psychological domains, and those by caregivers were in socioeconomic domains and handling physical symptoms of their patients. It is imperative to recognize and be cognizant of the challenges faced by cancer patients and their caregivers. Health care setups should formulate strategies to alleviate these challenges and provide holistic care to cancer patients. These strategies will hold in good stead for future pandemics also.","Mishra, Gupta, Bhatnagar, Garg, Bharati, Kumar, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06564-4","20210918","COVID-19 pandemic; Cancer patients; Caregivers; Challenges; Strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18083,""
"The impact of COVD-19 on North American dermatology practices","COVID-19 continues to affect the delivery of healthcare services, as practices across North America gradually re-open with new safety measures and practice guidelines. Specifically in dermatology, clinical care is delivered in close physician-patient proximity through physical examination and the use of additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. We designed a 10-question survey to better understand how COVID-19 has impacted the delivery of care in North American dermatology practices. Survey questions explored themes including changes in patient volumes, the use of virtual visits/teledermatology, the frequency of aesthetic and surgical procedures, and other related topics. We invited 102 board-certified dermatologists working in a variety of medical, aesthetic, surgical, and mixed practices, to participate in our survey hosted through Qualtrics XM. These dermatologists were selected based on their geographic location and our ability to access their contact information. Each dermatologist received an individualized e-mail and survey link; however, all survey responses were anonymized. In 2.5Ã‚Â weeks after survey invitations were sent, the survey was viewed and completed by 71 and 54 dermatologists, respectively. The second wave of e-mails was sent to the remaining 48 dermatologists who had not yet completed the survey, after which 15 participants both viewed and completed the survey. In total, 69 responses were recorded with an overall response rate of 67.6%. We report decreased patient volume capacity, fewer aesthetic and surgical procedures, and an increase in the use of virtual medicine among board-certified North American dermatologists. However, this represents a reflection on perspectives at a single time point in a rapidly evolving situation. Understanding the full scope of the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on dermatologic care is paramount to effectively serve our patients.","Zarbafian, Guo, Dover, Humphrey","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14458","20210918","COVID-19; aesthetic dermatology; cosmetic dermatology; dermatology; medical dermatology; procedural dermatology; return to practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18084,""
"Impact of the coronavirus pandemic on mental health and health care in adults with neurofibromatosis: Patient perspectives from an online survey","The coronavirus pandemic increased anxiety and stress and prevented access to health care worldwide; it is unclear how COVID-19 affected adults with a multisystem genetic disorder such as neurofibromatosis (NF). An anonymous online survey was distributed through an international registry and foundations to adults with NF (June-August 2020) to assess the impact of the pandemic on mental health and NF health care. Six hundred and thirteen adults (18-81Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 45.7) with NF1 (77.8%), NF2 (14.2%), and schwannomatosis (7.8%) provided complete responses. Respondents rated moderate-to-high amounts of worry about the impact of COVID-19 on their emotional (46.3%) and physical health (46.7%), and 54.8% endorsed moderate-to-high pandemic-related stress. Adults with diagnosed/suspected mental health disorders or moderate-to-severe NF symptom impact as well as females endorsed higher COVID-19 stress (psÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Less than half who missed a doctor's appointment for their NF care (43.4%) used telehealth. Of these, 33.3% and 46.2% reported that telehealth met their needs to a moderate or high degree, respectively. Results indicated that subgroups of adults with NF experience higher COVID-19-related worries and stress and may need additional support. Furthermore, telehealth is under-utilized and could help NF providers connect with patients, although improved delivery and patient training may facilitate expanded use of these services.","Wolters, Reda, Martin, Al Ghriwati, Baker, Berg, Erickson, Franklin, Merker, Oberlander, Reeve, Rohl, Rosser, Toledo-Tamula, Vranceanu","https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.62490","20210918","COVID-19; coronavirus; neurofibromatosis; psychosocial; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18085,""

"Work situation of rheumatologists and residents in times of COVID-19 : Findings from aÃ‚Â survey in Germany","The work situation is an important dimension of professional life and wellbeing, and aÃ‚Â policy lever to strengthen recruitment and retention. This study aims to explore the work situation of physicians and residents in internal medical rheumatology, considering the impact of the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19. AÃ‚Â questionnaire-based online survey was conducted in early 2021 at the Hannover Medical School, supported by the German Society of Rheumatology. Target groups were all rheumatology physicians and residents in Germany. The main areas of investigation included work hours, task delegation, and collaboration; workload and mental health issues; discrimination and sexual harassment experiences; and the impact of COVID-19. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed for the standardized items and qualitative content analysis for the free-text information. The respondents (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°101) expressed positive attitudes towards cooperation and task delegation to medical assistants, especially those specialized in rheumatology, while attitudes towards cooperation with GPs pointed to blockades. There was aÃ‚Â strong mismatch between actual and desired work hours both in the group of women and in the group of men. 81% rated their workload as high or very high; every sixth rheumatologist has suffered from stress or burnout syndromes at least once in the past. Experiences of gender discrimination and sexual harassment/violence were frequently reported, mostly by women. COVID-19 was an amplifier of stress, with major stressors being digitalization and increased demand for communication and patient education. There is an urgent need to improve the work situation of rheumatologists and reduce stress and mental health risks.

"The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH): protocol for a prospective longitudinal cohort study of healthcare and ancillary workers in UK healthcare settings","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality and devastated economies globally. Among groups at increased risk are healthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups. Emerging evidence suggests that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of adverse COVID-19-related outcomes. To date, there has been no large-scale analysis of these risks in UK HCWs or ancillary workers in healthcare settings, stratified by ethnicity or occupation, and adjusted for confounders. This paper reports the protocol for a prospective longitudinal questionnaire study of UK HCWs, as part of the UK-REACH programme (The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers). A baseline questionnaire will be administered to a national cohort of UK HCWs and ancillary workers in healthcare settings, and those registered with UK healthcare regulators, with follow-up questionnaires administered at 4 and 8 months. With consent, questionnaire data will be linked to health records with 25-year follow-up. Univariate associations between ethnicity and clinical COVID-19 outcomes, physical and mental health, and key confounders/explanatory variables will be tested. Multivariable analyses will test for associations between ethnicity and key outcomes adjusted for the confounder/explanatory variables. We will model changes over time by ethnic group, facilitating understanding of absolute and relative risks in different ethnic groups, and generalisability of findings. The study is approved by Health Research Authority (reference 20/HRA/4718), and carries minimal risk. We aim to manage the small risk of participant distress about questions on sensitive topics by clearly participant information that the questionnaire covers sensitive topics and there is no obligation to answer these or any other questions, and by providing support organisation links. Results will be disseminated with reports to Government and papers submitted to pre-print servers and peer reviewed journals.

"Delirium and neuropsychological outcomes in critically Ill patients with COVID-19: a cohort study","To characterise the clinical course of delirium for patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit, including postdischarge neuropsychological outcomes. Retrospective chart review and prospective survey study. Intensive care units, large academic tertiary-care centre (USA). Patients (n=148) with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were eligible for inclusion. Delirium was the primary outcome, assessed via validated chart review method. Secondary outcomes included measures related to delirium, such as delirium duration, antipsychotic use, length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, inflammatory markers and final disposition. Neuroimaging data were also collected. Finally, a telephone survey was conducted between 1 and 2 months after discharge to determine neuropsychological function via the following tests: Family Confusion Assessment Method, Short Blessed Test, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Cognitive Abilities 4a and Patient-Health Questionnaire-9. Delirium was identified in 108/148 (73%) patients, with median (IQR) duration lasting 10 (4-17) days. In the delirium cohort, 50% (54/108) of patients were African American and delirious patients were more likely to be female (76/108, 70%) (absolute standardised differences &gt;0.30). Sedation regimens, inflammation, delirium prevention protocol deviations and hypoxic-ischaemic injury were likely contributing factors, and the most common disposition for delirious patients was a skilled care facility (41/108, 38%). Among patients who were delirious during hospitalisation, 4/17 (24%) later screened positive for delirium at home based on caretaker assessment, 5/22 (23%) demonstrated signs of questionable cognitive impairment or cognitive impairment consistent with dementia and 3/25 (12%) screened positive for depression within 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after discharge. Patients with COVID-19 commonly experience a prolonged course of delirium in the intensive care unit, likely with multiple contributing factors.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Sexual Behaviors: Findings From a National Survey in the United States","Studies from the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting lockdown and social distancing measures have shown that there have been decreases in sexual frequency and relationship satisfaction. To evaluate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual behavior, relationship satisfaction, and intimate partner violence in the United States using a large national convenience sample. About 1,051 participants across the United States were recruited in October 2020 to complete a cross-sectional online survey. Participants were asked to retrospectively report their sexual behavior frequency, relationship satisfaction, and intimate partner violence during the pandemic and prior to the pandemic RESULTS: There was a small but significant decrease in some retrospectively-reported partnered sexual activities, and men reported a small increase in masturbation and pornography use. There was no evidence for a change in relationship satisfaction or intimate partner violence, but both men and women reported a small decrease in sexual pleasure, and women reported a small decrease in sexual desire. The sexual behaviors with greatest reduction were casual sex, hookups, and number of partners, and the most diminished as aspect of sexual functioning was sexual enjoyment. Depression symptoms, relationship status, and perceived importance of social distancing emerged as predictors of these reductions. Less than half of individuals who engaged with casual sex partners before the start of the pandemic ceased this behavior completely after the start of the pandemic. Individuals waited on average 6-7 weeks before reengaging in casual sex. These results inform public health response to the effects of the pandemic and add to our understanding of how the pandemic has continued to impact sexual behavior. This is the first known study to evaluate sexual behavior several months into the COVID-19 pandemic using a large national sample. However, the results of this study are limited by its convenience sampling method and cross-sectional design. These results indicate that the changes in sexual behavior observed in the early months of the pandemic have continued, with small but significant decreases in many partnered sexual behaviors and a small increase in men's solitary sexual behaviors.

Participants of Chinese nationality aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years were asked to complete a self-administered online questionnaire regarding sexuality behaviour and impact of event scale (IES) in March 2020. Nonrandom sampling was used for participant recruitment. Also assessed were sociodemographic data including sex, age, employment, region, sexual dysfunction, and whether participants tested positive for COVID-19. IES score, frequency of sexual intercourse per week, quality of usual sex life, emotional bonding and duration of relationship were measured. A total of 1,139 participants (ie, 735 males and 404 females) were included in the study. Mean age and IES of participants was 33.6 Ã‚Â± 9.5 years and 27.4 Ã‚Â± 8.6, respectively. Being male was significantly associated with increased frequency of sexual intercourse amid the COVID-19 pandemic (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .012). Also, participants with an IES score &lt;26 were more likely to report that they had increased frequency of sexual intercourse per week (P &lt; .001) and the COVID-19 pandemic had positively affected the quality of their usual sex lives (P &lt; .001). On the other hand, participants with IES score Ã¢â€°Â¥26 were more likely to report that the COVID-19 pandemic had positively affected their emotional bonding (P &lt; .001). Frequency of sexual intercourse and quality of sex life in participants who experienced high stressful impact were more likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This was one of the first studies to assess sexual behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese adults. Since participants were asked to self-report their sexual behavior, this potentially introduced self-reporting and recall bias into our findings. Our study reported that despite the moderate-to-severe stressful impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority reported no significant changes in the frequency of their sexual intercourse per week, quality of their usual sexual lives and emotional bonding.

"Willingness to bear economic costs of measures against SARS-CoV-2 in Germany","The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of the general population in Germany to bear the economic costs of measures against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Repeated cross-sectional data were taken from three waves of a nationally representative survey of individuals aged 18 to 74Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (wave 8: 21-22 April 2020, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°976; wave 16: 7-8 July 2020, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°977; wave 38: 9-10 March 2021). The willingness to accept a reduction of annual household income in order to bear the economic costs of the measures against SARS-CoV-2 served as outcome measure. Two-part models were used including explanatory variables on sociodemographic and (subjectively assessed) potential health hazard caused by COVID-19. 65.5% (61.6%; 56.9%) of respondents in wave 8 (wave 16; wave 38) were willing to accept a reduction of income, with the likelihood for accepting a reduction of income being positively associated with higher affect (i.e. emotional reaction) and presumed severity regarding COVID-19 in all three waves. The mean maximum percentage of income participants were willing to give up was 3.3% (95% CI: 2.9 to 3.7%) in wave 8, 2.9% (95% CI: 2.5 to 3.3%) in wave 16 and 4.3% (95% CI: 3.6 to 5.0%) in wave 38, with presumed severity of COVID-19 being positively associated with this percentage in all three waves. The majority of respondents indicated willingness to sacrifice income in order to bear the costs of measures against the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the potential health hazard caused by COVID-19 being consistently associated with this willingness. However, the proportion of individuals who were willing to give up income slightly decreased throughout the pandemic.","KÃƒÂ¶nig, De Bock, Sprengholz, Kretzler, Hajek","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11734-4","20210918","Corona-virus; Covid-19; Economic costs; Income; SARS-CoV-2; Willingness to accept; Willingness to pay","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18092,""
"Resilience to stress and social touch","Modern lifestyle and adversities such as the COVID-19 pandemic pose challenges for our physical and mental health. Hence, it is of the utmost importance to identify mechanisms by which we can improve resilience to stress and quickly adapt to adversity. While there are several factors that improve stress resilience, social behaviorâ€”primarily in the form of social touchâ€”is especially vital. This article provides an overview of how the somatosensory system plays a key role in translating the socio-emotional information of social touch into active coping with stress. Important future directions include evaluating in humans whether stress resilience can be modulated through the stimulation of low-threshold C-fiber mechanoreceptors and using this technology in the prevention of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2021.08.011","20220201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18093,""
"Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and incidence of depression: A population-based cohort study in China","Background Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution was linked to depression incidence, although the results were limited and inconsistent. Objectives To investigate the effects of long-term air pollution exposure on depression risk prospectively in China. Methods The present study used data from Yinzhou Cohort on adults without depression at baseline, and followed up until April 2020. Two-year moving average concentrations of particulate matter with a diameterÂ =Â 2.5Â Âµm (PM2.5), =10Â Âµm (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were measured using land-use regression (LUR) models for each participant. Depression cases were ascertained using the Health Information System (HIS) of the local health administration by linking the unique identifiers. We conducted Cox regression models with time-varying exposures to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of depression with each pollutant, after adjusting for a sequence of individual covariates as demographic characteristics, lifestyles, and comorbidity. Besides, physical activity, baseline potential depressive symptoms, cancer status, COVID-19 pandemic, different outcome definitions and air pollution exposure windows were considered in sensitivity analyses. Results Among the 30,712 adults with a mean age of 62.22Â Â±Â 11.25, 1024 incident depression cases were identified over totaling 98,619 person-years of observation. Interquartile range increments of the air pollutants were associated with increased risks of depression, and the corresponding HRs were 1.59 (95%CI: 1.46, 1.72) for PM2.5, 1.49 (95%CI: 1.35, 1.64) for PM10 and 1.58 (95%CI: 1.42, 1.77) for NO2. Subgroup analyses suggested that participants without taking any protective measures towards air pollution were more susceptible. The results remained robust in all sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution was identified as a risk factor for depression onset. Strategies to reduce air pollution are necessary to decrease the disease burden of depression.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149986","20220115","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18094,""
"Can servant leadership prevent hotel employee depression during the COVID-19 pandemic? A mediating and multigroup analysis","The hospitality industry has been severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with changes that have harmed employeesâ€™ psychological well-being. However, having supervisors who are servant may make a difference. With a focus on serving others and the care taken to ensure their employeesâ€™ highest priority needs are served, these leaders could help employees feel less depressed in these complicated times. By instilling servant behaviors in followers that help them become people that others can trust or with whom they can develop friendships, leaders could help these employees earn greater levels of personal social capital (PSC) through which to more successfully address pandemic times, especially if furloughed. Using structural equation modeling to analyze a sample of 205 hotel employees in Spain, we found that servant leadership directly decreases depression, and that PSC mediates this relationship. Our multigroup analyses (MGA) findings also reveal that when these employees are furloughed, the negative effect of PSC and the mediating role of PSC in this relationship is stronger. New light is thus shed on how servant leadership is effective in reducing employee depressive symptoms in times of severe changes such as those produced by the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121192","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18095,""
"COVID-19-induced shocks and uncertainty","Using statistical identification, we extract a COVID-19-induced shock by exploiting large daily jumps in financial markets caused by news about the pandemic. This shock depresses economic and financial indicators, increases risk and uncertainty measures, has sizeable distributional effects, and hits most harshly those industries relying on face-to-face interactions. Impulse response function analysis across various identification strategies leads us to interpret the statistical COVID-19-induced shock as a structural uncertainty shock.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2021.103893","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-19","",18096,""
