"Clinical characteristics with inflammation profiling of Long-COVID and association with one-year recovery following hospitalisation in the UK: a prospective observational study","Background There are currently no effective pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for Long-COVID. To identify potential therapeutic targets, we focussed on previously described four recovery clusters five months after hospital discharge, their underlying inflammatory profiles and relationship with clinical outcomes at one year. Methods PHOSP-COVID is a prospective longitudinal cohort study, recruiting adults hospitalised with COVID-19 across the UK. Recovery was assessed using patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs), physical performance, and organ function at five-months and one-year after hospital discharge. Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at one-year. Cluster analysis was performed using clustering large applications (CLARA) k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at five-months. Inflammatory protein profiling from plasma at the five-month visit was performed. Findings 2320 participants have been assessed at five months after discharge and 807 participants have completed both five-month and one-year visits. Of these, 35.6% were female, mean age 58.7 (SD 12.5) years, and 27.8% received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between five months 501/165 (25.6%) and one year 232/804 (28.9%). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at one year were: female sex OR 0.68 (95% CI 0.46-0.99), obesity OR 0.50 (95%CI 0.34-0.74) and IMV OR 0.42 (95%CI 0.23-0.76). Cluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters: very severe, severe, moderate/cognitive, mild relating to the severity of physical, mental health and cognitive impairments at five months in a larger sample. There was elevation of inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate/cognitive clusters compared to the mild cluster including interleukin-6 which was elevated in both comparisons. Overall, there was a substantial deficit in median (IQR) EQ5D-5L utility index from pre-COVID (retrospective assessment) 0.88 (0.74-1.00), five months 0.74 (0.60-0.88) to one year: 0.74 (0.59-0.88), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at one-year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters. Interpretation The sequelae of a hospital admission with COVID-19 remain substantial one year after discharge across a range of health domains with the minority in our cohort feeling fully recovered. Patient perceived health-related quality of life remains reduced at one year compared to pre-hospital admission. Systematic inflammation and obesity are potential treatable traits that warrant further investigation in clinical trials.","Rachael Andrea Evans; Olivia C Leavy; Matthew Richardson; Omer Elneima; Hamish J C McAuley; Aarti Shikotra; Amisha Singapuri; Marco Sereno; Ruth M Saunders; Victoria C Harris; Raminder Aul; Paul Beirne; Charlotte E Bolton; Jeremy S Brown; Gourab Choudhury; Nawar Diar Bakerly; Nicholas Easom; Carlos Echevarria; Jonathan Fuld; Nick Hart; John R Hurst; Mark Jones; Dhruv Parekh; Paul Pfeffer; Najib M Rahman; Sarah Rowland-Jones; Ajay M Shah; Dan G Wootton; Trudie Chalder; Melanie J Davies; Anthony De Soyza; William Greenhalf; Neil J Greening; Liam G Heaney; Simon Heller; Luke Howard; Joseph Jacob; R Gisli Jenkins; Janet M Lord; Will D-C Man; Gerry P McCann; Stefan Neubauer; Peter JM Openshaw; Joanna Porter; Jennifer Quint; Matthew J Rowland; Janet Scott; Malcolm G Semple; Sally J Singh; Mark Toshner; Keir Lewis; Andrew Briggs; Annemarie B Docherty; Steven Kerr; Nazir I Lone; Aziz Sheikh; Mathew Thorpe; Bang Zheng; James D Chalmers; Ling-Pei Ho; Alex Horsley; Michael Marks; Krisnah Poinasamy; Betty Raman; Ewen M Harrison; Louise V Wain; Christopher E Brightling; - PHOSP-COVID Collaborative Group","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.13.21267471","20211215","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23891,""
"Acute COVID-19 severity and 16-month mental morbidity trajectories in patient populations of six nations","BACKGROUND The aim of this multinational study was to assess the development of adverse mental health symptoms among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the general population by acute infection severity up to 16 months after diagnosis. METHODS Participants consisted of 247 249 individuals from seven cohorts across six countries (Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) recruited from April 2020 through August 2021. We used multivariable Poisson regression to contrast symptom-prevalence of depression, anxiety, COVID-19 related distress, and poor sleep quality among individuals with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 at entry to respective cohorts by time (0-16 months) from diagnosis. We also applied generalised estimating equations (GEE) analysis to test differences in repeated measures of mental health symptoms before and after COVID-19 diagnosis among individuals ever diagnosed with COVID-19 over time. FINDINGS A total of 9979 individuals (4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period and presented overall with a higher symptom burden of depression (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.03-1.36) and poorer sleep quality (1.13, 1.03-1.24) but not with higher levels of symptoms of anxiety or COVID-19 related distress compared with individuals without a COVID-19 diagnosis. While the prevalence of depression and COVID-19 related distress attenuated with time, the trajectories varied significantly by COVID-19 acute infection severity. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 but never bedridden due to their illness were consistently at lower risks of depression and anxiety (PR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.91 and 0.77, 0.63-0.94, respectively), while patients bedridden for more than 7 days were persistently at higher risks of symptoms of depression and anxiety (PR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27-2.05 and 1.43, 1.26-1.63, respectively) throughout the 16-month study period. CONCLUSION Acute infection severity is a key determinant of long-term mental morbidity among COVID-19 patients.","Ingibjorg Magnusdottir; Aniko Lovik; Anna Bara Unnarsdottir; Daniel L.

"Targeted HIV Testing for Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19","Background SARS-CoV-2 causes a severe respiratory illness known as COVID-19. Treatment options in the early portion of the COVID-19 pandemic included the use of antiretroviral agents i.e. protease inhibitors (PIs) such as lopinavir (LPV) that had been shown to have activity against the main proteases of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro but with very limited clinical data. Prior to the use of PIs, HIV testing would be indicated to ensure that patients who were not previously diagnosed with HIV would start appropriate HIV treatment. In this unique situation, HIV testing would be utilized not based on traditional HIV risk factors. Methods We performed a retrospective search from a specific systems database of patients admitted to Yale-New Haven Health System (YNHHS) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. We identified a subset of patients who were HIV tested. Most were done prior to initiating PI treatment. Demographics, comorbidity scores and specific underlying conditions were also tabulated. We performed Kruskal Wallis and Chi-Squared analysis to test for significance between HIV- and HIV+ patients. Results The total no. of patients admitted to the YNHHS with COVID-19 infection between the period from January 6, 2020 to January 6, 2021 was 5776. A cohort 964 (16.7%) patients were screened for HIV. Much of the testing occurred in the early COVID periods (Figure 1) when PIs were considered as part of the treatment algorithm. Sixty-seven (0.07%) patients tested HIV+ with 3 (0.003%) being newly diagnosed (Fig 2). Compared to HIV- patients, HIV+ were more likely to be identified as Black, with higher mean Elixhauser Comorbidity scores and significant associations with conditions such as hypertension, pulmonary disease, complicated diabetes, liver disease, renal failure and depression (Table 1). These co-morbidities have been correlated with higher risk of hospitalization for people living with HIV (PWH). Figure 2. COVID Admission and HIV Status The graph represents HIV testing results over the entire study period. Table 1. Demographics and Comorbidites Represents demographics and comorbidities of HIV- & HIV+ patients Figure 1. COVID Admissions and HIV Testing COVID admissions over time and the performance of HIV testing Conclusion This is one of the first reports on targeted HIV testing for patients not using identifiable traditional HIV risk factors who were admitted to a large healthcare system for COVID19 infections. The percentage of newly HIV diagnosed patients from this cohort was considered to be &lt; known HIV infection rates for our population. The majority of PWH were already established in care prior to their COVID19 diagnosis.

"Widening mental health and substance use inequities among sexual and gender minority populations: Findings from a repeated cross-sectional monitoring survey during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada","This paper examines the mental health and substance use impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic among sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations as compared to non-SGM populations, and identifies risk factors for mental health and substance use impacts among SGM groups. Data were drawn from two rounds of a repeated cross-sectional monitoring survey of 6027 Canadian adults, with Round 1 conducted May 14-19, 2020 and Round 2 conducted September 14-21, 2020. Bivariate cross-tabulations with chi-square tests were utilized to identify differences in mental health and substance use outcomes between SGM and non-SGM groups. Separate multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for mental health and substance use outcomes for all SGM respondents. Compared to non-SGM respondents, a greater proportion of SGM participants reported mental health and substance use impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including deterioration in mental health, poor coping, suicidal thoughts, self-harm, alcohol and cannabis use, and use of substances to cope. Among SGM respondents, various risk factors, including having a pre-existing mental health condition, were identified as associated with mental health and substance use impacts. These widening inequities demonstrate the need for tailored public mental health actions during and beyond the pandemic.","Slemon, Allie, Richardson, Chris, Goodyear, Trevor, Salway, Travis, Gadermann, Anne, Oliffe, John L.; Knight, Rod, Dhari, Shivinder, Jenkins, Emily K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Widening+mental+health+and+substance+use+inequities+among+sexual+and+gender+minority+populations:+Findings+from+a+repeated+cross-sectional+monitoring+survey+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+Canada","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Psychiatry research;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23894,""
"Health-related quality of life in COVID-19 survivors after 12 months, a prospective cohort study","Background The long-term effects of COVID-19 are still unknown. This study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 among survivors after one year. Methods All confirmed COVID-19 cases who presented at OLVG hospital in Amsterdam during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic were invited to participate in our prospective observational cohort study. The participants were divided into three subgroups: patients not admitted, admitted to the general ward and admitted to the ICU. Questionnaires were sent at 3, 6 and 12 months after presentation. We used the Research and Development â€“ 36-item health survey, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the PTSS Checklist for DSM-5. We compared the RAND-36 scores at the timepoints with a Dutch healthy control population in 2020 and between the three subgroups using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Results Of the 466 confirmed cases, 75 patients died of COVID-19, 64 patients were lost to follow up and 12 patients were excluded because they were unable to complete the questionnaires due to mental illness or cognitive impairment, they moved back to their home country or refused to participate. Of the remaining 315 patients, 182 (57.8%) completed the questionnaires at 3 months. Subsequently, 163 patients provided informed consent for follow up. At 6 and 12 months, 98 (60.1%) and 131 (80.4%) completed the survey. The average score of all domains at 3 months was 58, compared to 79 at twelve months and 81 in the control group. There was a statistically significant increase from 3 and 12 and 6 and 12 months (figure 1). At twelve months participants recovered to levels of the healthy control group (N=459), except for the ICU group, who still experienced bodily pain and decreased physical function. The improvement was most noticeable in the domains of social functioning, role limitations â€“ physical and role limitations â€“ emotional. The percentage of patients with abnormal total HADS scores (cutoff at 16) and PCL5- scores (cutoff at 33) at 3 months decreased from 27.8 to 22.1% and 18.9 to 7.6% at 12 months, respectively (figure 2 and 3). Figure 1. RAND-36: Health-related quality of life after COVID-19 of all patients.

In the present study, we analyze the influence of the socioeconomic status and the housing situation on the changes in PA behavior and recreational screen-time before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown among children and adolescents living in Germany. We found an alignment of PA behavior among youth from families with different socioeconomic backgrounds during the first lockdown and identified the housing situation to be aÂ meaningful predictor of the increase in habitual activity.

"Integrated Community Health Screening for COVID-19 and HIV Promotes HIV Diagnoses and Linkage to Care","Background New Jersey experienced a 64% decrease in HIV screening during the COVID-19 pandemic, hampering the Federal â€œEnd the Epidemic Initiativeâ€. From March 2020- May 2021, North Jersey Community Research Initiative, a community-based organization in Newark, NJ, noted a HIV seropositivity of 3.1% despite a decrease of 25% in testing. Qualitative interviews conducted virtually with community individuals and focus groups during that time period indicated that COVID-19 suggested clients were taking more risks due to feelings of isolation, depression and anxiety. NJCRI in collaboration with Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Somerset, NJ and five other community-based partners in NJ wanted to assess if offering community combination COVID-19 screening and HIV screenings during the pandemic would increase community screening for HIV. Methods CLIA Waived Screening for COVID-19 from two antigen assays, LumiraDx and BD Veritor was combined with a referenced laboratory based molecular screening from saliva Infinity Biologix under FDA emergency use authorization within CDC guidance with HIV Alere/Determine and INSTI in those individuals that identified as asymptomatic for COVID-19 but with high risk for HIV Results NJCRI began the COVID-19 and HIV rapid screening to clients on January 4, 2021.Clients tested for COVID-19 (N=274), 3% tested positive for HIV and &lt; 3% are self-reported HIV+ (94% of the sample tested negative for HIV). Overall, 92% of clients tested negative for COVID-19. Clients testing positive for COVID-19 (N=19), there was a 6% positivity rate utilizing COVID-19 Antigen by nasal swab. Those positive via COVID-19 Molecular (N=19) method, results indicate clients also tested positive 6% of the time using a saliva indicator. Approximately, 5% of the study sample are confirmed COVID-19 positives via both testing methods (separately 1% Antigen and &lt; 2% Molecular). 19% of the sample (N=3) tested positive for both HIV and COVID-19.

To date, grief-specific cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has mostly been delivered through individual face-to-face formats, while studies have shown that online treatment also yields promising results. Offering treatment online is now more than ever relevant during the pan demic and may offer important benefits compared with face-to-face CBT, such as lower costs and higher accessibility. Our expectation is that grief-specific online CBT is effective in reducing PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptoms. Objective Our aim is to evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness of grief-specific online CBT in reducing PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptom-levels for adults who lost a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method This study consists of two parts. In part 1, a two-armed (unguided online CBT versus waitlist controls) randomized controlled trial will be conducted. In part 2, a two-armed (guided online CBT versus unguided online CBT) controlled trial will be conducted. Symptoms of PCBD, PTSD, and depression will be assessed via telephone interviews at pre-treatment/pre-waiting period, post-treatment/post-waiting period, and six months post-treatment. Potential participants are people who lost a loved one at least three months earlier during the COVID-19 pandemic with clinically relevant levels of PCBD, PTSD, and/or depression. Analysis of covariance and multilevel modelling will be performed. Discussion This is one of the first studies examining the effectiveness of online grief-specific CBT. More research is needed before implementing online grief-specific CBT into clinical practice.

"Prevalence, Structure, and Risk Factors for Mental Disorders in Older People","This review focuses on assessing the prevalence and risk factors of mental disorders in older people in the modern era, including the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in PubMed, Elsevier, and Google using keywords over the past 10 years. Substantial discrepancy of data on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders has been shown in the elderly population. The significant incidence of mental disorders among nursing home residents is highlighted. The relevance of nonpsychotic depressive and anxiety disorders is demonstrated for the elderly, along with the difficulty of diagnosing mental disorders associated with physical pathology and cognitive impairments. The risk factors for mental disorders in older adults are socio-demographic but also economic, psychological, and physical. The problem of mental health of the elderly is characterized for the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic associated with specific risk factors for psychiatric disorders. The shortage of evidence-based research in the treatment of mental disorders in the elderly and the urgency to improve the organization of psychiatric care for such patients are noted. Understanding the structure and prevalence of mental disorders among the elderly will allow optimizing the functioning of healthcare systems.","Petrova, N. N.; Khvostikova, D.

A path analysis confirmed that teachers who appraised themselves as more susceptible to disease, experienced heightened levels of fear of COVID-19, which led to heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and hopelessness. Specifically, germ aversion and perceived infectability were separately associated with heightened fear of COVID-19, which in turn was associated with heightened anxiety.

"Der Suizid in der Polizeilichen Kriminalstatistik Suicide in the police crime statistics","Hintergrund und Ziel Obwohl der Suizid keinen Straftatbestand erfÃ¼llt und der Suizident weder Opfer noch TÃ¤ter im klassischen polizeilichen Sinne ist, sind Suizide Gegenstand polizeilicher Ermittlungen und werden mitunter in der Polizeilichen Kriminalstatistik (PKS) erfasst. Im Bundesland Bayern reichen verfÃ¼gbare Daten bis in das Jahr 1986 zurÃ¼ck. Die Auswertungen sollen Aufschluss geben Ã¼ber die Entwicklung der polizeilich registrierten Suizide, soziale Merkmale der Suizidenten sowie Ã¼ber Suizidmethoden und -auslÃ¶ser. Insbesondere wird betrachtet, inwieweit sich die ersten Monate der COVID-19-Pandemie auf die SuizidgefÃ¤hrdung ausgewirkt haben. Methoden Deskriptive statistische Analyse der vollendeten und versuchten Suizide anhand der bayerischen PKS der Jahre 1986â€“2020. Ergebnisse Die Zahl der Suizidtoten ist Ã¼ber die Jahrzehnte konstant rÃ¼cklÃ¤ufig. Diese positive Entwicklung hat auch im Berichtsjahr 2020 Bestand, das durch die weitreichenden Folgen der COVID-19-Pandemie gezeichnet ist. Der GroÃŸteil der Suizidenten ist mÃ¤nnlich und Ã¼ber 60Â Jahre alt. Als Suizidmethode dominiert das ErhÃ¤ngen. Als AuslÃ¶ser fÃ¼r den Suizid wird zumeist eine (psychische) Erkrankung ermittelt. Diskussion Die Gefahrenabwehr ist eine wichtige Aufgabe der Polizei. Polizeilich generierte Daten, Erfahrungswissen sowie Eingriffs- und EinflussmÃ¶glichkeiten der Polizei kÃ¶nnen zur Verhinderung von Suiziden beitragen.

"COVID-19-Induced Learning Disabilities and the Academic Experiences of US College Students","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 led to learning disruptions for most college students in the United States. These disruptions illuminated certain learning disabilities, which had varied effects on students' academic experiences. Our study reviewed the impact of the COVID-19-induced learning disabilities on student academic performance and enrollment. The findings reveal an uneven impact of the pandemic on specific groups of students. Some factors contributing to the observed impact on students' academic experiences are limited access to technological resources, transactional distance, mental health, economic and health shocks. Possible policy interventions must include addressing the inequities associated with access to educational resources, improving existing curricula to adapt to recent changes in the labor markets, and adopting measures to address student mental health issues.","Mannah-Blankson, Theresa, Asiseh, Fafanyo","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19-Induced+Learning+Disabilities+and+the+Academic+Experiences+of+U.S.+College+Students","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Insights into Learning Disabilities; 18(2):109-119, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23903,""

"Mental Health Treatment Disparities During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a decline in mental health status in the US, as well as reduced ability to seek mental health treatment. This study analyzed undertreatment of mental health during the pandemic to identify possible disparities and assess the need for interventions. Methods Data were collected from Wave 3 (January 6-February 15, 2021) of the US Census COVID-19 Household Pulse online survey, designed to measure the ongoing impact of the pandemic. Microdata files were downloaded from the Census website and included N=185,201 respondents. Data was collected in both English and Spanish and consisted of a representative sample of US residents. Data were analyzed using <U+03C7> 2 tests, with z-tests for more granular between-group comparisons. Results When asked if they needed and received therapy due to mental health concerns, 81% of respondents did not need therapy and did not receive it. Some (2%) reported receiving therapy but needing more. However, 9% reported needing therapy but not receiving it. A similar proportion, 9%, reported having received adequate therapy from a mental health professional. Those who needed therapy but did not receive it were more likely than adequately treated respondents to express debilitating worry, anxiety, depression, and lack of interest/pleasure in doing things (all p&lt; .05). These respondents were also more likely (vs. adequately treated respondents) to be younger, lower-income, racial/ethnic minorities, without health insurance, and food-insecure (all p&lt; .05). Conclusion Inadequate mental health treatment is a critical challenge, especially in the wake of COVID-19;Just as many respondents reported adequate mental health treatment as did needing additional mental health treatment. Respondents reporting undertreated mental health issues in this study were more likely to be vulnerable populations, many of whom have already been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Methods to expand accessible counseling capacity in economically feasible ways to limit these disparities should be further explored.

"Case SEries: Nasal Antimicrobial Photodisinfection (APDT) as Treatment Protocol for Asymptomatic and Early Stage COVID-19 Patients","Background Targeted reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the nose may mitigate the severity of lower tract respiratory disease as well as reduce hospitalization and mortality rates. Nasal Photodisinfection has been deployed for 10 years in Canadian hospitals reducing post-surgical infections. The objective of thiswork was to demonstrate effectiveness of APDT in early stage COVID-19 and asymptomatic carriers. Methods A cohort of 40 COVID-19 positive patients were treated with nasal photodisinfection (Steriwave) at a private clinic. All patients were previously identified by PCR as SARS-CoV-2 positive and admitted into the treatment cohort. BD rapid antigen nares testing was used before and after Photodisinfection treatment. Of the 40 patients, 13 were female and 27 were male. Age range was 9- 56 years of age. Treatment involved 3-4 applications of photosensitizer and 16-24 minutes per patient of treatment time. Patients were followed up within 24 hours, 48 hours as well as day 5 and 6 and day 10/11. Patients filled out a COVID-19 score card. Results Results demonstrated APDT was capable of significant and rapid viral load reduction in COVID-19 carriers. 100% of patients were converted from positive rapid antigen test to negative. 60% of patients reported fever resolution within 24 hours. Fever resolution occurred in 100% of patients within 48hours. Moreover, results demonstrated accelerated resolution of COVID-19 symptoms and significantly improved mental health benefits from reduction of COVID-19 related stress and anxiety. None of the patients experienced severe symptoms and no patients were hospitalized. Safety outcomes demonstrated no patient safety issues with only minor transient side effects (rhinorrhea, sneezing) observed. Moreover, the treatment procedure was pain-free and well tolerated by all patients. Conclusion Photodisinfection-based nasal decolonization anti-viral efficacy was demonstrated with improved outcomes for all patients treated in this case series. Significant rapid viral load reduction was confirmed by rapid antigen tests in all patients. More clinical studies are warranted in support of Photodisinfection based therapy for upper respiratory infections such as COVID-19.

"A Pedagogical Reflection on Counseling Skills in Asynchronous Learning Environments","The online environment provides a unique opportunity for students from wide-ranging locations to participate in academic activities to develop collegial abilities or vocational skills. The training process for working in the counseling field consists of graduate level learning pertaining to mental health issues, self-exploration, ethical and moral development, and reviewing contemporary research topics affecting diverse populations of people. Perhaps most importantly, it also involves developing the skill to be able to translate knowledge into a new counselor's skills and dispositional presentation. Since online courses are typically delivered in synchronous, asynchronous, or hybrid formats, it is reasonable to reflect on the differences experienced by students in skills-based courses and consider possible impacts the varied online learning environments could have on their development towards becoming counseling professionals. This reflection seeks to blend research and publication findings for counselor education in skills courses through the experiences of faculty and students exposed to varied learning environments utilizing the online format.","Kaufmann, Daniel, Smith, DNetra, Barnes, Janet, Lawrence, Joan, Young, Jennifer, Land, Christy, Guy, Tanisha, Krzewski, Elizabeth","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Pedagogical+Reflection+on+Counseling+Skills+in+Asynchronous+Learning+Environments","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Instructional Research; 10:47-57, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23907,""
"Increase in urgent care for patients with an eating disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Spanish province Incremento de la atenciÃ³n de urgencia para los pacientes con trastornos de la alimentaciÃ³n durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en una provincia espaÃ±ola","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on people's mental health. Patients with eating disorders (ED) are also highly sensitive to the pandemic situation due to their physical and mental health. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have had on the reasons for the urgent care of patients with an eating disorder, comparing the reasons for care with those from a previous period. Method We compared the visits to the emergency room and their characteristics before and after the pandemic of patients with an eating disorder in the province of Lleida. Information regarding sociodemographic status, reason for consultation, diagnosis, characteristics of suicidal behaviour, and other data were obtained from the electronic medical records. Results Within the total emergency attendances, eating disorders increased from 1.7% in the pre-pandemic period to 3.1% during the pandemic (pÂ =Â 0.030). Regarding the reason for consultation, a change in the pattern is observed, decreasing consultations for anxious decompensation (pÂ &lt;Â 0.001) and increasing suicidal behaviour (pÂ =Â 0.016) and behavioural disorder (pÂ =Â 0.022). Conclusions In our study we ascertained an increase in urgent care given to patients with an eating disorder during the two states of alarm, while consultations for anxiety symptoms decreased notably. However, care for suicidal behaviour increased, especially in women with comorbidity of personality disorders and who were unemployed.","Irigoyen-OtiÃ±ano, MarÃ­a, GonzÃ¡lez-Pinto, Ana, Llorca-BofÃ­, Vicent, Adrados-PÃ©rez, Marina, Arenas-Pijoan, Laura, Torterolo, Giovanni, SÃ¡nchez-Cazalilla, Marta, Buil, Esther, Nicolau-Subires, EugÃ¨nia, Albert-Porcar, Carla, Ibarra-Pertusa, LucÃ­a, Puigdevall-Ruestes, Margarita","https://www.google.com/search?q=Increase+in+urgent+care+for+patients+with+an+eating+disorder+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+a+Spanish+province+Incremento+de+la+atenciÃ³n+de+urgencia+para+los+pacientes+con+trastornos+de+la+alimentaciÃ³n+durante+la+pandemia+de+COVID-19+en+una+provincia+espaÃ±ola","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Revista de psiquiatria y salud mental;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23908,""
"Development and Implementation of Innovative Syringe Service Programs for Veterans in Rural and Urban Settings","Background Syringe Services Programs (SSPs) is one aspect of a comprehensive Harm Reduction approach necessary to reduce the transmission of blood borne infections including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) estimates that in 2019 that 595,000 veterans engage in opioid misuse with at least 57,000 veterans engaging in heroin. Stigmas to SSP are pervasive in the community and within the government system. Federal law prohibited the use of federal funds to purchase sterile needles or syringes for the purposes of illegal use of drugs by injection. It was officially clarified in May 24, 2021 that the prohibition to purchase syringes does not apply to Veterans Health Administration (VHA). While awaiting approximately 2 years to secure this clarification, syringes were obtained through a community donation. We aim to describe our process including difficulties encountered and data collected for SSP at two locations. Difficulties included developing an anonymous process to track quality, motivating providers to refer, educating highest risk veterans, providing face to face engagement during COVID-19 pandemic and ability to mail Harm Reduction kits containing sterile syringes. Illiana VA Program Information Sheet Orlando VA Program Information Sheet Methods Of the 140 facilities within VHA, there are currently only two SSPs established, Illiana VA and Orlando VA. A retrospective analysis of Harm Reduction benefits was performed among veterans who engaged with the two SSPs between 2018 to 2021. Orlando VA SSP Intake Process Map Process that veteran undergo when they engage with Orlando VA SSP Contents of Standard SSP Kit Distributed to Veterans at Orlando VA Results Approximately 3000 syringes were dispensed. Of the 17 veterans, 65% received syringes, 82% received naloxone, 100% engagement in mental health and 94% engagement in substance use disorder clinics. In total, 65% were screened for HIV, 82% for HCV and 29% for sexually transmitted infections. Conclusion These numbers, while modest, are notable, especially given the financial and organizational barriers that were in place. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted full implementation and outreach. With the recent, official clarification on syringe purchase and support for SSPs, the number of SSPs in the VA will grow, along with opportunity for more robust data collection. The experience of both facilities is a model for programs currently in development and moves us closer to ending the HIV epidemic by 2030.

"A Qualitative Review of Social Barriers Impeding Retention in HIV Care at a Ryan White Clinic","Background Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America aims to decrease new HIV diagnoses 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030. To achieve this, we identified patients unable to achieve viral suppression with social-behavioral needs deemed â€˜high-hanging fruit.â€™ Via extensive outreach efforts and creation of shared problem solving, we pursued the goals of rapid and effective treatment leading to viral suppression and prevention of HIV transmission. We (1) exhausted all avenues of outreach to re-engage patients in HIV care and (2) identified personal or social characteristics related to difficulties in visit retention and achieving viral suppression. Methods Of 446 Ryan White-eligible patients seen in an urban, academic medical center, 46 did not achieve and/or maintain viral suppression, and qualified for the study. We conducted a mixed methods survey comprised of both multiple choice and open-ended questions to ascertain what barriers patients face to continuous engagement in care and to achieving viral suppression. We developed a re-engagement outreach cycle which included: text messages and phone calls, electronic messages via patient portal or email, phone call to pharmacy to cross-check contact information, outreach to patientsâ€™ emergency contact, and sending a letter by mail. Results Of 46 participants, 32 were reached and 14 were not found. Sixteen re-engaged in care and of these, 14 completed the survey (see Figure). Those who completed the survey noted the following barriers to care: poor mental health, financial issues, problems committing to an appointment due to work/family/transportation, and COVID-19. Out of all 46 participants, the 14 who were not found had an overall a higher index of chaos. This index of chaos included, but was not limited to: homelessness, IV drug use, domestic violence, and stigma. Outreach to re-engage in HIV care A. Participants in study, B. Outreach outcomes, C. Common survey themes Conclusion Intensive efforts are required to re-engage patients, counsel on adherence, and achieve viral suppression.

"Seattle Children's Virtual Research Training Program: Pivoting to Remote Science Education for High School Students","Seattle Children's Research Institute has built a series of in-person education programs to inspire and empower students to explore futures in biomedical research and healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic prevented us from offering an in-person laboratory program, forcing a rapid pivot to an online format. The Virtual Research Training Program (VRTP) was a one-week summer experience for high school students, including students from groups that are under-represented in STEM. The curriculum introduced topics such as biochemistry, immunology and immunotherapy, and global and public health. Also included were laboratory demonstrations to emphasize cutting-edge applications for healthcare and discussions regarding college and career preparation. Key challenges included converting the in-person curriculum into a digestible virtual format, becoming proficient with the technology to provide for a seamless end-user experience with equitable access, and establishing quantifiable metrics for evaluation. Students reported statistically significant gains with large effect sizes in knowledge about science concepts and laboratory procedures, and in preparation for college and future STEM careers. Students were also engaged by asking questions, indicating their active participation despite the online environment.

"Stress and depression in undergraduate students during the COVID-19 pandemic: Nursing students compared to undergraduate students in non-nursing majors","Background The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated an already alarming mental health crisis on college campuses. Nursing students were uniquely impacted through the loss of clinical practicum experiences. Purpose The purpose of this study was to explore relationships between student perceptions of life-stress and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in nursing students compared to students in other academic disciplines. A secondary purpose of this study was to understand nursing student perceptions of how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their educational experience. Methods School-related life stress and depression measures were studied in a cross-section of 2326 undergraduate students using an anonymous online survey. Follow-up qualitative data were collected (NÂ =Â 12) to further explore relationships between school-related life stress and depression in nursing students. Results Nursing students had higher levels of student-life stress but fewer depressive symptoms than students in any other academic major. Students related that social support and belongingness were critical to their academic perseverance. Conclusions Differences between nursing and non-nursing students are likely due to a multifactorial combination of social support, resilience, and posttraumatic growth.","Black Thomas, Lisa M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Stress+and+depression+in+undergraduate+students+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+Nursing+students+compared+to+undergraduate+students+in+non-nursing+majors","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Journal of professional nursing : official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23913,""
"Pediatric Long Haul Post COVID-19: Is New Jerseyâ€™s Experience Different?","Background COVID-19 impacted nearly 4 million children, accounting for 14% of total cases in the US, 1.3-3.2% of total reported hospitalizations and less than 1% deaths attributed to COVID-19. Many studies report persistent symptoms in adults several months after acute COVID-19. Similar findings have been reported from a small cohort of children in Italy. To date there are no studies reviewing long haul symptoms in children in the US. Methods With the goal of defining long haul in pediatric population, and providing comprehensive care to these patients, RWJBarnabasHealth launched a post-COVID CARE program in October 2020 for children. The program has provided care for approximately 16 patients with COVID related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and 48 pediatric patients with COVID. The goal of the Pediatric Post-COVID CARE program was to provide a multidisciplinary approach for children ages 0-21 years impacted with COVID-19. This included patients who experienced ongoing symptoms &gt;4 weeks from initial COVID-19 illness. All children were assessed by a pediatric infectious disease physician and triaged to appropriate subspecialties, all part of the long-haul care team. In addition, physical therapy and psychology support services were provided to facilitate return to normalcy. Results To date, our program has evaluated 64 patients. 28% experienced at least 1 symptom 4 weeks after acute COVID-19. Median age was 14 years and 77.8% were female. The follow-up study was conducted from October 2020 to May 2021. Data was collected 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post discharge or initial evaluation in clinic. 28% of patients were antibody positive, 55.6% experienced fatigue, 50% experienced shortness of breath or cough, 50% experienced â€˜brain fogâ€™,33% chest pain and 44.4% experienced anxiety and/or depression. Conclusion Early identification of patients and comprehensive protocols may facilitate return to normalcy for children with lingering somatic symptoms worsened by impact of social isolation, economic stresses, lost parental jobs, and food insecurity among many other contributing factors. Further research is needed to determine why children of certain ethnicities are impacted differently.

"The role of extraversion and neuroticism for experiencing stress during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","Although long postulated, it has been scarcely researched how personality traits play out differently in distinct situations. We examined if Neuroticism and Extraversion, personality traits known to moderate stress processes, function differently in highly stressful situations requiring reduced social contact, that is, the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on past findings, we expected neuroticism to be associated with exacerbated perceptions of stress. In contrast to past findings, we expected extraversion, which usually ameliorates stress, to be associated with intensified perceptions of stress, especially in regard to the sociability facet. During the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, one-hundred-thirty adults (age M = 21.7Â years) reported on their personality traits including their facets with the BFI-2, COVID-19-related stressors, and their perceived stress during the last month (using the PSS). Findings indicated that neuroticism was associated with higher perceived stress regardless of the COVID-19-related stressors experienced. Facet level analysis revealed differences for anxiety, depression, and volatility. Importantly, trait extraversion was unassociated with stress experiences, whereas specifically the facet of sociability was associated with higher perceived stress. Also, the facets of assertiveness and energy both moderated the relationship between COVID-19-related stressors and perceived stress. In line with the transactional theory of stress, our findings indicate that perceptions of stress were best understood by looking at the interaction of environmental stressors and personality differences. Furthermore, the study substantiates that facets of personality traits offer unique information beyond broad traits in specific contexts.","Bellingtier, Jennifer A.; Mund, Marcus, Wrzus, Cornelia","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+role+of+extraversion+and+neuroticism+for+experiencing+stress+during+the+third+wave+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Current psychology (New Brunswick, N.J.);: 1-11, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23915,""
"Strategies to aid self-isolation and quarantine for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review","Background Individuals with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than individuals without SPMI. In combination with physical distancing, hygiene protocols, and vaccines, quarantine and self-isolation are primary means of viral containment. However, individuals with SPMI may experience more difficulties with mandated quarantine or self-isolation because of their illness(es), stigma, and marginalization. To date, there is a lack of consensus on strategies that could aid such individuals in completing isolation. Aim This review aimed to synthesize evidence for interventions to support self-isolation and mandated quarantine for COVID-19 among individuals with SPMIs. Methods We followed the PRISMA guidelines, searching 19 electronic databases (9 published literature registries and 10 gray literature sources). We looked for relevant randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and program evaluations of the effectiveness of relevant psychosocial, pharmacological, harm reduction, and addiction management strategies to support isolation settings or quarantine requirements for individuals with any SPMI (e.g., any mental disorder, substance use disorder, or their combination). Findings Of 10,298 total records that were located, 5582 were duplicate citations. Upon screening the remaining 4716 unique records by title and , we excluded a further 3562 records. Only one original article met our inclusion criteria after reviewing the full texts of the remaining 1154 citations. To support individuals experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic, San Francisco developed an isolation hotel that reduced COVID-19 hospital strain for 1009 participants (25% had a mental health disorder and 26% had a substance use disorder). While 81% completed their hotel stay, 48 patients had behavioral health needs that exceeded the hotel's capabilities. No other studies met our review's eligibility criteria. Most articles located by the search simply proposed solutions or discussed the challenges brought by COVID-19 for people with SPMIs. While some documents went a step further (e.g., shelter guidance documents to support individuals experiencing homelessness), these rarely addressed individuals with SPMIs directly. Conclusions This systematic review evaluated evidence from published and gray literature on interventions to support self-isolation and mandated COVID-19 quarantine for individuals with SPMIs. Only one study met our inclusion criteria. This study found a beneficial effect of a dedicated isolation hotel for individuals experiencing homelessness and COVID-19â€”where approximately 25%â€“50% of the study sample had a mental or substance use disorder. While there has been an abundance of COVID-19 protocols in general, information for SPMIs is lacking. As the pandemic continues and we better prepare for future pandemics, developing protocols for supporting SPMIs in this context is imperative.

"Dental Students' Perspectives on the Implementation and Effectiveness of Online Learning Due to COVID-19 Pandemic: A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study in Bulgaria","Purpose: As dental education was significantly influenced by the novel coronavirus pandemic, this study aims to investigate preclinical dental students' perspectives on the implementation of remote education and school closure due to COVID-19 pandemic, self-reported effectiveness of on-line learning as well as their educational and personal experiences. Method: A self-administered questionnaire was posted online to a total of 258 out of 516 second and third-year preclinical dental students in Dec 2020/Jan 2021 at Faculty of Dental Medicine, Medical University-Sofia, Bulgaria. Survey items focused on 3 general domains: student attitude, assessment, and concerns regarding online learning;student current knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 pandemic and student opinion of pandemic psychological impact on public health, personal experiences and intention for vaccination. Findings: One-hundred and sixty-nine students responded to the survey (response rate 65.5%). Most of them (70.4%) approved suspension of face-to-face classes due to the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent expressed dissatisfaction toward online teaching sessions and agreed that this will have negative effects on their education. Fifty-eight percent did not find remote education more stressful than in-person training. More concerns were expressed about financial issues than mental health problems. Intention for getting vaccinated was expressed by 53.3% and 40.8% thought that the vaccine would cause many side health effects. Implications for research and practice: Within the limitations of the study, identified gaps in online education could help increase effectiveness of learning environment and create opportunity to enhance education for the future. Dental student thoughts about COVID-19 vaccinations provide valuable information to administrators, public health professionals and policy makers to improve efforts towards preserving, protecting, and promoting public health.","Avramova, Nadya, Mihaylova, Ivanka, Yaneva-Ribagina, Krassimira, Bonev, Boyko, Nenov, Stanislav","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dental+Students'+Perspectives+on+the+Implementation+and+Effectiveness+of+Online+Learning+Due+to+COVID-19+Pandemic:+A+Descriptive+Cross-Sectional+Study+in+Bulgaria","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Advanced Education;: 109-118, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23917,""
"A social virus: Intergroup dehumanization and unwillingness to aid amidst COVID-19 - Who are the main targets?<U+2606>","Previous studies have shown that external threats, such as financial crises and natural disasters, might fuel negative attitudes, emotions, and behaviors towards outgroup members. However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility. The first is the â€œultimate scapegoatâ€ outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the ""context-dependent"" outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted. Results from our study (NÂ =Â 664), conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat, exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises.","Adler, Eli, Hebel-Sela, Shira, Leshem, Oded Adomi, Levy, Jonathan, Halperin, Eran","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+social+virus:+Intergroup+dehumanization+and+unwillingness+to+aid+amidst+COVID-19+-+Who+are+the+main+targets?<U+2606>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: International journal of intercultural relations : IJIR; 86:109-121, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23918,""
"Psychosocial Challenges in Palliative Care: Bridging the Gaps Using Digital Health","Psychosocial health is a major palliative care concern globally. Patients and caregivers engaged in palliative care may experience deteriorated mental and social health conditions. Global evidence informs a high burden of depression, anxiety, psychological distress and other mental health problems among the palliative care populations. Those challenges aggravate the preexisting palliative care issues, such as lack of access and suboptimal quality of care. Palliative caregiving, both in the institutional and community settings, should be strengthened, incorporating psychosocial support for the patients and their caregivers. The recent advancements in digital health technologies have shown promising impacts in facilitating health communication, decision-making and delivering psychosocial interventions using digital devices and platforms. Adopting evidence-based interventions can help the users to access mental health resources and communicate with each other to promote shared decision-making and management of health problems. Health-care organisations and systems may explore opportunities to advance psychosocial care using digital technologies. Leveraging advanced technologies in palliative caregiving may require multifaceted research exploring potential barriers and opportunities at the user, institutional and systems levels. Nonetheless, palliative care policies and health systems measures should be strengthened to develop and implement digital support systems that may improve psychosocial health and overall palliative care outcome.","Sultana, Abida, Tasnim, Samia, Sharma, Rachit, Pawar, Priyanka, Bhattcharya, Sudip, Hossain, Md Mahbub","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychosocial+Challenges+in+Palliative+Care:+Bridging+the+Gaps+Using+Digital+Health","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Indian journal of palliative care; 27(3):442-447, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23919,""
"Training LEADers to Accelerate Global Mental Health Disparities Research (LEAD) Program: A Research Training Program Protocol","Background: There is a critical need to address mental health needs across the globe, especially in low and middle-income countries where mental health disparities are pervasive, including among children. The global mental health disparities suggest an imperative for culturally and contextually-congruent mental health services models that expand upon the existing services and interventions for these groups. Rigorous research is a key tool in providing the scientific evidence to inform public policy and practice efforts to effectively address these needs. Yet, there is a limited number of researchers, especially those from diverse backgrounds, who study these issues. In this paper, we describe the â€œTrainingLEADers to Accelerate Global Mental Health Disparities Researchâ€ (LEAD) program, a research training program funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and focused on global mental health disparities research for early career researchers from under-represented minority groups. Methods: The LEAD program is designed as a two-phase training program for advanced pre-doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty from diverse backgrounds in the U.S., including groups underrepresented in biomedical, behavioral, clinical and social sciences research, interested in global mental health disparities research. Trainees are matched with mentors and participate in an intensive 12-week program. Discussion: The LEAD program seeks to provide a robust platform for the development, implementation and expansion of evidence-based culturally and contextually-congruent interventions and services models addressing global mental health disparities across the life cycle, especially in low-resource communities in the global context. By producing a sustainable network of well-trained investigators from underrepresented backgrounds, LEAD will potentially contribute to the shared lessons and efforts relevant to addressing global mental health disparities and improving care for vulnerable populations in low-resource settings.","Sensoy Bahar, Ozge, Cavazos-Rehg, Patricia, Ssewamala, Fred M.; Abente, Betsy, Peer, Laura, Nabunya, Proscovia, Soto de Laurido, Lourdes E.; Betancourt, Theresa S.; Bhana, Arvin, Edmond, Tonya","https://www.google.com/search?q=Training+LEADers+to+Accelerate+Global+Mental+Health+Disparities+Research+(LEAD)+Program:+A+Research+Training+Program+Protocol","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Frontiers in public health; 9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23920,""
"Level of resilience in nurses working at COVID-19 referral centers in Iran","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led many healthcare systems to become overwhelmed, and caused many frontline providers to feel fatigued and exhausted and experience severe emotional trauma. Nurses are the largest group of the world's frontline providers and it is clear that their resilience to threatening factors is critical in the current crisis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the level of resilience in nurses working in COVID-19 centers in Iran. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 250 nurses working at three COVID-19 centers in northwest Iran. The participants were recruited using simple random sampling. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was used to collect the data. The highest level of resilience was related to spiritual influences, while the lowest was the trust in their instincts and tolerance of negative emotions. Furthermore, the level of resilience was significantly higher in nurses with better family support (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Given the role of resilience in nurses' mental health, it is vital to support the nursing staff in critical situations and improve their resilience by focusing particularly on psychological and spiritual support.","Parizad, Soheili, Powers, Mohebbi, Moghbeli, Hosseingolipour","https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12685","20211215","COVID-19; Iran; nurse; resilience; spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23921,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and the health of people who use illicit opioids in New York City, the first 12 months","Concurrent opioid-related overdose and COVID-19 crises in the U.S. have imposed unprecedented challenges on people who use illicit opioids. Using the experiences of 324 people who use illicit opioids between April 2020 and March 2021, we examined four domains of health and well-being potentially impacted by COVID-19: drug risks and responses, healthcare and related services, material hardship, and mental health. Data were drawn from participants' completed monthly survey assessments which were grouped into four periods of interest for the unfolding pandemic: April-June 2020, July-October 2020, November-January 2021, and February-March 2021. A majority of measures in our four domains showed early COVID-19 related impacts, which quickly diminished as people and agencies responded to the pandemic. Difficulty obtaining food was the most frequently reported material hardship and appeared worst in April-June 2020. Over half of the population reported depression in April-June 2020, but this declined over the study period. Some participants reported changes to the heroin supply, including higher prices, lower quality, difficulty finding the drug, and fentanyl contamination. There was no discernable temporal shift in the frequency of use of each substance or the frequency of withdrawal symptoms. Over the study period, the mean number of overdoses per month decreased while the percent of opioid use events at which both a witness and naloxone were present (i.e., protected events) increased. Most participants receiving MOUD experienced an increase in take-home doses. Findings speak to the resilience of people who use drugs as a population with disproportionate experience of trauma and crisis and also to the rapid response of NYC health agencies and service providers working with this population. Despite evident signs of adaptability and resilience, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted some of the unique vulnerabilities of people who use illicit opioids and the need for greater rates of ""protected"" opioid use and greater availability of wrap-around services to efficiently address the safety, food security, mental health, and treatment needs of the population.","Bennett, Townsend, Elliott","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103554","20211215","COVID-19; Drug use; Naloxone; Opioids; Overdose","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23922,""
"Depression, anxiety, and happiness in dog owners and potential dog owners during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","Major life events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affect psychological and physiological health. Social support, or the lack thereof, can modulate these effects. The context of the COVID-19 pandemic offered a unique opportunity to better understand how dogs may provide social support for their owners and buffer heightened symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression and contribute to happiness during a major global crisis. Participants (768 pet dog owners and 767 potential pet dog owners) answered an online survey, including validated depression, anxiety, happiness psychometric scales, attitude to and commitment towards pet, and perceived social support. Potential pet dog owners were defined as individuals who did not own a dog at the time of the survey but would be very or extremely interested in owning one in the future. Dog owners reported having significantly more social support available to them compared to potential dog owners, and their depression scores were also lower, compared to potential dog owners. There were no differences in anxiety and happiness scores between the two groups. Dog owners had a significantly more positive attitude towards and commitment to pets. Taken together, our results suggest that dog ownership may have provided people with a stronger sense of social support, which in turn may have helped buffer some of the negative psychological impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Martin, Bachert, Snow, Tu, Belahbib, Lyn","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260676","20211215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23923,""
"Depression and anxiety symptoms and perceived stress in health professionals in the context of COVID-19: Do adverse childhood experiences have a modulating effect?","Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) have a great impact on mental health outcomes of adults. However, little is known whether ACE may act as modulators of the mental health of health professionals caring for patients with COVID-19. Data were collected through an online cross-sectional survey administered to health professionals in Lima (Peru) between May and July 2020. The survey included standardized self-assessment instruments for anxiety, depression, acute stress (AS) and history of ACE. A total of 542 health professionals completed the survey. Caring for patients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression and anxiety and when caring for patients with COVID-19 was combined with a history of early sexual abuse, its effect on the risk of anxiety increased (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.71, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .010). Mental health problems were associated with female gender in almost all the analyses and with the majority of ACEs. Health workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic presented a high risk of mental health disorders. Antecedents of sexual abuse acted as a potentiating factor of anxiety in professionals providing COVID-19 care. These findings suggest that the burden of ACE modulates mental health problems in health professionals during the pandemic.","FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Arana, OlÃƒÂ³rtegui-YzÃƒÂº, Vega-Dienstmaier, Cuesta","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2452","20211215","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; adverse childhood experiences; anxiety; depression; health professionals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23924,""
"Frequency and factors associated with foregone and delayed medical care due to COVID-19 among nonelderly US adults from August to December 2020","To estimate the frequency and factors associated with foregone and delayed medical care attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic among nonelderly adults from August to December 2020 in the United States. We used three survey waves from the Urban Institute's Household Pulse Survey (HPS) collected between August 19-31, October 14-26Ã‚Â and December 9-21. The final sample included 155,825 nonelderly (18-64) respondents representing 135,835,598 million individuals in the United States. We used two multivariable logistic regressions to estimate the association between respondents' characteristics and foregone and delayed care. The frequency of foregone and delayed medical care was 26.9% and 35.9%, respectively. Around 60% of respondents reported difficulties in paying for usual household expenses in the last 7 days. More than half reported several days of mental health issues. The regression results indicated that foregone or delayed care were significantly associated with difficulties in paying usual household expenses (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), worse self-reported health status (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), increased mental health problems (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), Veterans Affairs (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;0.001) or Medicaid (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) coverage compared to private healthcare coverage, and older age groups. Individuals who participated in the latter two waves of the survey (October, December) were less likely to report foregone and delayed care compared to those who participated in Wave 1 (August). Overall, the frequency of foregone and delayed medical care remained high from August to December 2020 among nonelderly US adults. Our findings highlight that pandemic-induced access barriers are major drivers of reduced healthcare provision during the second half of the pandemic and highlight the need for policies to support patients in seeking timely care.","Giannouchos, Brooks, Andreyeva, Ukert","https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13645","20211215","delayed care; foregone care; healthcare access; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23925,""
"Symptoms and quality of life at 1-year follow up of patients discharged after an acute COVID-19 episode","Patients surviving COVID-19 have been described as being at risk of developing sequelae. We aimed to investigate and elicit persistent symptoms, emotional status and quality-of-life in patients discharged after an acute COVID-19 episode. Patient-reported outcome measures were collected during a telephone interview 30 days and 1 year after discharge. Patients' general health status was evaluated using questions based on their symptoms, emotional status was assessed using the items 9 to 12 of the HeartQoL questionnaire and quality of life was assessed at 1 year through the EQ-5D-5L. In patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, all 14 items of the HeartQoL questionnaire were completed to derive the HeartQoL global score. Among 687 patients who survived after being hospitalised for COVID-19 at the University Hospitals of Geneva between 26 February and 26 April 2020, 184 (27%) and 165 (24%), respectively, participated in the follow-up at 30 days and 1 year. Of these 184 participants, 62% were male, median age was 58 years and 21% had a past medical history of cardiovascular disease. At one month after discharge, 61% (113/184) of patients presented fatigue and 28% (52/184) dyspnoea. One year after discharge, the main complaints were persistent fatigue in 27% (45/165) of patients, neurological problems in 17% (28/165) and dyspnoea in 14% (23/165). Eight percent (14/184) of patients declared being significantly worried 1 month after discharge and 5% (9/184) feeling depressed. The number of patients reporting being significantly worried or depressed at 1 year was lower. Regarding the quality of life at 1 year, the median EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale score was 80 (interquartile range 70-90).

"Perception of mental health and professional quality of life in Tunisian doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic: a descriptive cross-sectional study","few research studies about mental health problems in medical staff during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported. The Aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of anxiety and insomnia, affecting the professional quality of life of physicians during COVID-19 pandemic. doctors answered an online questionnaire regarding their perception of insomnia, anxiety and professional quality of life during COVID-19 pandemic with psychological parameters including the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Professional quality of life version 5 (ProQOL5). anxiety was found in 64.8% of the participants. This disorder was respectively moderate and severe in 12.4% and 6.7% of cases. Insomnia was found in 51.4% of respondents, 29.5% of whom worked in the COVID circuit (p=0.17). Insomnia was assessed as mild, moderate and severe in respectively 38.1%, 11.4% and 1.9% of cases. Compassion satisfaction was moderate in 72.4 of cases and high in 24.8% of cases. The entire population with low CS belonged to the 20-29 age group (p=0.019). Compassion satisfaction was statistically higher in married people (32.7%) (p=0.004). This entity varied significantly with occupational grade (p=0.003), seniority in grade (p=0.011) and working in the private health sector (p=0.046).

"Online Gaming and Prolonged Self-Isolation: Evidence from Italian Gamers During the Covid-19 Outbreak","The self-isolation measures employed during the COVID-19 pandemic made it dificult for basic needs to be met, thus increasing emotional distress. It has been suggested that socially meaningful online gaming bufered emotional distress during the lockdown. This study aimed to test the protective effect of online gaming during the lockdown and to investigate the diferences between highly involved gamers (those who play videogames intensely without adverse consequences) and problematic gamers in this regard. Capitalizing on a data collection that started before the pandemic, we adopted a cross-sectional between-groups study design in which gaming patterns, gaming-related variables and levels of emotional distress were compared between a pre-COVID group (N=298) and a COVID group (N=366). Compared to the pre-COVID group, high involvement in gaming was more prominent and emotional distress was decreased in the COVID group. Moderated regression analyses further revealed that the interaction between social compensation via gaming and highly involved gaming was associated with lower levels of emotional distress in the COVID-19 group. In contrast, the interaction between gaming-related relaxation and problematic gaming predicted higher emotional distress in the COVID-19 group. This study suggests that gaming for social compensation might mitigate the experienced emotional distress during pandemic related self-isolation, whereas maladaptive gaming patterns could constitute a vulnerability factor deserving clinical attention.","Giardina, Di Blasi, Schimmenti, King, Starcevic, Billieux","https://doi.org/10.36131/cnfioritieditore20210106","20211215","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; emotional distress; online gaming; problematic gaming","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23928,""
"Ect in Two Elderly Patients with Covid-19: Weighing Up Unknown Risks in Unprecedented Times","The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented situation demanding a rapid response to a barrage of unknown risks. Issues around infection control, resource allocation and treatment delivery have threatened the viability and accessibility of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) services. Additionally, there are unquantified risks around the delivery and effect of ECT in patients who have had COVID-19. We discuss two cases where ECT was restarted in older-adults who had had symptomatic COVID-19. We consider the importance of clinical assessment, multi-speciality team involvement, and comprehensive risk assessment in making high stakes treatment decisions around ECT in patients with COVID-19. Although more research and international multi-speciality collaboration is required to develop evidence-based guidance, it is vital that we maintain equitable access to safe, effective and potentially life-saving ECT during this pandemic.","McCarron, Rathee, Yang, Thavachelvi","https://doi.org/10.36131/cnfioritieditore20200506","20211215","COVID-19; ECT; older peoples mental health; pulmonary embolism; risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23929,""

"Depression Among HIV-Positive Pregnant Women at Northwest Amhara Referral Hospitals During COVID-19 Pandemic","Depression is the most common mental health disorder among HIV-positive pregnant mothers, which increases mortality, poor quality of life; it also increases the burden of disease. Depression hurts birth outcomes and maternal health. To assess depression and its associated factors among HIV-positive pregnant women attending antenatal care at Northwest Amhara referral hospitals, 2021. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 291 HIV-positive pregnant mothers from March 15, 2021 to April 30, 2021 at Northwest Amhara referral hospitals. Census was applied to reach the study participants. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. A binary logistic regression was conducted to see the relationship between dependent variables and independent. Those variables having a p-value of Ã¢â€°Â¤0.05 were found to be statistically associated with the response. Depression among HIV-positive pregnant women was found to be 28.7% [95% CI (24.8-33.40)] with a response rate of 96.04. Age Ã¢â€°Â¥30 years [AOR = 1.32, 95% CI (1.24-3.35)], urban residency [AOR = 1.76, 95% CI (1.57-4.61)], having first pregnancy &lt;18 years [AOR = 3.82, 95% CI (1.54-17.34)], known HIV serostatus during pregnancy [AOR = 1.29, 95% CI (1.08-2.47)], and COVID-19-related knowledge [AOR = 0.32, 95% CI (0.12-1.12) were significantly associated with depression. Nearly one-third of the pregnant women attending antenatal care were depressed. The age of the mother, residence, known HIV serostatus during pregnancy, age in the first pregnancy, and COVID-19-related knowledge were significantly associated with depression, and strengthening the existing care provided was the recalled interventions to combat antenatal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Abate, Mekonnen, Ferede","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S320311","20211215","COVID-19; Ethiopia; HIV positive mothers; depression; pregnancy; prevalence; referral hospitals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23931,""
"The Contribution of Psychological Distress to Resting Palpitations in Patients Who Recovered from Severe COVID-19","Increasing numbers of patients have recovered from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. This study aimed to evaluate the association of psychological distress with resting palpitations in recovered patients. In this prospective cohort study, consecutive patients who recovered from severe COVID-19 and complained of resting palpitations were included. Dynamic electrocardiogram (ECG) was continuously monitored for 2 hours while patients were at rest. A survey using a palpitation frequency scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered to all participants. Of the 289 consecutive patients who recovered from severe COVID-19, 24 patients (8.3%) suffered resting palpitation symptoms, and 22 patients were finally included. Two-hour Holter monitoring showed that 18 (81.8%) patients had tachyarrhythmias, of which the most common was sinus tachycardia (17/22, 77.3%). However, patients with sinus tachycardia showed a similar frequency of palpitation episodes compared to those without sinus tachycardia. Anxiety (68.2%) and depression (59.1%) were prevalent among these recovered patients. Patients with anxiety or depression symptoms had a higher frequency of palpitation episodes than those without anxiety or depression symptoms. In addition, both the HADS-anxiety score (<i>r</i> =0.609, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01) and HADS-depression score (<i>r</i> =0.516, <i>P</i>=0.01) were positively related to the frequency of palpitation episodes. Symptoms of resting palpitations, manifested mainly by sinus tachycardia, are not uncommon in patients who recovered from severe COVID-19. Psychological distress (anxiety and depression) may be responsible, at least in part, for resting palpitation symptoms.","Huang, Yan, Hu, Cao, Wang, Meng, Li, Liu, Wang, Le, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S334715","20211215","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; palpitations; sinus tachycardia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23932,""
"Scientists, presidents, and pandemics-comparing the science-politics nexus during the Zika virus and COVID-19 outbreaks","We investigate how beliefs about scientists and presidents affect views about two pandemics, Zika virus (2016) and COVID-19 (2020). Three New Hampshire surveys in 2016 and 2020 provide data to test how beliefs about scientists' practices and presidential approval relate to pandemic views. Support for presidents consistently predicts perceptions of scientists' integrity and trust in science agencies for information, but the directionality changes from 2016 to 2020-increased trust among Obama-supporters; decreased trust among Trump-supporters. Respondents who believe scientists lack objectivity are also less likely to trust science agencies during both Zika and COVID-19 and are less apt to be confident in the government's response in 2016. Assessments of pandemic responses become increasingly political during 2020; most notably, support for President Trump strongly predicts confidence in the government's efforts. Results highlight how beliefs about scientists' practices and presidents are central to the science-politics nexus during pandemics.","Safford, Whitmore, Hamilton","https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.13084","20211215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23933,""
"Overdose deaths and the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia, Canada","British Columbia (BC) declared an overdose public health emergency in 2016. Since then, BC has consistently reported the highest overdose death rates of any province in Canada. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose deaths in BC reached a record high in 2020. This analysis reports on changes in the profile of people who have died of overdose since BC's declaration of COVID-19 as a public health emergency on 17 March 2020. Using BC Coroners Service data, Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression were conducted to compare demographic, geographic and post-mortem toxicology data between people who died of overdose before (17 March-31 December 2019) and after (17 March-31 December 2020) BC's declaration of COVID-19 as a public health emergency. Overdose deaths observed since 17 March 2020 (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°1516) more than doubled those observed in the same period in 2019 (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°744). In the adjusted logistic regression model, odds of death in the post compared to pre-COVID-19 period was significantly higher among males compared to females, among all older age groups compared to people aged 30-39, and was lower in public buildings compared to private residences. Alongside a significant increase in overdose deaths since BC's declaration of COVID-19 as a public health emergency, the demographic profile of people who have died of overdose has changed. Ongoing overdose prevention efforts in BC must seek to reach people who remain most isolated, including older adults, who during dual public health emergencies are facing compounded risk of preventable mortality.","Palis, BÃƒÂ©lair, Hu, Tu, Buxton, Slaunwhite","https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13424","20211215","COVID-19; drug toxicity; overdose; overdose death; public health emergency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23934,""
"Parental burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic","Increased and long-term parental stress related to one's parental role can lead to parental burnout. In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, families experienced intensified pressure due to the government-initiated contact restrictions applied to prevent the spread of the virus in the population. This study investigates the risk factors and predictors of parental burnout in a large sample of parents (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1488) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. Demographic and psychosocial factors were assessed at two timepoints: at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak in March 2020 (T1) and at 3Ã‚Â months follow-up (T2). A hierarchical regression analysis was applied to identify the factors that contribute to parental burnout at T2. Parental burnout was additionally explored across subgroups. Findings revealed that younger age was associated with more parental burnout. Concurrent (T2) use of unhelpful coping strategies, insomnia symptoms, parental stress, and less parental satisfaction was significantly associated with the presence of greater parental burnout (T2). Additionally, parental stress and satisfaction measured in the earliest phase of the pandemic (T1) were associated with parental burnout 3Ã‚Â months later (T2) over and above concurrent parental stress/satisfaction. Unemployed parents and individuals with a mental health condition were identified as subgroups with substantially heightened levels of parental burnout. El estrÃƒÂ©s cada vez mayor y a largo plazo relacionado con el papel que desempeÃƒÂ±an los padres puede conducir al agotamiento parental. En la primera fase de la pandemia de la COVID-19, las familias sufrieron cada vez mÃƒÂ¡s presiÃƒÂ³n debido a las restricciones en el contacto iniciadas por el gobierno que se aplicaron para prevenir la propagaciÃƒÂ³n del virus en la poblaciÃƒÂ³n. En este estudio se investigan los factores de riesgo y los factores pronÃƒÂ³sticos del agotamiento parental en una muestra grande de padres (N = 1488) durante la pandemia de la COVID-19 en Noruega. Se evaluaron factores demogrÃƒÂ¡ficos y psicosociales en dos intervalos de tiempo: al comienzo de la pandemia en marzo de 2020 (primera fase) y tres meses despuÃƒÂ©s (segunda fase). Se aplicÃƒÂ³ un anÃƒÂ¡lisis de regresiÃƒÂ³n jerÃƒÂ¡rquica para identificar los factores que contribuyen al agotamiento de los padres en la segunda fase. AdemÃƒÂ¡s, se analizÃƒÂ³ el agotamiento de los padres entre subgrupos. Los resultados revelaron que las edades mÃƒÂ¡s jÃƒÂ³venes estuvieron asociadas con un mayor agotamiento parental. El uso simultÃƒÂ¡neo (en la segunda fase) de estrategias de afrontamiento poco ÃƒÂºtiles, los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de insomnio, el estrÃƒÂ©s de los padres y una menor satisfacciÃƒÂ³n de los padres estuvieron asociados significativamente con la presencia de un mayor agotamiento de los padres (segunda fase). AdemÃƒÂ¡s, el estrÃƒÂ©s y la satisfacciÃƒÂ³n de los padres medidos en la fase inicial de la pandemia (primera fase) estuvieron asociados con el agotamiento de los padres tres meses despuÃƒÂ©s (segunda fase) por encima del estrÃƒÂ©s y la satisfacciÃƒÂ³n simultÃƒÂ¡neos de los padres. Los padres y las personas desempleadas con una enfermedad de salud mental se identificaron como subgrupos con niveles considerablemente elevados de agotamiento parental.

"PERSPECTIVE: A Mental Health Services Research Agenda in the Era of COVID-19: Steadfast Commitment to Addressing Evolving Challenges","Decades of research that predate the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate that most people with mental health needs are not receiving adequate care. The inequities between those who need care and those who receive adequate care are larger for racial and ethnic minority groups and people living in underserved communities. The pandemic is associated with an exacerbation of these inequities, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality for the most vulnerable populations. This Perspective summarizes longstanding and evolving challenges to the provision of high quality care for people with mental illness, describes the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) commitment to addressing those challenges, and embeds salient research priorities most germane to the health policy readership of this journal. Example funding announcements and extant funding priorities are highlighted to demonstrate NIMH's commitment to health services research during the pandemic. The collaborative care model is presented as an evidence-supported service delivery model that could be delivered via telehealth. Recent studies that compare the utilization of routine telehealth services during the pandemic, when compared to in-person services pre-pandemic, are summarized. In FY2020, NIMH invested $171,194,275 in health services research. Over the past two years, NIMH led or participated on dozens of funding announcements that call for mental health services research to help improve the provision of care for people with mental illness. Service delivery models like collaborative care can offer effective intervention via telehealth. The practice community can deliver routine services via telehealth at volumes similar to pre-pandemic in-person levels. However, wide variation in telehealth utilization exists, with inequities associated with racial and ethnic groups and underserved rural locations. A limitation is that clinical outcomes are not routinely available from administrative datasets. There continues to be an urgent need for health policy research and collaboration with the health policy community as part of the research enterprise. NIMH encourages and often requires strong research practice partnerships to help ensure findings will be of value to end users and make their way into the practice setting. There is a need to study pandemic related changes in financing, delivery, receipt, and outcomes of mental health care. Despite robust evidence, clinical practice guideline recommendations, and established financing mechanisms, uptake of service delivery models that can be delivered in part or in full via telehealth (e.g., the collaborative care model) is poor. In the era of COVID-19, the charge to the mental health services research community is urgent: (i) develop strategies to better implement, scale, and sustain existing evidence-supported treatments and services and (ii) develop, test, and evaluate new solutions to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and value of care.","Freed","https://www.google.com/search?q=PERSPECTIVE:+A+Mental+Health+Services+Research+Agenda+in+the+Era+of+COVID-19:+Steadfast+Commitment+to+Addressing+Evolving+Challenges.","20211215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23936,""
"A Panacea for Australia's COVID-19 Crisis? Weighing Some Legal Implications of Mandatory Vaccination","Although Australia's rates of infection, illness and mortality from COVID-19 have been relatively low, they have escalated with the rapid transmission of the Delta variant. Restrictions imposed on people's liberties to curb the spread of the virus in several Australian States have engendered economic hardship, mental health challenges, and collective exhaustion and impatience. Several vaccines have been developed and approved for use in Australia that have proven effective in reducing the likelihood that the vaccinated will contract COVID-19 and, if infected, transmit and suffer serious illness and/or die from it. Public debate has thus centred on whether mandatory vaccination could be the panacea for Australia's COVID-19 crisis, and several Australian governments and employers have already imposed vaccination requirements. This article explores some potentially significant implications of mandatory vaccination for two areas of the law - human rights and employers' liability - to consider whether, from a legal perspective, mandatory vaccination could constitute a viable solution to Australia's present predicament.","Wolf, Taliadoros, Gleeson","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Panacea+for+Australia's+COVID-19+Crisis?+Weighing+Some+Legal+Implications+of+Mandatory+Vaccination.","20211215","COVID-19; employers' liability; human rights; mandatory vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23937,""
"Estimating the strength of selection for new SARS-CoV-2 variants","Controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic becomes increasingly challenging as the virus adapts to human hosts through the continual emergence of more transmissible variants. Simply observing that a variant is increasing in frequency is relatively straightforward, but more sophisticated methodology is needed to determine whether a new variant is a global threat and the magnitude of its selective advantage. We present two models for quantifying the strength of selection for new and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the background of contemporaneous variants. These methods range from a detailed model of dynamics within one country to a broad analysis across all countries, and they include alternative explanations such as migration and drift. We find evidence for strong selection favoring the D614G spike mutation and B.1.1.7 (Alpha), weaker selection favoring B.1.351 (Beta), and no advantage of R.1 after it spreads beyond Japan. Cutting back data to earlier time horizons reveals that uncertainty is large very soon after emergence, but that estimates of selection stabilize after several weeks. Our results also show substantial heterogeneity among countries, demonstrating the need for a truly global perspective on the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","Dorp, Goldberg, Hengartner, Ke, Romero-Severson","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27369-3","20211215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23938,""

"Gambling problems and associated harms in United Kingdom Royal Air Force personnel","International evidence indicates that currently serving and former military personnel may be at heightened vulnerability to problem gambling. The aim of the present study was to undertake the first survey of gambling experience and potential problems among serving United Kingdom Royal Air Force (RAF) personnel. Our objectives were to survey the frequency of gambling problems, types of gambling activities, examine mental health, alcohol use, and COVID-19-related associations with gambling, and identify potential risk factors for problem gambling among RAF personnel. A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to all serving RAF personnel in January 2021 and the final dataset consisted of nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2119 responses. The Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) identified gambling severity, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) assessed depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment (GAD-7) measured anxiety, and alcohol use was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Questions relating to COVID-19 asked whether the pandemic had impacted one's gambling, mental health, and alcohol use. Findings indicated that 12.5% of personnel reported gambling problems, which included 8.0% with PGSI scores indicating low-risk gambling (1-2), 2.9% with moderate-risk gambling scores (3-4), and 1.6% with scores indicating problem gambling (Ã¢â€°Â¥8). Most personnel had no symptoms of depression or anxiety, and most experienced lower risk drinking levels. The likelihood of any gambling problem (PGSIÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 1) in RAF personnel was associated with age (18-24Ã‚Â years old), male gender, and Non-Commissioned ranks. Most participants reported a deterioration in their mental health due to COVID-19 and increased risky gambling. These findings indicate that gambling problems and associated harms are significant concerns for serving RAF personnel.","Pritchard, Dymond","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107200","20211215","Alcohol use; Gambling; Mental health; Military; Royal Air Force","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23940,""
"Anxiety and depression among US college students engaging in undergraduate research during the COVID-19 pandemic","The objective was to examine mental health of undergraduate researchers (UGRs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed 962 UGRs who were conducting research in Spring 2020 at over 100Ã¢â‚¬â€°US universities. We conducted an online survey in July 2020. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and multivariable generalized estimating equations. 63% reported at least mild anxiety and 73% reported at least mild depression based on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores; 15.2% reported severe anxiety (score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 15) and 23.4% reported severe depression (score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 15). More COVID-19-related adverse event experiences were associated with more severe anxiety and depression, as were first-generation status, woman gender, and LGBQ status. Greater social support was protective, and significantly more so for men (vs. women) and continuing generation (vs. first generation) students.

"Health and well-being of university students before and during COVID-19 pandemic: A gender comparison","COVID-19 has affected people's health in various ways. University students are a particularly sensitive group for mental and physical health issues. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the mental and physical health of male and female first-year university students during and before COVID-19. Total of 115 first-year university students (54% male) answered questions about mental and physical health. The students were asked to estimate their physical activity, sedentary behavior, loneliness, stress, and sleep quality during COVID-19 opposed to before the pandemic. Males had fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, and their self-esteem was higher than females (p&lt;0.05). Over 50% of both genders estimated their mental health to be worse than before COVID-19. Larger proportion of males (69%) compared to females (38%) estimated that their physical health had worsened than before the pandemic. Larger proportion of females (38%) than males (14%) experience increased loneliness and stress (68% vs. 48%). Over 70% of both genders estimated increased sedentary behavior than before the pandemic, and larger proportion of males (76%), compared to females (56%), estimated that they were less physically active than before COVID-19. About 50% of participants estimated their sleep quality was worse than before COVID-19. University students estimated their mental and physical health to have deteriorated during the pandemic.

"Patients' Perspectives on Qualitative Olfactory Dysfunction: Thematic Analysis of Social Media Posts","The impact of qualitative olfactory disorders is underestimated. Parosmia, the distorted perception of familiar odors, and phantosmia, the experience of odors in the absence of a stimulus, can arise following postinfectious anosmia, and the incidences of both have increased substantially since the outbreak of COVID-19. The aims of this study are to explore the symptoms and sequalae of postinfectious olfactory dysfunction syndrome using unstructured and unsolicited threads from social media, and to articulate the perspectives and concerns of patients affected by these debilitating olfactory disorders. A thematic analysis and content analysis of posts in the AbScent Parosmia and Phantosmia Support group on Facebook was conducted between June and December 2020. In this paper, we identify a novel symptom, olfactory perseveration, which is a triggered, identifiable, and usually unpleasant olfactory percept that persists in the absence of an ongoing stimulus. We also observe fluctuations in the intensity and duration of symptoms of parosmia, phantosmia, and olfactory perseveration. In addition, we identify a group of the most common items (coffee, meat, onion, and toothpaste) that trigger distortions; however, people have difficulty describing these distortions, using words associated with disgust and revulsion. The emotional aspect of living with qualitative olfactory dysfunction was evident and highlighted the detrimental impact on mental health. Qualitative and unsolicited data acquired from social media has provided useful insights into the patient experience of parosmia and phantosmia, which can inform rehabilitation strategies and ongoing research into understanding the molecular triggers associated with parosmic distortions and research into patient benefit.","Parker, Kelly, Smith, Kirkwood, Hopkins, Gane","https://doi.org/10.2196/29086","20211215","COVID-19; concern; mental health; nose; olfactory dysfunction; olfactory perseveration; parosmia; patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perspective; perspective; phantosmia; smell; social media; support; symptom; thematic analysis; trigger foods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23943,""
"In-person versus virtual therapy in outpatient eating-disorder treatment: A COVID-19 inspired study","Findings show virtual therapy (conducted using internet-based videoconferencing techniques) to be a viable alternative to in-person therapy for a variety of mental-health problems. COVID-19 social-distancing imperatives required us to substitute virtual interventions for in-person sessions routinely offered in our outpatient eating disorder (ED) program-and afforded us an opportunity to compare the two treatment formats for clinical efficacy. Using self-report assessments, we compared outcomes in a historical sample of 49 adults with heterogeneous EDs (treated in-person over 10-14Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks in individual and group therapies) to those of 76 patients receiving comparable virtual treatments, at distance, during the COVID-19 outbreak. Linear mixed models were used to study symptom changes over time and to test for differential effects of treatment modality. Participants in both groups showed similar improvements on eating symptoms, levels of weight gain (in individuals in whom gain was indicated), and satisfaction with services. Our results suggest that short-term clinical outcomes with virtual and in-person ED therapies are comparable, and point to potentials of virtual therapy for situations in which geographical distance or other barriers impede physical access to trained therapists or specialized treatments.","Steiger, Booij, Crescenzi, Oliverio, Singer, Thaler, St-Hilaire, Israel","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23655","20211214","COVID-19; anorexia nervosa; bulimia nervosa; eating disorders; online therapy; pandemic; psychotherapy; virtual therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23944,""
"COVID-19 lockdowns and incidence of psychoactive substance exposure according to age and sex","The lockdown periods imposed in 2020 by governments had deleterious consequences on population mental health. Several studies based on declarative data have suggested that the lockdown periods were associated with changes in psychoactive substance use but few relied on toxicological analyses. We studied the impact of lockdowns on the pattern of routine care toxicological screening performed on patients hospitalized at the emergency ward (EW) and intensive care units (ICU) at the Grenoble University Hospital. This was a retrospective, monocentric study comparing routine care toxicology biological tests performed in children older than 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age and adults hospitalized at the ICU and EW in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Alcohol, illicit drugs, and medications were screened. Generalized linear models were generated to evaluate the effect of the lockdown periods on toxicology results, considering age and sex. The study included 13,910 samples from 11,786 patients. There was no significant difference in the repartition of sex or age over the three years. The frequency of positive toxicological tests increased during the lockdown periods (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14, (1.01-1.28), <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.026).

"Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health of Palliative Care Professionals and Services: A Mixed-Methods Survey Study","This study aimed to examine the mental health of palliative care professionals in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship of mental health with socio-demographic factors, and the impact of the pandemic on palliative care services. A total of 142 palliative care professionals in Hong Kong participated in an online survey. The questionnaire includes measurements on depression, anxiety, perceived stress, post-traumatic stress, professional quality of life, items that measure the effect of COVID-19 on palliative care services, and one open-ended question for describing how the services were affected. Descriptive and multivariate regression analyses were conducted. Quantitative and qualitative data about the impact of COVID-19 on palliative care services were analyzed and triangulated using a mixed-methods approach. Up to 82%, 43%, and 42% of the participants felt moderately to highly stressed, anxious, and depressed, respectively, during the pandemic. Younger participants tended to have poorer mental health and professional quality of life. Around 82% felt stressed when communicating with patients and family members under the no-visiting policy during the pandemic. More than three-quarters of participants showed lack of confidence in the anti-epidemic policy of the government. Qualitative findings identified 3 themes affecting the provision of palliative care: 1. the tightening of restrictions on visitors; 2. the limited provision of services; and 3. staff deployment. Appropriate responses are required to give extra support to palliative care professionals during the pandemic and facilitate their coping with the impact of COVID-19 on the provision of palliative care.","Chan, Woo, Kwok, Yu, Chiu","https://doi.org/10.1177/10499091211057043","20211214","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; palliative care; pandemic; professionals; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23946,""
"How young people experienced COVID-19 disease containment measures in the Western Cape, South Africa: A qualitative study including the perspectives of young people, their parents, teachers and school counsellors","Little is known about the potential impact of COVID-19 disease containment measures on children's mental health and well-being, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We sought to explore this amongst young adolescents in South Africa and from the perspectives of multiple key stakeholders.

We generated three overarching themes: ""locked down at home"", ""social disconnection"" and ""back to school."" Children had varying reactions to COVID-19 and lockdown including excitement, frustration, anxiety, boredom and loneliness. Parents were anxious about teaching, and technology did not consistently provide the necessary support. Children felt disconnected from their peers at home, and at school, reconnecting with friends was obstructed by disease containment measures. All participants were concerned about children completing the academic year successfully and worried excessively about the implications of this year on their future. Young people and their immediate networks, in a low- and middle-income context, described a variety of negative impacts of disease containment measures emotionally, although there was a wide variety of experiences.

Qualitative study using in-depth interviews with 15 junior doctors. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, anonymised and imported into NVivo V.12 to facilitate data management. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. National Health Service (NHS) England. A purposive sample of 12 female and 3 male junior doctors who indicated severe depression and/or anxiety on the DASS-21 questionnaire or high suicidality on Paykel's measure were recruited. These doctors self-identified as having lived experience of distress due to their working conditions. We report three major themes. First, the challenges of working during the COVID-19 pandemic, which were both personal and organisational. Personal challenges were characterised by helplessness and included the trauma of seeing many patients dying, fears about safety and being powerless to switch off. Work-related challenges revolved around change and uncertainty and included increasing workloads, decreasing staff numbers and negative impacts on relationships with colleagues and patients. The second theme was strategies for coping with the impact of COVID-19 on work, which were also both personal and organisational. Personal coping strategies, which appeared limited in their usefulness, were problem and emotion focused. Several participants appeared to have moved from coping towards learnt helplessness. Some organisations reacted to COVID-19 collaboratively and flexibly. Third, participants reported a positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on working practices, which included simplified new ways of working-such as consistent teams and longer rotations-as well as increased camaraderie and support. The trauma that junior doctors experienced while working during COVID-19 led to powerlessness and a reduction in the benefit of individual coping strategies. This may have resulted in feelings of resignation. We recommend that, postpandemic, junior doctors are assigned to consistent teams and offered ongoing support.","Spiers, Buszewicz, Chew-Graham, Dunning, Taylor, Gopfert, Van Hove, Teoh, Appleby, Martin, Riley","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056122","20211214","COVID-19; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23950,""
"Assessing the impact of social distancing measures implemented during COVID-19 pandemic on medications for opioid use disorder in West Virginia","This study evaluates if social distancing measures instituted during the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic were associated with a reduction in Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) prescribing in West Virginia. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the quick implementation of public health interventions such as social distancing. This led to the use of telemedicine in the clinical setting however implementing telemedicine involves system level and infrastructure level changes within a healthcare environment. This could cause a barrier to MOUD delivery as it is often provided concomitantly with other face to face substance use and mental health services. The purpose of this study is to determine whether social distancing was associated with a reduction in MOUD prescribing in West Virginia, with the goal of adding to the knowledge of how COVID-19 and COVID-19-related mitigation strategies have impacted patients with OUD. Prescription monitoring data were requested from the West Virginia Board of Pharmacy. We applied interrupted time series modeling to investigate MOUD prescribing practices before and after social distancing took effect. Gabapentin prescriptions were utilized as a control for comparison. Our study assessed state-wide buprenorphine and Suboxone prescriptions as compared to a control medication and found an increase in dosage of both medications and an increase in number of buprenorphine prescriptions, but a small decrease in buprenorphine/naloxone prescription number related to the dates of implementation of social distancing. Taken together, overall this indicates an increase in prescription number of MOUD prescriptions as well as an increase in dosage. This study suggests that social distancing measures were associated with an increase in both the number of MOUD prescriptions and the number of doses in each prescription. Significant alterations to MOUD delivery in the clinical setting were implemented in a short timeframe with the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the implementation of clinical measures to accommodate social distancing measures may provide benefit to transformation of future delivery of MOUD.","Haggerty, Khodaverdi, Dekeseredy, Wood, Hendricks, Peklinsky, Sedney","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108687","20211214","MOUD; Opioid use disorder; Substance use; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23951,""
"Associations between postpartum depression and assistance with household tasks and childcare during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from American mothers","The early postpartum period is recognized cross-culturally as being important for recovery, with new parents receiving increased levels of community support. However, COVID-19-related lockdown measures may have disrupted these support systems, with possible implications for mental health. Here, we use a cross-sectional analysis among individuals who gave birth at different stages of the pandemic to test (i) if instrumental support access in the form of help with household tasks, newborn care, and care for older children has varied temporally across the pandemic, and (ii) whether access to these forms of instrumental support is associated with lower postpartum depression scores. This study used data from the COVID-19 And Reproductive Effects (CARE) study, an online survey of pregnant persons in the United States. Participants completed postnatal surveys between April 30 - November 18, 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°971). Logistic regression analysis tested whether birth timing during the pandemic was associated with odds of reported sustained instrumental support. Linear regression analyses assessed whether instrumental support was associated with lower depression scores as measured via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression survey. Participants who gave birth later in the pandemic were more likely to report that the pandemic had not affected the help they received with household work and newborn care (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), while access to childcare for older children appeared to vary non-linearly throughout the pandemic. Additionally, respondents who reported that the pandemic had not impacted their childcare access or help received around the house displayed significantly lower depression scores compared to participants who reported pandemic-related disruptions to these support types (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The maintenance of postpartum instrumental support during the pandemic appears to be associated with better maternal mental health. Healthcare providers should therefore consider disrupted support systems as a risk factor for postpartum depression and ask patients how the pandemic has affected support access. Policymakers seeking to improve parental wellbeing should design strategies that reduce disease transmission, while facilitating safe interactions within immediate social networks (e.g., through investment in COVID-19 testing and contact tracing). Cumulatively, postpartum instrumental support represents a potential tool to protect against depression, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gildner, Uwizeye, Milner, Alston, Thayer","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04300-8","20211214","Childcare; Coronavirus; Maternal wellbeing; Mental health; Perinatal depression; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23952,""
"Lived experiences of Ugandan women who had recovered from a clinical diagnosis of postpartum depression: a phenomenological study","Postpartum depression affects a significant proportion of women of childbearing age. The birth of a newborn baby is normally considered a joyful event, inhibiting mothers from expressing their depressive feelings. If the condition is not well understood and managed, mothers with postpartum depression are likely to experience suicidal ideation or even commit suicide. This study explored lived experiences of women who had recovered from a clinical diagnosis of postpartum depression in southwestern Uganda. This phenomenological study adopted the explorative approach through in-depth interviews as guided by the biopsychosocial model of depression. It was conducted in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, Bwizibwera Health Centre IV and Kinoni Health Centre IV located in Mbarara and Rwampara districts, southwestern Uganda. Data were collected from 30 postpartum mothers who were purposively selected, between 9th December 2019 and 25th September 2020. We analyzed this work using thematic data analysis and this was steered by the Colaizzi's six-step phenomenological approach of inquiry. The findings were summarized into five major themes: 1) somatic experiences including insomnia and headache, breast pain, poor breast milk production, weight loss and lack of energy; 2) difficulties in home and family life including overwhelming domestic chores, lack of social support from other family members, fighting at home and financial constraints due to COVID-19 pandemic; 3) negative emotions including anger, self-blame, despondency and feelings of loneliness and regrets of conceiving or marriage; 4) feelings of suicide, homicide and self-harm including suicidal ideation and attempt, homicidal ideations and attempt and feelings of self-harm and 5) coping with postpartum depression including spirituality, termination of or attempt to leave their marital relationships, acceptance, counselling and seeking medical treatment, perseverance. Suicidal and homicidal thoughts are important parts of the postpartum depression experience, and these may put the lives of the mothers, their spouses and their babies at a great risk. Poor relationship quality, intimate partner violence and lack of financial resources contribute significantly to the negative emotional experiences of mothers with PPD.","Atuhaire, Rukundo, Brennaman, Cumber, Nambozi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04287-2","20211214","Lived experiences; Postpartum depression; Qualitative research; Uganda","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23953,""
"Emotional support received moderates academic stress and mental well-being in a sample of Afghan university students amid COVID-19","Academic stress experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered high levels of anxiety and depression and other severe mental health issues among university students around the globe. In Afghanistan, there is a paucity of research on the academic and mental health issues of Afghan university students and none pertaining to their academic stress and mental well-being amid the pandemic. This research examines the potential stress-buffering role of emotional support received between academic stress and mental well-being in a sample of Afghan university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study sample comprised 508 Afghan university students. An online survey was developed for data collection. Model 1 of the PROCESS macro was used to conduct the moderation analysis. These indicate that moderate and high levels of emotional support received may protect against the negative effects of higher levels of academic stress on mental well-being. This research makes an important contribution to the literature on social support. It may be inferred from the results that Afghan university students who experience academic stress, but have strong emotional support are able to attain greater mental well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak as compared to those with weak emotional support. Results may encourage mental health practitioners, university counselors, education administrators, and faculty to jointly formulate strategies for offering emotional support to Afghan university students.","Green, Faizi, Jalal, Zadran","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211057729","20211214","Academic stress; Afghan university students; COVID-19; emotional support received; mental well-being; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23954,""

"Prevalence of burnout among university students in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Burnout is common among university students and may adversely affect academic performance. Little is known about the true burden of this preventable malady among university students in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aimed to systematically estimate the prevalence of burnout among university students in LMICs. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Web of Science, African Journals Online, and Embase from the inception of each database until February 2021. Original studies were included. No study design or language restrictions were applied. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed using STATA version 16.0. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using Q-statistics and funnel plots, respectively. Fifty-five unique articles, including a total of 27,940 (Female: 16,215, 58.0%) university students from 24 LMICs were included. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used in 43 studies (78.2%). The pooled prevalence of burnout was 12.1% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 11.9-12.3; I2 = 99.7%, Q = 21,464.1, p = &lt; 0.001). The pooled prevalence of emotional exhaustion (feelings of energy depletion), cynicism (negativism), and reduced professional efficacy were, 27.8% (95% CI 27.4-28.3; I2 = 98.17%. p = &lt;0.001), 32.6 (95% CI: 32.0-33.1; I2: 99.5%; p = &lt; 0.001), and 29.9% (95% CI: 28.8-30.9; I2: 98.1%; p = &lt; 0.001), respectively. Nearly one-third of university students in LMICs experience burnout. More studies are needed to understand the causes of burnout in this key population. There is a need to validate freely available tools for use in these countries.","Kaggwa, Kajjimu, Sserunkuma, Najjuka, Atim, Olum, Tagg, Bongomin","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256402","20211207","Academic Performance; Adolescent; Adult; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Developing Countries; Emotions; Female; Humans; Income; Male; Prevalence; Students; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-16","",23956,""
