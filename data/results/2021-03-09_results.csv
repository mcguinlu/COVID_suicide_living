"Associations between COVID-19 and 30-day thromboembolic events and mortality in people with dementia receiving antipsychotic medications","Background Antipsychotic medications are frequently prescribed to people with dementia to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms  Using a global federated research network, the objectives were to determine: 1) if COVID-19 is associated with 30-day thromboembolic events and mortality for people with dementia receiving antipsychotic medications;and 2) if the proportion of people with dementia receiving antipsychotics is higher during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019  Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using TriNetX, a global federated health research network  The network was searched for people aged =65 years with dementia, COVID-19 and use of antipsychotics in the 30-days prior to COVID-19 recorded in electronic medical records between 20/01/2020 and 05/12/2020  These individuals were compared to historical controls from 2019 with dementia and use of antipsychotics in the 30-days before a visit to a participating healthcare organisation  Propensity score matching for age, sex, race, co-morbidities and use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants was used to balance cohorts with and without COVID-19  Results Within the TriNetX network, 8,414 individuals with COVID-19, dementia and use of antipsychotics and 32,693 historical controls were identified  After propensity score matching there were 8,396 individuals with COVID-19 and 8,396 historical controls  The cohorts were well balanced for age, sex, race, co-morbidities and use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants  The odds of 30-day thromboembolic events and all-cause mortality were significantly higher in adults with COVID-19 (Odds Ratios: 1 36 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1 21-1 52) and 1 93 (1 71-2 17), respectively)  The number of people with dementia with a visit to a participating healthcare organisation was lower between 20/01/2020 and 05/12/2020 (n=165,447) compared to the same period in 2019 (n=217,391), but the proportion receiving antipsychotics increased from 14 7% (95%CI: 14 6%-14 9%) to 16 4% (95%CI: 16 2%-16 5%), P&lt; 0001  Conclusions These findings add to the evidence base that during the COVID-19 pandemic there was an increase in the proportion of people with dementia receiving antipsychotics  The negative effects of antipsychotics in patients with dementia may be compounded by concomitant COVID-19","Harrison, Stephanie L.; Buckley, Benjamin J.

"Les enfants suivis en psychiatrie infanto-juvÃ©nile ont ils connu la dÃ©gradation redoutÃ©e pendant la pÃ©riode de confinement liÃ©e Ã  la pandÃ©mie COVID-19?","RÃ©sumÃ© Objectifs: La pÃ©riode de confinement qui sâ€™est dÃ©roulÃ©e en France de la mi-mars Ã  la mi-mai 2020, Ã  lâ€™occasion de la pandÃ©mie COVID-19, soulÃ¨ve dâ€™importantes questions sur ses effets psychologiques directs et indirects chez les enfants et adolescents  ConsidÃ©rÃ©e intuitivement comme nuisible, voire traumatisante dans le discours mÃ©diatique, nous avons tentÃ© de mieux qualifier ses effets Ã  partir de deux dÃ©marches complÃ©mentaires Dâ€™une part, nous avons rÃ©alisÃ© une revue de la littÃ©rature sur le sujet, dâ€™autre part, nous y avons associÃ© une objectivation de lâ€™Ã©volution de lâ€™Ã©tat clinique global des enfants au sein de la file active du service de psychiatrie infanto-juvÃ©nile du CHRU de Brest pendant la pÃ©riode de confinement La revue de la littÃ©rature portant sur les effets psychologiques de situations de confinement ou de quarantaine Ã  lâ€™occasion dâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mies passÃ©es ou actuelle de COVID-19, notamment en Chine, rapporte de nombreuses donnÃ©es sur leurs consÃ©quences dÃ©lÃ©tÃ¨res  Les effets relatÃ©s sont de nature variable: symptÃ´mes anxieux et dÃ©pressifs principalement, mais aussi Stress Post Traumatique, dans des proportions importantes  Cependant, la dÃ©finition des situations vÃ©cues et les contextes dans lesquels se sont dÃ©roulÃ©es ces Ã©tudes sont en fait peu comparables Ã  la situation franÃ§aise  Par ailleurs, les effets de la peur de la contamination nâ€™y sont pas diffÃ©renciÃ©s de ceux liÃ©s au confinement lui-mÃªme  Patients et mÃ©thodes: 354 enfants et adolescents suivis dans le service ont bÃ©nÃ©ficiÃ© dâ€™une mesure de lâ€™impact du confinement sur leur Ã©tat clinique global Ã©valuÃ© Ã  la Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) par leur praticien habituel au cours de la pÃ©riode du 16 mars au 11 mai 2020  RÃ©sultats: Nos rÃ©sultats mettent en Ã©vidence que 50% des enfants ont connu un Ã©tat clinique global inchangÃ© en comparaison Ã  leur Ã©tat avant le confinement, 25 Ã  30% ont connu une amÃ©lioration et 20 Ã  25% ont montrÃ© une lÃ©gÃ¨re dÃ©gradation pendant la pÃ©riode de confinement  Lâ€™Ã©tat dÃ©crit est globalement stable dans le temps au cours des huit semaines de la durÃ©e du confinement  Lâ€™Ã¢ge ou la sÃ©vÃ©ritÃ© prÃ©alable de la pathologie nâ€™a pas dâ€™influence significative, mÃªme si on note une amÃ©lioration globale plus frÃ©quente chez les adolescents  Conclusion: Ces rÃ©sultats sont assez discordants avec le discours gÃ©nÃ©ral  Plusieurs hypothÃ¨ses sont discutÃ©es pour expliquer les raisons de cette absence de dÃ©gradation qui pourrait Ã©ventuellement Ãªtre Ã©tendue aux enfants et adolescents en gÃ©nÃ©ral pendant cette pÃ©riode  Background: The general lockdown period during the COVID-19 pandemic which covered mid-March to mid-May 2020 in France raised important questions about the direct and indirect psychological effects on children and adolescents  Perceived intuitively as harmful and even traumatic in the mediaâ€™s discourse, we tried to better qualify its effects from two complementary approaches  We carried out a review of the literature on the subject to which we associated a regular assessment of the children's global clinical state in the entire active file of the child-psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest throughout the lockdown period  The findings of the literature review on the psychological effects of lockdowns or quarantines during past or current epidemics, in particular in China, report many deleterious and variable effects such as symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at a significant rate  However, the definition of the situations experienced and the contexts in which those studies took place appear to be not truly comparable to the French situation  Moreover, the effects of the fear of contamination are not differentiated from those linked to confinement itself  Patients and methods: 354 children and adolescents under the care of the above department underwent an assessment of the impact of lockdown on their global clinical condition using the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) performed by their usual practitioner during the period from March 16 to May 11, 2020  Results: Our results highlight that 50% of children remained in stable condition, 25 to 30% improved and 20 to 25% experienced a slight degradation  The evolution of the clinical status appeared stable over time during the eight weeks  The initial age or severity of mental disorder had no significant influence, although there was a slightly more frequent improvement in adolescents  Conclusion: These results are quite inconsistent with general discourse and common expectations  Several psychopathological hypotheses are discussed to support this absence of psychological degradation which might even be extended to children and adolescents in the general population","Lavenne-Collot, Nathalie, Ailliot, Pierre, Badic, Simona,

"COVID-19: A catalyst for change in telehealth service delivery for opioid use disorder management","COVID-19 has exacerbated income inequality, structural racism, and social isolation-issues that drive addiction and have previously manifested in the epidemic of opioid-associated overdose. The co-existence of these epidemics has necessitated care practice changes, including the use of telehealth-based encounters for the diagnosis and management of opioid use disorder (OUD). We describe the development of the &quot;Addiction Telehealth Program&quot; (ATP), a telephone-based program to reduce treatment access barriers for people with substance use disorders staying at San Francisco's COVID-19 Isolation and Quarantine (I&amp;Q) sites. Telehealth encounters were documented in the electronic medical record and an internal tracking system for the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) COVID-19 Containment Response. Descriptive statistics were collected on a case series of patients initiated on buprenorphine at I&amp;Q sites and indicators of feasibility were measured. Between April 10 and May 25, 2020, ATP consulted on the management of opioid, alcohol, GHB, marijuana, and stimulant use for 59 I&amp;Q site guests. Twelve patients were identified with untreated OUD and newly prescribed buprenorphine. Of these, all were marginally housed, 67% were Black, and 58% had never previously been prescribed medications for OUD. Four self-directed early discharge from I&amp;Q-1 prior to and 3 after initiating buprenorphine. Of the remaining 8 patients, 7 reported continuing to take buprenorphine at the time of I&amp;Q discharge and 1 discontinued. No patients started on buprenorphine sustained significant adverse effects, required emergency care, or experienced overdose. ATP demonstrates the feasibility of telephone-based management of OUD among a highly marginalized patient population in San Francisco and supports the implementation of similar programs in areas of the U.S. where access to addiction treatment is limited. Legal changes permitting the prescribing of buprenorphine via telehealth without the requirement of an in-person visit should persist beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency.","Mehtani, Ristau, Snyder, Surlyn, Eveland, Smith-Bernardin, Knight","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2021.1890676","20210308","COVID-19; Telehealth; buprenorphine; low-barrier; opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11657,""

This report shares key results from a cross-sectional survey of South Dakota residents' perceptions on the impact and knowledge of COVID-19 during the early phases of the pandemic. From March 24 to April 14, 2020, South Dakota residents (n = 4,761) reported on their psychological symptoms, pandemic-related stressful experiences, top concerns regarding the pandemic, attitudes towards COVID-19, and social distancing behaviors, and where residents were getting COVID information and who they trust to provide accurate information. Most participants were engaging in at least some social distancing and indicated at least moderate concern about COVID-19. Across age groups, getting sick from the coronavirus was the most frequently endorsed concern. Younger adults endorsed concerns about not being able to work, whereas older adults endorsed concerns about accessing medical care. The majority of the sample reported anxiety, worry, and sleep problems; about half the sample reported depressed mood, anhedonia, and appetite problems. Results highlight the importance of engaging public health experts and physicians in COVID-19 health messaging campaigns.

"The association between perceived stress with sleep quality, insomnia, anxiety and depression in kidney transplant recipients during Covid-19 pandemic","The psychological distress and sleep problems caused by current Covid-19 outbreak is not well known in kidney transplant recipients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between perceived stress with sleep quality, insomnia, anxiety, depression and kidney function in kidney transplant recipients during the Covid-19 pandemic. A hundred-six kidney transplant recipients were enrolled. Questionnaire of &quot;Socio-demographics&quot;, &quot;Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)&quot;, &quot;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)&quot;, &quot;Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)&quot; and &quot;Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)&quot; are performed. The laboratory data is recorded. The perceived stress related to Covid-19 pandemic and its associations were investigated. The mean age of patients was 44.2Ã‚Â±13.3 years, and 65 of the patients (61.3%) were men. Forty-nine (46.2%) of the patients had high-perceived stress; 51 (48.1%) of the patients had poor sleep quality, 40 (37.7%) of the patients had insomnia, 25 (23.6%) of the patients had anxiety and 47 (44.3%) of the patients had depression. The patients having a history of Covid-19 infection in own or closed relatives (9.09Ã‚Â±4.17 vs 6.49Ã‚Â±4.16, p:0.014) and the patients who have a rejection episode any of time (8.24Ã‚Â±5.16 vs 6.37Ã‚Â±3.57, p:0.033) have had significantly higher anxiety scores, when they compared to others. The high PSS were positively correlated with PSQI, ISI, HAD-A and HAD-D. Regression analyses revealed that high-perceived stress is an independent predictor of anxiety and depression. There was not significant difference between kidney function with PSS, PSQI, ISI, HAD-A and HAD-D. High PSS is positively correlated with poor sleep quality and insomnia and also an independent predictor of anxiety and depression in kidney transplant recipients during the outbreak of Covid-19. As the pandemic is still spreading worldwide quickly early identification and intervention of sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders are essential to protect graft function with high compliance to treatment in transplantation patients.","Barutcu Atas, Aydin Sunbul, Velioglu, Tuglular","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248117","20210308","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11659,""

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 366-374. Summary. In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the &quot;psychodemia&quot;.

"The Role of Medical Students During COVID-19 Era A Review","Since December 2019, the world has been facing the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic crisis. The rapid and effortless spread of the virus has led the World Health Organization to adopt unprecedented large-scale preventive measures. Our aim is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of medical students, and to evaluate their awareness and aptitude for contributing to the fight against COVID-19 contagion. PubMed electronic database was employed for the research using the following terms: &quot;medical students and COVID-19&quot;, &quot;mental health of medical students and COVID-19&quot;, &quot;knowledge of medical students and COVID-19&quot;, &quot;preventive behavior of medical students and COVID-19&quot;. Twenty-one articles were included; ten assess the knowledge of medical students on COVID-19, seven present whether they demonstrate appropriate preventive behavior according to global guidelines, seven examine the impact of the pandemic on their mental health, five examine their role on the side of trained healthcare workers. Some articles combine more than one of the above mentioned domains. Medical students seem to demonstrate an adequate level of knowledge upon COVID-19 and implement proper strategies to prevent its spread. Further training is essential to improve some aspects in this field. Social media has proven to be the optimal source of information for medical students, which is incompatible with their future careers as doctors. The pandemic had a negative impact on medical students, expressed as fear regarding the virus spread; nevertheless, many have felt the need to assist healthcare systems under appropriate precautions.","Magklara, Angelis, Solia, Katsimantas, Kourlaba, Kostakis, Tsakotos, Zaoutis, Filippou","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v92i1.10873","20210308","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11663,""
"Brazil before and during COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on the practice and habits of physical exercise","The goal of this study was to investigate the practice and habits of physical exercise impact due to COVID-19 social isolation before and during the outbreak in Brazil and its mains macro-regions, which have social and economic disparities. This is an observational cross-sectional study through an online questionnaire survey. A self-administered survey (PEF-COVID19) was applied in the Brazilian general population, age Ã¢â€°Â¥ 18 years. T-test for independent samples and Chi-square tests were used to compare Brazil and different macro-regions, pÃ‹â€š0.05. 1,977 participants filled the survey and 1,845 were included; 80% of the included ones were in social isolation. In general, the self-related physical exercise practice before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and exercise characteristics were highly affected by the pandemic (pÃ‹â€š0.05). Sedentary behavior increased significantly (14.9 vs. 29.8%) and between the active ones, the frequency of PEx per week and duration of the PEx practice decreased significantly. The motivation to exercise also changed considering performance and health before and during the pandemic, respectively (10 vs. 5.6% and 72.4 vs. 79.1%). Also, the sample started to exercise less in the night and more in the afternoon, respectively (33.7 vs. 25.3% and 19.1 vs. 31.5%). The COVID-19 pandemic highly influenced the physical exercise practice and habits (frequency, duration, motivation, period to exercise) in Brazil and its main macro-regions. These results can be used to create measures, as home-based exercise programs, to avoid the harm of sedentary behaviors and mental health impact during and after the pandemic.","Sonza, Da Cunha de SÃƒÂ¡-Caputo, Bachur, Rodrigues de AraÃƒÂºjo, Valadares Trippo, Ribeiro Nogueira da Gama, Lago Borges, Amaral MendonÃƒÂ§a, Bernardo-Filho","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v92i1.10803","20210308","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11664,""
"Older people and nature: the benefits of outdoors, parks and nature in light of COVID-19 and beyond- where to from here?","The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people's health and wellbeing globally. In the pandemic, parks, gardens and other local green spaces have been recognised as vital to people's physical and mental health. Emerging global evidence shows increased access to local parks and recreational activities and a new appreciation of the natural surroundings. Various movements and organisations globally have called for actions to embrace recent trends and changes in relation to the planning of public spaces and urban built environments to enable better access to parks and nature. The crisis, however, has exposed the inequities around access to green space where vulnerable populations such as older people and those in low socioeconomic areas are particularly affected.

"Investigating Popular Mental Health Mobile Application Downloads and Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This article analyzes the changes in downloads and activity of users of select popular mental health mobile applications (mHealth apps) during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis has shown a negative impact on public mental health. Mobile health has the potential to help address the psychological needs of existing and new patients during the pandemic and beyond. Downloads data of 16 widely used apps were analyzed. The quality of apps was reviewed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) framework. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between app quality and app popularity. Among the 16 apps, 10 were meditational in nature, 13 showed increased downloads, with 11 apps showing above 10% increase in the downloads after the pandemic started. The popular apps were satisfactory in terms of functionality and esthetics but lacked clinical grounding and evidence base. There exists a gap between app quality and app popularity. This study provided evidence for increased downloads of mental mHealth apps (primarily meditation apps) during the COVID-19 pandemic but revealed several gaps and opportunities to address deficiencies in evidence-based design, usability and effective assessment, and integration into current workflows. The COVID-19 pandemic is a potential turning point for mHealth applications for mental health care. Whereas the evidence suggests a need for alternative delivery of care, human factors and ergonomics methods should be utilized to ensure these tools are user-centered, easy to use, evidence-based, well-integrated with professional care, and used sustainably.","Wang, Markert, Sasangohar","https://doi.org/10.1177/0018720821998110","20210308","COVID-19; Mobile Health Rating Scale (MARS); mental health; mobile apps; mobile health (mHealth)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11666,""

Of 135 consecutive COVID-19 patients, 31 (23%) required ICU-care (severe), 72 (53%) were admitted to the regular ward (moderate), and 32 (24%) underwent outpatient-care (mild) during acute disease. At three-month follow-up, 20 patients (15%) presented with one or more neurological syndromes that were not evident before COVID-19.

"Impact of the intersection of anaesthesia and gender on burnout and mental health, illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic","Physician burnout and poor mental health are prevalent and often stigmatised. Anaesthetists may be at particular risk and this is further increased for women anaesthetists due to biases and inequities within the specialty. However, gender-related risk factors for and experiences of burnout and poor mental health remain under-researched and under-reported. This negatively impacts individual practitioners, the anaesthesia workforce and patients and carries significant financial implications. We discuss the impact of anaesthesia and gender on burnout and mental health using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example illustrating how women and men differentially experience stressors and burnout. COVID-19 has further accentuated the gendered effects of burnout and poor mental health on anaesthetists and brought further urgency to the need to address these issues.

"Pandemics and maternal health: the indirect effects of COVID-19","Infectious diseases can directly affect women and men differently. During the COVID-19 pandemic, higher case fatality rates have been observed in men in most countries. There is growing evidence, however, that while organisational changes to healthcare delivery have occurred to protect those vulnerable to the virus (staff and patients), these may lead to indirect, potentially harmful consequences, particularly to vulnerable groups including pregnant women. These encompass reduced access to antenatal and postnatal care, with a lack of in-person clinics impacting the ability to screen for physical, psychological and social issues such as elevated blood pressure, mental health issues and sex-based violence. Indirect consequences also encompass a lack of equity when considering the inclusion of pregnant women in COVID-19 research and their absence from vaccine trials, leading to a lack of safety data for breastfeeding and pregnant women. The risk-benefit analysis of these changes to healthcare delivery remains to be fully evaluated, but the battle against COVID-19 cannot come at the expense of losing existing quality standards in other areas of healthcare, especially for maternal health.","Lucas, Bamber","https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15408","20210308","COVID-19; anaesthesia; indirect effects; maternal health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11669,""

"Robotic-Assisted Surgery for Cadaveric Skull Opening: A New Method of Autopsy Procedure","<b>Background:</b> Sawing of bone is an essential part of an autopsy procedure. An oscillating saw always generates noise, fine infectious dust particles, and the possibility of traumatic injuries, all of which can induce occupational hazard risks to autopsy workers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Objectives:</b> The first goal of this study was to explore the production of noise and bone dust emission, comparing an oscillating saw and a robotic autopsy saw during an autopsy. The second goal was to evaluate the performance of a new robotic autopsy method, used during skull opening. The third goal was to encourage mortuary workers to use robotic technology during the autopsy procedure to protect us away from occupational injuries as well as airborne infections. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> The experiments involved a comparison of noise levels and aerosol production during skull cutting between the oscillating saw and the robotic autopsy saw. <b>Results:</b> The results confirmed that noise production from the robotic autopsy saw was lower than the oscillating saw. However, the bone dust levels, produced by the robotic autopsy saw, were greater than the oscillating saw, but were not greater than the dust concentrations which were present before opening the skull. <b>Conclusions:</b> The use of a new robotic system might be an alternative choice for protecting against occupational damage among the healthcare workers. Further research might attempt to consider other healthcare problems which occur in the autopsy workplace and apply the robotic-assisted technology in autopsy surgery.","Jumlongkul, Chutivongse","https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2020.622083","20210308","aerosol; autopsy noise; bone dust; oscillating saw; robotic autopsy saw; robotic-assisted surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11671,""
"The COVID-19 Elective for Pediatric Residents: Learning About Systems-Based Practice During a Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has promptedÃ‚Â pediatric residency programsÃ‚Â to adjust the delivery of educational curricula and to update content relevant to the pandemic. In this descriptive paper, we present how we rapidly developed and implemented a COVID-19 pandemic elective for pediatric residents. This curriculum was established at a single tertiary care children's hospital in June 2020.Ã‚Â We used the ADDIE (analysis, design, development, implementation, evaluation) framework to develop a two-week elective (30 hours) consisting of six flexibly scheduled modules.Ã‚Â We administered post-elective surveys and exit interviews to solicit feedback to improve the elective and obtain effectiveness of our educational interventions. We developed an asynchronous online COVID-19 Elective for Pediatric Residents. The curriculum modules focus on pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the disaster management ecosystem, simulation of clinical care, mental health ramifications, and public health consequences. We also include six in-situ experiences (visits to a drive-through COVID-19 testing site, testing laboratory and local public health department, a simulation of a critically ill child, and meetings with emergency managers and social workers) to solidify learning and allow for further reflection. To date, eight participants have taken the elective. All participants strongly agreed on a five-point Likert item survey that the elective enhanced their knowledge in current evidence-based literature for COVID-19, disaster preparedness, hospital response, management of the critically ill child, and mental and public health ramifications. All participants agreed this curriculum was relevant to and will change their practice. We demonstrate how a COVID-19 elective for pediatric residents could be quickly developed and implemented. The pilot results show that pediatric trainees value asynchronous learning, supplemented by relevant in-situ experiences. Moreover, these results suggest that this curriculum provides needed disaster response and resiliency education for pediatric residents.","Iyer, Lo, Scherzer, MacDowell, Gupta, McManus, Stewart, Linakis, Stanley","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13085","20210308","asynchronous learning; covid-19 pandemic; curriculum development and evaluation; curriculum implementation; emergency medicine - emergency critical care - disaster medicine; hospital response; incident learning systems; pediatrics emergency; systems based practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11672,""
"Hope and Resilience During a Pandemic Among Three Cultural Groups in Israel: The Second Wave of Covid-19","The aim of this study was to explore the coping resources of hope and sense of coherence, which are rooted in positive-psychology theory, as potential resilience factors that might reduce the emotional distress experienced by adults from three cultural groups in Israel during the chronic-stress situation of a pandemic. The three cultural groups examined were secular Jews, Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Arabs. We compared these cultural groups during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, just before the Jewish New Year (mid-September 2020) as a second lockdown was announced. Data were gathered from 248 secular Jews, 243 Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and 203 Arabs, who were 18-70 years old (<i>M</i> = 37.14, <i>SD</i> = 12.62). The participants filled out self-reported questionnaires including the Brief Symptom Inventory as a measure of emotional/psychological distress (i.e., somatization, depression, and anxiety) and questionnaires about sense of coherence and different types of hope (i.e., intrapersonal, interpersonal, and transpersonal) as measures of coping resources and resiliency. Differences were found between the three groups in terms of several variables. The Arab participants reported the highest levels of emotional distress and the lowest levels of interpersonal and transpersonal hope; whereas the Ultra-Orthodox participants revealed the highest levels of sense of coherence and other resilience factors. A structural equation model revealed that, in addition to the sociodemographic factors, only sense of coherence and intrapersonal hope played significant roles in explaining emotional distress, explaining 60% of the reported distress among secular Jews, 41% among Ultra-Orthodox Jews, and 48% among Arabs. We discuss our findings in light of the salutogenic and hope theories. We will also discuss their relevancy to meaning-seeking and self-transcendence theory in the three cultural groups.","Braun-Lewensohn, Abu-Kaf, Kalagy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.637349","20210308","ethnic groups; hope; pandemic; resilience; sense of coherence; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11673,""

Based on Schwartz's theory of human basic values, the current study combines variable-centered and person-centered approaches to examine the relationships between adolescents' values and mental health across two regions in China. The results generally showed that (1) both self-enhancement and conservation values were positively correlated with depression and loneliness, while both self-transcendence and openness to change values negatively correlated with depression and loneliness. The results also showed that (2) there were four value clusters (i.e., <i>self-focus, other-focus, anxiety-free, undifferentiated</i>), and, compared to adolescents in the <i>self-focus</i> and <i>undifferentiated</i> values cluster, all adolescents in the <i>anxiety-free</i> values cluster reported lower depression and loneliness, while all adolescents in the <i>other-focus</i> values cluster reported higher depression and loneliness. The differences between the two regional groups only emerged in depression. Specifically, adolescents in Shanghai have higher levels of depression than adolescents in Qingdao. This study provides some evidence for the new science of self-transcendence among adolescents and also sheds light on how we may improve the level of mental health during the COVID-19 era.","Liu, Wang, Li, Zhang, Li, Han","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.630420","20210308","COVID-19; adolescents; existential positive psychology; mental health; self-transcendence; values","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11674,""
"Coronavirus Disease 2019: Exploring Media Portrayals of Public Sentiment on Funerals Using Linguistic Dimensions","Funerals are a reflective practice to bid farewell to the departed soul. Different religions, cultural traditions, rituals, and social beliefs guide how funeral practices take place. Family and friends gather together to support each other in times of grief. However, during the coronavirus pandemic, the way funerals are taking place is affected by the country's rules and region to avoid the spread of infection. The present study explores the media portrayal of public sentiments over funerals. In particular, the present study tried to identify linguistic dimensions associated with lexical components of social processes, affective processes, fear, and disgust. An exhaustive search of newspaper coverage of funeral and related articles was made for a specific corona period. After an initial screening for the details and language used, a total of 46 newspaper articles on funerals were finalized for the analysis. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software was used to determine the association between linguistic dimensions of function words and words related to social and affective processes, as presented in the newspaper articles. Sentiment Analysis and Cognition Engine (SEANCE) was applied for the analysis of sentiment, social cognition, and social order. Bayesian correlation analysis and regression revealed positive and significant associations between function words and affective processes, between pronouns and social processes, and between negative adjectives and psychological processes of fear and disgust. Also, significant negative associations were found between polarity nouns and psychological processes of fear and disgust and between polarity verbs and psychological processes of fear and disgust. Bayes factor 10 provides strong evidence in favor of the study hypotheses. The media is influenced by the prevailing sentiments in society and reflects their perception of the current social order and beliefs. The findings provide a glimpse into the prevailing sentiment of society through the lens of media coverage.

"Prevalence of Sleep Disturbances and Sleep Quality in Chinese Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","<b>Objectives:</b> Healthcare workers (HWs) experienced high levels of work stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a high risk of sleep disturbances. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the prevalence of sleep disturbances and sleep quality in Chinese HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> English (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) and Chinese databases (WanFang, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and SinoMed) were systematically and independently searched for relevant studies published from December 1, 2019, to May 20, 2020. The pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances and sleep quality were calculated using a random-effects model. <b>Results:</b> A total of 17 studies involving 12,682 Chinese HWs were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances in Chinese HWs was 45.1% (95% CI: 37.2-53.1%). We found that the prevalence of sleep disturbances varied among frontline, infected, and non-frontline HWs (<i>Q</i> = 96.96, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); females and males (<i>Q</i> = 9.10, <i>p</i> = 0.003); studies using different assessment instruments (<i>Q</i> = 96.05, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); and studies with different sample sizes (<i>Q</i> = 5.77, <i>p</i> = 0.016) and cut-off values (<i>Q</i> = 62.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The pooled mean total score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was 9.83 (95% CI: 8.61-11.04). HWs in Wuhan had a higher total PSQI score than those in other regions (<i>Q</i> = 9.21, <i>p</i> = 0.002). <b>Conclusion:</b> Sleep disturbances were common in Chinese HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in frontline and infected HWs. Our results indicate the heavy mental health burden on HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and can provide other countries with valuable information to assist HWs during the crisis.","Xia, Chen, Liu, Luo, Guo, Liu, Zhang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.646342","20210308","COVID-19; China; healthcare workers; meta-analysis; sleep disturbances","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11678,""
"Case Report: Parental Loss and Childhood Grief During COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedent public health crisis, transforming many aspects of our daily life. Protection measures, such as social distancing, nationwide lockdowns, and restrictions on hospital visits and funerals have a serious impact on how people mourn their loved ones. The grieving process during childhood and adolescence evolves along the developmental stages and is a dynamic, non-linear process that needs time. Parental death increases the risk for psychopathology in the short and long term. We present a case of an 11-year-old girl referred to child psychiatry-liaison service by her neurologist due to peer relationship problems and sadness. Fifteen days before her first psychiatric consultation, her father suffered a myocardial infarction complicated with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and he was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Positive coping mechanisms and adaptive emotional expression strategies were explored during her consultations. Her father died 2 weeks after emergency state and nationwide lockdown was declared in Portugal, during the first COVID-19 outbreak. The family did not have the opportunity for a proper farewell, the funeral obeyed strict rules, and the patient and her family were at home, due to social distancing and school closure policies. Consultations were maintained by telephone calls and, less frequently, by face-to-face appointments. Adaptive and helpful strategies to grieve were shared with the patient and her mother. Intervention with the mother alone was also helpful. Death circumstances related to COVID-19, confinement policies, and social-economical stressors can intensify the grief experience, increasing the risk for complicated grief. Although psychiatric teleconsultation is essential during COVID-19 pandemic, it poses various limitations. Non-verbal communication clues may not be totally apprehended; it may represent a problem in the therapeutic relationship, and access to technology can be difficult for psychiatric patients and clinicians. COVID-19 pandemic policies should include mental health protection measures, which should facilitate adjusted grief responses for those who lose a loved one during this pandemic.","Santos, SÃƒÂ¡, Aguiar, Cardoso, Correia, Correia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.626940","20210308","COVID19; bereavment; child and adolescence psychiatry; childhood grief; parental death","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11679,""
"Depression Following COVID-19 Lockdown in Severely, Moderately, and Mildly Impacted Areas in China","<b>Background:</b> The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to overwhelming levels of distress as it spread rapidly from Wuhan, Hubei province to other regions in China. To contain the transmission of COVID-19, China has executed strict lockdown and quarantine policies, particularly in provinces with the highest severity (i.e., Hubei). Although the challenges faced by individuals across provinces may share some similarities, it remains unknown as to whether and how the severity of COVID-19 is related to elevation in depression. <b>Methods:</b> The present study compared depression among individuals who lived in mildly, moderately, and severely impacted provinces in China following the lockdown (<i>N</i> = 1,200) to norm data obtained from a representative sample within the same provinces in 2016 (<i>N</i> = 950), and examined demographic correlates of depression in 2020. <b>Results:</b> Residents in 2020, particularly those living in more heavily impacted provinces, reported increased levels of depression than the 2016 sample. Subsequent analyses of sub-dimensions of depression replicated the findings for depressed mood but not for positive affect, as the latter only declined among residents in the most severely impacted area. Increased depressed mood was associated with female, younger age, fewer years of education, and being furloughed from work, whereas reduced positive affect was associated with younger age and fewer years of education only. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study underscored the impact of COVID-19 on depression and suggested individual characteristics that may warrant attention.","Han, Chen, Bi, Yang, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.596872","20210308","COVID-19; depression; exposure; lockdown; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11680,""
"Technological advancements to address elderly loneliness: Practical considerations and community resilience implications for COVID-19 pandemic","Loneliness has been a known severe public health concern among the elderly population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this paper is to discuss the practicalities of using emerging technologies to address elderly loneliness and its implications and adaptations to the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019. The authors draw on examples from the literature and their own observations from working with older adults, to provide an overview of possible ways technology could help this population in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Technological advancements have offered remarkable opportunities to deliver care and maintain connections despite the need to stay physically separated. These tools can be integrated into crisis communications, public health responses, and care programs to address loneliness among the elderly. However, it must be done strategically and informed by the type of loneliness at play, environmental factors, socioeconomics, and technological literacy. Technological advancements can be a valuable tool in addressing known public health concerns, such as loneliness among the elderly populations. However, the use of this tool should be governed by the specific situation at hand, taking into consideration individual needs and environmental factors, especially the compounded effects caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Different technological programs and approaches are appropriate for different types of loneliness. For example, online therapy such as internet-based cognitive behavior therapy may mitigate loneliness caused by fear; online interaction such as videoconferencing may relieve loneliness caused by lack of social engagement. Care-providing organizations and policy makers should consider the risk of loneliness while responding to COVID-19 outbreak, particularly within elderly populations. As part of a broader plan, technological solutions as well as low-tech approaches can make a difference in mitigating loneliness. Solutions should be accessible to and usable by older adults. Provision of equipment, training, and guidance may be necessary to execute a technology-centric plan; for some communities and individuals, approaches that do not rely on advanced technology may be more effective.","Conroy, Krishnan, Mittelstaedt, Patel","https://doi.org/10.1108/wwop-07-2020-0036","20210308","COVID19; loneliness; mental health; older people; resilience; technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11681,""
"Adapting Clinical Skills to Telehealth: Applications of Affirmative Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy with LGBTQ+ Youth","Online social work services (e.g., telemental health; telebehavioral health; virtual care; telehealth) present significant opportunities for clinical social workers to provide effective care to marginalized populations, such as LGBTQ+ youth. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased focus on telehealth, and while there are excellent resources to guide ethics, standards, and legal decisions (NASW, n.d.), there is less guidance in the literature to specifically inform the adaptation of offline clinical skills to telehealth, particularly for LGBTQ+ youth. To address this gap, we present examples from our experience offering AFFIRM, an affirmative cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group intervention now being delivered through telehealth. Specifically, this paper will: (a) describe the key considerations for the delivery of CBT via telehealth to youth; (b) detail specific clinical skills and strategies to enable successful online implementation; (c) describe the adaptation approach through a case study of cognitive restructuring with a transgender youth; (d) and offer specific guidance to support clinicians to adapt their clinical skills to the virtual environment.","Craig, Iacono, Pascoe, Austin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10615-021-00796-x","20210308","Affirmative practice; Cognitive behavioral therapy; LGBTQ+ youth; Mental health; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11682,""
"Bridging the communication gap between radiographers and patients to improve chest radiography image acquisition: A multilingual solution in the COVID-19 pandemic","A chest X-ray (CXR), taken in full inspiration, is important to ensure pathology in the lungs will not be missed. To achieve this, effective communication on breathing instructions for patients is crucial. During the COVID-19 pandemic, radiographers in Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) were challenged when performing CXR for the patients whose native language is not English. Most of these patients were foreign workers living in the same dormitory which had formed the largest COVID-19 cluster in Singapore. These dormitory residents found it difficult to understand and adhere to breathing instructions, resulting in a suboptimal degree of inspiration when the CXRs were taken. This may ultimately affect the diagnostic value of the radiographs. This paper aims to share and evaluate how radiographers tackled this issue and continued to acquire fully-inspired CXR for the dormitory residents despite the language barrier. Using a combination of online survey and retrospective analysis of the rejection rates of CXR done over the period of early April to early June, a team of radiographers evaluated the effectiveness of using audio recordings in managing the issue of not achieving a fully inspired CXR for patients due to language barrier. The rejection rate for CXR due to suboptimal inspiration decreased from 26% to 9% upon implementation of the audio recordings. 92.3% of the CXRs taken within this period also fulfilled the criteria of a fully-inspired CXR, as evidenced by having at least 9 posterior ribs seen above the right hemi-diaphragm. Survey results found a fairly balanced number of radiographers who agreed and disagreed that a fully-inspired CXR was achieved for most of their patients after utilisation of translation manuals and audio recordings. After the implementation of audio recordings, the decrease in rejection rate of CXR and an audit which demonstrated that CXR quality was upheld had proven that the radiographers successfully achieved fully-inspired CXR for suspected COVID-19 patients. This confirmed that using pre-recorded audio instructions was an efficient intervention albeit being a one-way communication, leads to more accurate imaging results, aligning with existing literature on communication experiences between radiographers and patients. Moreover, the decreased rejection rate of CXRs had increased department efficiency consequently reducing departmental expenses in the long run. Given that we have an ageing population and the vast majority of the elderly converse in their various dialects, positive feedback from radiographers presented opportunities to expand the translation manual and audio recordings to include local dialects. These can be seamlessly integrated in CXR and other procedures in the hospital setting. To ensure that the translations are culturally sensitive, attention should be paid to the translation process of instructions into other languages and local dialects by enlisting the help of native speakers.","Choong, Tay, Binte Abdul Razak, Look, Sng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2021.02.004","20210308","COVID-19; Chest X-ray; Language barrier","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11683,""
"Predictors of Anxiety and Depression in Medical Professionals During the Time of COVID-19 Outbreak","The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of sociodemographic data, mental disorder history, confusion and somatic discomfort triggered by social media on anxiety and depression symptoms among medical professionals during COVID-19 outbreak. 460 participants completed online questionnaires that included sociodemographic data, mental health disorder history, an assessment of confusion and somatic discomfort triggered by social media, and psychological disturbance. Hierarchical linear regression model was adopted to analysis the data. The hierarchical linear regression model was able to explain 41.7% of variance in depression symptoms. Including: comorbidity with one mental disorder (B= 0.296, P &lt; .001), confusion (B= 0.174, P &lt; .001) and somatic discomfort (B=0.358, P&lt;.001) triggered by social media.

"COVID-19 Racial Discrimination and Depressive Symptoms among Asians Americans: Does Communication about the Incident Matter?","Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Asians in the US have experienced a spike of racism. The goal of this paper is to examine the association between racial discrimination amid COVID-19 pandemic and depressive symptoms among Asian subgroups and to test whether communications about the incident with various sources moderate this relationship. Data come from an online survey conducted among 245 Asian Americans. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. COVID-19 racial discrimination was positively associated with depressive symptoms, and this association did not vary between Chinese Americans and other Asian subgroups. Communications with a spouse/partner buffered the mental burden of racial discrimination. Those who shared their experience in online ethnic communities displayed stronger depressive symptoms than who did not. These results suggest the potential benefit of communication with a spouse/partner in mitigating the mental burden of discrimination and call for more online mental health support for Asians.","Woo, Jun","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10903-021-01167-x","20210307","Asian Americans; COVID-19; Communication about discrimination; Depressive symptoms; Racial discrimination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11685,""
"Pandemic-related emergency psychiatric presentations for self-harm of children and adolescents in 10 countries (PREP-kids): a retrospective international cohort study","To examine the differences in hospital emergency psychiatric presentations for self-harm of children and adolescents during the covid-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Retrospective cohort study. We used electronic patient records from 23 hospital emergency departments in ten countries grouped into 14 areas. We examined data on 2073 acute hospital presentations by 1795 unique children and adolescents through age 18. We examined the total number of emergency psychiatric hospital presentations and the proportion of children and adolescents presenting with severe self-harm as our two main outcome measures. In addition, we examined sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and clinical management variables for those presenting with self-harm. To compare the number of hospital presentations between 2020 and 2019 a negative binomial model was used. For other variables, individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses were carried out. Emergency psychiatric hospital presentations decreased from 1239 in 2019 to 834 in 2020, incident rate ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.62-0.73; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001.

"Pediatric emergency department utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City","This study describes the utilization of a pediatric emergency department (ED) during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the initial U.S. epicenter, including the impact on visit acuity and incidences of common diagnoses. We performed an observational retrospective review of patients younger than 18 years old seen in a New York City pediatric ED from March 7th to May 6th 2020, and during the same time period in 2018 and 2019. Demographics, visit details, diagnoses, and dispositions were compared. Validated algorithms were utilized to create practical diagnosis groupings and to determine the probability of a visit requiring emergent evaluation. ED visits during the pandemic decreased by 56% to an average daily census of 67 patients, from an anticipated 152. Admission rates rose from 13.3% to 17.4% (p&lt;0.001), and the proportion of triage Emergency Severity Index level 1 and 2 patients increased by 23.7% (p&lt;0.001). Non-emergent visits dropped from 32.3% to 27.5% (p&lt;0.001). Several common, often low-acuity diagnoses saw disproportionate reductions in visits including headache, chest pain, and minor injuries. Concerningly, visits for suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or self-harm increased by 100% (p&lt;0.001) and visits for evaluating abuse or neglect decreased by 89% (p=0.01). Pediatric ED utilization substantially deceased during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, but left relatively higher patient acuity. Healthcare systems in early epicenters must also prepare for the disproportionate impact a pandemic has on the most vulnerable pediatric patients, particularly those at risk for self-harm or abuse.","Sokoloff, Krief, Giusto, Mohaimin, Murphy-Hockett, Rocker, Williamson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.02.029","20210307","Abuse; Acuity; Behavioral health; Coronavirus; Incidence; SARS-CoV-2; Suicide; Volume","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11687,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health among 157,213 Americans","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented crisis with potential negative mental health impacts. This study used data collected via Youper, a mental health app, from February through July 2020. Youper users (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 157,213) in the United States self-reported positive and negative emotions and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. We examined emotions and symptoms before (pre), during (acute), and after (sustained) COVID-related stay-at-home orders. For changes in frequency of reported acute emotions, from the pre to acute periods, anxiety increased while tiredness, calmness, happiness, and optimism decreased. From the acute to sustained periods, sadness, depression, and gratitude increased. Anxiety, stress, and tiredness decreased. Between the pre and sustained periods, sadness and depression increased, as did happiness and calmness. Anxiety and stress decreased. Among symptom measures, anxiety increased initially, from the pre to the acute periods, but later returned to baseline. The study sample was primarily comprised of young people and women. The app does not collect racial or ethnicity data. These factors may limit generalizability. Sample size was also not consistent for all data collected. The present study suggests that although there were initial negative impacts on emotions and mental health symptoms in the first few weeks, many Americans demonstrated resilience over the following months. The impact of the pandemic on mental health may not be as severe as predicted, although future work is necessary to understand longitudinal effects as the pandemic continues.","Yarrington, Lasser, Garcia, Vargas, Couto, Marafon, Craske, Niles","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.056","20210307","anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11688,""
"Online art therapy in elementary schools during COVID-19: results from a randomized cluster pilot and feasibility study and impact on mental health","Emerging literature on the current COVID-19 crisis suggests that children may experience increased anxiety and depression as a result of the pandemic. To prevent such school and mental health-related problems, there is a timely need to develop preventive strategies and interventions to address potential negative impacts of COVID-19 on children's mental health, especially in school settings. Results from previous child clinical research indicate that art-based therapies, including mindfulness-based art therapy, have shown promise to increase children's well-being and reduce psychological distress. The goal of the present pilot and feasibility study was to compare the impact of an emotion-based directed drawing intervention and a mandala drawing intervention, on mental health in elementary school children (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22), in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both interventions were group-based and delivered online and remotely. A pilot study using a randomized cluster design was implemented to evaluate and compare both interventions in relation to child anxiety, depression, inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. Analyses of covariance revealed a significant effect of the type of drawing intervention on levels of inattention, after controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the emotion-based directed drawing group showed lower inattention scores at post-test, when compared to participants in the mandala group. Post-hoc sensitivity analyses showed significant decreases in pre-to-post scores for levels of hyperactivity for the complete sample. Overall, results from this pilot and feasibility study showed that both an emotion-based directed drawing intervention and a mandala drawing intervention may be beneficial to improve mental health in elementary school children, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. From a feasibility standpoint, results indicate that the implementation of both interventions online and remotely, through a videoconference platform, is feasible and adequate in school-based settings. Further work incorporating larger sample sizes, longitudinal data and ensuring sufficient statistical power is warranted to evaluate the long-term impact of both interventions on children's mental health.","Malboeuf-Hurtubise, LÃƒÂ©ger-Goodes, Mageau, Taylor, Herba, Chadi, LefranÃƒÂ§ois","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00367-5","20210307","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-09","",11689,""
