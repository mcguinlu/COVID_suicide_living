"Receptive Music Therapy to reduce stress and improve wellbeing in Italian Clinical Staff involved in COVID-19 Pandemic: a preliminary study","The influence of music therapy (MT) as a support intervention to reduce stress and improve wellbeing in Clinical Staff (CS) working with COVID-19 patients was evaluated  Participants were enrolled as a result of spontaneous agreement (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>34) and were given remote receptive MT intervention over a 5-week period  Their levels of tiredness, sadness, fear and worry were measured with MTC-Q1 before and after MT intervention  An immediate significant variation in the CS emotional status was observed  The results seem to confirm that in an emergency situation, it is possible to put in place a remote MT support intervention for CS exposed to highly stressful situations","Giordano, Filippo, Scarlata, Elide, Baroni, Mariagrazia, Elide, Gentile, Eleonora, Filomena, Puntillo, Brienza, Nicola, Gesualdo, Loreto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2020.101688","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: The Arts in Psychotherapy;2020.; Publication details: The Arts in Psychotherapy;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-17","",2761,""
"Evidence map on the contributions of traditional, complementary and integrative medicines for health care in times of COVID-19","Background Due to the pandemic, there is a significant interest in the therapeutic resources linked to TCIM to support potentially therapeutic research and intervention in the management of COVID-19  At the date of this evidence mapÂ´s publication, there is no evidence of specific treatments for Coronavirus - 19 (COVID-19)  This map organizes information about symptoms management (especially on dimensions related to mental health and mild viral respiratory infections, as well as immune system strengthening and antiviral activity)  Method This evidence map applies methodology developed by Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information based on the 3iE evidence gap map  A search was performed in the Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine Virtual Health Library and PubMed, using the MeSH and DeCS terms for respiratory viral diseases associated with epidemics, COVID-19 symptoms, relevant mental health topics, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions related to TCIM  Results For the map, 126 systematic reviews and controlled clinical studies were characterized, distributed in a matrix with 57 interventions (18 phytotherapy, 9 mind-body therapies, 10 traditional chinese medicine, 3 homeopathic and anthroposophic dynamized medicines and 17 supplements), and 67 outcomes (14 immunological response, 23 mental health, 25 complementary clinical management of the infection and 5 other)  Discussion The map presents an overview of possible TCIM contributions to various dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the field of mental health, and it is directed to researchers and health professionals specialized in TCIM  Most of the antiviral activity outcomes described in this map refers to respiratory viruses in general, and not specifically to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2)  This information may be useful to guide new research, but not necessarily to support a therapeutic recommendation  Finally, any suspicion of COVID-19 infection should follow the protocols recommended by the health authorities of each country/region","Portella, Caio Fabio Schlechta, Ghelman, Ricardo, Abdala, Carmen VerÃ´nica Mendes, Schveitzer, Mariana Cabral","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100473","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Integrative Medicine Research;2020.; Publication details: Integrative Medicine Research;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-17","",2762,""

"Mental health status of individuals with a mood-disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: Initial results from the COLLATE project","BACKGROUND: Physical-distancing strategies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may be particularly detrimental to the mental health of individuals with a pre-existing mood disorder. Data on the mental health status of these individuals during the current pandemic is sparse, and their current mental health needs unclear. METHOD: We characterised COVID-19 related lifestyle changes, primary concerns and psychological distress in n=1292 respondents self-reporting a mood disorder (either bipolar disorder or depressive disorder) and n=3167 respondents without any reported mental disorder from the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project; an Australian national survey launched on April 1st 2020. RESULTS: Psychological distress was heightened in the mood disorder group compared to the group with no mental disorder, with stress and depression further elevated in respondents with bipolar disorder compared to those with depressive disorder; and men with bipolar disorder having even higher levels of depression than women with bipolar disorder. Respondents with bipolar disorder were particularly concerned about financial issues associated with COVID-19 compared to those with depressive disorder and those with no mental disorder. Adverse changes to lifestyle behaviours were more prevalent in respondents with a mood disorder and linked to higher levels of distress. LIMITATIONS: Mood disorder was self-reported and was not clinically verified. CONCLUSIONS: Current psychological distress levels are elevated in individuals with mood disorder and are associated with maladaptive situational and lifestyle changes occurring in response to COVID-19.","Van Rheenen, Tamsyn E; Meyer, Denny; Neill, Erica; Phillipou, Andrea; Tan, Eric J; Toh, Wei Lin; Rossell, Susan L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.037","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord;275: 69-77, 2020 Jul 02.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;275: 69-77, 2020 Jul 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-17","",2768,""

"The ups and downs of daily life during COVID-19: Age differences in affect, stress, and positive events","Past research has linked older age with greater emotional well-being and decreased reactivity to stressors, but it is unknown whether age-related advantages in emotional well-being are maintained in the wake of COVID-19. We examined age differences in exposure and affective reactivity to daily stressors and positive events in the first several weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak. In March and April 2020, 776 adults from Canada and the U.S. ages 18-91 (mean age 45) reported COVID-19 threats at baseline, then completed nightly surveys for one week about their daily stressors, positive events, and affect. Younger age predicted more concerns about the threat of COVID-19 across multiple domains, in addition to lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and less frequent positive events. Younger adults had more non-COVID-19 daily stressors and higher perceived control over stressors, but lower perceived coping efficacy than older adults. There were no age differences in the frequency of COVID-19 daily stressors nor perceived stressor severity. Younger adults had greater reductions in negative affect on days when more positive events occurred and greater increases in negative affect on days when non-COVID-19 stressors occurred. Age moderation was attenuated for negative affective reactivity to COVID-19 stressors. Age did not moderate positive affective reactivity to daily events. In the early weeks of the pandemic, older adults showed better emotional well-being and less reactivity to stressors but did not differ from younger adults in their exposure to COVID-19 stressors. Additionally, younger adults benefited more from positive events.","Klaiber, Wen, DeLongis, Sin","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa096","20200716","aging; coronavirus; daily stress; emotions; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-17","",2771,""

"Negative cognitive and psychological correlates of mandatory quarantine during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China","Quarantine plays a key role in controlling the pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study investigated (a) the associations between mandatory quarantine status and negative cognitions (perceived discrimination because of COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection)/mental health status (emotional distress because of COVID-19, probable depression, and self-harm/suicidal ideation), (b) the associations between the negative cognitions and mental health status, and (c) potential mediations between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 24,378 students of 26 universities in 16 Chinese cities (February 1-10, 2020). Correlation coefficients, odds ratios (OR), structural equation modeling, and other statistics were used for data analysis. Mandatory quarantined status was significantly and positively associated with perceived discrimination (Cohen's d = 0.62), perceived high/very high risk of infection (OR = 1.61), emotional distress (Cohen's d = 0.46), probable depression (OR = 2.54), and self-harm/suicidal ideation (OR = 4.98). Perceived discrimination was moderately and positively associated with emotional distress (Spearman correlation = 0.44). Associations between perceived risk of infection and mental health variables were significant but relatively weak. Cross-sectional mediation models showed good model fit, but the overall indirect paths via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress only accounted for 12-15% of the total effects between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation. In conclusion, quarantined participants were more likely than others to perceive discrimination and exhibit mental distress. It is important to integrate mental health care into the planning and implementation of quarantine measures. Future longitudinal studies to explore mechanisms underlying the mental health impact of quarantines are warranted.

"COVID-19 and ageism: How positive and negative responses impact older adults and society","The disproportionately high rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health complications and mortality among older adults prompted supportive public responses, such as special senior early shopping hours and penpal programs. Simultaneously, some older adults faced neglect and blatant displays of ageism (e.g., #BoomerRemover) and were considered the lowest priority to receive health care. This article examines positive and negative responses toward older adults in the United States during the pandemic and the consequences for older adults and society using data from the pandemic in the United States (and informed by data from other countries) as well as past theorizing and empirical research on views and treatment of older adults. Specifically, positive responses can reinforce the value of older adults, improve older adults' mental and physical health, reduce ageism, and improve intergenerational relations, whereas negative responses can have the opposite effects. However, positive responses (social distancing to protect older adults from COVID-19 infection) can inadvertently increase loneliness, depression, health problems, and negative stereotyping of older adults (e.g., helpless, weak). Pressing policy issues evident from the treatment of older adults during the pandemic include health care (triaging, elder abuse), employment (layoffs, retirement), and education about ageism, as well as the intersection of ageism with other forms of prejudice (e.g., racism) that cuts across these policies.

"Factors contributing to the distress, concerns, and needs of UK Neuroscience health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 research from China suggests health care workers are at risk of distress, have specific concerns, and need support. It remains unknown whether findings are applicable to UK health care staff and whether psychological support based on generic approaches is effective. We administered an online survey at a leading neuroscience hospital in the UK to examine how individual staff characteristics contribute to distress, concerns, and interventions most valued during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a high incidence of distress, particularly in females and staff with previous mental health history. Concerns fell into three factors: 'risk of infection', 'work challenges', and 'social change', and were affected by professional role and contact with COVID-19 patients. These three factors predicted distress. Psychological support and clear updates were deemed most useful, with specific needs affected by age, professional role, and contact with COVID-19 patients. This is the first documentation of a high incidence of psychological distress predicted by three types of concerns in health care workers of a neuroscience hospital. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued were all affected by individual staff characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of providing stratified, one to one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high incidence of psychological distress in UK health care staff. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued are influenced by individual staff characteristics.

"How Have COVID-19 Isolation Policies Affected Young People's Mental Health? - Evidence From Chinese College Students","The breakout of COVID-19 has brought about huge influence on people's physic and mental health. This paper aims to investigate the mental health status of young people living in isolation due to the policy response to Coronavirus disease. Nine hundred ninety-two Chinese college students (<i>M</i>age = 19.45, <i>SD</i> = 1.41) were recruited to finish an online survey in the period of self-isolation. Seven dimensions of psychological well-being were measured, including mental status, knowledge of stress management, behavioral patterns, risk perception, academic stress, family relationships, and peer relationships. Results of cluster analysis indicated that young individuals' mental status can be divided into three groups: high-risk (<i>n</i> = 61, <i>M</i>age = 19.26, <i>SD</i> = 1.32), medium-risk (<i>n</i> = 627, <i>M</i>age = 19.43, <i>SD</i> = 1.38), and low-risk (<i>n</i> = 304, <i>M</i>age = 19.54, <i>SD</i> = 1.49). Moreover, results of multiple regression showed that the isolation policy has had a complex influence on the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 44.894, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], fear [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 30.776, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], hypochondria [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 22.530, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], depression [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 39.022, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], and neurasthenia [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 45.735, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001] via various factors.

"Addressing the Problem of Severe Underinvestment in Mental Health and Well-Being from a Human Rights Perspective","Throughout the world, mental health remains a neglected priority, low on the agenda of policy makers and funders at the national and international levels. While this is shifting somewhat, there remains a considerable need to address the underprioritization of mental health and well-being, perhaps even more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the history of mental health interventions-which have overemphasized the biomedical model and have thus resulted in coercion, denial of life in the community, and unnecessary pathologization of human experience-there is also a need to ensure that increased funding does not simply replicate these mistakes. This is particularly true in the current landscape, where efforts to &quot;scale up&quot; mental health and to reduce &quot;treatment gaps&quot; are gaining momentum and where post-pandemic responses are still being formulated. As the potential for global mechanisms for funding mental health increases, national and international funders should look to practices that are rights affirming and contextually relevant. In this paper, I explore the current landscape of mental health financing, in terms of both national resource allocation and development assistance. I then outline the momentum in global mental health that is likely to materialize through increased funding, before considering ways in which that funding might be utilized in a manner that promotes human rights.","Mahomed","https://www.google.com/search?q=Addressing+the+Problem+of+Severe+Underinvestment+in+Mental+Health+and+Well-Being+from+a+Human+Rights+Perspective.","20200716","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-17","",2780,""

"COVID-19 and the Mental Health of People From Refugee Backgrounds","Approximately 1 in 10 of the current 26 million people who are refugees reside in high-income countries. They have commonly experienced trauma related to violence, insecurity, persecution and shortage of food and medicine. Our research suggests that COVID-19 and its health and social sequalae may be triggering past traumatic reactions, exacerbating mental health problems and undermining functioning. The purpose of this article is to promptly communicate these anecdotal findings to general health practitioners to ensure informed and sensitive health care delivery to this vulnerable population.","Rees, Fisher","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731420942475","20200716","COVID-19; health and mental health; refugee","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-17","",2782,""
"Development and Clinical Evaluation of a Web-Based Upper Limb Home Rehabilitation System Using a Smartwatch and Machine Learning Model for Chronic Stroke Survivors: Prospective Comparative Study","Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have shown the feasibility of remote physical therapy at home. In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

"Fronto-Limbic Connectivity as a Predictor of Improvement in Nonsuicidal Self-Injury in Adolescents Following Psychotherapy","<b> <i>Objectives:</i> </b> Key neurobiological factors contribute to vulnerability to nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents and how they respond to treatment targeted to reduce such behaviors. This study aims to examine differences in intrinsic functional connectivity between adolescents with NSSI and healthy controls (HCs) and to identify baseline connectivity markers that predict improvements in NSSI after psychotherapy. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> Adolescents aged 12-17 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24) with repetitive NSSI along with demographically similar HCs (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16) underwent resting-state functional MRI scanning after which patients received up to 4 months of psychological treatment. A seed-based approach was used to examine baseline between-group differences in intrinsic functional connectivity of the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Further analyses examined the associations between intrinsic functional connectivity at baseline and improvement in NSSI after psychological treatment. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Compared with HCs, adolescents with NSSI showed significantly reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex, subcallosal cortex, and paracingulate gyrus, as well as between the amygdala and a cluster encompassing the right planum temporale and right insula. Adolescents with NSSI, compared with HCs, also showed reduced connectivity between the mPFC and two clusters: one located in the precentral and postcentral gyri and another in the left insula. After treatment, 50% of patients reported fewer NSSI episodes compared to baseline, which was considered as improvement. Stronger negative amygdala-prefrontal connectivity was associated with greater posttreatment improvement in NSSI. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Adolescents with NSSI may have aberrant amygdala and mPFC connectivity compared with HCs. Furthermore, stronger baseline negative amygdala-prefrontal connectivity may predict greater improvement in NSSI after psychological intervention. Given that no prior study has used resting-state functional connectivity to predict response to psychological treatment in adolescents with NSSI, replication of these findings is needed.","Santamarina-Perez, Romero, Mendez, Leslie, Packer, Sugranyes, Picado, Font, Moreno, Martinez, Morer, Romero, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1089/cap.2018.0152","20200716","NSSI; amygdala; brain connectivity; medial prefrontal cortex; psychological intervention; resting state; Adolescent; Brain; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Limbic System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Psychotherapy; Self-Injurious Behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-17","",2784,""
"Decision making and mental health across adulthood during social distancing","COVID-19-related social-distancing measures have dramatically limited physical social contact between individuals of all ages. We wondered how these new societal conditions would impact the choices of individuals of different ages given known age differences in social preferences, and if social distancing measures would have a differential emotional impact on older individuals. Early popular media reports suggested that older adults were more likely to ignore social distancing guidelines. Across two samples, we found that although older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner (i.e., temporally discount) social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, there were no adult age differences in social distancing behavior. The increased motivation for immediate social contact in older age appears to be balanced by a similarly increased motivation for physical health. Additionally, although older adults reported being more likely to contract COVID-19 and experience more severe health consequences, they experienced fewer overall COVID-19-related mental health symptoms compared to younger adults. These data contradict media anecdotes and suggest that older adults are not only similarly compliant with distancing guidelines, but also are faring relatively better emotionally during the pandemic while overall mental health issues are higher than normal in the population.","Kendra Leigh Seaman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80","20200717","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; social distancing; covid-19; temporal discounting; mental health; aging","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-17","",2785,""
"Development and validation of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS)","During respiratory viral epidemics and pandemics such as the COVD-19 pandemic, everyday behaviors such as leaving the house and touching frequently-used surfaces become the subject of fear and avoidance due to their potential for contagion. Despite the potential mental health related impact of this psychological phenomenon, there are currently no measures available that are designed to evaluate the extent to which individuals become fearful of these everyday situations during a respiratory viral pandemic. Here, we developed and assessed the psychometric properties of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS) questionnaire across two samples recruited online (ns = 243, 341) recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that the ARVIS is best described by a single factor and shows a high reliability (Chronbachâ€™s alpha > .88). It showed convergent associations with state anxiety and low discriminant associations with general trait anxiety and depression. Moreover, the ARVIS was highly associated with the extent to which subjects reported engaging in handwashing and social distancing, demonstrating criterion validity. This new scale provides a validated measure for assessing virus-related fear that can facilitate research into the psychological effects of respiratory virus pandemics.","Toby Wise et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-488-9B0","20200717","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; pandemic; fear; infection; avoidance; anxiety; covid","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-17","",2786,""
"Validation to Spanish version of the COVID-19 Stress Scale","There is a global consensus about the potential of the COVID-19 pandemic to affect people's mental health. In this context, and prior to the formulation of mitigation strategies, tools are required that allow an objective and effective assessment of mental health risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of COVID-19 Stress Scale, formulated by Taylor et al. (2020), based on the concept of COVID-19 Stress Syndrome. A national sample of 1214 participating adults was taken in Colombia, who answered a translated version of the scale. Evidence of a hexa-dimensional structure was obtained whose goodness of fit indicators were Chi2 = 1215,759, Sig. =. 000, CMIN / DF = 2.202, RMSEA = .044, NFI = .943, TLI = .964, CFI =. 968 and FMIN = 1,967. Regarding reliability, an a = .924 and Spearman-Brown = .824 were obtained for the entire scale; the reliability indicators of the 6 subscales were also high. The similarities and differences in the findings with respect to the original psychometric study of the scale are discussed, as well as the utility and importance of the instrument as a tool in future efforts to mitigate the psychosocial effects of the pandemic.","Edgar Guillermo Pulido","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-859-129","20200717","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Psychometrics; stress; covid-19; pandemic; mental health; reliability; validity","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-17","",2787,""
