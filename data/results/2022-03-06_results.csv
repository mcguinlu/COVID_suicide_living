"Rapid onset functional tic-like behaviours in children and adolescents during COVID-19: Clinical features, assessment and biopsychosocial treatment approach","To report the prevalence and clinical characteristics of children with rapid onset functional tic-like behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Single centre, retrospective cohort study of children (&lt;18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) referred to the tic clinic from January 2018 to July 2021. We calculate the prevalence of newly diagnosed functional tics, and compare the clinical features to chronic tic disorder/Tourette syndrome (CTD/TS). A total of 185 new patients were referred to the tic clinic between 2018 and 2021. There was a significant increase in the percentage of functional tics in 2020 and 2021 (2% in 2018, 5.6% in 2019, 10.6% in 2020 and 36% in 2021). Differences between functional tics (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 22) and CTD/TS (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 163) include female predominance (100 vs. 28%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), later age of onset (mean age 13.8 vs. 6.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) and higher rates of anxiety/depression (95 vs. 41%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). The functional tic group were more likely to present with coprolalia-like behaviours (77 vs. 10%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), complex phrases (45 vs. 0.6%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), copropraxia (45 vs. 2%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), self-injury (50 vs. 4%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), hospitalisation/emergency visits (36 vs. 2%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) and school absenteeism (56 vs. 7%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). A total of 18.2% of patients with functional tics reported preceding exposure to social media content involving tics. There is an increase in adolescent females presenting with rapid onset functional tic-like behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight differences in clinical features between the functional tic group and CTD/TS to aid diagnosis and management in the community. Based on our findings, we propose a mixed model of neuropsychiatric vulnerability and social media contagion in this group of adolescents with functional tics.","Han, Kozlowska, Kothur, Lorentzos, Wong, Mohammad, Savage, Chudleigh, Dale","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15932","20220305","general paediatrics; neurology; psychiatry/mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-06","",27976,""
"Rural Residents' Perinatal Experiences During the Initial Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study in British Columbia","Many studies have explored the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on perinatal health, but few have examined the effects of the pandemic on birthing families through a rural lens. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced long-standing disparities between urban and rural communities, it is important that the significance of place on the health and wellness of rural populations is made visible. In-depth interviews and focus groups with 16 participants from rural communities in British Columbia, Canada, were performed. Participants included those who had been pregnant or given birth after March 11, 2020. Data from the interviews and focus groups were analyzed using the principles of thematic analysis to understand the perinatal experiences of rural families during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of the data revealed 4 major themes: perceived risk of infection, navigating uncertainty, experience of care received, and resilience and silver linings. In general, participants conceptualized rural communities as safer bubbles. Exceptions included specific vectors of risk such as tourism travel and border communities. Challenges experienced by rural families including anxiety around changing health guidelines, reduced social support, and potential loss of their partners' support at births. Additional concerns specific to rural experiences added to this burden, including fear of traveling to referral centers for care and increased difficulties accessing resources. Participants reported positive, compassionate care experiences that helped to mitigate some of the added stressors of the pandemic. These findings highlight the importance of perinatal care provision that integrates physiologic and mental health supports. This study provides a foundation for a comprehensive inquiry into the experiences of rural perinatal services during COVID-19.","Sullivan, Cameron, Kornelsen","https://doi.org/10.1111/jmwh.13338","20220305","COVID-19; maternal health; pregnancy; qualitative; quality of health care; rural; rural health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-06","",27977,""
"The Relationship between Social Support and Postnatal Anxiety and Depression: Results from the Listening to Mothers in California Survey","Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) impact multiple domains of maternal and child well-being. Estimates of postpartum depressive symptoms range from 6.5% to 12.9% and from 8.6% to 9.9% for postpartum anxiety. We sought to identify the role social support could play in mitigating PMADs. The data are drawn from the Listening to Mothers in California survey; results are representative of women who gave birth in 2016 in a California hospital. The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 was used to assess total symptoms of PMADs and anxiety and depressive symptoms individually. Two questions adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey were used to assess emotional, practical, and functional (combined) social support. After exclusions for missing data related to PMADs or social support, we analyzed data from 2,372 women. At the time of survey administration (mean 5.7Ã‚Â months after birth), 7.0% of respondents reported elevated PMAD symptoms and 45.9% reported that they always received functional social support. In multivariable analysis, controlling for demographic and pregnancy-related factors and prenatal anxiety and depressive symptoms, women who reported consistent support had a prevalence of elevated PMAD symptoms one-half that of those who did not (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.74). This study suggests that consistent social support serves as a robust protective factor against postpartum symptoms of PMADs. Because many predictors of PMADs are not modifiable, social support stands out as an important target for programmatic intervention, particularly in light of increased isolation related to the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic.","Feinberg, Declercq, Lee, Belanoff","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2022.01.005","20220305","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-06","",27978,""
"Working mothers during COVID-19: a cross-sectional study on mental health status and associations with the receipt of employment benefits","Beyond the sweeping physiological effects of COVID-19 infections in 2020 and 2021, the psychosocial impacts of lockdowns, social distancing, and the associated disruptions to daily life have brought on a simultaneous mental health crisis, particularly among many working mothers who are disproportionately balancing childcare, virtual schooling, and employment vulnerability. The aim of this study was to measure the mental health status of working mothers in the United States and associations with the provision of family-friendly employment benefits one year into the pandemic. Cross-sectional data were collected from a sample of working mothers in the U.S. using an online survey of mental health status and the receipt of employer-provided family-friendly benefits. Mental health was measured with the Kessler 6 (K-6) and the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental WellbeingÃ‚Â Scale (SWEMWBS). Perceived helpfulness of benefits was assessed through self-reported Likert-scale scores of 0 (not at all helpful) to 4 (extremely helpful) to determine mean helpfulness scores for benefit types. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between receipt of employment benefits and serious mental illness (SMI). A total of 728 participants met the study criteria, 83.7% were non-Hispanic/Latino white and 61.1% were 35-44Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age. Among study participants, 54.3% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°395) and 21.8% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°159) reported psychological distress levels associated with moderate mental illness (MMI) and serious mental illness (SMI), respectively. Not receiving benefits was associated with a 50% increase in odds of SMI (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.50, 95% CI [1.03-2.20], pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.036). Benefits perceived to be the most helpful for participants were flexible hours/schedule (3.5; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.9), flexible work location (3.3; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.1), and supplemental paid time off (3.1; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.1), with mean scores above very helpful. Results suggest employment benefits may help support the mental health of working mothers and provide a call to action to employers and policy stakeholders to develop solutions addressing gaps in workplace benefits and mental health support for working parents, with sustainable reform in mind to mitigate employment benefit inequities exposed by the pandemic.","Kirwin, Ettinger","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12468-z","20220305","COVID-19; Employment benefits; Family friendly benefits; Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6); Mental health; Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS); Working mothers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-06","",27979,""
"Exploring the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Male Mental Health Emergencies Attended by Ambulances During the First National ""Lockdown"" in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated mitigation strategies such as ""lockdown"" are having widespread adverse psychological effects, including increased levels of anxiety and depression. Most research using self-reported data highlights the pandemic's impact on the psychological well-being of females, whereas data for mental health emergency presentations may reflect the impact on male mental health more accurately. We analyzed records of male mental health emergencies occurring in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom during the first national ""lockdown."" We computed two binary logistic regression models to (a) compare male mental health emergencies occurring during ""lockdown,"" 2020 (5,779) with those occurring in the same period in 2019 (<i>N</i> = 4,744) and (b) compare male (<i>N</i> = 5,779) and female (<i>N</i> = 7,695) mental health emergencies occurring during ""lockdown."" Comparisons considered the characteristics of mental health emergencies recorded by ambulance clinicians (Primary Impressions), and the socioeconomic characteristics of communities where emergencies use the Index of Multiple Deprivation. We found that during ""lockdown,"" male emergencies were more likely to involve acute anxiety (odds ratio [OR]: 1.42) and less likely to involve intentional drug overdose (OR: 0.86) or attempted suicide (OR: 0.71) compared with 2019. Compared with females, male emergencies were more likely to involve acute behavioral disturbance (OR: 1.99) and less likely to involve anxiety (OR: 0.67), attempted suicide (OR: 0.83), or intentional drug overdose (OR: 0.76).

"Prevalence of Suicidality and its Association with Quality of Life in Older Patients with Clinically Stable Psychiatric Disorders in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The pattern of suicidality in older patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic is not clear. This study examined the prevalence of suicidality and its association with quality of life (QOL) among older clinically stable patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. A multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted from May 22 to July 15, 2020, among four major tertiary psychiatric hospitals in China. Suicidality was assessed by asking 3 standardized questions. Depressive symptoms, pain, and QOL were assessed with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-brief version, respectively. A total of 1063 clinically stable patients participated and completed the assessment. The prevalence of suicidality was 11.8% (95% CI: 9.9%-13.7%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that poor treatment adherence (P = .009, OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.17-2.96) and perceived illness worsening during the COVID-19 outbreak (P = .02, OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.15-3.73), being diagnosed with major depressive disorder (P &lt; .001, OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.68-4.64), PHQ-9 total score (P &lt; .001, OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.15-1.24) and NPRS total score (P = .002, OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06-1.29) were associated with higher risk of suicidality. After controlling for covariates, older psychiatric patients with suicidality had lower QOL compared to those without (F<sub>(1, 1063)</sub> =16.5, P&lt;.001). Suicidality was common in older patients with clinically stable psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering its negative impact on QOL and personal suffering, routine screening and preventive suicide measures should be implemented for older psychiatric patients.","Liu, Xu, Zou, Li, Wang, Yan, Du, Zhang, Zhang, Li, Cheung, Ungvari, Ng, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1177/08919887221078557","20220305","COVID-19; older patients; psychiatric disorder; quality of life; suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-06","",27981,""

"Network Analysis of Depression, Anxiety, Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms, Insomnia, Pain, and Fatigue in Clinically Stable Older Patients With Psychiatric Disorders During the COVID-19 Outbreak","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profound negative effects on the mental health of clinically stable older patients with psychiatric disorders. This study examined the influential nodes of psychiatric problems and their associations in this population using network analysis. Clinically stable older patients with psychiatric disorders were consecutively recruited from four major psychiatric hospitals in China from May 22 to July 15, 2020. Depressive and anxiety syndromes (depression and anxiety hereafter), insomnia, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), pain, and fatigue were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia Severity Index, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version, and Numeric Rating Scales for pain and fatigue, respectively. A total of 1063 participants were included. The network analysis revealed that depression was the most influential node followed by anxiety as indicated by the centrality index of strength. In contrast, the edge connecting depression and anxiety was the strongest edge, followed by the edge connecting depression and insomnia, and the edge connecting depression and fatigue as indicated by edge-weights. The network structure was invariant by gender based on the network structure invariance test (M = .14, <i>P</i> = .20) and global strength invariance tests (S = .08, <i>P</i> = .30).

"Sleep Disturbances and Their Association With Quality of Life in Older Psychiatric Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quality of clinically stable psychiatric patients is unknown. This study examined the prevalence of sleep disturbances and their association with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable older psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. This multicenter, cross-sectional study involved older patients attending maintenance treatment at outpatient departments of four major psychiatric hospitals in China. Patients' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. Sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and QOL were assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and 2 items of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief version, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the independent associations of socio-demographic and clinical variables with sleep disturbances, while the association between sleep disturbances and QOL was explored with analysis of covariance. A total of 941 patients were recruited. The prevalence of sleep disturbances was 57.1% (95% CI: 53.9-60.2%). Analysis of covariance revealed that QOL was significantly lower in patients with sleep disturbances compared to those without. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbances were positively and independently associated with more severe depressive symptoms (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.26-1.37). Compared to patients with major depressive disorder, those with other psychiatric diagnoses had a significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.00-2.08).

"The Association Between Men's Mental Health During COVID-19 and Deterioration in Economic Status","This study investigated associations among economic status deterioration, mental health, and gender during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,807 participants completed an online questionnaire that included demographic variables and questions measuring three mental health variables: psychological distress (as measured by symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress), adjustment disorder, and emotional eating. Results indicated that women reported higher mental health impairment than men. Men and women whose economic status significantly deteriorated because of the COVID-19 pandemic reported greater mental health impairment than those whose economic status did not significantly deteriorate. However, men whose economic status significantly deteriorated reported high mental health impairment (emotional eating and adjustment difficulties) similar to women in the same situation. This change in men's reporting pattern suggests that the economic impact of COVID-19 severely impacted their mental health and affected how they view their masculinity, which, in turn, further impaired their mental health. As the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant impact on mental health worldwide, it is important to identify individuals and groups who are at high risk of mental health impairment. The current study demonstrates that men's distress, which is frequently complex to identify, can be detected using standardized measures and analyzing these according to changes in reporting patterns as opposed to simply examining means and frequencies. The results suggest that the COVID-19 crisis may provide an opportunity to understand more about mental health, in particular, that of men.","Hadar-Shoval, Alon-Tirosh, Asraf, Tannous-Haddad, Tzischinsky","https://doi.org/10.1177/15579883221082427","20220305","COVID-19; economic change; emotional eating; menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mental health; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-06","",27985,""
