"Refining long-COVID by a prospective multimodal evaluation of patients with long-term symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection","Background: COVID-19 long-haulers or long-COVID represent 10% of COVID-19 patients and remain understudied. Methods: In this prospective study, we recruited 30 consecutive patients seeking medical help for persistent symptoms (> 30 days) attributed to COVID-19. All reported a viral illness compatible with COVID-19. The patients underwent a multi-modal evaluation including clinical, psychological, virological, specific immunological assays and were followed longitudinally. Results The median age was 40 [interquartile range: 35-54] and 18 (60%) were female. After a median time of 152 [102-164] days after symptom onset, fever, cough and dyspnea were less frequently reported as compared with the initial presentation, but paresthesia and burning pain emerged in 18 (60%) and 13 (43%) patients, respectively. The clinical examination was unremarkable in all patients although the median fatigue and pain visual analogic scales were 7 [5-8] and 5 [2-6], respectively. Extensive biological studies were unremarkable, as were multiplex cytokine and ultra-sensitive interferon-a2 measurements. At this time, nasopharyngeal swab and stool RT-PCR were negative for all tested patients. Using SARS-CoV-2 serology and IFN-{gamma} ELISPOT, we found evidence of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in 50% (15/30) of patients, with objective evidence of lack or waning of immune response in two. Finally, psychiatric evaluation showed that 11 (36.7%), 13 (43.3%) and 9 (30%) patients had a positive screening for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively. Conclusions Half of patients seeking medical help for long-COVID lack SARS-CoV-2 immunity. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity did not cluster clinically or biologically long haulers, who reported severe fatigue, altered quality of life, and exhibited psychological distress.","Marc SCHERLINGER; Renaud Felten; Floriane Gallais; Charlotte Nazon; Emmanuel Chatelus; Luc Pijnenburg; Amaury Mengin; Adrien Gras; Pierre Vidailhet; Rachel Arnould-Michel; Sabrina Bibi-triki; Raphael Carapito; Seiamak Bahram; sophie trouillet-assant; Magali Perret; Alexandre Belot; Laurent Arnaud; Jacques-Eric Gottenberg; Samira Fafi-Kremer; Jean Sibilia","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.08.21255167","20210413","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12824,""
"Evaluation of stress, burnout and hair cortisol levels in health workers at a University Hospital during COVID-19 pandemic","In the critical context of COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers are on the front line, participating directly in the care, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with COVID-19. This exposes them to a higher risk of developing chronic stress, psychological distress, and any other mental health symptoms. to evaluate stress and burnout in a health workers population and, in addition, to measure hair cortisol concentration as a current biomarker of stress. 234 health workers from Hospital de ClÃƒÂ­nicas &quot;JosÃƒÂ© de San MartÃƒÂ­n&quot;, Buenos Aires University, were included in this study. In this population hair samples were obtained from the posterior vertex as close to the scalp as possible and the individuals completed the following surveys: perceived stress, social support, burnout scale, life event scale, and sociodemographic data. Hair cortisol was measured by an automated chemiluminescent method. The studied population was divided into three groups considering those individuals below the healthy reference sample range (&lt;Ã‚Â 40Ã‚Â pg/mg hair), within the healthy reference range (40-128Ã‚Â pg/mg hair) and above the reference range (&gt;Ã‚Â 128Ã‚Â pg/mg hair). This study used a transversal and observational design. Our results show that 40% of the studied population presented hair cortisol values outside of the healthy reference range. In the whole studied population, a direct correlation was found between hair cortisol concentration and perceived stress as well as between hair cortisol concentration and the emotional exhaustion component of burnout (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.142, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.030; rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.143, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.029, respectively). 12% of the studied population showed Burnout (52% doctors and residents, 19% nurses, 19% administrative personnel). Higher values in hair cortisol levels were found in the group with burnout versus individuals without burnout (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.034). Finally, a mediation analysis was performed, finding that depersonalization is a mediating variable in the relationship between self-perceived stress and hair cortisol level (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.86, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0086; indirect effect IC: 0.0987-1.8840). This is the first study in which a stress biomarker such as hair cortisol is evaluated in this population and in this context. Healthcare workers are subjected to increased levels of stress and burnout. High depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and decreased personal sense of accomplishment characterize this population. It is the responsibility of the health authorities to implement strategies to manage this psychological emergency.","Ibar, Fortuna, Gonzalez, Jamardo, Jacobsen, Pugliese, Giraudo, Ceres, Mendoza, Repetto, Reboredo, Iglesias, Azzara, Berg, Zopatti, Fabre","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105213","20210412","Burnout; COVID-19; Hair cortisol; Healthcare workers; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12825,""
"Electroconvulsive therapy services during COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) services hard worldwide as it is considered an elective procedure and hence has been given less importance. Other reasons include the risk of transmission of infections, lack of resources, and the scarcity of anesthesiologists due to their diversion to intensive care units to manage COVID-19 patients. However, ECT is an urgent and life-saving measure for patients diagnosed with depression and other severe mental illnesses who have suicidality, catatonia, or require a rapid therapeutic response. COVID-19 pandemic is a significant source of stress for individuals due to its impact on health, employment, and social support resulting in new-onset psychiatric illnesses and the worsening of a pre-existing disorder. Hence, a continuation of the ECT services during the COVID-19 pandemic is of paramount importance. In this narrative review, the authors from India have compiled the literature on the ECT practice during the COVID-19 pandemic related to the screening and testing protocol, necessity of personal protective equipment, modification in ECT Suite, electrical stmulus settings, and anesthesia technique modification. The authors have also shared their experiences with the ECT services provided at their institute during this pandemic. This description will help other institutes to manage the ECT services uninterruptedly and make ECT a safe procedure during the current pandemic.","Surve, Sinha, Baliga, M, Karan, Jl, Arumugham, Thirthalli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102653","20210412","Anesthesia; COVID-19; ECT practice; Personal protective equipment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12826,""
"Depression, Anxiety, Resilience, and Coping: The Experience of Pregnant and New Mothers During the First Few Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> It is well-documented that the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women is essential for maternal, child, and family well-being. Of major public health concern is the perinatal mental health impacts that may occur during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is essential to explore the symptom experience and predictors of mental health status, including the relationship between media use and mental health. <b> <i>Materials and Methods:</i> </b> The purpose of this study is to evaluate the experiences of pregnant and postpartum women (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°524) in the United States in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online observational study collected psychosocial quantitative and qualitative survey data in adult pregnant and postpartum (up to 6 months postdelivery) women in April-June 2020. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Multivariable linear regression models were used to evaluate predictors of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The most common predictors were job insecurity, family concerns, eating comfort foods, resilience/adaptability score, sleep, and use of social and news media. Qualitative themes centered on pervasive uncertainty and anxiety; grief about losses; gratitude for shifting priorities; and use of self-care methods including changing media use. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> This study provides information to identify risk for anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms in perinatal women during acute public health situations. Women with family and job concerns and low resilience/adaptability scores seem to be at high risk of psychological sequelae. Although use of social media is thought to improve social connectedness, our results indicate that increased media consumption is related to increased anxiety symptoms.","Kinser, Jallo, Amstadter, Thacker, Jones, Moyer, Rider, Karjane, Salisbury","https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2020.8866","20210412","COVID; anxiety; depression; experience; pandemic; postpartum; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12827,""

"COVID-19 Public Health Restrictions and Older Adults' Well-being in Uganda: Psychological Impacts and Coping Mechanisms","<b>Objectives</b>: Older adults across the globe have been particularly affected by the novel coronavirus due to their increased susceptibility to the virus. With limited existing research, the aim of this study was to explore the psychological effects of COVID-19 public health measures on older adults in Uganda and their coping mechanisms.<b>Methods</b>: Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with older Ugandans (aged 60+) in June 2020. Participants were asked about their experiences of public health measures, and their effects on the lives of older adults compared to pre-pandemic.<b>Results</b>: Three themes were identified: Impact on emotional well-being; Implications on physical well-being; and Coping mechanisms. Older adults experienced both psychological and physical effects, including upset, fear, and frustration about restrictions and the virus, as well as early signs of increased frailty, thus causing concerns for the long-term emotional and physical health of older Ugandans.<b>Conclusions</b>: Public health measures need to be considerate of the potential long-term implications on the well-being of older adults in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, and ensure the possibility for continued physical exercise and social connection. This can be particularly challenging for people from more disadvantaged backgrounds who may not be able to afford a smartphone or laptop, with older adults further requiring support in using digital technologies.<b>Clinical Implications</b>: Older adults need to receive adequate psychological support to cope with the mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Giebel, Ivan, Ddumba","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2021.1910394","20210412","Ageing; COVID-19; LMIC; Older adult; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12831,""
"Alleviating psychological distress and promoting mental wellbeing among adolescents living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, during and after COVID-19","COVID-19 social control measures (e.g. physical distancing and lockdowns) can have both immediate (social isolation, loneliness, anxiety, stress) and long-term effects (depression, post-traumatic stress disorder) on individuals' mental health. This may be particularly true of adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) and their caregivers - populations already overburdened by intersecting stressors (e.g. psychosocial, biomedical, familial, economic, social, or environmental). Addressing the adverse mental health sequelae of COVID-19 among ALHIV requires a multi-dimensional approach that at once (a) economically empowers ALHIV and their households and (b) trains, mentors, and supervises community members as lay mental health services providers. Mental health literacy programming can also be implemented to increase mental health knowledge, reduce stigma, and improve service use among ALHIV. Schools and HIV care clinics offer ideal environments for increasing mental health literacy and improving access to mental health services.","Okumu, Nyoni, Byansi","https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1912137","20210412","Adolescents; COVID-19; HIV; mental health; sub-Saharan Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12832,""
"Women perception of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy and subsequent maternal anxiety: a prospective observational study","The use of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine in pregnant women is controversial and still not performed in Italy. Our objective was to evaluate the propensity of a population of Italian women to receive the vaccine and its psychological impact. A prospective, observational study was performed on pregnant women attending Ospedale Cristo Re UniversitÃƒ Roma TorVergata. A multi-section questionnaire was sent to each included woman on the first day of available SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Part-A was finalized to acquire maternal characteristics and to test the women's perception of vaccinations in pregnancy and their fear-induced by vaccines. Part-B included the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory (STAI) a validated test for scoring trait anxiety (basal anxiety, STAI-T) and state anxiety (STAI-S). An abnormal value of STAI was considered when Ã¢â€°Â¥40. Comparisons of maternal variables were performed according to their vaccine attitude. The questionnaire was completed by 161 women (80.5% of the population considered). A positive attitude toward the vaccine was present in 136 (84.5%) women (positive) while the remaining 25.5% considered the vaccine not useful (negative). Among the former group 52.9% were favorable to obtain the vaccine during pregnancy despite the current national limitations, a percentage significantly higher (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02) than in the negative groups. Women with a negative attitude to the vaccine had a lower educational (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002) and employment level (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.016) when compared to the positive group. In all the women a significant increase of STAI-S from STAI-T values was evidenced (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001). The incidence of abnormal STAI T values (basal anxiety) was similar between the 2 groups (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.81), while there was a significant increase of STAI-S values in the negative group (negative 88.0%; vs positive 63.4%; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.018).

"Determining Anxiety Levels and Related Factors in Operating Room Nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A descriptive study","Healthcare professionals responsible for care and treatment during outbreaks are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress. This study investigated operating room nurses' anxiety levels and related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research was conducted between July and September 2020. The sample consisted of 192 operating room nurses. Data were collected using a descriptive questionnaire and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Participants had moderate levels of anxiety. The risk factors associated with high levels of anxiety included having chronic diseases, working with patients causing worry, fear of contracting COVID-19 and transmitting it to loved ones, incompetence of hospitals in managing the pandemic, lack of support from hospital managers, taking few breaks, and working long shifts due to preventive measures at the workplace. The results show that operating room nurses have had moderate anxiety levels since the onset of the pandemic. Therefore, it is critical to regularly identify and meet their mental and emotional needs to implement early preventive interventions. Identifying risk factors will help recognize anxiety in operating room nurses and take measures to protect their mental health while working with high-risk patients in different clinics during the pandemic.

"Psychological resilience, coping behaviours, and social support among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review of quantitative studies","To appraise and synthesize studies examining resilience, coping behaviours, and social support among healthcare workers during the coronavirus pandemic. A wide range of evidence has shown that healthcare workers, currently on the frontlines in the fight against COVID-19, are not spared from the psychological and mental health-related consequences of the pandemic. Studies synthesizing the role of coping behaviours, resilience, and social support in safeguarding the mental health of healthcare workers during the pandemic is largely unknown. This is a systematic review with a narrative synthesis. A total of 31 articles were included in the review. Healthcare workers utilized both problem-centred and emotion-centred coping to manage the stress-associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Coping behaviours, resilience, and social support were associated with positive mental and psychological health outcomes. Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of coping behaviours, resilience, and social support to preserve psychological and mental health among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to safeguard the mental health of healthcare workers during the pandemic, hospital and nursing administrators should implement proactive measures to sustain resilience in HCWs, build coping skills, and implement creative ways to foster social support in healthcare workers through theory-based interventions, supportive leadership, and fostering a resilient work environment.","Labrague","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13336","20210412","COVID-19; coping; healthcare workers; mental health; psychological resilience; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12835,""

A cross-sectional, one-time online survey was completed by racial/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse students in 9th through 12th grade at 2 semi-rural Georgia public high schools (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 761). Overall, almost one-fourth of high school students were extremely or very worried about the pandemic, with higher rates of worry among students who are racial/ethnic minorities, lower SES, female and in older grades. Results indicated a concerning impact on the stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness that students are feeling, particularly among girls and those in older grades. Students of color and low SES, who are already disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, are also more likely to experience mental health challenges. Findings highlight important demographic differences of the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of high school students and have implications for schools with addressing these needs.","Gazmararian, Weingart, Campbell, Cronin, Ashta","https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.13007","20210412","COVID-19; adolescents; coronavirus; health disparities; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12836,""
"Boosting Nitric Oxide in Stress and Respiratory Infection: Potential Relevance for Asthma and COVID-19","Nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous signaling molecule that is critical for supporting a plethora of processes in biological organisms. Among these, its role in the innate immune system as a first line of defense against pathogens has received less attention. In asthma, levels of exhaled NO have been utilized as a window into airway inflammation caused by allergic processes. However, respiratory infections count among the most important triggers of disease exacerbations. Among the multitude of factors that affect NO levels are psychological processes. In particular, longer lasting states of psychological stress and depression have been shown to attenuate NO production. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has caused a pandemic, and with that, sustained levels of psychological stress globally, also adversely affects NO signaling. We review evidence on the role of NO in respiratory infection, including COVID-19, and stress, and argue that boosting NO bioavailability may be beneficial in protection from infections, thus benefitting individuals who suffer from stress in asthma or SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ritz, Salsman, Young, Lippert, Khan, Ginty","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100255","20210412","SARS-CoV-2; asthma; dietary nitrate; nitric oxide; nitric oxide donor; psychological stress; respiratory infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12837,""

"A multi-center survey on the postpartum mental health of mothers and attachment to their neonates during COVID-19 in Hubei Province of China","There is an emerging literature on the mental health of both pre- and post-partum mothers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As of April 1, 2020, 23 mothers confirmed with COVID-19, 15 mothers suspected with COVID-19 but with negative polymerase chain reaction tests, and 33 mothers without COVID-19 (Control Group) were recruited for a study from Hubei Province in China. The Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS), the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale were applied to investigate the attachment of mothers to their neonates and the postpartum mental health of mothers within the first 3 months after delivery (between 20 to 89 days). The period of mother-child separation among the confirmed group (33.9Ã‚Â±20.9 days) was significantly longer than that of suspected group (16.7Ã‚Â±12.2 days) and control group (10.7Ã‚Â±8.4 days). The total score of the MPAS in mothers confirmed with COVID-19 (45.5Ã‚Â±4.2) was significantly lower (indicating less mother-child attachment) than that in the suspected (50.5Ã‚Â±4.7) and control (48.8Ã‚Â±4.6) groups. A negative correlation was noted between the mother-child separation time and the MPAS scores, including the subscale scores of attachment (MPAS acore: Spearman's ÃÂ =-0.33, 95% CI: -0.095 to -0.538, P=0.005; Subscale score of attachment: Spearman's ÃÂ =-0.40, 95% CI: -0.163 to -0.592, P=0.001). The incidence of postpartum anxiety in the confirmed, suspected and control groups was 4.3%, 6.7% and 12.1%, respectively; and the incidence of postpartum depression was 39.1%, 33.3% and 30.3%, respectively. No significant difference was found with regards to maternal postpartum anxiety and depression among the three groups. Decreased mother-child attachment found among mothers confirmed with COVID-19, indicates that further intervention is needed to ensure mother-child interaction to appropriately develop attachment. Mother-child attachment experienced disruption due to prolonged mother-child separation necessitated by the COVID-19 management protocol, which needs to be revised to reduce prolonged mother-child separation. Additionally, mothers with and without COVID-19 suffered a high incidence of depression, which warrants further mental health investment for pregnant mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Peng, Zhang, Liu, Huang, Noble, Yang, Lu, Luo, Zhu, Cao, Liu, Chen, Zhang, Xia, Narayan","https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-6115","20210412","COVID-19; attachment; mental health; postnatal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12839,""
"Increased Screen Time Is Associated With Alcohol Desire and Sweetened Foods Consumption During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Elevated screen time has been associated with addictive behaviors, such as alcohol and sugar intake and smoking. Considering the substantial increase in screen time caused by social isolation policies, this study aimed to analyze the association of increased screen time in different devices during the COVID-19 pandemic with consumption and increased desire of alcohol, smoking, and sweetened foods in adults. <b>Methods:</b> A sample of 1,897 adults with a mean age of 37.9 (13.3) years was assessed by an online survey, being composed by 58% of women. Participants were asked whether screen time in television, cell phone, and computer increased during the pandemic, as well as how much time is spent in each device. Closed questions assessed the frequency of alcohol and sweetened food consumption, smoking, and an increased desire to drink and smoke during the pandemic. Educational level, age, sex, feeling of stress, anxiety, depression, and use of a screen device for physical activity were covariates. Binary logistic regression models considered adjustment for covariates and for mutual habits. <b>Results:</b> Increased television time was associated with increased desire to drink (OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.12; 1.89) and increased sweetened food consumption (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.18; 1.99), while an increase in computer use was negatively associated with consumption of alcohol (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53; 0.86) and sweetened foods (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62; 0.98). Increased cell phone time was associated with increased sweetened food consumption during the pandemic (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.18; 2.67). Participants with increased time in the three devices were less likely to consume sweetened foods for Ã¢â€°Â¥5 days per week (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.39; 0.99) but were twice as likely to have sweetened food consumption increased during pandemic (OR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.07; 3.88). <b>Conclusion:</b> Increased screen time was differently associated with consumption and desire for alcohol and sweets according to screen devices. Increased time in television and cell phones need to be considered for further investigations of behavioral impairments caused by the pandemic.","Tebar, Christofaro, Diniz, Lofrano-Prado, Botero, Correia, Cucato, Ritti-Dias, do Prado","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.630586","20210412","COVID-19; dietary pattern; pandemic; sedentary behavior; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12840,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Primary Care General Practice Consultations in a Teaching Hospital in Shanghai, China","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus disease) pandemic is deeply concerning because of its massive mortality and morbidity, creating adverse perceptions among patients likely to impact on their overall medical care. Thus, we evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of primary care consultations within a Shanghai health district. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective observational cohort study was performed, with data analyzed concerning the pattern of patient visits to general practitioners within the Tongren Hospital network (the sole provider of general practice to the population of 700,000). Data from all general practice consultations for adults were collected for the first 6 months of 2020, which included a 60-day lockdown period (January 24-March 24, 2020) and compared to corresponding data from the first 6 months of 2019. We evaluated changes to the numbers and patterns of primary care consultations, including subgroup analysis based on age, sex, and primary diagnosis. <b>Results:</b> A substantial reduction in patient visits, associated with increased median age, was observed during the first wave of the pandemic in the first 6 months of 2020, compared to the same interval during 2019. Additionally, reduced reappointments and waiting times, but increased costs per visit were observed. When analyzed by primary disease diagnosis, patient visits were reduced for all the major systems. The most striking visit reductions were in cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, and gastrointestinal diseases. However, psychological disorders were increased following lockdown, but there was also a dramatic fall in consultations for depression. Reduced monthly patient numbers correlated with both rate of reappointment and average waiting time during the first 6 months of both 2019 and 2020, but an inverse correlation was observed between cost per visit and monthly patient numbers. Specifically during the lockdown period, there was ~50% reduced patient visits. <b>Conclusions:</b> The lockdown has had a serious impact on patients' physical and psychological health. Our analysis provides objective health-related data that may inform the current controversy concerning the balance between the detrimental effects of the use of lockdown vs. the use of a more targeted approach to eliminate viral transmission. These data may improve decision-making in medical practice, policy, and education.","Xu, Fan, Ding, Feng, Tao, Zhou, Qian, Tao, Hambly, Bao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.642496","20210412","COVID-19; GP; demographic pattern; lockdown; primary care; psychological disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12841,""
"Drastic Reductions in Mental Well-Being Observed Globally During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results From the ASAP Survey","Most countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have repeatedly restricted public life to control the contagion. However, the health impact of confinement measures is hitherto unclear. We performed a multinational survey investigating changes in mental and physical well-being (MWB/PWB) during the first wave of the pandemic. A total of 14,975 individuals from 14 countries provided valid responses. Compared to pre-restrictions, MWB, as measured by the WHO-5 questionnaire, decreased considerably during restrictions (68.1 Ã‚Â± 16.9 to 51.9 Ã‚Â± 21.0 points). Whereas 14.2% of the participants met the cutoff for depression screening pre-restrictions, this share tripled to 45.2% during restrictions. Factors associated with clinically relevant decreases in MWB were female sex (odds ratio/OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.11-1.29), high physical activity levels pre-restrictions (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.16-1.42), decreased vigorous physical activity during restrictions (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05-1.23), and working (partially) outside the home vs. working remotely (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16-1.44/OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.23-1.47). Reductions, although smaller, were also seen for PWB. Scores in the SF-36 bodily pain subscale decreased from 85.8 Ã‚Â± 18.7% pre-restrictions to 81.3 Ã‚Â± 21.9% during restrictions. Clinically relevant decrements of PWB were associated with female sex (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.50-1.75), high levels of public life restrictions (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.18-1.36), and young age (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.19). Study findings suggest lockdowns instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic may have had substantial adverse public health effects. The development of interventions mitigating losses in MWB and PWB is, thus, paramount when preparing for forthcoming waves of COVID-19 or future public life restrictions.","Wilke, Hollander, Mohr, Edouard, Fossati, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Gross, SÃƒÂ¡nchez RamÃƒÂ­rez, LaiÃƒÂ±o, Tan, Pillay, Pigozzi, Jimenez-Pavon, Sattler, Jaunig, Zhang, van Poppel, Heidt, Willwacher, Vogt, Verhagen, Hespanhol, Tenforde","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.578959","20210412","SF-36; WHO-5; coronavirus; lockdowns; pain; psychological health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12842,""
"Inner Harmony as an Essential Facet of Well-Being: A Multinational Study During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to explore the role of two models of well-being in the prediction of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely PERMA and mature happiness. According to PERMA, well-being is mainly composed of five elements: positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning in life, and achievement. Instead, mature happiness is understood as a positive mental state characterized by inner harmony, calmness, acceptance, contentment, and satisfaction with life. Rooted in existential positive psychology, this harmony-based happiness represents the result of living in balance between positive and negative aspects of one's life. We hypothesized that mature happiness would be a more prominent protective factor during the present pandemic than the PERMA composite. A total of 12,203 participants from 30 countries responded to an online survey including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the PERMA-Profiler, and the Mature Happiness Scale-Revised (MHS-R). Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that PERMA and mature happiness were highly correlated, but nonetheless, they represented two separate factors. After controlling for demographic factors and country-level variables, both PERMA Well-being and MHS-R were negative predictors of psychological distress. Mature happiness was a better predictor of stress, anxiety, and general distress, while PERMA showed a higher prediction of depression. Mature happiness moderated the relation between the perceived noxious effects of the pandemic and all markers of distress (depression, anxiety, stress, and total DASS-21). Instead, PERMA acted as a moderator in the case of depression and stress. These findings indicate that inner harmony, according to the mature happiness theory, is an essential facet of well-being to be taken into consideration. The results of this study can also orient policies aimed to alleviate the negative effects of the pandemic on mental health through the promotion of well-being.","Carreno, Eisenbeck, PÃƒÂ©rez-Escobar, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Montes","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648280","20210412","COVID-19; PERMA; existential positive psychology; inner harmony; mature happiness; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12843,""
"Assistive Technologies in Dementia Care: An Updated Analysis of the Literature","<b>Objectives:</b> Technology can assist and support both people with dementia (PWD) and caregivers. Recently, technology has begun to embed remote components. Timely with respect to the pandemic, the present work reviews the most recent literature on technology in dementia contexts together with the newest studies about technological support published until October 2020. The final aim is to provide a synthesis of the timeliest evidence upon which clinical and non-clinical decision-makers can rely to make choices about technology in the case of further pandemic waves. <b>Methods:</b> A review of reviews was performed alongside a review of the studies run during the first pandemic wave. PsycInfo, CINAHL, and PubMed-online were the databases inspected for relevant papers published from January 2010. <b>Results:</b> The search identified 420 articles, 30 of which were reviews and nine of which were new studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Studies were first sorted according to the target population, then summarized thematically in a narrative synthesis. The studies targeting technologies for PWD were categorized as follows: monitoring and security purposes, sustaining daily life, and therapeutic interventions. Each category showed potential benefits. Differently, the interventions for caregivers were classified as informative, psycho-education programs, psychosocial-supportive, therapeutic, and cognitive/physical training. Benefits to mental health, skills learning, and social aspects emerged. <b>Conclusions:</b> The evidence shows that technology is well-accepted and can support PWD and caregivers to bypass physical and environmental problems both during regular times and during future pandemic waves. Nevertheless, the lack of a common methodological background is revealed by this analysis. Further and more standardized research is necessary to improve the implementation of technologies in everyday life while respecting the necessary personalization.","PappadÃƒÂ , Chattat, Chirico, Valente, Ottoboni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.644587","20210412","COVID-19 pandemic; caregivers; dementia; psychology; quality of life; technology-assistive/supportive","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12844,""
"Depression and Anxiety Among Quarantined People, Community Workers, Medical Staff, and General Population in the Early Stage of COVID-19 Epidemic","<b>Background:</b> We described the prevalence of anxiety and depression related to COVID-19 pandemic among different types of population and examined their potential risk factors. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect demographic characteristics, exposure histories, and many other concerns about COVID-19. The Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS), followed by a four-step multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. <b>Results:</b> Out of 3,303 participants, the quarantined people (40.9%), community workstation staffs-policemen-volunteers (CPV) (36.4%) and general public (30.7%) reported higher percentages of depression than the general medical staff (18.4%). Moreover, the quarantined people (19.1%) also showed higher prevalence of anxiety than the general public (9.1%) and the general medical staff (7.8%). The quarantined people had the highest risk of anxiety and depression, whereas the self-rated health was negatively associated with the risks of anxiety and depression.

"Maladaptive Daydreaming in an Adult Italian Population During the COVID-19 Lockdown","During the COVID-19 outbreak, individuals with or without mental disorders may resort to dysfunctional psychological strategies that could trigger or heighten their emotional distress. The current study aims to explore the links between maladaptive daydreaming (MD, i.e., a compulsive fantasy activity associated with distress and psychological impairment), psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety, and negative stress, and COVID-19-related variables, such as changes in face-to-face and online relationships, during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. A total of 6,277 Italian adults completed an online survey, including socio-demographic variables, COVID-19 related information, the 16-item Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale (MDS-16), and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 Items (DASS-21). Based on an empirically derived cut-off score, 1,082 participants (17.2%) were identified as probable maladaptive daydreamers (MDers). A binary logistic regression revealed that compared to controls, probable MDers reported that during the COVID-19 lockdown they experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression, decreased online social relationships, and, surprisingly, stable or increased face-to-face social relationships. Given the peculiar characteristics of the pandemic context, these findings suggest that the exposure to the risk of contagion had probably exacerbated the tendency of probable MDers to lock themselves inside their mental fantasy worlds, which in turn may have contributed to further estrangement from online social relationships and support, thus worsening their emotional distress.","Musetti, Franceschini, Pingani, Freda, Saita, Vegni, Zenesini, Quattropani, Lenzo, Margherita, Lemmo, Corsano, Borghi, Cattivelli, Plazzi, Castelnuovo, Somer, Schimmenti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.631979","20210412","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; maladaptive daydreaming; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12846,""
"&quot;Oh, My God! My Season Is Over!&quot; COVID-19 and Regulation of the Psychological Response in Spanish High-Performance Athletes","<b>Background:</b> In an unprecedented situation of interruption of the sporting dynamics, the world of sport is going through a series of adaptations necessary to continue functioning despite coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than ever, athletes are facing a different challenge, a source of discomfort and uncertainty, and one that absolutely alters not only sports calendars, but also trajectories, progressions, and approaches to sports life. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the levels of psychological vulnerability that may have been generated in the athletes, because of the coexistence with dysfunctional responses during the COVID-19 experience, and which directly influence the decrease of their mental health. <b>Methods:</b> With a descriptive and transversal design, the study aims to identify the state of the dysfunctional psychological response of a sample of Spanish athletes (<i>N</i> = 284). The DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale), Toronto-20 (alexithymia), and Distress Tolerance Scale questionnaires were administered to a sample of high-level Spanish athletes in Olympic programs. <b>Results:</b> The results suggest that the analyzed athletes indicate high levels of dysfunctional response (e.g., anxiety, stress, depression, and alexithymia) when their tolerance is low. In addition, the variables show less relational strength, when the capacity of tolerance to distress is worse and age is lower. At the same time, the greater the anxiety and uncertainty are, leading to more catastrophic and negative thoughts, the younger the athletes are. <b>Conclusions:</b> It is clear that both age and tolerance to distress are considered adequate protective factors for psychological vulnerability in general and for associated dysfunctional responses in particular. Moreover, the psychological resources offered by more experienced athletes are also a guarantee of protection against negativity and catastrophism.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, LÃƒÂ³pez-Mora, YÃƒÂ¼ce, Nogueira-LÃƒÂ³pez, Tovar-GÃƒÂ¡lvez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.622529","20210412","COVID-19; anxiety; athletes; depression; distress tolerance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12847,""

"Head-to-Head Comparison of Sedation and Somnolence Among 37 Antipsychotics in Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Delirium, and Repurposed in COVID-19, Infectious Diseases, and Oncology From the FAERS, 2004-2020","<b>Objective:</b> Antipsychotic compounds are known to induce sedation somnolence and have expanded clinical indications beyond schizophrenia to regulatory approval in bipolar disorder, treatment-resistant depression, and is being repurposed in infectious diseases and oncology. However, the medical sciences literature lacks a comprehensive association between sedation and somnolence among a wide-range of antipsychotic compounds. The objective of this study is to assess the disproportionality of sedation and somnolence among thirty-seven typical and atypical antipsychotics. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Patient adverse drug reactions (ADR) cases were obtained from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) between January 01, 2004 and September 30, 2020 for a wide-array of clinical indications and off-label use of antipsychotics. An assessment of disproportionality were based on cases of sedation and somnolence and calculated using the case/non-case methodology. Statistical analysis resulting in the reporting odds-ratio (ROR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were conducted using the R statistical programming language. <b>Results:</b> Throughout the reporting period, there were a total of 9,373,236 cases with 99,251 specific ADRs reporting sedation and somnolence. Zuclopenthixol (<i>n</i> = 224) ROR = 13.3 (95% CI, 11.6-15.3) was most strongly associated of sedation and somnolence and haloperidol decanoate long-acting injection (LAI) was not statistically associated sedation and somnolence. Further, among atypical antipsychotic compounds, tiapride and asenapine were the top two compounds most strongly associated with sedation and somnolence. Comprehensively, the typical antipsychotics ROR = 5.05 (95%CI, 4.97-5.12) had a stronger association with sedation and somnolence when compared to atypical antipsychotics ROR = 4.65 (95%CI, 4.47-4.84). <b>Conclusion:</b> We conducted a head-to-head comparison of thirty-seven antipsychotics and ranked the compounds based on the association of sedation and somnolence from ADR data collected throughout 16Ã‚Â years from the FAERS. The results are informative and with recent interests in repurposing phenothiazine antipsychotics in infectious disease and oncology provides an informative assessment of the compounds during repurposing and in psychopharmacology.","Eugene, Eugene, Masiak, Masiak","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.621691","20210412","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; major tranquilizers; pharmacogenomics; psychiatry; sedation; sleep; treatment resistant","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12850,""

"Demographic, gadget and internet profiles as determinants of disease and consequence related COVID-19 anxiety among Filipino college students","In the context of the nationwide shift to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its possible effect on mental health, this study investigated the relationship between demographic, gadget and Internet profiles, and disease and consequence related COVID-19 anxiety among Filipino college students. This is a quantitative cross-sectional study. A total of 952 students participated in the online survey. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to draw insights from the data.

"Sudarshan Kriya Yoga: A Breath of Hope during COVID-19 Pandemic","Important counter measures to combat an infectious disease pandemic include vaccination, antiviral therapy, and immunomodulation therapy. Vaccinations are disease specific and moreover strain specific, so the protection provided is also specific and limited. Antiviral therapies are costly and require bulk production of drugs, hence globally there is an increased interest toward low-risk, cost-effective complementary alternative therapies, such as Yoga and Ayurveda to tackle the infectious pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is clinical evidence available on the potential complementary role of yogic practices in the management of noncommunicable and communicable diseases. Various online databases were searched for articles published between 2000 and 2020. Databases explored were Medline, EMBASE, Indian Citation Index, PsycINFO, Index Medicus for South-East Asia Region, and Google Scholar. All search results were screened, and articles related to keywords such as COVID-19, yoga therapy, and Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) were selected for data extraction. Quality of the studies included was evaluated on the basis of the construct validity, content validity, relevance, bias, credibility relating to information, and data sources. SKY is a unique yogic practice that includes specific sequential breathing techniques. It balances the autonomic nervous system and thus can alleviate anxiety, routine stress, depression, stress-related medical disorders, and posttraumatic stress. It potentiates natural host immune defenses that are essential to tackle a plethora of microbial infections. This narrative review article provides an overview of potential therapeutic benefits that SKY can offer to the population at large during this COVID-19 pandemic.","Zope, Zope, Biri, Zope","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijoy.IJOY_102_20","20210412","COVID-19; Coronavirus disease 2019; Sudarshan Kriya Yoga; posttraumatic stress disorder; stress; vagus nerve stimulation; yoga therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12853,""
"Depression in patients with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic based on longitudinal self-reporting","The current study screened major depression in people with epilepsy (PWE) during the epidemic of the novel coronavirus-related disease COVID-19, in order to identify whether the outbreak generated negative psychological impact on PWE. A Chinese version of the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (C-NDDI-E), a self-reporting depression inventory, was applied for rapid detection of major depression. Assessment was carried out online during three different periods (prior to, during, and after the outbreak of COVID-19), with the aim of identifying changes in prevalence of depression and associated risk factors. A total of 158 PWE were recruited into the study (48.7% female). The questionnaire completion rates were 94.3% and 70.9% during and after the outbreak, respectively. The prevalence of depression prior to the epidemic, as the baseline, was 34.8% and increased to 42.3% during the period of the epidemic. Towards the end of the outbreak, the prevalence declined towards the baseline (36.6%). Factors such as living alone (OR = 4.022, 95% CI: 1.158-13.971, P = 0.028) and active seizures before the epidemic (OR = 2.993, 95% CI: 1.197-7.486, P = 0.019) were associated with depression during the epidemic. Monotherapy appeared to be protective against depression (OR = 0. 105, 95% CI: 0.047-0.235, P &lt;0.001). Our results suggest that the pandemic exerts negative influence on PWE's mental health. Depression is one of the common psychological disorders that needs greater attention during this extraordinary period.","Sun, Mo, Sun, Niu, Si","https://doi.org/10.1684/epd.2021.1263","20210412","COVID-19; depression; epilepsy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12854,""
"New obstacles and widening gaps: A qualitative study of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on US adults with disabilities","Prior research has demonstrated that the needs of the disability community have not been met during public health emergencies. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequities for many populations including people with disabilities, and data is needed to develop inclusive public health response policies. To identify how COVID-19 has uniquely impacted the lives of adults with disabilities. 38 participants were recruited through disability advocacy groups and social media. Semi-structured virtual focus groups were conducted with adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) who self-identified as having a disability. Focus groups were conducted for each of six disability sub-groups: vision, hearing, mobility and physical, mental health, cognitive, intellectual, and developmental, and chronic illness. Using inductive coding, major themes were identified and compared across the disability sub-groups. Three major themes and thirteen sub-themes were identified from the focus groups. The three major themes comprised: new problems created by the pandemic, obstacles in daily life that were exacerbated by the pandemic, and broader changes to accessibility and disability identity. Sub-themes such as difficulty with COVID-19 testing and regular medical care were reported by participants of all disability sub-groups, while other sub-themes like direct care needs and medical rationing were reported by participants from a subset of the disability sub-groups. These results indicate how the COVID-19 pandemic unequally impacts disabled people. The participants indicated that to fully address their needs, disability perspectives must be included in the public health pandemic response. As new research shows that COVID-19 can cause long-term disability, the urgency to ensure the disability community is part of public health policies will increase.","Epstein, Campanile, Cerilli, Gajwani, Varadaraj, Swenor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101103","20210412","COVID-19; Disability equity; Disability health; Emergency response; Qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12855,""
"Physician Burnout in Primary Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in Portugal","Primary care physicians have been present on the frontline during the ongoing pandemic, adding new tasks to already high workloads. Our aim was to evaluate burnout in primary care physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as associated contributing factors. Cross-sectional study with an online questionnaire disseminated through social media, applying the snowball technique. The target population was primary care physicians working in Portugal during the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to sociodemographic data, the questionnaire collected responses to the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), the Resilience Scale and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21). Data were collected from May 9 to June 8, 2020, a period comprising the declaration of a national calamity and then state of emergency, and the subsequent ease of lockdown measures. Levels of burnout in 3 different dimensions (personal, work, and patient-related), resilience, stress, depression, and anxiety were assessed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with burnout levels. Among the 214 physician respondents, burnout levels were high in the 3 dimensions. A strong association was found between gender, years of professional experience, depression and anxiety, and burnout levels. Physician burnout in primary care is high and has increased during the pandemic. More studies are needed in the long term to provide a comprehensive assessment of COVID-19'simpact on burnout levels and how to best approach and mitigate it during such unprecedented times.","Baptista, Teixeira, Castro, Cunha, SerrÃƒÂ£o, Rodrigues, Duarte","https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211008437","20210412","COVID-19; burnout; general practice; pandemic; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12856,""
"An integer programming model to assign patients based on mental health impact for tele-psychotherapy intervention during the Covid-19 emergency","The Covid-19 pandemic challenges healthcare systems worldwide while severely impacting mental health. As a result, the rising demand for psychological assistance during crisis times requires early and effective intervention. This contributes to the well-being of the public and front-line workers and prevents mental health disorders. Many countries are offering diverse and accessible services of tele-psychological intervention; Ecuador is not the exception. The present study combines statistical analyses and discrete optimization techniques to solve the problem of assigning patients to therapists for crisis intervention with a single tele-psychotherapy session. The statistical analyses showed that professionals and healthcare workers in contact with Covid-19 patients or with a confirmed diagnosis had a significant relationship with suicide risk, sadness, experiential avoidance, and perception of severity. Moreover, some Covid-19-related variables were found to be predictors of sadness and suicide risk as unveiled via path analysis. This allowed categorizing patients according to their screening and grouping therapists according to their qualifications. With this stratification, a multi-periodic optimization model and a heuristic are proposed to find an adequate assignment of patients to therapists over time. The integer programming model was validated with real-world data, and its results were applied in a volunteer program in Ecuador.","Miniguano-Trujillo, Salazar, Torres, Arias, Sotomayor","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10729-020-09543-z","20210411","AAQ-II; Integer programming; Logistic regression; SARSÃ¢â‚¬â€œCoV2; Tele-psychotherapy; WLSMV","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12857,""

"Factors associated with changes in consumption among smokers and alcohol drinkers duringthe COVID-19 'lockdown' period","The impact of the COVID-19 public health social measures (PHSM) on health behaviours is poorly understood. We aimed to identify factors associated with changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption during the strictest period of PHSM 'lockdown'. Logistic regression analysis were conducted using secondary data from the Central Statistics Office Social Impact Survey collected during lockdown in Ireland (April 23rd-May 1st, 2020). Of the 1,362 (33.8%) individuals that responded to the survey, 80.6% were current drinkers and 26.0% were smokers. The majority of smokers (60.9%) and drinkers (60.6%) reported no change in consumption. However, 30.5% of smokers and 22.2% of drinkers reported increased consumption. Being concerned about household stress from confinement (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002), working from home (aOR 2.1, 95Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.4-3.3, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and urban living (aOR 2.0, 95Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.5-2.9, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were associated with increases in alcohol consumption.

A mixed picture was evident in terms of changes in consumption among current smokers and drinkers. Increased consumption was more commonly reported than reductions. Increased consumption was associated with psychological distress and socio-economic factors.

"Effectiveness of a one day self-compassion training for pediatric nurses' resilience","Resilience is a critical skill for nurses and other healthcare professionals, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet few nurses receive training that promotes emotional awareness and regulation, resilience, and self-compassion. The purpose of this study was to understand if attending a one-day workshop format of the Self Compassion for Healthcare Communities (SCHC) program would improve pediatric nurses' resilience, well-being, and professional quality of life. Following a quasi-experimental design, pre, post, and follow-up surveys were acquired from 22 nurses who attended the training and 26 nurses who did not attend the training. In a linear mixed models regression analysis, changes in self-compassion, mindfulness, compassion, resilience, job engagement, professional quality of life (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress), depression, anxiety and stress were analyzed between groups. Participants in the intervention exhibited significant increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, compassion to others, resilience and compassion satisfaction, and significant decreases in burnout, anxiety, and stress compared to the non-intervention group. A one-day SCHC training program provides nurses with knowledge and skills to increase their resilience and support their emotional well-being and professional quality of life. Nurses' schedules may hamper their ability to attend lengthy resilience trainings, yet the skills needed for resilience are crucial to decreasing burnout, empathy fatigue, and turnover. Offering an effective, one-day training provides an accessible alternative for nurses to gain knowledge and skills that increase resilience.","Franco, Christie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.03.020","20210411","Burnout; Compassion satisfaction; Resilience training; Self-compassion training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12860,""
"Correlation of Seizure Increase and COVID-19 Outbreak in Adult Patients with Epilepsy: Findings and Suggestions from a Nationwide Multi-centre Survey in China","To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the behaviours, mental health and seizure control of adult patients with epilepsy (PWE) and to identify the correlation of seizure increase and the COVID-19 outbreak to guide the medical care of individuals with epilepsy during a public health crisis. This study was conducted at 28 centres from February 2020 to April 2020. Participants filled out a 62-item online survey including sociodemographic, COVID-19-related, epilepsy-related and psychological variables and were divided into two groups based on whether their seizure frequency increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to test differences in significant characteristics. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for seizure worsening. A total of 1,237 adult PWE were enrolled for analysis. Of this sample, 31 (8.33%) patients experienced an increase in seizures during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that feeling nervous about the pandemic (P &lt; 0.05), poor quality of life (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001), drug reduction/withdrawal (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.032), moderate anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.046) and non-seizure free before the COVID-19 outbreak (P &lt; 0.05) were independently related to seizure increase during the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, PWE with poor quality of life and mental status, as well as AED reduction/withdrawal, were more likely to experience seizure increase. This observation highlights the importance of early identification of the population at high risk of seizure worsening and implementation of preventive strategies during the pandemic.","Zeng, Meng, Zhu, Yao, Lian, Zhu, Zhang, Dai, Wang, Han, Li, Zhang, Xu, Yao, Luo, Jiang, Wang, Zhao, Chen, Deng, Liu, Feng, Song, Wu, Liao, Wang, Zhu, Xiao, Wang, Long","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2021.03.029","20210411","COVID-19; Epilepsy; Mental health; Seizure control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12861,""

A national sample of 6,607 adults (4.4% who reported testing positive for COVID-19, 25.3% testing negative, and 70.3% untested) were recruited an online platform andcompleted the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, PTSD-Checklist for DSM-5, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification-Consumption scale, and an item assessing SI in May-June 2020. A series of multivariable analyses were conducted. In the total sample, 35.3% screened positive for current AUD, 33.6% for MDD, 33.6% for GAD, 24.6% for SI, and 20.2% for CS. Past 2-week SI (adjusted odds ratios [AORs]= 1.49-12.06), number of close friends (AORs= 1.40-2.72), history of AUD (AORs= 1.15-1.92), history of anxiety disorder (AORs= 1.07-2.63), and younger age (AORs= 0.97-0.98) were significantly associated with screening positive for MDD, GAD, CS, and AUD. COVID-19 status was not independently associated with these conditions, but the combination of testing positive for COVID-19, meeting criteria for AUD, and screening positive for MDD, GAD, or CS predicted a 96% probability for SI. Predisposing factors are stronger predictors of psychological distress than personal COVID-19 infection or exposure. The additive effects of COVID-19 infection, alcohol use, and psychiatric problems in predicting SI suggest screening, monitoring, and treating these conditions in population-based prevention and treatment efforts may be important.","Tsai, Elbogen, Huang, North, Pietrzak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.085","20210411","Alcohol use disorder; Epidemiology; Mental illness; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12862,""
"Prevalence and risk factors for anxiety symptoms during the outbreak of COVID-19: A large survey among 373216 junior and senior high school students in China","The increasing menace of the COVID-19 epidemic led to an atmosphere of anxiety around the world, however the evidence among Chinese students aged 12 to 18 years has been limited. A total of 373216 junior and senior high school students were recruited using a cluster sampling method in Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Xinyang city of Henan Province, China, during February 4-12, 2020. Presence of anxiety symptoms was determined by Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7). Multiple logistic regression was performed to estimate the potential risk factors. Among the participants, junior and senior high school students were found to have anxiety symptoms, producing an overall prevalence of 9.89%. The prevalence was lower in female than in male (9.66% vs. 10.11%) and the prevalence was higher for junior high school students than senior high school students (13.89% vs. 12.93%). The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was highest among rural students and lowest among urban students (11.33% vs. 8.77%). The cognitive level was negatively associated with the prevalence of anxiety symptoms. After adjusting for potential confounders, age, gender, residential location, worried level, fear level and behavior status were found to be associated with anxiety symptoms. Prevalence may be skewed by assessing anxiety symptoms using self-reported scales rather than clinical interviews. This large-scale study assesses the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and its potential influencing factors in junior and senior high school students.

"Structural competency and the future of firearm research","In this critical literature review we develop a five-part agenda for pandemic-era research into mass shootings and multiple-victim homicides that promotes understanding the psychologies of individual shooters within larger structures and systems. We show how the momentous events set in motion by the COVID-19 virus, and the structural drivers of inequity and racism that its spread exposed, challenge mental health research on gun trauma to better account for broader terrains of race and place, as well as the tensions, politics, and assumptions that surround guns in the U.S. more broadly. Doing so will broaden mental-health interventions into epidemics of U.S. gun trauma, and challenge mental health research better recognize structural biases inherent in its own purview. We frame the agenda through the rubric of structural competency, an emerging framework that systematically trains health care professionals and others to recognize ways that institutions, neighborhood conditions, market forces, public policies, and health care delivery systems shape symptoms and diseases. Developing a structural framework around research into U.S. gun violence addresses the risks, traumas, meanings, and consequences that firearms represent for all communities-and highlights the importance of a renewed focus on mental health and safety for communities of color. Recognizing how gun violence reflects and encapsulates structures helps mental health experts address common sense gun policies within broader contexts-by fighting against structural racism or racially inflected gun policies for instance, or against economic policies that undermine access to mental health care more broadly.","Metzl, McKay, Piemonte","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113879","20210411","Antiracism; Coronavirus; Firearms; Gun violence; Mass shootings; Mental illness; Pandemic; Racism; Structural competency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12864,""

"Pathways between COVID-19 public health responses and increasing overdose risks: A rapid review and conceptual framework","Emerging evidence indicates that illicit drug overdoses are increasing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a paucity of evidence on the causative pathways for this trend, but expert opinions, commentaries, and some reviews offer theoretical underpinnings. In this rapid review, we collate the available published evidence, expert opinions, commentaries, and reviews on the unintended pathways between COVID-19 public health responses and increasing illicit drug overdoses. Using tenets of thematic analyses and grounded theory, we also offer a visual conceptual framework for these unintended pathways. Our framework focuses on five particular public health responses, namely social isolation/physical distancing/quarantine; staff/resource reallocations and reductions; closures of businesses and other places of employment; border closures and transportation restrictions; and the early release of people from prisons. As argued in the literature reviewed here, these public health responses have unintentionally created increased overdose risks by producing high risk use scenarios; increased risks of relapsing; disrupted addictions services and treatment; an increasingly toxic supply of drugs; and the risk of using with lowered tolerance. Health care systems should respond to these pathways to mitigate the unintended consequences. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may represent an opportunity to enact proactive, progressive, and innovative solutions to an overdose crisis that will surely outlast the current pandemic.","Nguyen, Buxton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103236","20210411","2019-nCOV; COVID-19; Overdose; Pandemic; Public health policy; Public health response; SARS-COV-2; Unintended consequences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12866,""

"Supporting Parents &amp; Kids Through Lockdown Experiences (SPARKLE): A digital parenting support app implemented in an ongoing general population cohort study during the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","The COVID-19 related lockdowns and distancing measures have presented families with unprecedented challenges. A UK-wide cohort study tracking changes in families' mental health since early lockdown (Co-SPACE) found a significant rise in primary school-aged children's behaviour problems and associated family-related stress. Three-quarters of parents in Co-SPACE also reported wanting extra support. In SPARKLE, we will examine whether providing Co-SPACE families with a smartphone application delivering information and parenting support, Parent Positive, can reverse the negative effects of the pandemic on children and parents. The efficacy on child and parent outcomes and cost-effectiveness of Parent Positive will be examined. We will also test whether the effects are moderated by pre-existing levels of child conduct problems and usage of Parent Positive. Exploratory analyses will examine whether other baseline characteristics or lockdown circumstances moderate the effects of Parent Positive. SPARKLE is a two-arm superiority parallel group randomised controlled trial embedded in an existing large UK-wide self-selected community cohort - Co-SPACE. Those who consent to SPARKLE will be randomised 1:1 to either Parent Positive or Follow-up As Usual (FAU). Co-SPACE (a UK-wide longitudinal cohort study) parents aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 who have children aged 4-10 years will be eligible for SPARKLE. Parent Positive: is a digital public health intervention that can be delivered rapidly at scale to support parents in managing their children's behaviour to reduce conduct problems and levels of family conflict, which were exacerbated during the first lockdown, and which may increase further in future months as families need to cope with continuous uncertainty and further disruption to their daily lives. Co-designed with parents and based on decades of parenting research, Parent Positive consists of three elements: (i) Parenting Boosters: where advice, delivered in the form of narrated animations, videos, graphics and text is provided to help parents with eight common parenting challenges; (ii) Parenting Exchange: a facilitated parent-to-parent communication and peer support platform and; (iii) Parent Resources: giving access to carefully selected high-quality, evidence-based online parenting resources. Follow-up as Usual: FAU was selected as a comparator because the public health nature meant that an active comparator was not appropriate due to the pragmatic, rapid implementation of the trial. Individuals randomised to FAU will receive no intervention for the first two months while the data for baseline (T1), T2 and T3 are collected. They will then be given full access to the app until 30th November 2021. Outcome measures will be collected remotely through Qualtrics according to the Co-SPACE schedule at baseline (T1), which will be the Co-SPACE survey data obtained immediately prior to randomisation, and then at one month (T2) and two months (T3) post-randomisation. Measures will be collected to assess group differences in child and parent outcomes, costs and service utilisation, and adverse events. Usage of Parent Positive will also be tracked. The primary outcome is parent-reported child conduct problems at one-month post-randomisation measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire conduct problems subscale. Enrolled participants will be allocated to Parent Positive or FAU at the ratio of 1:1 by simple randomisation using the Randomizer function within the Qualtrics programme. Neither blocking nor stratification will be used. It is not possible to blind parents enrolled in the study and Qualtrics will automatically inform parents of their group allocation. Blinded members of the research team and the senior statistician will not be given access to the Qualtrics system or the data in order to remain blinded until after the analysis is complete. We do not anticipate any serious harms associated with taking part in the intervention, therefore there will be no need to unblind any blinded staff during the study. The junior statistician will be unblinded throughout. A total of 616 will be recruited into the trial with 308 consenting parents randomised to each treatment arm. V1.0; 15.03.2021.

"Barriers and coping mechanisms to accessing healthcare during the COVID-19 lockdown: a cross-sectional survey among patients with chronic diseases in rural Rwanda","Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions imposed to contain COVID-19, often referred to as 'lockdowns', abruptly and ubiquitously restricted access to routine healthcare services. This study describes reported barriers and coping mechanisms to accessing healthcare among chronic care patients during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in Rwanda. This cross-sectional study was conducted among chronic care patients enrolled in pediatric development, HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, mental health, and oncology programs at 3 rural Rwandan districts. Active patients with an appointment scheduled between March-June 2020 and a phone number recorded in the electronic medical record system were eligible. Data were collected by telephone interviews between 23rd April and 11th May 2020, with proxy reporting by caregivers for children and critically ill-patients. Fisher's exact tests were used to measure associations.Ã‚Â Logistic regression analysis was also used to assess factors associated with reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare during the lockdown. Of 220 patient respondents, 44% reported at least one barrier to accessing healthcare. Barriers included lack of access to emergency care (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°50; 22.7%), lack of access to medication (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44; 20.0%) and skipping clinical appointments (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37; 16.8%). Experiencing barriers was associated with the clinical program (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), with oncology patients being highly affected (64.5%), and with increasing distance from home to the health facility (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.031).Ã‚Â In the adjusted logistic regression model, reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare was associated with the patient's clinical program and district of residence. Forty (18.2%) patients identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care, such as walking long distances during suspension of public transport (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21; 9.6%), contacting clinicians via telephone for guidance or rescheduling appointments (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15; 6.8%), and delegating someone else for medication pick-up (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6; 2.7%). Of 124 patients who reported no barriers to accessing healthcare, 9% used positive coping mechanisms. A large proportion of chronic care patients experienced barriers to accessing healthcare during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, many patients alsoÃ‚Â independently identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care - strategies that could be formally adopted by healthcare systems in Rwanda and similar settings to mitigate effects of future lockdowns on patients.","Nshimyiryo, Barnhart, Cubaka, Dusengimana, Dusabeyezu, Ndagijimana, Umutesi, Shyirambere, Karema, Mubiligi, Kateera","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10783-z","20210411","Barriers and coping mechanisms to accessing healthcare; COVID-19 lockdown; Chronic care; Chronic diseases; Rwanda","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12870,""
"Quality of life of nursing internship students in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented negative impact on the usual way of life. The fight against this fatal virus demands the united force of healthcare workers, including nurse interns (NIs). Therefore, being unprepared for a crisis of this magnitude which never happened in a century, nurses and NIs experience stress, trauma, and mental health issues that affect their quality of life (QoL). This study inquired the demographic of the NIs, the responses of the participants to the domains of Quality of Life Evaluation Scale (QOLES), and the relationship between the participants' responses to the scale to each of their demographic profiles. This study used a quantitative cross-sectional design through an electronic survey form in the collection of data. Utilizing total enumeration as sampling technique, 152 NIs in Saudi Arabia completed the survey. Across the 22-item questionnaire, the NIs still feel safe being in the hospital, clinic, or other healthcare facilities with a mean of 3.32; while item 8, which is having abundant energy, had the lowest mean of 1.91. The overall mean is 2.61, interpreted as 'important,' signifying that the participants 'agree to some extent.' The QoL of the NIs focused more on their psychological wellbeing and social relationships while the environmental and physical domains had lesser emphasis. In terms of enhancing specificity, comprehensiveness, and generalizability of future studies in QoL, a larger sample and more rigorous design is recommended.","Grande, Butcon, Indonto, Villacorte, Berdida","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijans.2021.100301","20210412","COVID-19; Frontliners; Healthcare workers; Nurse interns; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12871,""
"Pregnancy during the pandemic: the impact of COVID-19-related stress on risk for prenatal depression","Pregnant women may be especially susceptible to negative events (i.e. adversity) related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and negative affective responses to these events (i.e. stress). We examined the latent structure of stress and adversity related to the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women, potential antecedents of COVID-19-related stress and adversity in this population, and associations with prenatal depressive symptoms. We surveyed 725 pregnant women residing in the San Francisco Bay Area in March-May 2020, 343 of whom provided addresses that were geocoded and matched by census tract to measures of community-level risk. We compared their self-reported depressive symptoms to women matched on demographic factors and history of mental health difficulties who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. Women who were pregnant during the pandemic were nearly twice as likely to have possible depression than were matched women who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. Individual- and community-level factors tied to socioeconomic inequality were associated with latent factors of COVID-19-related stress and adversity. Beyond objective adversity, subjective stress responses were strongly associated with depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Highlighting the role of subjective responses in vulnerability to prenatal depression and factors that influence susceptibility to COVID-19-related stress, these findings inform the allocation of resources to support recovery from this pandemic and future disease outbreaks. In addition to policies that mitigate disruptions to the environment due to the pandemic, treatments that focus on cognitions about the self and the environment may help to alleviate depressive symptoms in pregnant women.","King, Feddoes, Kirshenbaum, Humphreys, Gotlib","https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172100132X","20210412","adversity; depression; pandemic; pregnancy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12872,""
"Using Absolutist Word Frequency from Online Searches to Measure Population Mental Health Dynamics","The assessment of population mental health relies on survey data from representative samples, which come with considerable costs. Drawing on research which established that absolutist words (e.g. never) are semantic markers for depression, we propose a new measure of population mental health based on the frequency of absolutist words in online search data (Absolute Thinking Index; ATI). Our aims were to first validate the ATI, and to use it to model public mental health dynamics in France and the UK during the current COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we extracted time series for a validated dictionary of 19 absolutist words, from which the ATI was computed (weekly averages, 2019-2020, n = 208). We then tested the relationship between ATI and longitudinal survey data of population mental health in the UK and France. ATI was linked with survey depression scores in the UK, r = .68, 95%CI[.34,.86], ÃŸ = .23, 95%CI[.09,.37] in France and displayed similar trends. We finally assessed the pandemicâ€™s impact on ATI using Bayesian structural time-series models. These revealed that the pandemic increased ATI by 3.2%, 95%CI[2.1,4.2] in France and 3.7%, 95%CI[2.9,4.4] in the UK. Mixed-effects models showed that ATI was related to COVID-19 new deaths in both countries ÃŸ = .14, 95%CI[.14,.21]. Our results demonstrate the validity of the ATI as a measure of population mental health (depression) in France and the UK. We propose that researchers use it as cost-effective public mental health â€œthermometerâ€ for applied and research purposes.","Jais Adam-Troian et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CD-3FF-3DF","20210413","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Diagnosis; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; psychometrics; cognitive behavioral theory; depression; covid-19; monitoring; prevention; google trends; mental health; online search; pandemic; semantic marker; suicide; dichotomous thinking; public health; search volume data; absolutist words; sars cov 2; psycholinguistics","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","",12873,""
