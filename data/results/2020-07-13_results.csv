"REMOTE WORKING DURING THE PANDEMIC: A Q&A WITH GILLIAN ISAACS RUSSELL","In this interview by email, Gillian Isaacs Russell, author of the influential Screen Relations: The Limits of Computer-Mediated Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy, responds to a set of questions from the BJP  The interview focuses on the impact of remote working during the coronavirus epidemic, starting with the question of whether an effective therapeutic process can occur without physical co-presence  Isaacs Russell shares her immediate thoughts about the virtually overnight changes to our practice that came with the epidemic, and the work of the American Psychoanalytic Association's Covid-19 Advisory Team, on which she sits  Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age  She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online;the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient;the relationship between place and time;and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death  The interview ends with her thoughts on whether we should assume that the landscape of analytic therapy will be permanently altered by Covid-19, and with her hope that general awareness of the impact of trauma on our mental health has been raised","Isaacs Russell, Gillian","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjp.12581","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: British Journal of Psychotherapy;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication details: British Journal of Psychotherapy;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2643,""
"Preliminary findings on the associations between mental health indicators and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic","Aim: Our study investigates associations between social isolation and indicators of general mental health, wellbeing, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and stress in Brazilian adults  Variables to measure aspects to ease the isolation impact (ease-isolating variables) were also included  Method: 539 Brazilian adults were recruited by convenience from March 25 to April 07, 2020  We administered a questionnaire on isolation behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO-5, the GHQ-12, the CLA, the GAD-7, the PSS-10, and the CES-D  To analyze data, we relied upon the network analysis approach  Results: COVID-19 isolation variables showed positive relationships with mental health indicators, and ease-isolating variables presented mixed associations with mental health indicators  For instance, satisfaction with the quality of social interactions connected strongly and positively with the well-being variable, while negatively with loneliness and general psychological symptoms  Conclusions: Our hypotheses were partially confirmed  We can conclude that the damage to mental health associated with social isolation during the pandemic can be minimized by maintaining satisfactory interpersonal relationships  We have three direct recommendations: mental health professionals should (a) elaborate strategies that contemplate the use of virtual tools to alleviate depressive feelings resulting from isolation, (b) give particular attention to risk groups that are most impacted by the isolation imposed by a pandemic situation and may suffer from loneliness, and (c) consider anxiety control strategies for the anxiogenic adverse reaction generated by the worldwide alert in times of disease outbreaks","Goncalves, Andre Pereira, Zuanazzi, Ana Carolina, Salvador, Ana Paula, Jaloto, Alexandre, Pianowski, Giselle, Carvalho, Lucas de Francisco","https://doi.org/10.12740/app/122576","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy;22(2):10-19, 2020.; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy;22(2):10-19, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2644,""

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals","INTRODUCTION: Healthcare professionals (HPs) have been confronted by unprecedented traumatic experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in countries that had not experienced similar epidemic outbreaks in recent years. AIM: To analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of HPs. METHOD: We comprehensively reviewed the studies published in MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science and Google Scholar between December 2019 and May 2020. RESULTS: Most studies report a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among HPs that can be associated with: a) COVID-19 exposure; b) epidemiological issues; c) material resources; d) human resources; and e) personal factors. The role of certain variables, before, during and after the pandemic, remains unexplored. Longitudinal studies will help elucidate which factors are associated with a higher risk of developing long-lasting negative effects. Qualitative studies may contribute to understanding the influence of individual and social narratives in HPs' distress. CONCLUSION: A deeper analysis on the individual, institutional, political and socio-cultural factors, meanings and values influencing HPs distress and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic is needed.","Braquehais, Maria Dolores; Vargas-CÃ¡ceres, SebastiÃ¡n; GÃ³mez-DurÃ¡n, Esperanza; Nieva, Gemma; Valero, Sergi; Casas, Miquel; Bruguera, Eugeni","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa207","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: QJM;2020 Jun 22.; Publication details: QJM;2020 Jun 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2648,""
"Debate: #Together despite the distance","The pandemic COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a major global impact on the healthcare systems worldwide as they deal with the surge of critically ill persons. Additionally, the preventative measure of stay-at-home orders and closure of nonessential businesses has caused the disruption of entire communities. The child/youth mental health workforce bears the additional burden of the disruption of the systems-based practice crucial to the successful provision of mental health services. Major sources of stress for the workforce include: (a) a threat to the worker's personal/family health and life (traumatic injury), (b) a loss of colleagues or threat to professional mastery and identity (grief injury), (c) an inner conflict between ones' values and aspirations and what they are able to accomplish in their work (moral injury), and (d) fatigue, simply feeling worn out by the relentless work and need, without time for rest and recovery (fatigue injury). The rapid transformation of the in-person to virtual practice by the implementation of telehealth/telephonic sessions has eroded the boundary between personal/professional life and created a new Zoom fatigue.","Chrisman","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12406","20200712","COVID-19; disaster; mental health; pandemic; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2649,""
"Debate: COVID-19 and psychological well-being of children and adolescents in Italy","Italy was the first country in Europe to deal with COVID-19. Measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the virus were based mainly on quarantine and social distancing, with dramatic economic, social and psychological consequences. Since March, Italian children and adolescents are facing school closures, which have caused a disruption in the daily lives of millions of young people and their families. To date, despite the slow reopening, the government has decided to maintain school closures for the entire academic year, leaving the future of young people in uncertainty. There is already some evidence that quarantine and social isolation are having negative impact on children's and adolescents' psychological well-being. Moreover, this situation will mainly affect those children and adolescents with pre-existing vulnerabilities and those suffering of mental disorders. It is imperative to keep young people's needs at the core of reconstruction plans, allowing them to return to school safely, and providing them with some strategies to heal and dealing with this stressful and potentially traumatic situation.","Caffo, Scandroglio, Asta","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12405","20200712","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19); adolescents; children; mental health; psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2650,""

"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on sleep quality in university students and administration staff","In Italy, lockdown due to COVID-19 health emergency started on March 10 and partially ended on May 3rd, 2020. There was a significant increase of psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness, and worsening of quality of sleep in the general population. Participants completed an anonymous web-based survey that include questionnaires about sleep and anxiety and depression symptoms. Our sample included 400 subjects: 307 students (mean age 22.84Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.68) and 93 university administration staff workers (mean age 37.02Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.46). we found an increase in Bed Time hour, Sleep Latency, and Wake-Up time between before and during COVID-19 emergency and a worsening of sleep quality and of insomnia symptoms. In particular, during the lockdown, the impact of the delay in Bed Time and in Wake-Up was more pronounced in students. In workers, we observed a prevalence of maintenance insomnia before COVID-19 of 24% that significantly increase during COVID-19 reaching 40%, while workers with difficulties in sleep initiation were only 15% that increased to 42%. In our sample, 27.8% showed depressive symptoms, while 34.3% showed anxious symptoms, in particular in students. The impact of lockdown was greater in students than in workers, and in females than in males.

"Love in the Time of COVID-19: Sexual Function and Quality of Life Analysis During the Social Distancing Measures in a Group of Italian Reproductive-Age Women","The beginning of 2020 was characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic. The world governments have adopted restrictive measures to reduce the spread of infection. These measures could affect the sexual function and quality of life of women living with their partner. The aim is to assess the impact of the social distancing measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function and quality of life of noninfected reproductive-age women, living with their sexual partner. Observational analysis on sexually active women, living with their partner, and without COVID-19 infection was performed. The population previously answered FSFI, FSDS, and SF-36 questionnaires. 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail for an evaluation during the COVID-19 outbreak. The primary endpoint was the assessment of the women's sex function change during the social restriction period, by analyzing the FSFI and FSDS questionnaires. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the impact on the quality of life calculated by the SF-36 questionnaire. 89 patients were considered. The median age was 39 (28-50) years. Mean sexual intercourses/month decreased from 6.3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1.9 to 2.3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1.8, mean difference:Ã‚Â -3.9Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1.2. FSFI decreased significantly (29.2Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 4.2 vs 19.2Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 3.3, mean difference:Ã‚Â -9.7Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 2.6) and FSDS increased significantly (9.3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 5.5 vs 20.1Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 5.2, mean difference: 10.8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 3.4). The SF-36 showed a significant change from 82.2Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 10.2 to 64.2Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 11.8 4Ã‚Â weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures; mean difference:Ã‚Â -17.8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.7. The univariable analysis identified working outside the home, university educational level, and parity Ã¢â€°Â¥1 as predictive factors of lower FSFI. In multivariable analysis, working outside the home and combination of working outside the homeÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â university educational levelÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â parity Ã¢â€°Â¥1 were the independent factors of a lower FSFI. The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic period on sexual function and quality of life in women shows how acute stress might affect the psychological state. Thus, psychological or sexual support could be useful. To our knowledge, this study is the first that analyzes the change in sexual activity in women during the COVID-19 outbreak period. The limitations were the low number of the analyzed participants, psychological tests were not included, and no data were collected on masturbation, self-heroism, solitary, and nonpenetrative sex. The COVID-19 epidemic and the restrictive social distancing measures have negatively influenced the sexual function and quality of life in not-infected reproductive-age women who live with their sexual partners.

"Anxiety and Depression of Nurses in a North West Province in China During the Period of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Outbreak","To investigate the anxiety and depression levels of frontline clinical nurses working in 14 hospitals in Gansu Province, China, during this period. A cross-sectional survey was conducted online between February 7 and 10, 2020, with a convenience sample of 22,034 nurses working in 14 prefecture and city hospitals in Gansu Province, located in northwest China. A self-reported questionnaire with four parts (demographic characteristics, general questions related to novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, self-rating anxiety scale, and self-rating depression scale) was administered. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, and SDs were computed. The associations between anxiety and depression with sociodemographic characteristics, work-related concerns, and impacts were analyzed, followed by multivariable logistic regression to identify factors that best predicted the nurses' anxiety and depression levels. A total of 21,199 questionnaires were checked to be valid, with an effective recovery rate of 96.21%. The mean Ã‚Â± SD age of the respondents was 31.89 Ã‚Â± 7.084 years, and the mean Ã‚Â± SD length of service was 9.40 Ã‚Â± 7.638 years. The majority of the respondents were female (98.6%) and married (73.1%). Some demographic characteristics, related concerns, and impacts of COVID-19 were found to be significantly associated with both anxiety (p &lt; .001) and depression (p &lt; .001). Nurses who needed to take care of children or elderly relatives, took leave from work because they were worried about COVID-19, avoided contact with family and friends, and wanted to obtain more COVID-19-related knowledge had higher levels of both anxiety and depression. Results show that nurses faced with the COVID-19 outbreak are at risk for experiencing anxiety and depression. Demographic background, psychosocial factors, and work-related factors predicted the psychological responses. The family responsibilities and burdens of women may explain the higher levels of anxiety and depression among nurses with these obligations as compared to those without. On the other hand, nurses who chose not to take leave from work or who did not avoid going to work during this period were less anxious and depressed. Professional commitment might be a protective factor for adverse psychological responses. It is pertinent to provide emotional support for nurses and recognize their professional commitment in providing service to people in need.","Han, Wong, She, Li, Yang, Jiang, Ruan, Su, Ma, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12590","20200711","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2655,""

Forty-four studies are included in this review. Between 11 and 73.4% of HCWs, mainly including physicians, nurses, and auxiliary staff, reported post-traumatic stress symptoms during outbreaks, with symptoms lasting after 1-3Ã‚Â years in 10-40%. Depressive symptoms are reported in 27.5-50.7%, insomnia symptoms in 34-36.1%, and severe anxiety symptoms in 45%. General psychiatric symptoms during outbreaks have a range comprised between 17.3 and 75.3%; high levels of stress related to working are reported in 18.1 to 80.1%. Several individual and work-related features can be considered risk or protective factors, such as personality characteristics, the level of exposure to affected patients, and organizational support. Empirical evidence underlines the need to address the detrimental effects of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks on HCWs' mental health. Recommendations should include the assessment and promotion of coping strategies and resilience, special attention to frontline HCWs, provision of adequate protective supplies, and organization of online support services.","Preti, Di Mattei, Perego, Ferrari, Mazzetti, Taranto, Di Pierro, Madeddu, Calati","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-01166-z","20200711","COVID-19; Epidemic; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2658,""

"When altruists cannot help: the influence of altruism on the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The positive predictive effect of altruism on physical and psychological well-being has been extensively demonstrated in previous studies, but few studies have examined the effect of altruism on negative mental health outcomes when altruists cannot perform altruistic behaviours. This study explored the influence of altruism on negative affect and mental health (anxiety and depressive symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic while people self-isolated at home in China. University students were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Self-reported perceived risk, altruism, negative affect, anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Self-Report Altruism Scale (SRA scale), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9). A structural equation model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects on mental health. The final sample comprised 1346 Chinese participants (MageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19.76Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.23Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 73% female). Overall, the higher the risk the participants perceived, the more negative affect they exhibited (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and thus, the more anxious and depressed they felt (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.134, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001); however, this relationship between risk perception and negative affect was moderated by altruism. In contrast to previous studies, the increase in negative affect associated with the increased perceived risk was pronounced among individuals with high altruism (tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.68, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Individuals with high altruism exhibited more negative affect than those with low altruism, which indirectly increased their anxiety and depressive symptoms. These findings enrich theories of altruism and provide valuable insight into the influence of altruism on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Feng, Zong, Yang, Gu, Dong, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00587-y","20200711","Altruism; COVID-19; Mental health; Negative affect; Perceived risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2661,""

This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Istanbul, Turkey, between March and June 2020, where a total of 4,700 persons were approached and 3,672 (78%) of participants (64.4% males and 35.6% females) completed the Knowledge Attitude Practices (KAP) and Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) questionnaires. In this study, 64.1% of participants were categorized as psychologically fatigued and 35.9% as normal. There was a significant difference between fatigued and normal participants with respect to age, educational level, occupational status, place of residence and number of family members (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Other differences related to knowledge of COVID-19 were symptoms, treatment, ways of spreading (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), prevention by avoiding crowded places (<i>p</i> = .008) and isolation (<i>p</i> = .002). For attitudinal items, normal participants generally showed more positive attitudes than the fatigued in believing that COVID-19 will finally be controlled, satisfaction with preventive measures taken by the authorities, reporting suspected cases with symptoms and trusting that Turkey can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>p</i> &lt; .001).

"Prevalence and Predictors of Anxiety and Depression Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Compliance with Precautionary Measures: Age and Sex Matter","Effective management of the global pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (also known as COVID-19), resulted in the implementation of severe restrictions in movement and enforcement of social distancing measures. This study aimed to understand and characterize the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population and to identify risks and protective factors that predict changes in mental health status. In addition, the study investigated compliance with precautionary measures (PM) to halt the spread of the virus. The online anonymous survey collected information on sociodemographic data, compliance with PM, quality of life (QOL), and mental health via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). A total of 1642 adult participants (71.6% women, 28.4% men) completed the survey in the European island country, Cyprus. A large percentage (48%) reported significant financial concerns and 66.7% significant changes in their QOL. About 41% reported symptoms associated with mild anxiety; 23.1% reported moderate-severe anxiety symptoms. Concerning depression, 48% reported mild and 9.2% moderate-severe depression symptoms. Women, younger age (18-29), student status, unemployment status, prior psychiatric history, and those reporting greater negative impact on their QOL, were at higher risk for increased anxiety and depression symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The youngest age group and males also reported lower levels of compliance with PM. Higher compliance with PM predicted lower depression scores (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but higher anxiety for measures related to personal hygiene. The results of this study provide important data on the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and QOL and identify a variety of personal and social determinants that serve as risks and protective factors. Furthermore, it has implications for policy makers demonstrating the need for effective mental health programs and guidance for the implementation of PM as a public health strategy.","Solomou, Constantinidou","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17144924","20200711","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; precautionary measures; psychological effects; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2664,""
"Mentality and behavior in COVID-19 emergency status in Japan: Influence of personality, morality and ideology","The COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 and severely influenced society. In response, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency on 7th April in seven prefectures. The study conducted an immediate survey on 8th April to record the response of the general public to the first emergency status due to epidemics. The study hypothesized that personality traits, moral foundation, and political ideology can influence people's mentality, cognition, and behavior toward COVID-19. Based on a nationwide dataset of 1856 respondents (male = 56.3%, Mage = 46.7, emergency regions = 49.9%), the study found that personality, morality, and ideology altered mental health status and motivated behaviors toward COVID-19. Neuroticism and avoiding harm involved cognition and behavior through various means. The study also found significant differences among demographic groups. Results are informative and contributive to the governance and management of, and aid for, individual responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Qian, Yahara","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235883","20200710","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2665,""

"Psychological health, sleep quality, and coping styles to stress facing the COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","To understand Wuhan residents' psychological reactions to the COVID-19 epidemic and offer a reference point for interventions, an online questionnaire survey was conducted. It included the Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), Athens Insomnia Scale, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Categorical data were reported as numbers and percentages. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between demographic factors and anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style. A total of 1242 Wuhan residents investigated, 27.5% had anxiety, 29.3% had depression, 30.0% had a sleep disorder, and 29.8% had a passive response to COVID-19. Being female was the risk factor for anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.62) and sleep disorder (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.36); being married was associated with anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.75); having a monthly income between 1000 and 5000 CNY (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.44, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.83, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.61) or &gt;5000 CNY (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.47, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.45, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.14) was a risk factor for anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder; not exercising (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.45, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.71, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1. 85, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.71) was a common risk factor for anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style; and having a higher education level (bachelor's degree and above) (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.40) was associated with having a sleep disorder.

"Differences in Sense of Belonging, Pride, and Mental Health in the Daegu Metropolitan Region due to COVID-19: Comparison between the Presence and Absence of National Disaster Relief Fund","Korea's Daegu Metropolitan City once had the second highest rate of COVID-19 infection after Wuhan in China. Following the outbreak, the government provided the first national disaster relief fund to citizens as financial aid. This study investigated whether the sense of regional belonging, pride, and mental health among 550 citizens of Daegu differed between the times before and after COVID-19, based on the presence or absence of the disaster relief fund. Frequency analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, and <i>t</i>-tests were conducted using the SPSS 25.0 program. Results showed that the sense of belonging was higher after COVID-19 than before, while pride was lower. Individuals who received the disaster relief fund showed higher levels of regional belonging and pride with statistical significance. The prevalence of melancholy and depression increased after COVID-19, but the presence or absence of the fund did not lead to a significant difference. Thus, in case of a future national disaster level, provision of the disaster relief fund can raise the sense of regional belonging and pride, in order to elicit communication among local residents toward overcoming difficulties. Furthermore, during challenging disaster situations, central and local governments should provide diverse programs for the citizens' mental health care.","Kim, Cho, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134910","20200710","COVID-19; Daegu; disaster relief fund; mental health; pride; sense of belonging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2668,""
"Changes in Weight and Nutritional Habits in Adults with Obesity during the &quot;Lockdown&quot; Period Caused by the COVID-19 Virus Emergency","Our aim is evaluating the changes in weight and dietary habits in a sample of outpatients with obesity after 1 month of enforced lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy. In this observational retrospective study, the patients of our Obesity Unit were invited to answer to a 12-question multiple-choice questionnaire relative to weight changes, working activity, exercise, dietary habits, and conditions potentially impacting on nutritional choices. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations among weight/BMI changes and the analyzed variables. A total of 150 subjects (91.5%) completed the questionnaire. Mean self-reported weight gain was Ã¢â€°Ë†1.5 kg (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Lower exercise, self-reported boredom/solitude, anxiety/depression, enhanced eating, consumption of snacks, unhealthy foods, cereals, and sweets were correlated with a significantly higher weight gain. Multiple regression analyses showed that increased education (inversely, ÃŽÂ² = -1.15; 95%CI -2.13, -0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.022), self-reported anxiety/depression (ÃŽÂ² = 1.61; 0.53, 2.69, <i>p</i> = 0.004), and not consuming healthy foods (ÃŽÂ² = 1.48; 0.19, 2.77, <i>p</i> = 0.026) were significantly associated with increased weight gain. The estimated direct effect of self-reported anxiety/depression on weight was 2.07 kg (1.07, 3.07, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Individuals with obesity significantly gained weight 1 month after the beginning of the quarantine.

"How handling extreme C-reactive protein (CRP) values influences CRP and depression symptom networks: A replication and extension of Fried et al (2019)","Increasingly, it has been recognized that analysis at the symptom, rather than diagnostic, level will drive progress in the field of immunopsychiatry. Network analysis offers a useful tool in this pursuit with the ability to identify associations between immune markers and individual symptoms, independent of all other variables modeled. However, these analyses require a lot of power and replication is key to determine their utility in this context. Additionally, further investigation into how methodological decisions (i.e., including vs. excluding participants with C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L, regularized vs. nonregularized networks) influence results is necessary to establish best practices for the use of network analysis in immunopsychiatry. The current study attempts to replicate Fried et al. (2019), which found CRP to be uniquely associated with sleep problems, fatigue, and changes in appetite. In a sample of 3,464 adult participants from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset, this study found consistent support for associations between CRP and fatigue and changes in appetite, no support for an association between CRP and sleep, and some support for additional CRPâ€”symptom associations. Methodologically, results consistently demonstrated that including individuals with CRP > 10 mg/L and estimating nonregularized networks provided better estimates of these associations. Implications for the characterization of an inflammatory phenotype of depression, treatment planning, and designing future studies are discussed.","Daniel Moriarity et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46061-1B6-99B","20200712","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; immunology; network; inflammation; nhanes; network analysis; phenotype; replication; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2675,""
"Diligent medical activities of a publicly designated medical institution for infectious diseases pave the way for overcoming COVID-19: A positive message to people working at the cutting edge","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is highly infectious and has spread worldwide. An important factor compounding spread is the infection of medical staff with SARS-CoV-2, which threatens the collapse of the very institutions required to treat COVID-19. The possibility of virus transmission from patients with COVID-19 to medical staff is thus of primary concern. Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriage among hospital staff could also be conceivable to act as a potent source of ongoing transmission. Here we show that, surprisingly, none of the medical staff working at a hospital with COVID-19 patients had IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, indicating that virus transmission from patients to medical staff did not occur in these medical workers. These results show that standard preventive measures against infectious diseases can prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure in medical staff, and should greatly encourage medical practitioners at the front line of this pandemic.","Nagano, T.; Arii, J.; Nishimura, M.; Yoshida, N.; Iida, K.; Nishimura, Y.; Mori, Y.","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.20107490","20200525","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2676,""
"Phenomenon of depression and anxiety related to precautions for prevention among population during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Kurdistan Region of Iraq: based on questionnaire survey","PURPOSE: Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has swept the world, causing widespread burden and increasingly hospitalizations. Researchers from around the world have tried to study the virus and its effect with more precision in various fields. The purpose of this study is to identify levels of anxiety and depression with regard to precautionary for prevention of COVID-19, and to identify the relationship between demographic variables and both depression and anxiety. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study; data were collected by questionnaire via a mobile phone application in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq from 25 March, 2020 to 5 April, 2020. The sample size was 894 after deleting 20 cases because of duplication. The questionnaire consists of three main parts; part one is related to the sociodemographic characteristics of participants, the second and third parts consist of items related to depression and anxiety about COVID-19 using a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = of course no, 2 = no , 3 = normal for me, 4 = yes, and 5 = of course yes). Data was analyzed using SPSS V.25. RESULTS: The majority of the participants were from Erbil (58.8%), most of them were male (58.4%); nearly 21.2% preferred quarantine and 41.7% chose curfew as a best way to to avoid being infected by COVID-19. Most of the participants had depression because of people's lack of knowledge about how to protect themselves from the virus (88.14%), while the majority of them had anxiety concerning shopping and contact with infected people (97%) and financial problems (97%). Females had higher rates of COVID-19 depression than did males. There was a significant correlation between age and home setting and anxiety, and a significant association between marital status and level of education and depression. There was no significant association between other variables and depression and anxiety CONCLUSION: The findings of the study indicated that the majority of participants were depressed and had anxiety about COVID-19. There was a significant association between gender and depression and anxiety, while there was no significant association between occupation and income, and depression and anxiety.

"Coronavirus Stress, Optimism-Pessimism, Psychological Inflexibility, and Psychological Health: Psychometric Properties of the Coronavirus Stress Measure","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a global health threat attributed to negatively affecting the mental health and well-being of people globally. The purpose of the present study is to examine the mediating role of optimism-pessimism and psychological inflexibility in the relationship of coronavirus stress with psychological problems among Turkish adults. The sample of the study included 451 adults (55% women). Participants mainly consisted of young adults with a mean age of 23.30 years, ranging from 18 to 65 years (SD = 6.97). A mediation model indicated that coronavirus stress had a significant predictive effect on optimism-pessimism, psychological inflexibility, and psychological problems. Further, optimism-pessimism and psychological inflexibility mediated the effect of coronavirus stress on psychological problems in adults. Lastly, optimism-pessimism predicted the psychological problems of adults through psychological inflexibility. These results elucidate our understanding of the role of mediators in coronavirus stress and psychological health problems. The findings are useful in terms of providing evidence for tailoring interventions and implementing preventative approaches to mitigate the psychopathological consequences of COVID-19.

"Associations Between Fear of COVID-19, Mental Health, and Preventive Behaviours Across Pregnant Women and Husbands: An Actor-Partner Interdependence Modelling","The present cross-sectional study examined the actor-partner interdependence effect of fear of COVID-19 among Iranian pregnant women and their husbands and its association with their mental health and preventive behaviours during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A total of 290 pregnant women and their husbands (N = 580) were randomly selected from a list of pregnant women in the Iranian Integrated Health System and were invited to respond to psychometric scales assessing fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. The findings demonstrated significant dyadic relationships between husbands and their pregnant wives' fear of COVID-19, mental health, and preventive behaviours. Pregnant wivesâ€™ actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours but not anxiety. Moreover, a husband actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Additionally, there were significant partner effects observed for both the pregnant wives and their husbands concerning all outcomes. The present study used a cross-sectional design and so is unable to determine the mechanism or causal ordering of the effects. Also, the data are mainly based on self-reported measures which have some limitations due to its potential for social desirability and recall biases. Based on the findings, couples may benefit from psychoeducation that focuses on the effect of mental health problems on pregnant women and the foetus.","Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Imani, Vida; Lin, Chung-Ying; Timpka, Toomas; BrostrÃ¶m, Anders; Updegraff, John A.; Ã…restedt, Kristofer; Griffiths, Mark D.; Pakpour, Amir H.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00340-x","20200611","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-13","",2679,""
"An Investigation of the Effect of COVID-19 on OCD in Youth in the Context of Emotional Reactivity, Experiential Avoidance, Depression and Anxiety","In addition to the serious physical and medical effects on individuals, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have short- and long-term psycho-social consequences, especially for young people. Nowadays, with psychological problems becoming more widely recognized in adolescents, it is possible that the fear and anxiety caused by the pandemic will trigger various anxiety disorders, OCD and similar negative outcomes. Considering that psychological qualities such as emotional reactivity and experiential avoidance observed in adolescents may increase the risk of such psycho-social disorders, in this study the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and OCD was investigated in a Turkish sample of 598 adolescents, and the mediating role of emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety in this relationship was examined. The data collection was performed online rather than in person because of the COVID-19 threat. A structural equation model was used to determine the direct and indirect predictive effects between variables in data analysis. The results of the study show that the effect of COVID-19 fear on OCD is mediated by emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety.
