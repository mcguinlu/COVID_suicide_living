"Japanese Project for Telepsychiatry Evaluation during COVID-19: Treatment Comparison Trial (J-PROTECT): Rationale, design, and methodology","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the mental health of people around the world. Anxiety related to infection, stress and stigma caused by the forced changes in daily life have reportedly increased the incidence and symptoms of depression, anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Under such circumstances, telepsychiatry is gaining importance and attracting a great deal of attention. However, few large pragmatic clinical trials on the use of telepsychiatry targeting multiple psychiatric disorders have been conducted to date. Methods: The targeted study cohort will consist of adults (>18 years) who meet the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for either (1) depressive disorders, (2) anxiety disorders, or (3) obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Patients will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either a telepsychiatry group (at least 50% of visits to be conducted using telemedicine, with at least one face-to-face treatment [FTF] every six months) or an FTF group (all visits to be conducted FTF, with no telemedicine). Both groups will receive the usual treatment covered by public medical insurance. The study will utilize a master protocol design in that there will be primary and secondary outcomes for the entire group regardless of diagnosis, as well as the outcomes for each individual disorder group. Discussion: This study will be a non-inferiority trial to test that the treatment effect of telepsychiatry is not inferior to that of FTF alone. This study will provide useful insights into the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of psychiatry.","Taishiro Kishimoto; Shotaro Kinoshita; Shogyoku Bun; Yasunori Sato; Momoko Kitazawa; Toshiaki Kikuchi; Mitsuhiro Sado; Akihiro Takamiya; Masaru Mimura; Takashi Nakamae; Yoshinari Abe; Tetsufumi Kanazawa; Yasuo Kawabata; Hiroaki Tomita; Koichi Abe; Akitoyo Hishimoto; Takeshi Asami; Akira Suda; Yoshinori Watanabe; Toru Amagai; Kei Sakuma; Hisashi Kida; Michitaka Funayama; Hiroshi Kimura; Aiko Sato; Shuichiro Fujiwara; Kiichiro Nagao; Naoya Sugiyama; Maki Takamiya; Hideyuki Kodama; Takaharu Azekawa","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.23.21259366","20210629","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15482,""
"Effects of Long-Duration Home Isolation Linked to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health of Adolescent Athletes","To assess whether adolescent athletes were affected or not in terms of mental health by the long duration at home linked to isolation enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 940 team athletes, 274 individual athletes, and 131 nonathlete controls aged 12-17Ã‚Â years. Demographic data were obtained with a form including questions about age, sex, sports type, and physical activity status (type, duration, and frequency) during the isolation period. Participants completed the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale-13, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children. Among participants, 88% did not meet the physical activity recommendations for children and adolescents, while 42.8% felt depressed. Depressive symptoms were present in 38.1% of boys and 59.7% of girls, with girls (6.4%) having higher posttraumatic stress symptoms than boys (3.5%). Among athletes, depressive and anxiety symptoms were lower compared with nonathlete controls (P &lt; .01). Posttraumatic stress symptoms were lower among athletes than nonathlete controls for girls (team vs control, P = .006; individual vs control, P = .002) but similar for boys (P &gt; .05). The depression (P = .518), state (P = .866), and trait anxiety (P = .507) symptoms were similar between team athletes and individual athletes. Though adolescent athletes' depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were significantly lower than nonathlete controls, athletes also had high depression levels. These findings show the need to take precautions to protect the psychological health of not only nonathletes, but also athletes in the pandemic period.","Denerel, Ã…Å¾enÃ„Â±Ã…Å¸Ã„Â±k, KÃƒÂ¶yaÃ„Å¸asÃ„Â±oÃ„Å¸lu, Ãƒâ€¡iÃ„Å¸dem, TunÃƒÂ§","https://doi.org/10.1123/pes.2020-0164","20210629","anxiety; depression; posttraumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15483,""
"The COVID-19 Lockdown and Changes in Routine-Oriented Lifestyle Behaviors and Symptoms of Depression, Anxiety, and Insomnia in South Africa","The authors assessed the impact of lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on routine-oriented lifestyle behaviors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in South Africans. In this observational study, 1048 adults (median age = 27Ã‚Â y; n = 767 females; n = 473 students) responded to an online survey on work, exercise, screen, alcohol, caffeine and sleep behaviors, depression, anxiety, and insomnia before and during lockdown. Comparisons were made between males and females, and students and nonstudents. During lockdown, males reported larger reductions in higher intensity exercise and alcohol use than females, while depressive symptoms increased more among females, more of whom also reported poorer sleep quality. Students demonstrated larger delays in work and sleep timing, greater increases in sitting, screen, sleep duration, napping, depression and insomnia and larger decreases in work hours, exercise time, and sleep regularity compared with nonstudents. Students experienced more changes in their routine-oriented behaviors than nonstudents, coupled with larger increases in depression and insomnia. The dramatic change in their work and sleep timing suggests habitual routines that are at odds with their chronotype, with their sleep changes during lockdown likely reflecting ""catch-up"" sleep in response to accumulated sleep debt under usual routines.","Davy, Scheuermaier, Roden, Christie, Bentley, Gomez-Olive, Iacovides, Lewis, Lipinska, Roche, Todd, Zschernack, Rae","https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2020-0863","20210629","daily routine; mental health; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15484,""
"Lessons learned recruiting a diverse sample of rural study participants during the COVID-19 pandemic","Residents of rural areas have been a hard-to-reach population for researchers. Geographical isolation and lower population density in rural areas can make it particularly challenging to identify eligible individuals and recruit them for research studies. If the study is about a stigmatizing topic, such as opioid overdose, recruitment can be even more difficult due to confidentiality concerns and distrust of outside researchers. This paper shares lessons learned, both successes and failures, for recruiting a diverse sample of rural participants for a multi-state research study about naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal agent. In addition, because our recruitment spanned the period before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., we share lessons learned regarding the transition to all remote recruitment and data collection. We utilized various recruitment strategies including rural community pharmacy referrals, community outreach, participant referrals, mass emails, and social media with varying degrees of success. Among these modalities, pharmacist referrals and community outreach produced the highest number of participants. The trust and rapport that pharmacists have with rural community members eased their concerns about working with unknown researchers from outside their communities and facilitated study team members' ability to contact those individuals. Even with the limited in-person options during the pandemic, we reached our recruitment targets by employing multiple recruitment strategies with digital flyers and emails. We also report on the importance of establishing trust and maintaining honest communication with potential participants as well as how to account for regional characteristics to identify the most effective recruitment methods for a particular rural area. Our suggested strategies and recommendations may benefit researchers who plan to recruit underrepresented minority groups in rural communities and other historically hard-to-reach populations for future studies.","Kim, Wilson, Mashburn, Reist, Westrick, Look, Kennelty, Carpenter","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103344","20210629","Hard-to-reach population; Minority; Naloxone; Opioid overdose; Rural population; Study recruitment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15485,""
"A perception-based study to explore COVID-19 pandemic stress and its factors in Bangladesh","Worldwide the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated sufferings of mental health and behaviour attitudes of people. Many countries, including Bangladesh, reported suicide as extreme consequences of the psychological burden influenced by COVID-19. The present study explores human stress and its factor influenced by COVID-19 in Bangladesh, which significantly affect the quality of life. An online-based questionnaire survey was conducted among 651 adult Bangladeshi populations by capturing socio-demographic information, possible human stress, and consequences of the pandemic. A set of statistical tools such as Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), T-test, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were applied to identify the relationship between different factors and influential factors increasing human stress. More than 83% of the participants are facing COVID-19 related mental stress, which results in short temper, sleep disorder, and family chaos. PCA and HCA outcomes indicated a significant relationship between the respondents' opinions and human stress factors, which harmonized with the country's existing scenario. PCM results enlighten the relationship between human stress factors and found financial hardship, cutting back daily spending, and food crisis are interconnected together causes stress. Also, hampering students' formal education and future career plans significantly contribute to mental stress. Based on the above findings, it's crucial to introduce a time-oriented strategy and implement precaution monitoring plans for Bangladesh. The rescue plan will help people to manage the pandemic and improve mental health to fight against psychological challenges related to COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Amit, Barua, Kafy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2021.05.002","20210629","COVID-19; Mental health; Psychology; Public health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15486,""
"Factors associated with anxiety and depression among patients with Covid-19","The 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused a global distress. However, its psychological impact on patients is unclear. We aim to determine the mental health status and explore related factors of anxiety and depression among patients with (COVID-19). This is a cross-sectional descriptive survey conducted among COVID-19 patients at the Mohammed VI University Hospital Centre in Marrakech over a period of four months. We assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on admission. The significance threshold used for any data comparison test was the value of pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05. A total of 103 participants were included. The average age was 44, 17Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 17, 19 years. About 54,4% of the subjects were male. Of the 103 participants, 36.89% and 23.30% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression; respectively. The mean score of anxiety subscale and depression subscale for all patients was 6.45Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 4.29 and 5.38Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 4.47, respectively. The bivariate analysis showed that age (p=0, 0004; p=0, 0002), oxygen saturation level (p=0, 0003; p=0, 0059), hospital stay (pÃ‚Â &lt;0, 0001; pÃ‚Â &lt;0, 0001) and family infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p=0, 0094; p=0, 0023) were associated with anxiety and depression respectively for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, gender (p=0, 0119) was associated with depression. There is an increasing level of anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

"The effects of narrative exposure therapy on COVID-19 patients with post-traumatic stress symptoms: A randomized controlled trial","With the global attack of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), cases with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) have been increasing steadily, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients and as such, seeking effective treatments is an urgent matter. Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is a typical cognitive behavioral therapy targeting trauma-related psychological disorders and may be an effective intervention. A total of 111 COVID-19 patients near the discharge stage with positive screening results for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the study group or the control group. The study group received NET and personalized psychological intervention, while the control group only received personalized psychological intervention. PTSS, depression, anxiety and sleep quality were measured pre- and post-intervention to evaluate the effect of NET. This trial was registered with the International Standard Randomized Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR2000039369). NET participants showed a significantly greater PTSS reduction in comparison with the control group after the intervention. Improvement in sleep quality, anxiety and depression after the intervention were pronounced but not significantly different between the two treatment groups. The assessors weren't blinded for the convenience of measurement and protection of participants' psychological security. NET likely had a positive impact on PTSS of COVID-19 patients. Clinical staff should consider applying NET to improve the psychological well-being of patients who have experienced an epidemic such as COVID-19.","Fan, Shi, Zhang, Sun, Wang, Fu, Mo, Wen, Xiao, Kong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.019","20210629","COVID-19; Narrative exposure therapy; Post-traumatic stress symptoms; randomized controlled trial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15488,""
"'Quarantine 15': Pre-registered findings on stress and concern about weight gain before/during COVID-19 in relation to caregivers' eating pathology","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has dramatically altered daily activities including eating and physical activity behaviors, which in turn may be related to eating pathology. Those who care for children (henceforth caregivers) may face the brunt of these changes, but little research has examined the consequences of COVID-19 on eating pathology in caregivers. A community sample of caregivers (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯140) completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing demographics, stress and concern about weight gain before/during COVID-19, disordered eating (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire-Short Form), and emotional eating (Emotional Eating Scale-Revised). Significant positive relationships emerged between stress and concern about weight gain before/during COVID-19 and disordered eating, emotional eating-depression, emotional eating-anger/anxiety, and emotional eating-boredom. Stress and concern about weight gain during, not before, COVID-19 positively predicted variance in disordered eating and emotional eating. Stress was associated with lower emotional eating-boredom when concern about weight gain during COVID-19 was low. Stress was associated with lower emotional eating-depression when concern about weight gain before COVID-19 was low, but when high, stress was associated with higher emotional eating-depression. Stress and concern about weight gain before/during COVID-19 may be relevant to worsened disordered eating and emotional eating in caregivers, a neglected population in the literature. Targeting concern about weight gain may weaken the relationship between stress and emotional eating-depression and emotional eating-boredom among caregivers in the context of COVID-19.","Jordan, Barnhart, Studer-Perez, Kalantzis, Hamilton, Musher-Eizenman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105580","20210629","COVID-19; Caregivers; Concern about weight gain; Coronavirus; Disordered eating; Emotional eating; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15489,""
"Stress and anxiety among physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region: An online survey","During infectious disease outbreaks, healthcare workers are at high risk of infection, infecting others, and psychological distress. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of stress and anxiety in physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region and assess their associated factors. This cross-sectional study was carried out in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan Region, from March 28 to April 15, 2020. An online self-administered survey questionnaire was used to collect data from physicians working in specialized COVID-19 centers and other healthcare facilities. The level of stress was measured based on the 10-items Perceived Stress Scale. The level of anxiety was measured based on the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale. A total of 370 participants responded to the perceived stress component of the survey, of whom 57 (15.4%) had low perceived stress, 249 (67.3%) had moderate stress, and 64 (17.3%) had high stress. Being female was significantly associated with having moderate/high stress (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.40 (95% CI 1.31-4.39)). A total of 201 participants responded to the generalized anxiety disorder component of the survey, of whom 19 (9.5%) had no anxiety, 57 (28.4%) had mild anxiety, 79 (39.3%) had moderate anxiety, and 46 (22.9%) had severe anxiety. Working in COVID-19 centers (AOR = 2.23 (95% CI 1.02-4.86)) and being general practitioners (AOR = 4.16 (95% CI 1.14-15.14)) were significantly associated with having moderate/severe anxiety. A considerable proportion of physicians experience stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan region. Generalists and those in special COVID-19 units report the greatest anxiety. There a need to establish mechanisms to reduce the risks of stress and anxiety among physicians.

"Stress and Burnout in Psychiatrists in Turkey during COVID-19 Pandemic","Clinicians working in mental health (MH) services seem to be at increased risk of burnout. This study aimed to investigate the stress and burnout levels of psychiatrists working in MH services in Turkey and determine the relationship between stress, workload, and support during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was sent to child and adult psychiatrists registered with Turkish professional mail groups. 217 psychiatrists replied, with equal numbers from child (n=108) and adult (n=109) MH services. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and study-specific questionnaire were used. 60.8% of psychiatrists (n=132) experienced medium-or high-intensity work-related burnout, 49.8% (n=108) experienced patient-related burnout, and 31.8% (n=69) experienced medium-or high-intensity personal burnout. Patient-related burnout scores were significantly higher in the child psychiatry group than in the adult psychiatry group. The majority (n=126, 58.1%) reported either moderate or higher stress levels linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Turnover intention, reluctance to retrain in psychiatry and sense of lack of value in the job are all associated with higher levels of burnout. The current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to bring additional stressors to psychiatrists. This study shows that psychiatrists in Turkey already exhibit high levels of work-related stress. Organizational interventions to ameliorate psychiatrists' wellbeing and work conditions are required.","Ãƒâ€“Ã„Å¸ÃƒÂ¼tlÃƒÂ¼, McNicholas, TÃƒÂ¼rkÃƒÂ§apar","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.225","20210629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15491,""
"Social Support Promotes Mental Health During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Study from Turkey","Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has several negative effects on mental health, given its rapid transmission, hygiene and isolation measures and associated social and financial difficulties. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mental health burden of the Turkish population and vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 outbreak, especially exploring the effects of social support. We assessed depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and perceived social support among 894 people all over Turkey, using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) two months after the declaration of the first COVID-19 case in Turkey. According to DASS-21 subscale scores, the findings showed that the prevalence of moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress-related symptoms was 24.8%, 21.9% and 12.6%, respectively. Female gender, being single, having a lifetime psychiatric disorder, lower education level and financial concerns were significantly associated with higher DASS-21 scores. Also, there was a negative correlation between all subgroups of perceived social support, especially from the family, and the total DASS-21 score. Vulnerable groups should be identified and protected to reduce adverse psychiatric outcomes of COVID-19. Besides, further strategies should be provided to maintain protective factors, such as social support, under stressful conditions.","Kaya, AyÃ„Â±k, Tasdelen, Ercis, Ertekin","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.217","20210629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15492,""

"COVID-19, Physical Distancing in the Workplace and Employees' Mental Health: Implications and Insights for Organizational Interventions - Narrative Review","Physical distancing is one of the non-pharmaceutical measures adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Although it appears to be effective in mitigating this spread, its implementation in workplaces may undermine employees' mental health. In fact, torn between the fear of contagion and the need to maintain their jobs, employees must also comply with physical distancing measures in the workplace, which alter social interactions and set a predetermined frame and distance that guide employees' behaviors within the organization while they need empathy. This situation might increase their level of stress. This paper is a narrative review that addresses the impact of physical distancing in the workplace on employees' mental health. It presents the main factors that might moderate this impact and it recommends organizational interventions that can help to mitigate it. Physical distancing measures in workplaces are necessary and inevitable. Notwithstanding, they might undermine employees' mental health, whence the importance to implement proper organizational actions to support employees and to facilitate their adaptation, in this unprecedented organizational change. This paper examines a relatively unexplored topic. It goes beyond examining social isolation to explore how setting a predetermined frame and distance can have an impact on employees' mental health and recommends interventions that might help organizations to prevent mental health issues.","Hamouche","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.202","20210629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15494,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Positive Psychology: The Role of News and Trust in News on Mental Health and Well-Being","As of writing of this paper, over 94 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and over 2 million people have died. During crisis situations, people seek news to gain information and reduce uncertainty. Although news could provide some means of control, the constant access may also cause emotional distress. Research suggests that consumption of crisis news leads to high psychological distress and fear that may impact intentions to engage in healthy behavior. Fake news and widespread misinformation during this pandemic have obliterated public trust in news which can also affect mental health. Therefore, in this research we explore the impact of news exposure on mental well-being and test for plausible explanations. Utilizing survey methodology, we examine the role of news exposure on perceived stress, happiness, satisfaction, gratitude and the moderating impact of interest in COVID-19 news on the same. In addition, we propose trust in news as a mediator of the relationship between news exposure and abovementioned variables. The findings suggest that high levels of news exposure, combined with low levels of interest in COVID-19 news, led people to experience more stress and low satisfaction, gratitude, and happiness. However, when interest in COVID-19 news was high, people experienced more gratitude and happiness with increasing exposure. High levels of news exposure led to lower levels of trust that led to low satisfaction and happiness. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.","Jain","https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2021.1946219","20210629","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15495,""
"Giving birth during a pandemic: From elation to psychopathology","To compare the postpartum psychopathological symptoms of women who gave birth before the pandemic with those who gave birth during the pandemic. A total of 212 women participated in the study, of which 96 gave birth before the pandemic and 116 during the pandemic. Psychopathological symptoms, postpartum depression, perceived stress, and resilience were evaluated. Women who gave birth during the pandemic had higher scores on somatization, obsessions and compulsions, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism. In addition, perceived stress was the common predictor of an increase in these symptoms. Postpartum is a complicated period in a woman's life. Many psychological adaptations take place and women may be subject to psychological alterations during this period. In addition, women who gave birth during the COVID-19 crisis may show greater psychological vulnerability, due to the specific situation experienced during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic may have played a role in the increase in psychopathological symptoms after childbirth.

"The impact of COVID-19 on different population subgroups: ethnic, gender and age-related disadvantage","Against a background of stalling UK life expectancy, the COVID-19 pandemic is a major crisis for public health with impacts differing markedly by ethnicity, gender, and age. Direct health impacts include mortality and long-term harms among survivors. Social disruption and lockdown measures arising from uncontrolled infection have destabilised healthcare and other essential services. The economic crisis resulting from the pandemic is already triggering job losses, which will in turn have their own adverse health effects. These myriad impacts of the pandemic are not affecting everyone equally. Ethnic minorities, men and older people have disproportionately suffered from COVID-19, including their risk of mortality. However, some indirect impacts - including those on mental health and employment - are more likely to affect women and younger people. The health consequences of the pandemic will affect the lives of people in the UK for decades.","Katikireddi, Hainey, Beale","https://doi.org/10.4997/JRCPE.2021.240","20210629","COVID-19; age; ethnicity; gender; healthcare inequalities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15497,""
"Public Health Scotland - the first year: successes and lessons","Over its first year Public Health Scotland (PHS) played a key role in the national vaccination programme by providing professional leadership and expertise. We expedited the reporting of all aspects of the pandemic, and accelerated rapid evidence reviews. We contributed to rigorous research showing that: vaccination reduced hospitalisation by 90%, and the transmission of COVID-19 within households by 55%; hence vaccination works. Lessons for the future included strengthening whole genome sequencing to manage COVID-19 and to prepare for future pathogens. COVID-19 also stimulated the redesign of many health and social care services: by exploiting digital media; by implementing evidence on reducing barriers to service delivery; and by greater integration - of projects rather than organisations - enabling groups who had not worked together to address common issues. PHS and partners soon recognised the need to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on existing inequalities. So we aim to 'build back fairer' as the pandemic recedes, by pursuing PHS's four priorities: poverty; children and young people; place and community; and mental health and well-being.","Phin","https://doi.org/10.4997/JRCPE.2021.239","20210629","COVID-19; Polymerase Chain Reaction test; incidence; mortality; pandemics; poverty; public health; vaccination; vaccine; whole genome screening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15498,""
"Prevalence and Factors Associated With Mental Health Symptoms in Adults Undergoing Covid-19 Testing","Understanding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons receiving COVID-19 testing will help guide mental health interventions. We aimed to determine the association between sociodemographic factors and mental health symptoms at 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks (baseline) after a COVID-19 test, and compare prevalence of mental health symptoms at baseline to those at 16-week follow-up. Prospective cohort study of adults who received outpatient COVID-19 testing at primary care clinics. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 test results with mental health symptoms. Mental health symptoms reported at baseline were compared to symptoms at 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks follow-up using conditional logistic regression analyses. At baseline, a total of 124 (47.51%) participants reported at least mild depressive symptoms, 110 (42.15%) participants endorsed at least mild anxiety symptoms, and 94 participants (35.21%) endorsed hazardous use of alcohol. Females compared to males were at increased risk of at least mild depressive symptoms at baseline (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.08; 95% CI: 1.14-3.79). The odds of at least mild depressive symptoms was significantly lower among those residing in zip codes within the highest quartile compared to lowest quartile of household income (AOR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.17-0.81). Also, non-Hispanic Whites had significantly higher odds of reporting hazardous alcohol use compared to non-Whites at baseline (AOR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.05-3.57). The prevalence of mental health symptoms remained elevated after 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. We found a high burden of symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as hazardous alcohol use in a diverse population who received testing for COVID-19 in the primary care setting.

"Symptoms of ADHD Predict Lower Adaptation to the COVID-19 Outbreak: Financial Decline, Low Adherence to Preventive Measures, Psychological Distress, and Illness-Related Negative Perceptions","The COVID-19 outbreak created numerous multidimensional stressors, to which people show different levels of vulnerability. The current paper examines whether symptoms of ADHD are associated with poorer adaptation. After the first quarantine in Israel, 2,055 adults participated in an online survey. Participants completed scales probing adaptation indicators: financial status, adherence to preventive measures, mental health, and COVID-19 related perceptions. Background measures, including the level of symptoms of ADHD, were collected. Adaptation indicators negatively correlated with the level of symptoms of ADHD. Financial decline explained a small portion of the link between ADHD and decreased mental health. Background risk-taking, anti-social, and pro-social behavior partially explained the link between ADHD and non-adherence to preventive measures. COVID-19 related perceptions also partially explained that link. This study suggests that people with ADHD are more vulnerable to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore deserve special attention and care.","Pollak, Shoham, Dayan, Gabrieli-Seri, Berger","https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547211027934","20210629","ADHD; COVID-19; health; pandemic; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15500,""
"Predicting risk along the suicidality continuum: A longitudinal, nationally representative study of the Irish population during the COVID-19 pandemic","Little is known about the lifetime prevalence of different indicators of suicidality in the Irish general population; whether suicidality has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic; and what factors associated with belonging to different points on a continuum of suicidality risk. A nationally representative sample of Irish adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,032) completed self-report measures in May 2020 and a follow-up in August 2020 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 715). Lifetime prevalence rates were 29.5% for suicidal ideation, 12.9% for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and 11.2% for attempted suicide. There were no changes in past two-week rates of NSSI and attempted suicide during the pandemic. Correlations between the indicators of suicidality supported a progression from ideation to NSSI to attempted suicide. Suicidal ideation alone was associated with being male, unemployed, higher loneliness, and lower religiosity. NSSI (with no co-occurring attempted suicide) was associated with a history of mental health treatment. Attempted suicide was associated with ethnic minority status, lower education, lower income, PTSD, depression, and history of mental health treatment. Suicidal ideation, NSSI, and attempted suicide are relatively common phenomena in the general adult Irish population, and each has unique psychosocial correlates. These findings highlight important targets for prevention and intervention efforts.","Hyland, Rochford, Munnelly, Dodd, Fox, ValliÃƒÂ¨res, McBride, Shevlin, Bentall, Butter, Karatzias, Murphy","https://doi.org/10.1111/sltb.12783","20210629","attempted suicide; non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI); risk factors; self-harm; suicidal ideation; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15501,""
"The moderating effects of reported pre-pandemic social anxiety, symptom impairment, and current stressors on mental health and affiliative adjustment during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","Individuals with social anxiety (SA) have well-established fears of being negatively evaluated and exposing self-perceived flaws to others. However, the unique impacts of pre-existing SA on well-being and interpersonal outcomes within the stressful context of the pandemic are currently unknown. In a study that took place in May 2020, we surveyed 488 North American community participants online. We used multiple linear regression to analyze whether retrospective reports of pre-pandemic SA symptoms predicted current coronavirus anxiety, loneliness, fears of negative evaluation, use of preventive measures, and affiliative outcomes, and whether pre-pandemic functional impairment and recent COVID-related stressors moderated these relations. Results highlighted the negative effects of pre-pandemic SA on current mental health functioning, especially for participants with higher pre-pandemic functional impairment and greater exposure to COVID-related stressors. Although participants with higher pre-pandemic SA reported currently feeling lonelier and more fearful of negative evaluation, they also endorsed greater efforts to affiliate with others. High SA individuals may have heightened desire for social support within the isolating context of the pandemic, in which COVID-related social restrictions enable greater avoidance of social evaluation but may also mask the enduring impairment associated with pre-pandemic SA.","Ho, Moscovitch","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2021.1946518","20210629","COVID-19; Social anxiety; impairment; pandemic; social support; stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15502,""
"Parental Mental Health and Children's Behaviors and Media Usage during COVID-19-Related School Closures","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is different from previous disasters in that it continues to the present and has affected all aspects of family life. During epidemics, psychosocial support is not less important than infection control. During COVID-19-related school closures, prolonged partial closures of schools could have detrimental social and health consequences for children and may increase the burden on the family. Based on a community sample in Korea, this study identified parental concerns, children's media usage, other various factors and examined whether parental stress level or depression were positively associated with problem behaviors, media exposure, and sleep problems of the primary school children during school closure under COVID-19. Participants were 217 parents residing in Suwon, South Korea, who had primary school children and responded to a web-based questionnaire on parental concerns from school closure under COVID-19, subjective stress, depression, whether having received mental health services, and family characteristics; children's sleep patterns, problem behaviors, media usage during the online-only class period, and changes in activity level following the pandemic. During school closure, children gained body weight, spent less time in physical activities and more in media usage. Besides online learning content (97.2%), YouTube was highly used content (87.6%), and games followed (78.3%). Parental subjective stress index was highly associated with parental depression (Pearson correlation 0.439, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), children's sleep problems (0.283, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), tablet time (0.171, <i>P</i> = 0.012) and behavior problems (0.413, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Parental depression was associated with children's sleep problems (0.355, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), TV time (0.153, <i>P</i> = 0.024), tablet time (0.159, <i>P</i> = 0.019), and behavior problems (0.524, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Parents who previously received mental services seemed to be more concerned about the problems their children already have getting worse because of COVID-19 than the disease itself. Children's sleep problem was associated with tablet (0.172, <i>P</i> = 0.011) and smartphone time (0.298, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), but not its frequency. During COVID-19-related school closures, many parents and children had various difficulties relating to mental health.

"A prospective examination of COVID-19-related social distancing practices on suicidal ideation","The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred the implementation of several public safety measures to contain virus spread, most notably socially distancing policies. Prior research has linked similar public safety measures (i.e., quarantine) with suicide risk, in addition to supporting the role of social connection in suicidal thoughts and behaviors; consequently, there is a need to better understand the relationship between widespread social distancing policies and suicide risk. The current study aimed to examine the prospective association between COVID-19-related social distancing practices and suicidal ideation. Participants (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 472) completed measures of suicidal ideation and impacts of social distancing practices at baseline and two weeks later. After controlling for general psychosocial distress (i.e., depression, social connectedness), cross-lagged regression models identified prospective, bidirectional relationships between perceived impacts of social distancing on one's mental health and both passive and active suicidal ideation. The impact of social distancing on work/social routine was not associated with suicidal ideation. Overall, findings suggest the importance of an individual's perception regarding the effect of social distancing on their mental health, rather than the disruption to work or social routine, in suicide risk. Findings highlight potential targets for suicide risk prevention and intervention.","Ammerman, Burke, McClure, Jacobucci, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1111/sltb.12782","20210629","COVID-19; coronavirus; lockdown; social distancing; suicidal ideation; suicide risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15504,""
"Effects of Logotherapy-Based Mindfulness Intervention on Internet Addiction among Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has seriously affected people's work and lives. Disaster-related traumatic stress events increase the risk of substance abuse. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak, as a stress event, inevitably has a negative impact on Chinese adolescents with Internet addiction. In 2020, 1787 copies of the questionnaire were randomly distributed among adolescents aged 12-16 years in three communities in Shandong Province, China. Among the respondents, 121 Internet addicts voluntarily participated and were divided into the experiment group (60 members) and the control group (61 members). Logotherapy-based mindfulness intervention was carried out on the experiment group. The effects of the intervention were analyzed after eight weeks of intervention. After the intervention, significant decreases occurred in the scores of Internet addiction and its five dimensions in the experiment group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), thereby implying better invention effects in the experiment group than the control group. The experiment group exhibited an increase in the positive coping score and a decrease in the negative coping score (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Significant decreases were found in the anxiety and depression scores in the experiment group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Logotherapy-based mindfulness intervention can significantly reduce the degree of Internet addiction among adolescents during the COVID-19 period, improve their positive emotions, reduce their negative emotions, and alleviate the degree of anxiety and depression in adolescents.","Liu, Jiang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.18502/ijph.v50i4.6005","20210629","Adolescents; China; Internet addiction; Logotherapy; Mindfulness intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15505,""
"IgA potentiates NETosis in response to viral infection","IgA is the second most abundant antibody present in circulation and is enriched at mucosal surfaces. As such, IgA plays a key role in protection against a variety of mucosal pathogens including viruses. In addition to neutralizing viruses directly, IgA can also stimulate Fc-dependent effector functions via engagement of Fc alpha receptors (Fc-ÃŽÂ±RI) expressed on the surface of certain immune effector cells. Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte, express Fc-ÃŽÂ±RI, and are often the first to respond to sites of injury and infection. Here, we describe a function for IgA-virus immune complexes (ICs) during viral infections. We show that IgA-virus ICs potentiate NETosis-the programmed cell-death pathway through which neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Mechanistically, IgA-virus ICs potentiated a suicidal NETosis pathway via engagement of Fc-ÃŽÂ±RI on neutrophils through a toll-like receptor-independent, NADPH oxidase complex-dependent pathway. NETs also were capable of trapping and inactivating viruses, consistent with an antiviral function.","Stacey, Golubeva, Posca, Ang, Novakowski, Zahoor, Kaushic, Cairns, Bowdish, Mullarkey, Miller","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101497118","20210629","NETosis; SARS-CoV-2; influenza; neutrophils; viruses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15506,""

"The impact of COVID-19 on substance use disorder treatment in California: Service providers' perspectives","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the U.S. health care system, including addiction treatment. The objective of this study is to describe the impact of COVID on the delivery of treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) from the perspectives of service providers. Between May and September 2020, 61 service providers from 16 SUD treatment sites in California participated in virtual focus groups that lasted about an hour. We recorded the discussions and transcribed them verbatim. Two qualitative analysts independently conducted content analysis to identify themes from the transcripts. At the beginning of the pandemic, service providers observed a slight decrease in patient admissions, followed by an uptick in patient flow due to increased mental health issues, alcohol use, and relapse. Many of the clinics adopted flexible service delivery modes, such as curbside dosing and extended take-home medication, to enable social distancing in clinic settings. Approximately half of the clinic encounters offered telemedicime, and a considerable proportion of patients preferred to use telephone-based services rather than video-based services. Internet instability and technical difficulties limited the use of telemedicine among their patients. COVID has been challenging for SUD treatment, but health care systems rapidly reacted with adjustments that may result in long-term changes in SUD service delivery. Telemedicine-based services have played a major role in ensuring uninterrupted patient care. Providers need organizational, technical, and logistical support to improve and sustain telemedicine services that increase access to quality care for their patients.","Lin, Clingan, Cousins, Valdez, Mooney, Hser","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108544","20210629","COVID-19; Qualitative research; Service provider; Substance use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15508,""
"Mental health solutions for domestic violence victims amid COVID-19: a review of the literature","Due to COVID-19, domestic violence victims face a range of mental health challenges, possibly resulting in substantial human and economic consequences. However, there is a lack of mental health interventions tailored to domestic violence victims and in the context of COVID-19. In this study, we aim to identify interventions that can improve domestic violence victims' mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic to address the research gap. Drawing insights from established COVID-19 review frameworks and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information on interventions that can address domestic violence victims' mental health challenges amid COVID-19. We identified practical and timely solutions that can be utilized to address mental health challenges domestic violence victims face amid COVID-19, mainly focusing on (1) decreasing victims' exposure to the abuser and (2) increasing victims' access to mental health services. Domestic violence is a public health crisis that affects all demographics and could result in significant morbidity and mortality. In addition to emphasizing mental health challenges faced by domestic violence victims, multidisciplinary interventions are identified that could provide timely and practical solutions to domestic violence victims amid the pandemic, which range from tailored shelter home strategies, education programs, escape plans, laws and regulations, as well as more technology-based mental health solutions. There is a significant need for more multipronged and multidisciplinary strategies to address domestic violence amid and beyond the pandemic, particularly interventions that could capitalize on the ubiquity and cost-effectiveness of technology-based solutions.","Su, McDonnell, Roth, Li, Ã…Â egalo, Shi, Wagers","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00710-7","20210629","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Domestic violence and abuse; Interventions; Intimate partner violence; Mental health; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Violence against women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","",15509,""

We retrospectively analyzed the data of 39,677 patients (group 1) that applied to 6 different large-volume tertiary centers in Ã„Â°stanbul for outpatient consultation, surgery, or other procedures in the 3-month period between March 16 and June 14, 2020. The distribution of the number of patients who applied to subspecialty sections of urology outpatient clinics and inpatient services were recorded by weeks. That data was compared to data obtained from 145,247 patients that applied to the same centers in the same period of the previous year (group 2). The reflection of worldwide and Turkish COVID-19 case distribution on the daily urological practice was analyzed. There was a decrease in the number of patients in all subspecialty sections the in group 1 compared to group 2; however, there was a significant proportional increase in urooncology and general urology admissions. A decrease of approximately 75% was observed in the total number of surgeries (p &lt; 0.001). We detected a negative correlation between the numbers of admission to all outpatient clinics and COVID-19 cases or deaths in Turkey (p &lt; 0.05). The same negative correlation was present for all surgical procedures and consultations (p &lt; 0.05). The multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the number of cases in Turkey, and the number of deaths worldwide affect the number of outpatient clinic admissions (R2 = 0.38, p = 0.028) and urological surgery (R2 = 0.33, p = 0.020) in Turkey negatively.
