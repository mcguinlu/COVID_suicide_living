"The impact of the COVID-19 school closure on adolescents' use of mental healthcare services in Sweden","Background School closures used to contain the COVID-19 pandemic may have negative impacts on students' mental health but credible evidence is scarce. Sweden moved upper-secondary students to remote learning but, as the only country in the OECD, kept schools at lower levers open throughout the pandemic. Methods Using nationwide register data, we estimate the difference in the use of mental healthcare services between upper- and lower-secondary students during the pandemic, and relate this to the same group difference prior to the pandemic. For the main analysis, this difference-in-difference approach is applied to the period April-June 2020 when upper-secondary schools were fully closed. We also study the periods July-December 2020 when upper-secondary schools were largely open, and January-March 2021 when they were partially closed. We study the impact on all contacts with hospitals and specialist psychiatric care due to mental and behavioral disorder, as well as prescriptions for antidepressants, insomnia, and ADHD drugs. Findings Compared with expected rates, the use of mental healthcare services among upper-secondary students fell by -3.71 [CI95 -5.52 to -1.91] cases per 1000 during April-June 2020, largely due to a reduction in depression and anxiety-related diagnoses (-1.49; CI95 [-2.36 to -0.63]) and prescriptions (-1.80; CI95 [-2.93 to -0.68]). This reduction in the use of mental healthcare services corresponds to a 4.36% CI95 [-6.47 to -2.25]) decrease compared to the level prior to the pandemic. The decrease compared to expected rates persists through July-December 2020 (-3.55%; CI95 [-5.38 to -1.71]) and January-March 2021 (-5.23%; CI95 [-7.24 to -3.21]). The reduction is stronger among students in the 2nd (-5.06%; CI95 [-8.02 to -2.09]) and 3rd (-4.86%; CI95 [-8.19 to -1.53]) year of upper-secondary school. The decrease is concentrated to students who was not in contact with mental healthcare services earlier in the academic year (-16.70%; CI95 [-22.20 to -11.20]). The relative reduction is largest for unplanned care (-13.88%; CI95 [-19.35 to -8.42]) and care at emergency units (-18.19%; CI95 [-26.44 to -9.92]). Interpretation Closing upper-secondary schools in Sweden reduced use of mental healthcare services. There is no indication of this being due to reduced accessibility. In a setting with no strict lockdown, moving to online teaching for a limited period did not worsen mental health among students in upper-secondary schools.","Helena B Svaleryd; Evelina Bjorkegren; Jonas Vlachos","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.12.21267684","20211214","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23820,""
"Adult life-course trajectories of psychological distress and economic outcomes in midlife during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study used two British birth cohorts to examine whether pre-pandemic trajectories of psychological distress were associated with a greater risk of changes in financial and employment situation during the pandemic, as well as increased need for government support and use of other methods to mitigate their economic situation. We identified 5 differential life-course trajectories of psychological distress from adolescence to midlife and explored their relation to changes in financial and employment circumstances at different stages during the pandemic from May 2020 to March 2021, applying multinomial logistic regression and controlling for numerous early life covariates. In addition, we ran modified Poisson models with robust standard errors to identify whether different trajectories were more likely to have been supported by the benefit system, payment holidays, borrowing and other methods of mitigating the economic shock. We found that despite the UK governments economic response package economic inequalities for pre-pandemic psychological distress trajectories with differential onset, severity and chronicity across the life-course were exacerbated by the COVID-19 economic shock. Furthermore, the subsequent cut in government support, alongside increases in the cost of living may widen economic inequalities for differential pre-pandemic psychological distress trajectories, which in turn may also worsen mental health. This work highlights, different pre-pandemic trajectories of psychological distress were more vulnerable to economic shock.","Vanessa Moulton; Alice Sullivan; Alissa Goodman; Sam Parsons; George Ploubidis","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.13.21267727","20211214","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23821,""
"Change in Finances, Peer Access, and Mental Health Among Trans and Non-binary People in Canada During COVID-19","Purpose COVID-related stressors associated with loss of income and community are compounded with gender minority stress among trans and non-binary people (TNB), which may result in mental health burden. The present study examined the effect of COVID-related change in finances and TNB gathering access on anxiety and depression among TNB people. Methods Participants were 18 years and older (M age = 30) who completed both pre-pandemic baseline (Fall 2019) and pandemic follow-up (Fall 2020) surveys in the Trans PULSE Canada study. Multivariable regression analyses examined associations between change in (1) finances and (2) access to TNB peers and mental health during the pandemic. Results Of 780 participants, 50% reported that COVID had a negative effect on personal income and 58.3% reported loss in access to TNB peer or friend gatherings (in person or online). Depression and anxiety symptoms increased from pre-pandemic to follow-up, and most participants were above measurement cut-offs for clinical levels during the pandemic. Changes in finances and access to peer gatherings were associated with depression symptoms during the pandemic, but effects depended on level of pre-pandemic depression. For participants with high pre-pandemic depression, financial stability was not protective against increased depression at follow-up. Participants experiencing unprecedentedly high levels of depression during COVID may have pursued more TNB gatherings. Neither financial change nor access to TNB gatherings were associated with pandemic anxiety. Conclusion Findings suggest need for a multifaceted approach to mental health programmes and services to address structural barriers, including financial support and meaningful TNB community engagement.","Monica A.

"COVID-19 in French Nursing Homes during the Second Pandemic Wave: A Mixed-Methods Cross-Sectional Study","Introduction French nursing homes were deeply affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 38% of all residents infected and 5% dying. Yet, little was done to prepare these facilities for the second pandemic wave, and subsequent outbreak response strategies largely duplicated what had been done in the spring of 2020, regardless of the unique needs of the care home environment. Methods A cross-sectional, mixed-methods study using retrospective, quantitative data from residents of 14 nursing homes between November 2020 and mid-January 2021. Four facilities were purposively selected as qualitative study sites for additional in-person, in-depth interviews in January and February 2021. Results The average attack rate in the 14 participating nursing facilities was 39% among staff and 61% among residents. One-fifth (20) of infected residents ultimately died from COVID-19 and its complications. Failure-to-Thrive-Syndrome (FTTS) was diagnosed in 23% of COVID-positive residents. Those at highest risk of death were men (HR=1.78; IC95: 1.18 - 2.70; p=0.006) with FTTS (HR=4.04; IC95: 1.93 - 8.48; p<0.001) in facilities with delayed implementation of universal FFP2 masking policies (HR=1.05; IC95: 1.02 - 1.07; p<0.001). The lowest mortality was found in residents of facilities with a partial (HR=0.30; IC95: 0.18 - 0.51; p<0.001) or full-time physician on staff (HR=0.20; IC95: 0.08 - 0.53; p=0.001). Significant themes emerging from qualitative analysis centered on (i) the structural, chronic neglect of nursing homes, (ii) the negative effects of the top-down, bureaucratic nature of COVID-19 crisis response, and (iii) the counterproductive effects of lockdowns on both residents and staff. Conclusion Despite high resident mortality during the first pandemic wave, French nursing homes were ill-prepared for the second, with risk factors (especially staffing, lack of medical support, isolation/quarantine policy etc) that affected case fatality and residents' and caregivers' overall well-being and mental health.","Morgane Dujmovic; Thomas Roederer; Severine Frison; Carla Melki; Thomas Lauvin; Emmanuel Grellety-Bosviel","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.12.21267681","20211214","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23823,""
"Mental Health During COVID-19: A Qualitative Study with Ethnically Diverse Healthcare Workers in the United Kingdom","Introduction: Healthcare workers are experiencing deterioration in their mental health due to COVID-19. Ethnic minority populations in the United Kingdom are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with a higher death rate and poorer physical and mental health outcomes. It is important that healthcare organisations consider the specific context and mental, as well as physical, health needs of an ethnically diverse healthcare workforce in order to better support them during, and after, the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We undertook a qualitative work package as part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers (UK-REACH). As part of the qualitative research, we conducted focus group discussions with healthcare workers between December 2020 and July 2021, and covered topics such as their experiences, fears and concerns, and perceptions about safety and protection, while working during the pandemic. The purposive sample included ancillary health workers, doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. We conducted discussions using Microsoft Teams. Recordings were transcribed and thematically analysed. Findings: We carried out 16 focus groups with a total of 61 participants. Several factors were identified which contributed to, and potentially exacerbated, the poor mental health of ethnic minority healthcare workers during this period including anxiety (due to inconsistent protocols and policy); fear (of infection); trauma (due to increased exposure to severe illness and death); guilt (of potentially infecting loved ones); and stress (due to longer working hours and increased workload). Conclusion: COVID-19 has affected the mental health of healthcare workers. We identified a number of factors which may be contributing to a deterioration in mental health across diverse ethnic groups. Healthcare organisations should consider developing strategies to counter the negative impact of these factors. This paper will help employers of healthcare workers and other relevant policy makers better understand the wider implications and potential risks of COVID-19 and assist in developing strategies to safeguard the mental health of these healthcare workers going forward, and reduce ethnic disparities.","Irtiza Qureshi; Mayuri Gogoi; Amani Al-Oraibi; Fatimah Wobi; Jonathan Chaloner; Laura Gray; Anna Louise Guyatt; Laura Nellums; Manish Pareek","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.13.21267718","20211214","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23824,""

"The mediterranean diet: Healthy and sustainable dietary pattern in the time of Sars-Cov-2","COVID-19, first reported inWuhan, China in December 2019 quickly spread worldwide leading to serious health, social and economic consequences. Acrucial role in the pathogenesis of severe disease has been attributed to the inflammatory status, that in more severe cases may evolve in an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (""cytokine storm)"" and fatal outcome. Non-communicable diseases, nutritional disorders and advanced age, conditions associated with a low-grade systemic inflammation and immune function alterations, have been identified as major risks for severe COVID-19. General recommendations for fighting COVID-19 highlighted the paramount importance of adopting a healthy plant-based dietary pattern and healthy lifestyle. The Mediterranean dietary pattern is considered as one of the healthiest dietary patterns, and its benefits are supported by a large body of evidence. Furthermore, it is considered as a sustainable lifestyle model. The aim of this research was to update the multiple benefits of the Mediterranean dietary pattern on physical and mental health, focusing on the effects that it may have in combating COVID-19. The potential effects and mechanisms of action of the main bioactive components of Mediterranean diet were also analyzed. Considering its effects in modulating inflammation and oxidative stress and supporting the immune system, the Mediterranean dietary pattern may be considered the most promising dietary approach to combat COVID-19.","Bagnato, C.; Perfetto, C.; Labanca, F.; Negrin, L.

"Development and Initial Evaluation of a Nurse-Led Healthcare Clinic for Homeless and At-Risk Populations in Tasmania, Australia: A Collaborative Initiative","People who are homeless experience significantly poorer health than the general population and often face multifaceted challenges engaging with public healthcare services. Mission Health Nurse-led Clinic (MHNC) was established in 2019 to meet the healthcare needs of this marginalised population in Launceston, Tasmania. This study examines barriers to healthcare access amongst individuals who experience homelessness, client and staff perceptions of the MHNC services and explored opportunities for service expansion. Descriptive statistics were drawn from administrative data, and all interviews were thematically analysed. A total of 426 presentations were reported for 174 individuals experiencing homelessness over 26 months. The median client age was 42 years and 60.9% were male;A total of 38.5% were homeless or lived in a supported accommodation. The predominant reasons for clinic visits included prescription requests (25.3%) and immunisations (20.1%). A total of 10 clients and 5 City Mission staff were interviewed with three themes emerging from the findings: personal vulnerability, disconnectedness and acceptability of the MHNC. The MHNC services were reported to be highly appreciated by all clients. Mental health and allied health, extra operating hours and maintaining the flexibility of walk-in appointments were suggested as expansion areas for the service and were highlighted as ways to increase engagement for improved health outcomes.

"The European Union post COVID-19: Preserving innovation's cutting edge and fostering social cohesion","Despite a long period of post-crisis recovery, the COVID crisis caught the EU in a precarious state. The policy and institutional innovations during the financial crisis tempered the macroeconomic imbalances that had caused the crisis. Nevertheless, the EU was left with a strong trend of divergence in economic and social performance because of the lack of sufficiently strong reforms at EU and national levels. But the lessons of the previous crisis were learned. This time around, the EU-level policy and institutional innovations were decisive. The fiscal capacities of the hard-hit countries were strengthened quickly. Green and digital transformation will require a major new wave of innovation in the corporate sector in the EU. This, in turn, critically hinges on improving the quality of public and private institutions and advancing with the implementation of major reforms at the EU level, such as the digital single market or Capital Market Union. Implementing these reforms fully, and preventing later reversals is a key to stemming the trend of economic and social divergence, thus strengthening the coherence of the EU.","Buti, M.; Szekely, I.

"Incidence of postpartum depression in a tertiary care hospital in Navi Mumbai amid COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed health care drastically, especially looking at how obstetrics functions. This places mothers in a situation of greater psychological vulnerability and heightens the risk of postpartum depression and disrupted mother-infant bonding, which may be weighted or worsened by the balance of the couple. We expect this impact to be even greater in vulnerable mothers in the context of dysfunctioning social services. This study intends to identify the incidence of postpartum depression in women delivering during COVID-19 pandemic among lockdown protocols in a tertiary center in Navi Mumbai and identify its sociocultural triggers so that strategies may be evolved to reduce the morbidity costs attributable to the mother and child in the future. Materials and methods: This study was a cross-sectional study, performed over a period of 2 months from June 2020 to August 2020 at DY Patil School of Medicine and Dr DY Patil Hospital, a teaching hospital in Western India. Two hundred postnatal mothers were recruited for the study in the postpartum period from 1 to 6 weeks after delivery. A specially designed questionnaire was used to record various determinants to assess the risk factors, which could contribute to postpartum depression. A predesigned and pretested questionnaire (EDPS-Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) was used to detect the depressive symptoms in postnatal mothers. The results for qualitative data were presented in frequency and percentage. Binary logistic regression was used to predict the contribution of each independent risk factor to arrive at the depression level, which happens to be the dependent risk factor in this study. The statistical analysis was done by using SPSS 21.0. The significant level was used at p &lt; 0.05.","Chainani, E.

"Identification of Risk Factors for Suicidal Ideation and Attempt Based on Machine Learning Algorithms: A Longitudinal Survey in Korea (2007â€“2019)","Investigating suicide risk factors is critical for socioeconomic and public health, and many researchers have tried to identify factors associated with suicide. In this study, the risk factors for suicidal ideation were compared, and the contributions of different factors to suicidal ideation and attempt were investigated. To reflect the diverse characteristics of the population, the large-scale and longitudinal dataset used in this study included both socioeconomic and clinical variables collected from the Korean public. Three machine learning algorithms (XGBoost classifier, support vector classifier, and logistic regression) were used to detect the risk factors for both suicidal ideation and attempt. The importance of the variables was determined using the model with the best classification performance. In addition, a novel risk-factor score, calculated from the rank and importance scores of each variable, was proposed. Socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors showed a high correlation with risks for both ideation and attempt. Mental health variables ranked higher than other factors in suicidal attempts, posing a relatively higher suicide risk than ideation. These trends were further validated using the conditions from the integrated and yearly dataset. This study provides novel insights into suicidal risk factors for suicidal ideations and attempts.","Choi, Junggu, Cho, Seoyoung, Ko, Inhwan, Han, Sanghoon","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312772","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12772, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23833,""

"THE EFFECTS OF VIRTUAL WORLD CAPTIVITY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","In recent decades, access to digital technology has increased, and labor productivity has required the acquisition of digital knowledge, so that the same skills used to meet hedonic tendencies, have led to the initiation and amplification of harmful behaviors. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted normal activities globally, generating multiple challenges for people's physical and mental health. The adaptation to the new lifestyle, imposed by this pandemic, has increased the use of digital technology, which has led to the development of addictive behavior in some users. The purpose of this work is to bring to the attention of specialists, how the effects of virtual addictions, during the pandemic, act on mental health and unexpectedly change the normal rhythm of life. This work is a synthesis of possible addictive behaviors and mental disorders triggered by the use of digital devices, classified according to: the field in which the addictive behavior is installed, predisposed age groups and the association with pre-existing mental disorders. Changing people's behavior, associated with other stressors, can lead to a multitude of ailments, ranging from mental disorders to changes in compliance in organic diseases. Consequently, addictive behaviors have different intensities, occupy variable durations, have a fluctuating mental consumption. They generate a gradual social dysfunction, to which pre-existing mental suffering is added, and people involved develop disorders requiring the intervention of a specialist in the field of mental health.","Darie, C.; Terpan, M.; Vlad, C.","https://doi.org/10.35630/2199-885x/2021/11/5.13","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Archiv Euromedica; 11(5):48-51, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23835,""
"Impacts of changes in alcohol consumption patterns during the first 2020 COVID-19 restrictions for people with and without mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions: A cross sectional study in 13 countries","Background The initial period of COVID-19-related restrictions affected substance use in some population groups. We explored how changes in alcohol use at the beginning of the pandemic impacted the health and well-being of people with and without mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions (MHDCs). Methods Data came from the Global Drug Survey Special Edition on COVID-19 conducted in May-June 2020. Measured were;changes in drinking compared to February 2020 (pre-COVID-19 restrictions), reasons for changes, and impact on physical health, mental health, relationships, finances, work/study, and enjoyment. This study included 38,141 respondents (median ageÂ =Â 32 IQR 25-45;51.9% cis man;47.8% cis woman;1.2% trans/non-binary;30.2% with MHDCs e.g. depression 20.0%, anxiety 16.3%, ADHD 3.8%, PTSD 3.3%). Results A third (35.3%) of respondents with MHDCs and 17.8% without MHDCs indicated that increased drinking affected their mental health negatively (p&lt;.001);44.2% of respondents with MHDCS compared to 32.6% without MHDCs said it affected their physical health negatively (p&lt;.001). Reduced drinking was associated with better mental health among a fifth (21.1%) of respondents with MHDCS and 14.4% without MHDCs (p&lt;.001). Age, relationship status, living arrangements, employment, coping and distress were significant predictors of increases in drinking. Conclusion Among people with MHDCS, reduced alcohol consumption was associated with better mental health, while the negative effects of increased drinking were more pronounced when compared to people without MHDCS. When supporting people in reducing alcohol consumption during uncertain times, people with MHDCS may need additional support, alongside those experiencing greater levels of distress.","Davies, Emma L.; Puljevic, Cheneal, Gilchrist, Gail, Potts, Laura, Zhuparris, Ahnjili, Maier, Larissa J.; Barratt, Monica J.; Winstock, Adam R.; Ferris, Jason A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103563","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy;: 103563, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23836,""
"Inflammatory bowel disease clinical service recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic","In some services, IBD advice lines were stopped, specialist nurses and medical staff were redeployed to support acute admissions, outpatient clinics were deferred, and home care services were under threat.3 4 In addition, there was a reluctance from patients to come to hospital or contact their services due to concerns over their personal safety.5 6 The Crohn's and Colitis United Kingdom (CCUK) â€˜life in lockdownâ€™ patient survey reported that patients felt their IBD teams kept them well informed of coronavirus and their condition. Importantly, one in five patients reported that they also received inaccurate information on other aspects such as shielding.7 The pandemic has also highlighted the disparities in accessing healthcare8 and addressing these alongside organisational transformation will support personalised care, which is one of the main recommendations of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease United Kingdom (IBD UK) standards.9 Healthcare services have restarted routine clinical practices responding swiftly to regional and national lockdowns in the second wave.10 Additionally, local data have allowed clinical teams to refine service delivery supporting those most vulnerable to poorer outcomes if they develop COVID-19.11 12 The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) has commissioned independent reviews on the redesign of outpatient services focusing on telemedicine and restarting endoscopy safely.13â€“20 The COVID-19 pandemic effect on clinical research and trial activity are being addressed separately by the BSG IBD research committee.1 21 We are currently in our second wave of the pandemic and a third national lockdown with increasing pressure to maintain specialist services as well as directly supporting care for patients with COVID-19. The BSG and European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) IBD guidelines and the IBDUK standards have described the components of a functional multidisciplinary IBD team.9 22â€“25 In addition to senior clinical decision-makers, specialist IBD nurses, endoscopy teams, dieticians, pharmacists and mental health services are all crucial aspects that will help keep patients in remission. Patient support The uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant physical, emotional and psychological stress for patients.5 26â€“28 The key concerns for patients are delays to diagnosis and planned procedures/surgery, accessible relevant information, securing the continued support of specialist IBD teams and maintenance of drug treatment.29 Improved coordination between central government, the National Health Service (NHS), specialist clinicians, community primary care teams and patient charities is needed to minimise patients receiving inaccurate or conflicting information.","Din, Shahida, Gaya, Daniel, Kammermeier, Jochen, Lamb, Christopher A.; Macdonald, Jonathan, Moran, Gordon, Parkes, Gareth, Pollok, Richard, Shaji, Sebastian, Segal, Jonathan, Selinger, Christian, Smith, Philip J.; Steed, Helen, Arnott, Ian D.","https://doi.org/10.1136/flgastro-2021-101805","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Frontline Gastroenterology; 13(1):77-81, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23837,""
"Retrospective study of non-natural manners of death in Ontario: Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures","Summary Background The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-natural manners of death in Ontario is not known. Understanding the indirect consequences of the pandemic and related public health measures (i.e. lockdown) fills a vital need to inform best practice in public health and guide policy decisions. Methods The Office of the Chief Coroner and the Ontario Forensic Pathology Service (OCC-OFPS) investigate sudden and unexpected deaths in the province of Ontario. The number of homicides, suicides, and accidental deaths (non-natural deaths=77,655) were extracted from the centralized Coroner's Information System database (total deaths=197,966), across four provincially defined stages of lockdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic (March 17 to December 31, 2020), and crude rates (per 100,000 people) were compared to the previous eleven years. Findings There was no major change to the rate of homicides during 2020 compared to 2009-2019 (RR 1Â·1, 95% CI 0Â·95-1Â·2;p=0Â·19;estimated annual effect=21 more deaths in 2020). The rate of suicides also did not show an overall major change in 2020 (RR 1Â·02, 95% CI 0Â·96-1Â·1;p=0Â·50;estimated annual effect=27 more deaths in 2020). However, during the first stage of lockdown (Stage 0), there was a decrease in the rate of suicides compared to all combinations of recent years from 2013 onwards (RRs 0Â·82-0Â·86, combined 95% CI 0Â·69-0Â·99;max p=0Â·039;estimated effect of 30 less deaths in Stage 0). There was an excess of over 1,500 accidental drug-related deaths that occurred during 2020 (RR 2Â·5, 95% CI 2Â·4-2Â·7;p&lt;0Â·001). This finding held up to â€˜interrupted time seriesâ€™ robustness testing, indicating that 2020 had substantially more drug-related deaths, even when accounting for the linear increasing trend over time. Although motor vehicle collision associated fatalities appeared to decrease slightly in 2020 (RR 0Â·89, 95% CI 0Â·81-0Â·96;p=0Â·0039;estimated annual effect of 78 less deaths), we could not conclude any lockdown-associated effect, particularly when compared to 2019 (RR 0Â·26, 95% CI 0Â·75-1Â·1;p=0Â·26). Interpretation In Ontario, the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic did not greatly increase homicide or suicide rates, nor decrease motor vehicle collision fatality rates;however, the longer-term impact of the pandemic remains to be elucidated and ongoing vigilance is warranted in the event that other trends emerge. Accidental drug-related fatalities substantially increased during all stages of the lockdown, marking an urgent need for consideration in policy. These results highlight the vital role of death investigation systems in providing high quality and timely data to inform public health recommendations.","Dmetrichuk, Jennifer M.; Rosenthal, Jeffrey S.; Man, Julia, Cullip, Mackenzie, Wells, Richard A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100130","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: The Lancet Regional Health - Americas; 7:100130, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23838,""
"Depression, anxiety, and stress during the sanitary emergency of COVID-19 in southeastern Mexico","Aim: Evaluate the level of depression, anxiety, and stress;and identify the factors associated with these psychological responses during the third phase of the COVID-19 health emergency in a sample of Mexican population. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted. We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results: We included 997 individuals with a mean age of 35.3 +/- 12.9 years;symptoms of stress. Respondents were more likely to present depression if they were &lt;40 years old (OR 1.73), not having a religion (OR 1.71), if they were currently unemployed (OR 1.54). Factors associated with anxiety were age&lt;40 years old (OR 1.73) and having recent contact with suspected or diagnosed patients with COVID-19 (OR 1.54). Self-perception of insufficient knowledge about COVID-19 disease was associated with stress (OR 1.55). Declaring not feeling safe of COVID-19 infection was associated with depression (OR 2.03), anxiety (OR 1.90), and stress (OR 1.75). Conclusions: The damage to mental health caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is evident;health personnel must pay attention to their psychological state and well-being to take appropriate measures.","Emigdio-Vargas, A.; Davalos-Martinez, A.; Barrera-Rodriguez, E.; Arreguin-Cano, J.

"Factors associated with persistence of symptoms 1 year after COVID-19: A longitudinal, prospective phone-based interview follow-up cohort study","Objective: To investigate the persistence of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in a real-file prospective cohort of patients at 12 months from hospital discharge. Methods: Longitudinal, prospective, single-center, cohort telephone follow-up (FU) study in a Tertiary Care Hospital. All consecutive patients &gt;18 years admitted for COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled in a telephone FU program aimed at monitoring symptoms after 1,3,6,9 and 12 months from hospital discharge. The survey screened for somatic (fatigue, dyspnea, dyspnea, palpitations, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, ageusia, anosmia, bowel symptoms) and emotional symptoms (insomnia, confusion, altered sense of reality, loss of appetite, fear, and depression) and frailty. Only patients with 12 months FU data were analyzed (N=254). Prevalence and factors associated with symptoms were the main outcomes. Frailty was defined by the presence of =3 indicators: weakness, slowness/impaired mobility, weight-loss, low physical activity, and exhaustion. Results: At 12 months, 40.5% of patients reported at least one symptom. The most common somatic ones were fatigue, exertional dyspnea, cough, bowel complaints while the most common psycho-emotional were insomnia, confusion, fear, and depression. Age, gender, gender, frailty, multiple symptoms at baseline and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were associated with symptoms persistence. Furthermore, frailty, COPD and multiple symptoms at baseline were associated with increased risk of somatic symptoms at 12 months, while age and gender were associated with emotional ones. Conclusions: Burden of the long COVID-19 symptoms decreased over time but remained as high as 40% at 12 months with important gender and functional differences, highlighting potential patient categories who may benefit from specific follow up strategies.","Fumagalli, Carlo, Zocchi, Chiara, Tassetti, Luigi, Silverii, Maria Vittoria, Amato, Carla, Livi, Luca, Giovannoni, Lorenzo, Verrillo, Federica, Bartoloni, Alessandro, Marcucci, Rossella, Lavorini, Federico, Fumagalli, Stefano, Ungar, Andrea, Olivotto, Iacopo, Rasero, Laura, Fattirolli, Francesco, Marchionni, NiccolÃ³","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2021.11.018","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: European Journal of Internal Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23840,""
"University Anxiety, Depression and Stress in Pandemic Times","Fear and uncertainty, related to emergency health measures such as confinement by Covid-19, has generated anxiety, depression and stress. In this context, the objective of this work has been to establish the correlation between the three variables. The type of study was carried out under a quantitative approach, basic type, descriptive level, with a non-experimental cross-sectional-correlational design. The DASS-21 scale (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) was used to measure the variables indicated. The sample comprised a total of 440 students of Human Medicine from the first to the fifth cycle;it was composed of 173 females (39.3%) and 267 males (60.7%). The selection was made under non-probabilistic convenience sampling. The descriptive statistical findings revealed the difference in the students: males presented higher levels in the variables measured: anxiety in 58.2%;depression, 56.4% and stress, 34.8%. In the hypothesis test, the correlation between the anxiety variable and the depression variable obtained a result of Spearman's Rho = 0.804** which is interpreted as a high positive relationship between the variables. As for the correlation between the anxiety variable and the stress variable, a Spearman's Rho = 0.893 was obtained, which is interpreted as high correlation between the variables.","Garay, J. P.

"One Health, one national park: a contribution to new perspectives and economics for modern times","One Health is a concept that sees human, animal, and environmental health as parts of a single interdependent system. The Covid-19 pandemic, its implications reaching far beyond the direct effects of a coronavirus on people's health, underlines the importance of this increasingly influential perspective. In practice, One Health has its roots in early affiliations of human and animal health science. Over time, each sphere of inquiry evolved to address its own agenda. Recently, veterinary scientists have led the reintegration, extension, and promotion of One Health sciences to address modern-day problems in which health and people's general wellbeing are viewed as inseparable. A prerequisite is to set out a framework of concepts and principles enabling clear definition of problems, interrelationships needing to be understood, and the level of aggregation appropriate for quantitative analysis. This paper extends the framework by considering economic trade-offs that inevitably must be made in the human, animal, and environmental sub-systems, and the consequences when policy interventions are superimposed on them. The New Forest National Park in southern England is a case where this perspective is essential. Following the Stone Mountain definition of One Health, first a conventional approach linking human and animal health is taken. Lyme disease, Alabama rot, bovine tuberculosis and strangles are examples of diseases known to be of significant concern. The focus is finding scope for socially efficient risk reduction in response to mitigation resource use. Superimposed on the grazing livestock subsystems are support payments for commoner farmers. The financial incentives provided by what effectively are headage payments have caused animal inventories to grow so much that the wider environment may well be subject to adverse spillover effects that merit investigation.","Howe, K.

"Association of serum interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein with depressive and adjustment disorders in COVID-19 inpatients","Background Immune mechanisms are part of the pathophysiology of mental disorders, although their role remains controversial. In depressive disorders a chronic low-grade inflammatory process is observed, with higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) values. Furthermore, in SARS-CoV2 infection, which is closely related to depressive disorders, there is a proinflammatory cascade of cytokines that causes systemic inflammation. Methods The present study evaluates the relationship between IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels and the presence of depressive and adjustment disorders in a sample of 1851 patients admitted to hospital for SARS-CoV2 infection from March to November 2020. Concentrations of IL-6 and CRP were determined within the first 72 hours at admission and compared among groups of patients according to previous history and current presence of depression or adjustment disorders.

"Chronic Pediatric Pain and Mental Illness During the COVID-19 Era: A Case Series From Inpatient Child Psychiatry Unit","Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists following tissue injury or disease processes and is believed to have taken place after healing. It is a functional impairment that causes discomfort and leads to the inability to perform various essential daily activities. Chronic pain in pediatrics can be of various types, the most commonly prevalent types being headaches, abdominal pain, and limb pain. Adolescents with chronic pain have been found to have generalized anxiety scores twice that of the average population, along with significant impairment of family dynamics. Some forms of chronic pain respond effectively to medication and psychotherapy, and recurrence is common when stress is triggered by external or environmental factors, most recently in the form of COVID-19. In this case series, we discuss three cases of worsening mental health presentations and chronic pain exacerbation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We talk about the unique perspective of chronic pain in the pediatric population and comorbid mental illnesses and their management from a psychiatric standpoint.","Jain, A.; Gee, S.; Malayala, S.

"Prevalence, Spectrum, and Outcome of Deliberate Self-harm Presenting to the Emergency Department during the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020","Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the lockdown imposed, has had profound social and economic consequences and thereby implications on psychological health. This study aims to understand the effects of the pandemic and the lockdown on the prevalence, spectrum, and outcome of patients presenting with deliberate self-harm (DSH) to the emergency department (ED). Methodology: This was a retrospective, observational study done in the ED of a tertiary care hospital in South India on DSH victims presenting from January to August 2020, spanning the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and unlock phases of the pandemic, and compared with data from a similar period in 2018. Results:Our study population included 507 DSH victims (prevalence: 1.2%) from January to August 2020.The percentage of DSH cases showed a slight increase among the pre-lockdown (203/17,234: 1.18%), the lockdown (179/14,687: 1.22%), and the unlock phases (125/9,977:1.25%). There was a female preponderance (286/507: 56.4%), and the mean age was 33.2 years. Of the 507 patients, 369 (72.8%) were admitted and 19 (3.7%) died. The lockdown period in 2020 showed a 40.9% absolute decrease in the number of DSH victims presenting to the ED as compared to an equivalent period in 2018. The proportion of patients taking plant poisons was significantly lower (odds ratio (OR) 0.38, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.18-0.81, p = 0.012] and that of corrosive ingestion was significantly higher (OR 2.94, 95%C11.57-5.48, p = 0.001) in the lockdown phase as compared to a lockdown-control phase of 2018. Conclusion:There was a reduction in the absolute number of patients presenting with DSH to the ED during January-August 2020, and more so during the lockdown phase (March 24-June 30), as compared to a similar period in 2018.There was no significant difference in the hospital outcome of DSH patients between the two periods.","John, S.

"Challenges With Long-Term Care Placement in Pediatric Psychiatry During COVID-19: A Case Series From Inpatient Unit","A large number of children and youth have been affected worldwide during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Apart from the obvious medical and financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an immense amount of psychosocial impact specifically on children and adolescents ranging from parents losing their jobs leading to financial hardships to school closure leading to not having significant interaction with their peers and having to spend more time at home which often leads to psychosocial conflicts. According to the literature review, in recent times, there has been worsening of mental health illnesses, increased suicide attempts, and severity of suicide attempts which has led to more visits to the hospitals and clinics with psychiatric concerns. There has been a pattern of increasing patient acuity in inpatient psychiatric units, more specifically in the pediatric units. The average length of stay for inpatient units has been increasing in the pediatric psychiatric units and an unfortunate downside of which has been noted to be increased lag time for placements in foster care systems or residential treatment centers in recent times. Here, we present cases of three teenagers who faced significant challenges in obtaining placement to foster care systems or residential treatment centers in the context of longer wait times experienced for intensive-out-of-home treatment services during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss potential solutions to this issue.","Kaur, J.; Jain, A.","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.19947","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Cureus; 13(11):4, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23848,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of the General Population and the Population of Psychiatric Patients","Background: Data on the psychological consequences of social isolation imposed by the global public health threat of the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. Mentally healthy people and psychiatric patients react to stress in different ways. Goal: To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the general population and the population of psychiatric patients in Vojvodina. Material and Methods: The study is designed as a cross-sectional study. It was conducted during April, May and June 2020 at the end and immediately after the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia on the territory of Novi Sad. Participants were divided into two groups - a clinical group of patients with mental disorders and a control group composed of the healthy volunteers. A self-assessment questionnaire was used to collect data on the presence of anxiety and symptoms of depression and behavioral disorders that indicate increased levels of stress - such as insomnia, sedative abuse. Results: Anxiety, fear, panic attacks (50%), depressive symptoms (42%), sleep problems (30%) and sedative abuse (25%) were the most commonly reported psychiatric symptoms. Healthy subjects did not show a statistically significant presence of any symptoms and signs associated with mental problems. Conclusion: The results support the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of psychiatric patients. It can be expected that the most pronounced effects of the pandemic on mental health in the general population will be visible in the future.","Kuljancic, D.

Frontline health workersâ€™ strategies for managing mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Frontline healthcare workers have experienced detrimental mental health impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic including anxiety, emotional distress, stress, fatigue, and burnout. But little is known about how these healthcare professionals take care of their own mental health in the midst of considerable personal, occupational and social disruption. In this article, we use qualitative data from an Australian national survey to examine the self-care strategies frontline healthcare professionals employed to manage their mental health and wellbeing during the crisis. Findings reveal how healthcare workers sought to adjust to disruption by adopting new self-care practices and mindsets, while encountering numerous personal and professional struggles that undermined their capacity for self-care. Feeling socially connected and valued were critical dimensions of caring for self, illustrating the importance of locating self-care in the social domain. These findings, we argue, highlight the need to expand conceptions of self-care away from those that focus primarily on the individual towards approaches that situate self care as collective and relational.","Lewis, Sophie, Willis, Karen, Bismark, Marie, Smallwood, Natasha","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2021.100053","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100053, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23850,""
"The Digital Divide and Active Aging in China","With the rapid development of society, especially the advent of intelligent technology of life services, the ability of the elderly to adapt to modern digital life is getting weaker and weaker, the dilemma of the â€œdigital divideâ€ for the elderly has aroused heated public debate. In the era of aging and information superposition, in-depth study of the multi-dimensional impact of the digital divide on the elderly has become an effective content of Chinaâ€™s active aging strategy. Based on the micro-data of the Chinese General Social Survey in 2017, this paper uses the entropy right method to construct the digital divide index system for the elderly over 60 years of age from the perspective of essential equipment, Internet utilization degree, and Basic Internet usage skills. At the same time, this paper constructs Chinaâ€™s comprehensive index of active aging from three aspects: health, social participation, and guarantee of the elderly, to study the impact of the digital divide on Chinaâ€™s active aging. The following conclusions have been drawn: the digital divide among the elderly significantly inhibits Chinaâ€™s active aging. The digital divide reduces the level of physical and mental health and social participation of older persons and inhibits the level of guarantee of older persons, thus impeding their active aging. In addition, it also reduces the overall life satisfaction of the elderly. The use of the Internet, skills, and other digital technology abilities of the elderly have effectively promoted active aging. The more Internet access devices older people have, the higher their level of social participation. The higher the Internet frequency of the elderly, the healthier the body and mind. Furthermore, the greater the level of physical and mental health and social participation of older groups who use online payments. The digital divide among the elderly inhibits the process of Chinaâ€™s active aging, and the unique course and stage characteristics of the development of the aging of the Chinese population require us to pay full attention to the relationship between the digital divide and active aging and how to construct a â€œdigital-friendlyâ€ aging system is an essential issue for Chinaâ€™s social development to consider.","Liu, Lingchen, Wu, Fan, Tong, Huiying, Hao, Cuihong, Xie, Tingting","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312675","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12675, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23851,""
"Attitudinal Barriers Hindering Adoption of Telepsychiatry among Mental Healthcare Professionals: Israel as a Case-Study","Despite proven advantages for the use of telemedicine in psychiatry, mental healthcare professionals have shown deep-seated mistrust and suspicion of telepsychiatry, which hinders its widespread application. The current study examines the attitudes of Israeli mental health professionals towards telepsychiatry and seeks to uncover the effects of experience and organizational affiliation on its adoption. The methodology included qualitative and thematic analysis of 27 in-depth interviews with Israeli mental health professionals, focusing on three major themesâ€”clinical quality, economic efficiency, and the effects on the workâ€“life balance of healthcare professionals. The attitudes of mental health professionals were found to be widely divergent and sharply dichotomized regarding different aspects of telepsychiatry and its suitability for mental healthcare services. However, there was a general consensus that telemedicine may not fulfil its promise of being a panacea to the problems of modern public medicine. In addition, attitudes were related to hierarchical position, organizational affiliation, and personal experience with telepsychiatry. Specifically, organizational affiliation influenced experience with and support for the assimilation of telepsychiatry. The study also revealed the role of organizational leadership and culture in promoting or inhibiting the proliferation and adoption of innovative technologies and services in modern medicine.","Magal, Tamir, Negev, Maya, Kaphzan, Hanoch","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312540","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12540, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23852,""
"Study protocol: the OxWell school survey investigating social, emotional and behavioural factors associated with mental health and well-being","IntroductionImproving our understanding of the broad range of social, emotional and behavioural factors that contribute to mental health outcomes in adolescents will be greatly enhanced with diverse, representative population samples. We present a protocol for a repeated self-report survey assessing risk and protective factors for mental health and well-being in school pupils aged 8â€“18 years with different socioeconomic backgrounds in England. The survey will provide a comprehensive picture of mental health and associated risks at the community level to inform the development of primary and secondary prevention and treatment strategies in schools.Methods and analysisThis protocol is for a large-scale online repeated self-report survey, representative of children and adolescents aged 8â€“18 years attending schools or further education colleges in participating counties in England. The survey consists of around 300 questions, including validated measures of mental health and well-being, risk and protective factors, and care-seeking behaviour and preferences. Additional questions each year vary to address current events and novel hypotheses, developed by the research team, collaborators and stakeholders. Primary analyses will investigate current and changing risk and protective factors, care-seeking behaviour and attitudes to allowing linkage of their sensitive data to other databases for research, and will compare measures of mental health to measures of well-being.Ethics and disseminationThe study was approved by the University of Oxford Research Ethics Committee (Reference: R62366). Tailored data summaries will be provided to participating schools and stakeholders within 3 months of data collection. The main findings will be presented at scientific meetings, published in peer-reviewed journals and shared via digital and social media channels. At the end of the study, other researchers will be able to apply for access to anonymous data extracts.","Mansfield, Karen Laura, Puntis, Stephen, Soneson, Emma, Cipriani, Andrea, Geulayov, Galit, Fazel, Mina","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052717","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(12), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23853,""
"Correlates of suicidal ideation related to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Repeated cross-sectional nationally representative Canadian data","Objective With significant levels of mental distress reported by populations, globally, the magnitude of suicidal ideation during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic is a central concern. The goal of this study was to quantify the extent of pandemic-related suicidal ideation in the Canadian population during the first ten months of the pandemic and identify sociodemographic and pandemic-related stressors associated with increased risk of ideation. Method Data were derived from three rounds of a mental health monitoring survey, nationally representative by age, gender, household income, and region, delivered online in May and September 2020 and January 2021. Bivariate analyses were used to quantify the proportion of respondents in Canada reporting suicidal ideation by sociodemographic factors and pandemic-related stressors. Unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between suicidal ideation and correlates within four pandemic-related stressor categories (financial, relationship, substance use, COVID-19 exposure). Results Of the 7002 respondents, 6.2% (nÂ =Â 433) reported experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings as a result of the pandemic within the two weeks prior to taking the survey. In terms of sociodemographic factors, suicidal ideation was more commonly reported among those who were not cisgender, &lt;65 years-old, single, Indigenous, LGBT2Q+, and who experience a pre-existing mental health condition. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, indicators across all four pandemic-related stressor categories were associated with two or more times the odds of suicidal ideation. Conclusion Disparities in COVID-19 related suicidal ideation have persisted throughout the first year of the pandemic for specific sociodemographic sub-groups and those who have faced stressors related to finances, relationships, increased substance use, and COVID-19 virus exposure. To best address these disparities and to prevent a transition from suicidal ideation to action, appropriate planning, resources, and policies are needed to ensure health and well-being for everyone.","McAuliffe, Corey, Pumarino, Javiera, Thomson, Kimberly C.; Richardson, Chris, Slemon, Allie, Salway, Travis, Jenkins, Emily K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100988","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: SSM - Population Health;: 100988, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23854,""
"Smart Homes as Enablers for Depression Pre-Diagnosis Using PHQ-9 on HMI through Fuzzy Logic Decision System","Depression is a common mental illness characterized by sadness, lack of interest, or pleasure. According to the DSM-5, there are nine symptoms, from which an individual must present 4 or 5 in the last two weeks to fulfill the diagnosis criteria of depression. Nevertheless, the common methods that health care professionals use to assess and monitor depression symptoms are face-to-face questionnaires leading to time-consuming or expensive methods. On the other hand, smart homes can monitor householdersâ€™ health through smart devices such as smartphones, wearables, cameras, or voice assistants connected to the home. Although the depression disorders at smart homes are commonly oriented to the senior sector, depression affects all of us. Therefore, even though an expert needs to diagnose the depression disorder, questionnaires as the PHQ-9 help spot any depressive symptomatology as a pre-diagnosis. Thus, this paper proposes a three-step framework;the first step assesses the nine questions to the end-user through ALEXA or a gamified HMI. Then, a fuzzy logic decision system considers three actions based on the nine responses. Finally, the last step considers these three actions: continue monitoring through Alexa and the HMI, suggest specialist referral, and mandatory specialist referral.","MÃ©ndez, Juana Isabel, Meza-SÃ¡nchez, Ana Victoria, Ponce, Pedro, McDaniel, Troy, Peffer, Therese, Meier, Alan, Molina, Arturo","https://doi.org/10.3390/s21237864","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Sensors; 21(23):7864, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23855,""
"THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON SPANISH NURSES AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIES TO REDUCE IT","Background Although the emotional and psychological impact of nursesâ€™ work had been identified before the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic aggravating risk indicators for their mental health. Aim The objective of this study was to analyze the levels of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress and burnout of nurses in the Balearic Islands (Spain) during the pandemic to identify possible sociodemographic and related occupational factors. Design A cross-sectional study of 892 nurses was conducted during four weeks from February to March 2021. Methods Sociodemographic data related to the pandemic were collected and anxiety, depression, burnout and post-traumatic stress were measured with validated scales. A multivariate and predictive analysis was carried out with risk estimates. Findings 75.6% of the nurses had experience in COVID-19 units, and 49.1% had worked for more than 10 months in a COVID-19 unit. Nurses in COVID-19 units (hospital ward or ICU) were more likely to report emotional fatigue (OR 1.9, p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (OR 1.5, pÂ =Â 0.021). In general, moderate posttraumatic stress was evident in general nurses (pÂ =Â 0.027), and severe posttraumatic stress was evident in ICU nurses (pÂ =Â 0.027). A 1.24-month reduction in COVID-19 patient care predicted reduced levels of emotional fatigue (5.45 points), depersonalization (1.87 points) and posttraumatic stress (4.65 points) in nurses. Conclusion Given the occurrence of new waves of COVID-19, the need to establish preventive strategies that focus on the personal and occupational characteristics related to these indicators and to implement urgent psychological support strategies is demonstrated. Impact Given these findings, it is imperative solutions are urgently applied in order to prevent compounding risk to the health system.","Molina-Mula, JesÃºs, GonzÃ¡lez-Trujillo, Antonio, PerellÃ³-Campaner, Catalina, Tortosa-EspÃ­nola, Sergio, Tera-Donoso, Jorge, la Rosa, Litha Otero De, Romero-Franco, Natalia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colegn.2021.12.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Collegian;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23856,""
"HOW THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS CHANGED THE IMAGE OF PSYCHIATRY","Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has brought the world at a standstill with unprecedented confinement measures and lockdowns in order to contain the novel virus. Negative effects of the pandemic on mental health are the main focal point. Social isolation, loneliness and the uncertainty of day to day living put a strain on the individual's psyche, therefore psychiatric intervention is highly needed. Mental health care providers are the key to help preserve and reconstruct a post-pandemic society. METHOD: Existing literature on the Covid-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved from the PubMed database using as a main focal point the role of the psychiatrist in managing the angst caused by the already mentioned stressful factor. In times of uncertainty and fear, mental health care remains the major pillar as it has been for numerous years, with implications worldwide. CONCLUSION: There is a pressing need for developing healthy coping mechanisms during the current crisis and it is mandatory to acknowledge the role of the psychiatrist from an early stage in order to preserve a sense of stability for the individual.","Moraru, C.; Radulescu, I.

"How much Fear of COVID-19 is There in Latin America? A Prospective Exploratory Study in Six Countries","Introduction: During the unprecedented lockdown, COVID-19 is causing people to suffer from mental disorders in response to strict containment measures. Latin America is the third most severely affected continent, and restrictive measures can have many negative effects on mental health (such as anxiety, depression, and stress) that may arise with fear. We aimed to measure the spread of fear of COVID-19 in the Latin American population. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective study in 535 participants of six countries of Latin America (Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru), and a country of Europe (Spain) as a control, during 2020. We used the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Results: The mean age was 31.2 +/- 13.2 years (70.8% under 30 years) and the majority were women (57.9%) and 76.6% had a technical, university, or postgraduate studies. Seven percent of participants had high rates of fear of COVID-19, these high estimates of fear were observed in Argentines (14.3%, score range: 28-31%), of Peruvians (10.2%, score range: 27-35%), and Mexicans (5.7%, score range: 27-29%). Both Peru (p=0.003) and Mexico (p=0.0001) showed significant differences from the control country. We showed low levels of fear in 57.1%, 45.5%, 42.9%, and 41.2% of Argentines, Colombians, Bolivians, and Peruvians, respectively. No differences in low levels of fear we found among age groups (p&gt; 0.05), however, we find differences between genders (p=0.001). Conclusions: These results suggested low levels of fear in six Latin American countries, highlighting the need to contextualize fear behavior as a key element in people's psychological well-being and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Moya-Salazar, J.; Canari, B.; Contreras-Pulache, H.","https://doi.org/10.29333/ejgm/11401","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Electronic Journal of General Medicine; 19(1):6, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23858,""
"Concern with COVID-19 Pandemic Threat and Attitudes Towards Immigrants: The Mediating Effect of the Desire for Tightness","Tightening social norms is thought to be adaptive for dealing with collective threat yet it may have negative consequences for increasing prejudice. The present research investigated the role of desire for cultural tightness, triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, in increasing negative attitudes towards immigrants. We used participant-level data from 41 countries (NÂ =Â 55,015) collected as part of the PsyCorona project, a cross-national longitudinal study on responses to COVID-19. Our predictions were tested through multilevel and SEM models, treating participants as nested within countries. Results showed that people's concern with COVID-19 threat was related to greater desire for tightness which, in turn, was linked to more negative attitudes towards immigrants. These findings were followed up with a longitudinal model (NÂ =Â 2,349) which also showed that people's heightened concern with COVID-19 in an earlier stage of the pandemic was associated with an increase in their desire for tightness and negative attitudes towards immigrants later in time. Our findings offer insight into the trade-offs that tightening social norms under collective threat has for human groups.","Mula, Silvana, Santo, Daniela Di, Resta, Elena, Bakhtiari, Farin, Baldner, Conrad, Molinario, Erika, Pierro, Antonio, Gelfand, Michele J.; Denison, Emmy, Agostini, Maximilian, BÃ©langer, Jocelyn J.; GÃ¼tzkow, Ben, Kreienkamp, Jannis, Abakoumkin, Georgios, Khaiyom, Jamilah Hanum Abdul, Ahmedi, Vjollca, Akkas, Handan, Almenara, Carlos A.; Atta, Mohsin, Bagci, Sabahat Cigdem, Basel, Sima, Kida, Edona Berisha, Bernardo, Allan B.

"COERCIVE MEASURES IN PANDEMIC PSYCHIATRIC CARE - RETROSPECTIVE STUDY","Coercion raises serious ethical and legal issues in psychiatric care. Coercive medical measures are applied in psychiatric institutions for protective purposes. Alcoholism is a social and medical problem because it especially affects the behavior of the individual. Alcohol consumption can catalyze exacerbations of mental illness and predispose to behaviors with an increased risk of violence. AIM: The purpose of this study is to illustrate medical and legal issues related to coercive measures in emergency psychiatric care during the pandemic. Methods: The study is retrospective, and the data were taken from the observation sheets of patients in the period between March 1, 2020-March 31, 2021, in acute section II in the Institute of Psychiatry ""Socola"" Iasi. RESULTS: Of those who required coercive measures during hospitalization, most were restraint for symptoms such as: self-aggression and aggression towards others. Mechanical restraint measures were also necessary in cases with hallucinatory-delusional symptoms, associated with self-aggression and aggression towards others. The share of hospitalized patients for alcohol abuse, who required coercive measures, was significantly higher during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Manifestations of violence among patients with major mental disorders are rare. Mechanical restraint was necessary especially in those who had self-aggression and aggression towards others, symptoms secondary to alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption amplifies the psychological imbalance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nechita, P.; Luca, L.; Moraru, C.; Cojocariu, R.

"Training and education in digital psychiatry: A perspective from Asia-Pacific region","Background Digital mental health interventions and digital psychiatry have been rapidly implemented over the past decade, particularly with the intent to offer a cost-effective solution in those circumstances in which the current mental health services and infrastructure are not able to properly accommodate the patients' needs. However, mental health workforce is often poorly theoretical/practical trained in digital psychiatry and in delivering remote consultations safely and effectively, not being common to own curricula-specific training requirements in digital psychiatry and skills. Methods A web-based international cross-sectional survey was carried out by a working group constituted by one or two national representative(s) of each WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions (APAC), with the aim to evaluate the level of training, knowledge, experience, and perception regarding the topic of digital psychiatry in a sample constituted by medical students, psychiatry trainees, and early career psychiatrists from APAC. Results An overall lack of theoretical and/or practical training on new digital tools and digital health interventions in psychiatry was observed. The level of training influences knowledge background, which, in turns, influences young professionals' perceptions and opinions regarding digital psychiatry and interventions in mental health. Conclusion Implementing psychiatry training programs may significantly improve the level of knowledge and use of digital tools in mental healthcare. Moreover, mental health services and infrastructures should be properly adapted to the digital era, considering the overall weak and heterogeneous technical support and equipment, issues of internet connectivity, and other administrative-related challenges observed in APAC.","Orsolini, L.; Jatchavala, C.; Noor, I.

"Changes in consumption patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic: Analyzing the revenge spending motivations of different emotional groups","People tend to alleviate their negative emotions by shopping. Considering the change of shopping behavior during COVID-19 outbreak, negative emotions are the key contributors to this change. In this light, this study aims to investigate how negative emotions caused by COVID-19 affect shopping behaviors. This study classified consumer groups based on their perceived negative emotions (i.e., anxiety, fear, depression, anger, and boredom). By clustering analysis, four groups (i.e., group of anxiety, depression, anger, and indifference) were derived. Then, this study examined how each of the emotional groups differently affect the shopping-related motivations (i.e., mood alleviation, shopping enjoyment, socialization seeking, and self-control seeking) and shopping behaviors (i.e., shopping for high-priced goods and buying of bulk goods). Results revealed all emotional groups affect socialization seeking and influence high-priced shopping intentions. However, depression and indifference are positively associated with socialization seeking and influence bulk shopping intentions. In addition, other emotions except for anxiety affect mood alleviation and influence high-priced shopping intentions.

"Stress and Financial Burden Faced by Dentists Amidst COVID 19 Pandemic","Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic, initiated in Wuhan, China, had devastating effects on the dental industry world-wide. The mode of transmission of SARS Cov-2, causative agent of Covid-19, was through aerosol and saliva contamination putting dentists at high risk of contracting Covid-19. The measures taken to contain the spread of virus had financial repercussion on the dental industry. The survey was conducted to understand the mental health of dentists amidst Covid-19 pandemic. Aim: To analyse the concerns and anxiety faced by dental surgeons regarding vaccination and the psychological and socio-economic impact Covid-19 pandemic had on dental setups. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of 3 months. A sample size of 300 dentists belonging to age group of 25years to 45years was analysed. The dentists included in the sample practiced in Maharashtra, India. A questionnaire was formulated in Google forms and circulated through social media platform. The result was analysed and demonstrated in pie-charts. Results: The survey analysed that majority of dentists were apprehensive to carry out dental procedures. Along with the risk of contracting and being a source of transmission of Covid-19, dentists had huge financial burden of clinic rents, EMI loan pending bills, the cost of preventive kits and reduced patient flow. Conclusion: The survey was successful in analysing the monetary and safety concerns faced by dentists amidst Covid-19 pandemic. The survey also pointed out the mental stress dentists had to overcome to practice dental procedures.","Patil, A. P.; Magdum, D.; Jadhav, S.; Jadhav, A.; Vhatkar, P.; Kavle, P.

"The Effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 on the Reported Mental Health Symptoms of Nonprofessional Carers: An Analysis Across Europe","Objectives This study tries to analyze how the crisis generated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has affected the reported mental health symptoms of informal caregivers in different European countries. Methods The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe-COVID-19 was used, collecting information from the beginning of June 2020 to August 2020 about individualsâ€™ state of health and the care they received. Several probit regression models were used to analyze the differences in the probability of (1) being sad or depressed, (2) being anxious or nervous, (3) having difficulty sleeping, and (4) feeling lonely, between individuals who provided informal care and individuals who did not. Several subanalyses by geographic area, mortality rates due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and long-term care expenditure were also performed. Results Since the outbreak of COVID-19, informal caregivers have had a higher probability of being sad or depressed of 8 percentage points (p.p.), a 7.1 p.p. higher probability of being anxious or nervous, and a 5.9 p.p. higher probability of having difficulty sleeping than non-caregivers. Informal caregivers in Southern Europe have had an 8 p.p. higher probability of being sad or depressed than non-caregivers. In Eastern Europe, this difference in probability reaches 9.7 p.p. Finally, in countries with higher mortality rates due to COVID-19, there have been greater differences in terms of being sad or depressed between caregivers and non-caregivers, regardless of expenditure on long-term care. Conclusions Since the outbreak of COVID-19, informal caregivers in Europe have had a higher probability of reporting mental health symptoms than non-caregivers.","PeÃ±a-Longobardo, Luz MarÃ­a, Oliva-Moreno, Juan, RodrÃ­guez-SÃ¡nchez, Beatriz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.10.011","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Value in Health;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23865,""
"CCWORK protocol: a longitudinal study of Canadian Correctional Workersâ€™ Well-being, Organizations, Roles and Knowledge","IntroductionKnowledge about the factors that contribute to the correctional officerâ€™s (CO) mental health and well-being, or best practices for improving the mental health and well-being of COs, have been hampered by the dearth of rigorous longitudinal studies. In the current protocol, we share the approach used in the Canadian Correctional Workersâ€™ Well-being, Organizations, Roles and Knowledge study (CCWORK), designed to investigate several determinants of health and well-being among COs working in Canadaâ€™s federal prison system.Methods and analysisCCWORK is a multiyear longitudinal cohort design (2018â€“2023, with a 5-year renewal) to study 500 COs working in 43 Canadian federal prisons. We use quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments (ie, surveys, interviews and clinical assessments) to assess participantsâ€™ mental health, correctional work experiences, correctional training experiences, views and perceptions of prison and prisoners, and career aspirations. Our baseline instruments comprise two surveys, one interview and a clinical assessment, which we administer when participants are still recruits in training. Our follow-up instruments refer to a survey, an interview and a clinical assessment, which are conducted yearly when participants have become COs, that is, in annual â€˜wavesâ€™.Ethics and disseminationCCWORK has received approval from the Research Ethics Board of the Memorial University of Newfoundland (File No. 20190481). Participation is voluntary, and we will keep all responses confidential. We will disseminate our research findings through presentations, meetings and publications (e.g., journal articles and reports). Among CCWORKâ€™s expected scientific contributions, we highlight a detailed view of the operational, organizational and environmental stressors impacting CO mental health and well-being, and recommendations to prison administrators for improving CO well-being.","Ricciardelli, Rosemary, Andres, Elizabeth, Mitchell, Meghan M.; Quirion, Bastien, Groll, Diane, Adorjan, Michael, Marcella Siqueira, Cassiano, Shewmake, James, Herzog-Evans, Martine, Moran, Dominique, Spencer, Dale C.; Genest, Christine, Czarnuch, Stephen, Gacek, James, Cramm, Heidi, Maier, Katharina, Phoenix, Jo, Weinrath, Michael, MacDermid, Joy, McKinnon, Margaret, Haynes, Stacy, Arnold, Helen, Turner, Jennifer, Eriksson, Anna, Heber, Alexandra, Anderson, Gregory, MacPhee, Renee, Carleton, Nicholas","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052739","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(12), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23866,""
"Crisis Response and Suicidal Patterns in US Youth Before and During COVID-19: A Latent Class Analysis","This study characterized the unobserved patterns in crisis response among youth in the U.S. from March to December 2020 and determined the characteristics of vulnerable subgroups who were at increased risk for suicide due to the pandemic. A latent class analysis of crisis support-seeking from a national text-based crisis platform, (n = 179,497, aged 24 years or younger) for 11 crisis concerns (e.g., depression, anxiety/stress, suicidal thoughts, isolation, abuse, bereavement, relationships) was performed on three study periods: (1) January 2017 to December 2020, (2) prepandemic: 1 January 2017 to 12 March 2020, and (3) pandemic: 13 March to 20 December 2020. Demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity) were used as predictors for class membership using the three-step method. Four latent classes were identified: (1) depression/isolation/self-harm (D/I/S) (18,694 texters, 10.4%), (2) interpersonal stress/mood-anxiety (I/M) (32,640 texters, 18.2%), (3) suicidal thoughts/depressed (S/D) (34,067, 19.0%), and (4) adjustment/stress (A/S) (94,096 texters, 52.4%). During the pandemic, an increase in suicidal thoughts and active rescues occurred in the D/I/S and S/D higher-risk subclasses. Characteristics of vulnerable groups in higher-risk classes since the pandemic included children, LGBTQ, American Indian, White, Black, Asian, female, and gender-nonconforming youth. Results identified a strong association with class membership in more severe risk classes during the pandemic and an increase in suicidal help-seeking, particularly among children and LGBTQ youth. Low-cost and targeted crisis text-based platforms for support-seeking in youth may be one potential safety net strategy to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in youth.","Runkle, Jennifer D.; Yadav, Shrikanth, Michael, Kurt, Green, Shannon, Weiser, Jaclyn, Sugg, Margaret M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.10.003","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health; 70(1):48-56, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23867,""
"Resilience as a moderator in the relationship between burnout and subjective well-being among medical workers in Serbia during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background/Aim. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, exhaustion and difficulties at work can seriously endanger the mental health of medical workers. The aim of this study was to examine whether resilience is a moderator of the association between burnout and subjective wellbeing among medical workers at the time of the pandemic. Methods. The research was conducted on a sample of 521 medical workers (354 female), among whom were 245 phy-sicians and 276 medical technicians. The average age of the respondents was 38.66 years. Data were collected using online questionnaires comprising the Brief Resilience Scale, the Work Burnout Scale, the Short Subjective Well-being Scale, and the Sociodemographic Data Questionnaire. Regression and interaction analysis (by SPSS macro ""PROCESS 3.5'') was used for data analysis and processing. Results. The results showed that burnout was a significant negative predictor of subjective well-being of medical workers (ss =-0.19;p &lt; 0.01) and a significant positive predictor of subjective well-being (ss = 0.40;p &lt; 0.01), as well as that the interaction of resilience and burnout was a significant positive predictor of subjective well-being (ss = 0.09;p &lt; 0.01). In subjects who had developed resilience at the level of +1 standard deviation (SD), the negative effect of burn-out on subjective well-being was 2.8 times lower than in subjects who had resilience at the level of-1 SD. Conclusion. The study confirmed that resilience reduces the negative connection between burnout and subjective well-being, which is a significant argument that medical workers should be provided with resilience training programs to prevent burnout and preserve mental health during a pandemic.","Safiye, T.; Vukcevic, B.; Cabarkapa, M.","https://doi.org/10.2298/vsp210517070s","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Vojnosanitetski Pregled; 78(11):1207-1213, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23868,""
"STRESS AND ANXIETY IN GENERAL POPULATION IN ROMANIA DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The mental health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmingly affect the general population. Stress and health anxiety, the risk of losing a job and working at home, online education for children, and isolation have a devastating cumulative effect. This study aims to achieve the following: i) to identify the epidemiological specifics of the perceived stress levels in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic;ii) to evaluate the correlation between socioeconomic factors and the level of perceived stress and anxiety;iii) to analyze the correlation between the perceived stress scores and the anxiety scores in the general population. We applied Perceived Stress Score (PSS) validated questionnaire and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) online to a group of respondents (N=1.362), profiling the data based on demographics: age, sex, COVID-19 infection, behavior compliance to sanitary limitations, socioeconomic status, and pre-existing health issues. Results show differentiation of PSS values in female and male respondents;occupation significantly influences the perceived stress score among COVID-19 positive respondents. Educational level and income significantly influence the perceived stress score. Low educational level and low income increase the perceived stress score among negative COVID-19 respondents. Subsequent research is needed to clarify other correlations between the perceived stress levels and general population well-being. While certain life conditions enhance the perception of stress, others could provide protective value to demographic groups. Therefore, we suggest further studies and qualitative approaches to general population stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Silistraru, I.; Cozmanciuc, G.; Rosca, S.; Bulgaru-Iliescu, D.; Damian, S.

Our theoretical model was built based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory, which successfully embraces the NBS framework, GBL, and GBE. Our findings based on an online survey reveal that NBS as a second-order construct, which embraces the four first-order elements, significantly improves guests' perception of mental health and emotional well-being. The direct and indirect effects of mental health, emotional well-being, GB attitude, and GBL also uncovered and significantly impacted GBE. The hypotheses were generally supported.

"Using participatory design to inform cyber/bullying prevention and intervention practices: Evidence-Informed insights and strategies","Bullying and cyberbullying are global phenomena negatively impacting on childrenâ€™s and young peopleâ€™s (CYPâ€™s) mental health and wellbeing and affecting their school social experiences and learning outcomes. Many interventions and prevention approaches have been employed over the decades, most impacting differentially, with some success in certain contexts and situations but not universally, suggesting the need for more contextualised, nuanced approaches at the whole school, community, individual and peer-group levels. The recognition of the importance of student and teacher voice in recent years has heralded interest in co-design practices to deliver more context-relevant interventions and prevention strategies. This article considers how participatory design and co-design practices can form part of the prevention and intervention repertoire for schools, teachers, counsellors and psychologists in their quest to understand and reduce cyberbullying and/or bullying (C/B) behaviours.

"Workplace spirituality as panacea for waning well-being during the pandemic crisis: A SDT perspective","The present study explores the association between workplace spirituality and wellbeing of employees working in the hospitality sector during the COVID 19 pandemic crisis. Workforce agility and organisational identification were taken as parallel mediators for the relationship between workplace spirituality and employee wellbeing. The hypothesized research model was examined in the light of SDT perspective of psychological needs. Data was collected through questionnaire survey using standardized instruments. The study surveyed 322 hotel employees of the northern region of India and utilized Structural Equation Modeling to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings confirmed a positive association between workplace spirituality and wellbeing, and established the role of workforce agility and organizational identification as parallel mediators in this relationship. COVID 19 significantly affected employees in the hospitality sector due to unprecedented uncertainties and economic hardships, which has taken a toll on mental health and wellbeing of the employees. Supportive organizational practices and systems are essential to ensure flexibility, adaptability and promptness in reacting to disrupting situations. Hotels should provide mental and emotional support to their staff during the crisis situation. This study is the first of its kind to explore the linkage between workplace spirituality and wellbeing of hotel employees, with the positive effect of workforce agility and organizational identification.

"Speak like a Native English Speaker or Be Judged: A Scoping Review","This review aims to examine the discrimination and prejudices toward the accent of non-native English speakers and cyberbullying as the ripple effect of these negative consequences. Following Arksey and Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s framework of conducting a scoping review, 60 studies from 2012 to 2021 were retrieved from the ERIC and Google Scholar databases. The studies were reviewed from two aspects: (1) psychological impact on speakers with a non-native English accent, (2) attitudes toward non-native English accents from the victimâ€™s and perpetratorâ€™s perspectives. The findings suggested that speaking with a non-native English accent drew negative cognitive, affective, and behavioral experiences. Biases toward non-native English accents were due to the general derogatory perception of an accent and the comprehensibility of speakersâ€™ accent and pronunciation. â€œAccent acceptabilityâ€ can be inculcated at all levels of education, not only through multicultural education but also through the concerted effort of policy makers and practitioners to seriously address this social issue. Accent awareness can dispel unwarranted and undesirable judgements of non-native English accent speakers. Future studies should be conducted on the effects of social and mental health experiences, particularly of non-native ESL and EFL teachers, given that this may be the only profession required to teach â€œliveâ€ during the pandemic and thus be subjected to public praise or ridicule.","Tan, Kim Hua, Michelle Elaine anak William, Jospa, Mohd-Said, Nur-Ehsan, Awang, Mohd Mahzan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312754","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12754, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23874,""
"A cross-sectional study for the mental health status and sleep quality among college students in Macao during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives The main focus of this study was to investigate the effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health condition and sleep quality of college students in Macao. In addition, the studentsâ€™ behaviours during the pandemic, such as drinking alcohol, taking sleeping pills, and seeking psychological counselling were analyzed. Method A cross-sectional survey of mental health and sleep quality status, as well as the possible behavioral risk factors, was conducted among the college students of Macao in August, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online self-report questionnaire survey method was applied to assess the general demographics and related lifestyle behaviors of students. The general mental health condition and sleep quality were evaluated through the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires, respectively. The main statistical methods included the Chi-square test, Bonferroni correction, and Pearson correlation. Data analysis was performed using SPSS Version 24.0. Results A total of 980 students were investigated in the study, of which 977 completed the survey. During the COVID-19 pandemic period, overall college students in Macao were psychologically well adjusted and reported good quality of sleep. However, female students were in poorer psychological condition than males (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the students over 20 years of age had poorer sleep quality than students aged less than or equal to 20 (P &lt; 0.05). The significant differences were found among the students in different study majors for the mental health status and sleep quality (both P &lt; 0.05), which were associated with certain behaviors, such as drinking alcohol, taking sleeping pills, and seeking for help in psychological counselling during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Conclusions Poor mental health status could be either the consequence or cause of sleep disturbance, which might further affected physical health. Therefore, regular assessment of mental health condition and sleep quality of college students is particularly necessary during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and appropriate intervention should be provided to the students.","Tao, Xiaoyu, Chen, Dong, Fan, Yawen, Zhang, Lanxin, Shan, Houqian, Wei, Yi, Yu, Xi, Tian, Zhong, Wang, Ling, Sookja Kim, Chung, Yu, Yaqin, Xiao, Ying","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12520","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: PeerJ;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23875,""

"Psychological intervention to treat distress: An emerging frontier in cancer prevention and therapy","Psychological distress, such as chronic depression and anxiety, is a topical problem. In the context of cancer patients, prevalence rates of psychological distress are four-times higher than in the general population and often confer worse outcomes. In addition to evidence from epidemiological studies confirming the links between psychological distress and cancer progression, a growing body of cellular and molecular studies have also revealed the complex signaling networks which are modulated by psychological distress-derived chronic stress during cancer progression. In this review, aiming to uncover the intertwined networks of chronic stress-driven oncogenesis and progression, we summarize physiological stress response pathways, like the HPA, SNS, and MGB axes, that modulate the release of stress hormones with potential carcinogenic properties. Furthermore, we discuss in detail the mechanisms behind these chronic stimulations contributing to the initiation and progression of cancer through direct regulation of cancer hallmarks-related signaling or indirect promotion of cancer risk factors (including obesity, disordered circadian rhythms, and premature senescence), suggesting a novel research direction into cancer prevention and therapy on the basis of psychological interventions.","Yang, Mei, Zhang, Zhe, Nice, Edouard C.; Wang, Chuang, Zhang, Wei, Huang, Canhua","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbcan.2021.188665","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Reviews on Cancer; 1877(1):188665, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23877,""

Introduction: The prolongation and consequences left by the covid-19 pandemic generate an uncertain and devastating panorama in many populations, evidence shows a high prevalence of mental health problems in medical students. Objective: The studyâ€™s aim was to evaluate the association between mood disorders and sleep quality (SQ) in Peruvian medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 310 medical students from a private university in Peru. The SQ was measurement through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), while mood disorders were evaluated through the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS-21). All information was collected by online surveys and then analyzed in programming language R. Results: The SQ results measured by PSQI were bad in 83.9% of the medical students. In the Poison regression analysis, the results of the bivariate analysis in men show that all mood disorders found the prevalence of bad SQ, however, in the multivariate analysis only stress (PRa: 1.30;95% CI 1.08 - 1.57;p &lt;0.01) and anxiety (PRa: 1.34;95% CI 1.09 - 1.56;p &lt;0.01) increased the prevalence of poor SQ. Women had a similar pattern in bivariate analysis, whereas in multivariate analysis, only severe stress (PRa: 1.15;95% CI 1.01 - 1.29;p &lt;0.05) increased the prevalence of poor SQ. Conclusions: This study allows us to observe the consequences that the COVID-19 pandemic is leaving in medical students in Peru. And so it disclosed are a vulnerable population to poor quality of sleep and a bad mood, which in the future will impact on health. It is suggested to educate medical students about the importance of proper sleep hygiene and the consequences of poor sleep hygiene practices.","Olarte-Durand, Mely, Roque-Aycachi, Jossiel B.; Rojas-Humpire, Ricardo, Canaza-Apaza, JosuÃ© F.; Laureano, Stefani, Rojas-Humpire, Andrea, Huancahuire-Vega, SalomÃ³n","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.11.010","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Revista Colombiana de PsiquiatrÃ­a;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23879,""
"Psychologie du sportÂ : une psychologue aux Jeux Olympiques (3e partie)","RÃ©sumÃ© Les carriÃ¨res des athlÃ¨tes de haut niveau sont loin dâ€™Ãªtre linÃ©aires. Pour arriver aux performances connues de tous, les sportifs connaissent des succÃ¨s et des dÃ©sillusions tout au long de leur pratique sportive. Maroussia ParÃ©, sportive de haut niveau en athlÃ©tisme et psychologue, analyse son parcours, de ses premiers Jeux Olympiques (J.O.) Ã  20ans, Ã  sa prÃ©paration dÃ©jÃ  entamÃ©e vers les J.O. de Paris en 2024. Entre la gestion des Ã©checs mais aussi des succÃ¨s, en passant par les blessures physiques et Ã©motionnelles, elle revient sur lâ€™autre rÃ©alitÃ© du sport de haut niveau, celle que le grand public voit moins. Ainsi, cet entretien avec Jean-Pierre Bouchard rÃ©vÃ¨le les stratÃ©gies dâ€™adaptation et les ressources mobilisÃ©es par les athlÃ¨tes pour faire face au caractÃ¨re imprÃ©visible du sport de haut niveau. Nous voyons, au travers de son expÃ©rience, que la performance ne se construit ni instantanÃ©ment ni indÃ©pendamment du contexte dans lequel elle se produit. La performance se rÃ©vÃ¨le comme une combinaison de facteurs personnels et environnementaux. Nous pouvons alors considÃ©rer que le sportif, pour Ãªtre performant, nâ€™a pas uniquement besoin de prÃ©paration mentale, mais bien dâ€™avoir un soutien et un accompagnement pour lâ€™aider Ã  optimiser et prendre soin de sa santÃ© mentale et de ses ressources psychologiques. Top athlete's careers are far from linear. To achieve the performances known to all, athletes experience successes and disappointments throughout their sporting practice. Maroussia ParÃ©, top athlete in athletics and psychologist, analyzes her career, from her first Olympic Games (Olympics) at 20, to her preparation already started for the Paris Olympics in 2024. Between the cope with failures but also success, through the physical and emotional injuries, she comes back to the other reality of high-level sport, the one that the general public sees less. Thus, this interview with Jean-Pierre Bouchard reveals the adaptation strategies and resources mobilized by athletes to cope with the unpredictability of high-performance sport. We can see, through her experience, that performance is not built instantly or independently of the context in which it occurs. Performance is then revealed as a combination of personal and environmental factors. We can therefore consider that the athlete to be successful does not only need mental preparation to be successful, but to have support and personal support to help them optimize and take care of their mental health and psychological resources.","ParÃ©, Maroussia, Bouchard, Jean-Pierre","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.11.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Annales MÃ©dico-psychologiques, revue psychiatrique;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23880,""
"Coronavirus Pandemic and Emergency Remote Teaching: perception of the impact on the well-being of university students","Young people in higher education are more vulnerable to the appearance of psychological symptoms in the context of COVID-19. Also, the adaptation to remote education and other difficulties can affect the well-being of university students. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the perception of wellbeing and mental health of university students who underwent remote education during quarantine. This is a cross-sectional, exploratory, and descriptive study. The instrument used was ""Questionnaire on the perception of social isolation by university students during quarantine of COVID-19"". Using the reference sampling technique, university students released the link to access the online questionnaire to their peers. 497 students participated, most of them women (74.69%), with mean age of 21.71 (SD = 2.85), enrolled in a public higher education institution (HEI) (72.89%). A positive and significant correlation was found (p&lt;0.001) for academic performance impaired by the adhesion of Emergency Remote Education and the negative perception of mental health and well-being. In the qualitative part, participants noticed anxiety (15.35%), stress (7.3%) and altered sleep (7.67%). About 91.96% of the participants are engaged in self care and emotional management practices. Therefore, the results converge with the literature and imply that online education can impact wellbeing and generate insecurity regarding the quality and solidity of academic training. Data from this study suggest that institutions should implement preventive activities regarding students' mental health and adapt remote learning in order to reduce student's distress.","Goncalves, N.

"Fear of Contracting COVID-19: A validation study of the Fear of Contracting COVID-19 Scale in Portuguese adolescents","Introduction: Given the pandemic circumstances, fear may emerge due to uncertainty, the possibility of being infected by SARS-Cov 2 or infecting others. It may also be associated with psychopathological symptoms and impact quality of life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: The current study aimed to examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the Fear of Contracting COVID-19 Scale (FCCS) in Portuguese adolescents and analyze the relationship between fear of contracting COVID-19 and depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, and with the quality of life of this age group. Method: The sample comprised 269 adolescents (137 boys and 132 girls), aged between 11 and 16 years old, attending the 3rd cycle of basic education. Participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the FCCS, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), and the KIDSCREEN-10, as a measure of the quality of life in adolescents. Results: The FCCS revealed, as in its original version for adults, a one-dimensional structure, with good adjustment indicators and good reliability. The fear of contracting COVID-19 was associated with anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms, but it did not show a relationship with the adolescents' quality of life. Gender differences showed that the girls present higher levels of fear of contracting COVID-19, more anxiety, depression and stress symptoms, and a worse perception of their quality of life. Conclusions: The Fear of Contracting COVID-19 Scale showed to be suitable for use with adolescents. The fear of contracting COVID-19, although associated with psychopathological symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress, does not seem to be related to the quality of life of adolescents.","Ramos, M.

"Experimental asynchrony to study self-inflicted lung injury","Summary Patient self-inflicted lung injury may be associated with worse clinical outcomes and higher mortality. Patient-ventilator asynchrony is associated with increased ventilator days and mortality, and it has been hypothesised as one of the important mechanisms leading to patient self-inflicted lung injury. However, given the observational nature of the key studies in the field so far, the hypothesis that patient-ventilator asynchrony causes patient self-inflicted lung injury has not been supported by evidence yet. Wittenstein and colleagues present a novel approach that enables controlling patient-ventilator asynchrony in a pig model of acute lung injury, to investigate the patient-ventilator asynchrony and patient self-inflicted lung injury causality. Their results suggest that increased patient-ventilator asynchrony associated with poor clinical outcomes reported in observational trials could be a marker, rather than a cause of patient self-inflicted lung injury. These findings on their own are not sufficient to justify a greater tolerance of patient-ventilator asynchrony amongst clinicians, a change for which further experimental work and clinical evidence is needed.","Cronin, John N.; Formenti, Federico","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2021.11.020","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: British Journal of Anaesthesia;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-15","",23883,""
