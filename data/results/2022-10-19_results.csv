"COVID-19-related discrimination, PTSD symptoms, and psychological distress in healthcare workers","To date, little effort has been made to examine if frontline workers who deal with COVID-19 patients are more likely to experience discrimination than second-line workers. Also, little information has appeared on how COVID-19-related discrimination affects PTSD symptoms in healthcare workers. We aimed to examine the association between COVID-19-related discrimination and frontline worker status. We further aimed to examine how COVID-19-related discrimination was associated with PTSD symptoms and psychological distress. We studied 647 healthcare workers. For the association between COVID-19-related discrimination and frontline worker status, we conducted multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and living alone. For the association of COVID-19-related discrimination with PTSD symptoms and psychological distress, we performed multivariable regression using hierarchical adjustments for age, sex, living alone, alcohol consumption, exercise and frontline worker status. Bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) were used. A total of 136 individuals worked on the frontline and the largest group were nurses (n = 81, 59.6%). Frontline workers had increased odds of COVID-19-related discrimination compared with second-line workers (odds ratio = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.37â€“4.96). COVID-19-related discrimination was associated with PTSD symptoms and psychological distress even at the highest level of adjustment (ÃŸ = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.10â€“1.23;ÃŸ = 2.43, 95% CI = 0.91â€“3.95, respectively). Frontline workers are more likely to experience COVID-19-related discrimination than second-line workers. Such discrimination may result in PTSD symptoms and psychological distress. Interventions to prevent COVID-19-related discrimination against healthcare workers, for example anti-discrimination campaigns, are important.

"Guest editorial","For PGRs, the uncertainty caused by the pandemic and the impact on their ability to successfully complete their research within their funding period have been particularly significant, given that even prior to the pandemic, funding pressures were found to be a factor that could contribute to poor mental health and well-being among PGRs (Mattocks and Briscoe-Palmer, 2016;Metcalfe et al., 2018). Research by Levecque (2017) indicated that half of PhD students in a Belgian study experienced psychological distress and one in three were at risk of common psychiatric disorders, and a number of subsequent studies have confirmed the susceptibility of doctoral students to mental health and well-being issues (Hazell et al., 2020). A report commissioned by the Higher Education Funding Council of England concluded that the specific challenges faced by PGRs required a bespoke policy response and that higher education institutions needed to invest more resources in student support services and associated activities to meet expected PGR demand (Metcalfe et al., 2018). Drawing on data from a longitudinal study of PhD students enrolled at a large research-intensive US university, this paper finds that studentsâ€™ mental health and disciplinary identity do follow similar trajectories, generally declining during the first years of doctoral study.","Creaton, Jane, Handforth, Rachel","https://doi.org/10.1108/SGPE-04-2021-089","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Studies in Graduate and Postdoctoral Education; 12(1):1-6, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39435,""
"Social media usage and its impact on usersâ€™ mental health: a longitudinal study and inputs to policymakers","Purpose&gt;This paper aims to provide a systematic meta-analysis from the year 2000 up to 2021 by reviewing relevant studies in extant literature related to the impact of social media on mental health.Design/methodology/approach&gt;This study adopts bibliometric methods and longitudinal statistical analysis to analyze extant literature. The structured literature review and meta-analysis findings on social media usage (SMU) and its impact on mental health indicate emerging research patterns in potentially leading to an integrative view.Findings&gt;This paper highlights the importance of challenges regarding SMU and its impact on usersâ€™ mental health.

SMU and its impact on usersâ€™ mental health can be attributed as contributing factors to the next global crisis. Studies suggest that increased SMU can potentially make users socially anxious. This study provides input to the policymakers, scholars and practitioners to understand the gravity of the situation and develop appropriate policy to overcome the challenges.Originality/value&gt;The rapidly evolving nature of technology and social media calls for a careful examination of its risks despite the many benefits of e-participation and digital interaction. Although there is widespread acknowledgment of the problematic revelation that the pattern of SMU closely mirrors mainstream addictive behavior;yet, there are only a limited number of comparative studies available. This may be one of the few studies which highlight the issue of SMU and its impact on usersâ€™ mental health. Moreover, this study also adds to the body of literature.","Apoorva, A.; Chaudhuri, Ranjan, Hussain, Zahid, Chatterjee, Sheshadri","https://doi.org/10.1108/ijlma-08-2022-0179","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Law and Management; 64(5):441-465, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39436,""
"Psychometric development and validation of ostracism experience scale (OES): across sample of young adults from Pakistan","Purpose: Ostracism is being socially ignored or excluded by others. Ostracism leads to serious psychological distress and health issues in the young adults being ostracized. However, there are no psychometrically designed instruments to measure this phenomenon in young adults. This study aims to develop a scale that measures ostracism efficiently and establishes the scale's psychometric properties. Design/methodology/approach: The research design used for the study is ""a mixed-method study using non-experimental research with an exploratory sequential approach and instrument development design."" For the formation of the item pool, theoretical evidence was collected and focus group discussions were conducted. Afterward, content validity was established with the help of subject matter experts, followed by Velicer's minimum average partial method and maximum likelihood factor analysis to form the instrument's factorial structure. Findings: Velicer's minimum average partial method and maximum likelihood factor analysis made two factors as follows: ostracism experience and psychological effect. The instrument developed has a high value of alpha reliability i.e. a = 0.97 and a = 0.96, a = 0.92 for the subscales, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The sample used for the research was enough to run the analysis, but future studies can go for a more extensive and more diverse sample. The sample was based solely on university students. The current research focused only on the target of the phenomenon, and the whole research process was conducted online because of the Covid-19 pandemic going on. The scale developed can be used in several settings to find out if the individual is being ostracized or not. Practical implications: The scale's most important implication is in the colleges and universities where young adults are found and face this problem daily. Likewise, psychologists can also use it in clinical settings. The other important implication of this scale is that it is opening a route to future research as different variables can be studied in ostracism such as depression, physical health and anxiety. Social implications: Ostracism is a hidden evil in societies that is not usually talked about. When people are not given equal importance in groups or settings, it leads to serious psychological issues in those individuals. This scale will in the identification of the problem that will lead to a proper solution to this evil. Originality/value: This work is original and not copied from anywhere. The research was conducted with the sole purpose of developing a scale on the ostracism experiences in young adults. The data is collected in the form of online surveys. The current scale is an attempt at developing a more reliable and valid scale that can be used in social settings.","Beenish, Shahzad, Muhammad, Aqeel, Hifza, Naseer, Khan, M.

"â€œWhy is my skin so intimidating to you?â€: Exploring social connectivity and racial identity of youth of color with foster care experience","Social support, racial/ethnic identity, and foster care exposure are concepts largely understudied in child welfare research. With the rise of racialized violence against persons of color and the COVID-19 pandemic, these intersecting identities are of great importance. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 youth of color with current or past foster care exposure. Three themes were identified: 1) feeling uncomfortably me, 2) not equal in opportunity, and 3) skin as a threat. Increased mental health support by caseworkers and understanding collective racial trauma is needed to help foster youth of color as they strive to achieve self-sufficiency in emerging adulthood.

"Mental health engagement among foster and adopted youth: the transition from in-person to telemental health services","Using the electronic health records of 55 foster and adopted youth, this study compared in-person mental health service utilization to telemental health (TMH) service utilization during COVID-19. Clients attended a greater number of therapy sessions, had more accumulated session time, and had shorter sessions via TMH compared to in-person. Similar results were found for school-aged children, females, and caregivers who engaged in their childrenâ€™s treatment. Notably, for non-significant differences in engagement, engagement numbers during TMH were always higher than in-person services.

"African Americans Caregiving During COVID-19","The Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused global distress, and communities of color are disproportionately adversely affected. Within this group, many caregivers are concerned about issues such as staying healthy, keeping the family well, paying bills, and caring for children who are homebound. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the challenges facing caregivers, the manner in which systemic discrepancies have impacted African American caregivers, and how COVID-19 responses have exacerbated pre-existing issues. To do this, we administered semi-structured interviews to caregivers residing in California, Georgia, Maryland, Indiana, Alabama, and New York regarding their experienceâ€™s caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were then analyzed using grounded theory and content analysis. The results indicate an increase in subjective mental health symptomology, stressors associated with social isolation, and compounded stress due to civil unrest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Practical solutions for practitioners and caregivers are provided based on study findings. In addition, the authors of this study wish to bring awareness to the societal and systemic issues that adversely impact this population.

"The role of job insecurity and work-family conflict on mental health evolution during COVID-19 lockdown","The aim of this intensive longitudinal study was (1) to explore the temporal evolution of two mental health indicators (anxiety and depressive symptoms, and insomnia) throughout COVID-19 lockdown in Spain, and (2) to examine its association with two work-related stressors (job insecurity and work-family conflict). A sample of 1519 participants responded to several questionnaires during the lockdown (between 16 March and 29 April 2020). Results of latent growth modelling showed a curvilinear increase of our two mental health indicators over time (a logarithmic growth for anxiety and depression, accentuated during the first part of the lockdown, and a quadratic growth for insomnia, accentuated during the second part). Regarding its association with work-related stressors, we found that higher levels of job insecurity and work-family conflict were related to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Additionally, we found a significant interaction between time and the two forms of work-family conflict (work-to-home and home-to-work), showing that people with more work-family conflict experienced stronger growth in all mental-health indicators. Overall, this study contributes to the description of the temporal dynamics of mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, as well as its association with two key work-related stressors.","Antino, Mirko, Ruiz-Zorrilla, Paula, Sanz-Vergel, Ana I.; Leon-Perez, Jose Maria, Rodriguez-MuÃ±oz, Alfredo","https://doi.org/10.1080/1359432x.2022.2049251","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology; 31(5):667-684, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39441,""
"Student perceptions and proposals for promoting wellbeing through social relationships at university","Whilst existing evidence has demonstrated the imperative of social integration, inclusion, and belonging for student mental health, students often report relational challenges, barriers, and stressors at university. Drawing on thematic analysis of six student co-creation panels conducted during the Student Minds University Mental Health Charter consultations, this paper aims to elucidate student perspectives and proposals for promoting mental health at university by enhancing interpersonal interactions and social relationships. In particular, student panels identified existing challenges and opportunities to address social isolation, conflict, and exclusion in interactions with peers, academic staff, and the local community.

"Primary Care: A Critical Stopgap of Mental Health Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a worsening mental health crisis, while also dramatically reducing access to in-person primary care services. Primary care, an essential provider of mental health services, rapidly adopted telemedicine to address behavioral health needs. Here we examine the provision of mental health services by primary care during the pandemic, including the essential use of telemedicine.</b> METHODS: <b>Data were collected via a series of national, cross-sectional surveys of primary care clinicians in November 2020 by the Larry A. Green Center. The survey was distributed through a network of partner organizations and subscribers. Descriptive and chi squared analysis were utilized.</b> RESULTS: <b>Among 1,472 respondents, 88% reported increased mental health needs and 37% reported higher rates of substance use among patients. Most (65%) clinicians became more involved in providing mental health support, and 64% reported using telemedicine to provide behavioral health services. Phone-based care was more common for care delivery among patients who were uninsured (60% vs 42%, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), Medicare beneficiaries (45% vs 36%, <i>PÃ¢â‚¬â€°</i>&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), non-English speaking (67% vs 40%, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and racial and ethnic minorities (58% vs 34%, <i>PÃ¢â‚¬â€°</i>&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001).</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Primary care is a leading provider of mental health services and has played a critical role during the pandemic.

"Elections have (health) consequences: Depression, anxiety, and the 2020 presidential election","In this paper, we examine the effect of the 2020 presidential election on anxiety and depression among Americans. We use data from the 2020 Household Pulse Survey (HPS), a nationally representative rapid response survey conducted weekly from April to July of 2020 and then bi-weekly until December of 2021. The high-frequency nature of the survey implies that we can identify week-to-week changes in mental health outcomes. We find that self-reported symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety and depression increased steadily up to the presidential election and declined after the election. The anxiety and depression levels are significantly higher around the 2020 election than in April 2020, when most of the U.S. was under mandatory or advisory stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, anxiety and depression-specific office visits and usage of mental-health-specific prescription drugs show similar patterns.

"Psychological Analysis on of Network Rumors Spread in COVID-19 Epidemic","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, related rumors have been spread rapidly on social media, which has seriously affected public normal life and caused mental panic and anxiety. This paper, by analyzing the spread of online rumors and their impact on public mental health during the COVID-19 epidemic, aims to put forward relevant suggestions for dealing with rumors and improving public mental health. According to the actual rumors collected during the epidemic period as the content of the questionnaire, an online rumor survey was carried out. A total of 1,200 questionnaires were distributed, and 1,165 valid questionnaires were collected. Among the sources of information about the epidemic, 78.2% of the respondents obtained epidemic information through online channels. 633 respondents were concerned about the epidemic situation, accounting for 54.3%. The respondents have different susceptibility to the epidemic sources, epidemic spread, epidemic treatment, epidemic influence, and epidemic prevention. They account for 37.2%, 43. 4%, 45.2%, 39.4%, and 46.1% respectively. 646 respondents expressed great anxiety about the epidemic situation, accounting for 55.5%.

"Positivity and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in COVID-19 Survivors: Mediating Role of Rumination and Fear of COVID-19","COVID-19 pandemic, which still continues to affect the whole world, has led to an increase in PTSD symptoms in societies, especially individuals who have been diagnosed with the disease and recovered are at significant risk for PTSD have been reported. Although it has been observed that PTSD symptoms of individuals who were infected in the past epidemics such as SARS and Ebola continued for a long time even after the epidemic, it is noteworthy that the studies conducted during the COVID-19 process do not focus enough on people who survived the COVID-19 disease. The purpose of this study is to determine the direct and indirect impact of positivity on PTSD symptoms of individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and the role of rumination and fear of COVID-19 as potential mediators in this effect. In the study, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Ruminative Response Scale, Positivity Scale, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale were applied to 551 Turkish participants, who survived the COVID-19 disease. SEM-based mediation analysis was used to test hypothesized relationships. Mediating roles of fear of COVID-19 and rumination between positivity and PTSD were tested. Results indicated that rumination and fear of COVID-19 had a full mediating role in the relationship between positivity and PTSD. These findings pointed out that positivity might be an indirect protective disposition against COVID-19-related PTSD and might reduce risk factors associated with PTSD among COVID-19 survivors. Mental health practices for COVID-19 patients should aim to increase positive thinking, since they have ruminative thoughts about transmission of the virus and hospitalization process and these thoughts may lead to negative mental health conditions. In this sense, positive psychology-focused implementations can be organized for COVID-19 patients and survivors.","Gunlu, KoÃƒÂ§, Asici, Oral","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.578","20221018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39449,""
"Prognostic Assessment of Stress-Related Factors in Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary challenge for all countries and affects the psychological wellbeing of healthcare professionals working with people suffering from COVID-19 and puts them at a high risk of mental health problems. The aim of the study was to identify stress-related factors that affect the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine. A total of 1098 Ukrainian healthcare workers were surveyed using an online questionnaire consisting of questions relating to a) socio-demographic characteristics; b) perceptions of the COVID-19 related situation; and c) stress and protective factors. Respondents were divided into two groups, depending on whether they provided care to the patients with COVID-19 or not. Of the 1087 healthcare workers, 863 (79.4%) were found to have anxiety / fear caused by the COVID-19. No significant difference was detected between professionals who did and did not provide personal assistance to patients with COVID-19 concerning anxiety / fear related to COVID-19 (p=0.0776). Based on logistic regression model (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(6)=263.70, p=0.000) the most significant predictive factors for anxiety / fear caused by the COVID-19 were factors related to safety and risk perception (the risk of getting infected, dying, infecting loved ones, perception of the threat of the epidemic spread), information factors (constant news about COVID-19), as well as factors related to the organisation of care (lack of staff in health care facilities). Negative risk perception, high consumption of COVID-19 news, and shortage of staff in health care facilities were significant predictors of anxiety / fear caused by the COVID-19.","Pinchuk, Pishel, PolyvÃ‘â€“anaia, Chumak, Ilnytska, Stepanova, Filimonova, Kopchak, Yachnik, Kolodezhny, Solonskyi","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.572","20221018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39450,""
"Mental Health Support Program for Healthcare Professionals in a Pandemic Hospital in Turkey and Its Results on Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia and Sexual Disorders","The COVID-19 pandemic has put enormous stress on the health care workers, threatening not only their physical health but also their mental well-being. No mental health support program (MHSP) addressing depression and anxiety in healthcare workers (HCWs), has been shown to be effective in Turkey previously. We aimed to measure the effect of our MHSP among healthcare workers who applied for psychological help associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. An MHSP has been created for healthcare professionals working in a pandemic hospital during the COVID-19 period. Health workers were recruited between July and September 2020. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia levels were evaluated with HAM-A (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), HDRS (Hamilton Depression Scale), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) before and after the intervention. Sexual complaints were questioned by a consultant psychiatrist. MHSP (n=31), and treatment as usual (TAU, n=27) groups were compared using repeated-measures ANOVA. Sociodemographic data, medical history of COVID-19, and psychiatric diagnoses were similar between the groups. There was no difference in baseline HAM-A, HDRS, and ISI scores (p&gt;0.05). At the end of the study, there was a significant difference between study groups regarding anxiety scores (For post-treatment, MHSP=8.0Ã‚Â±2.6 vs. TAU=17.9Ã‚Â±3.1, p&lt;0.001) and depression symptoms (For post-treatment, MHSP=8.8Ã‚Â±2.7 vs. TAU=20.0Ã‚Â±2.4, p&lt;0.001) but not in insomnia levels (For post-treatment, MHSP=6.5Ã‚Â±2.4 vs. TAU=7.3Ã‚Â±2.4, p=0.499). Likewise, both groups reported similar levels of improvement in reduced sexual drive. Our study results suggest that the MHSP effectively alleviates the psychiatric complaints of healthcare professionals. It is recommended to have mental support teams for healthcare professionals in hospitals.","Tuna, Ermis","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.564","20221018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39451,""
"For Those Who Fight, Fall and Raise Again - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health of Health Care Providers","During the COVID-19 pandemic health care providers found themselves under increased demands in the work environment and in their professional and personal lives which created both physical and mental health challenges. Thus, we aim to provide an integrative review that identifies and summarizes the research published regarding mental health functioning in health care providers, in Serbia, since the beginning of the pandemic. A search of the published literature was conducted using Medline and SCIndex databases, applying key words ""COVID-19"" and ""Serbia"". The search was limited to papers published since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic until January 2022. Two reviewers independently screened the retrieved papers. The study used pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We identified eight papers on the subject of mental health functioning in health care providers. The studies were all original research papers with predominantly cross-sectional study design, using online assessments. Sample size varied in number of participants and profile of medical providers (physicians, nurses and medical technicians, community pharmacists). Dominantly, focus of interests of researchers were exploration of levels of anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, burnout, as well as behavioural changes and environmental influences. The studies related to mental health of medical professionals show the importance of recognizing the psychological challenges posed by health crises caused by COVID-19. They raise awareness of recognizing differences and difficulties between wide range of medical sectors, and appeal for necessity for accessible and professional psychological support. Further studies should address the detailed exploration of the mental health of this specific population, as well as propose strategies needed to balance the challenges posed by the pandemic.","Dunjic-KostiÃ„â€¡, PantoviÃ„â€¡-StefanoviÃ„â€¡, CvetiÃ„â€¡, JaÃ…Â¡oviÃ„â€¡-GaÃ…Â¡iÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.557","20221018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39452,""
"The Incidence of Alcohol Use Disorders during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a myriad of challenges to healthcare systems and public health policies across the globe. Individuals with alcohol use disorders are at peaked risk due to mental, socio-demographic, and economic factors leading to hindered mental health service access, misinformation and adherence. Keywords including ""alcohol use"", ""death"", ""hand sanitizer"", ""overdose"" and ""COVID-19"" were used to obtain 8 media reports for case analysis. A review of 34 manually extracted records were also conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Embase database with no time and language restrictions. A total of 2,517 individuals with alcohol overdose across the United States, India, Canada, and Iran were presented. The majority of cases were male, ages 21-65. Common contributors were linked to socio-economic changes, disruption to mental health services, and physical isolation. While original studies are essential to evaluate the etiologies of alcohol use and misuse during pandemics, the dissemination of misinformation must be curbed by directing vulnerable individuals towards accurate information and access to mental health services.","Sarfraz, Sarfraz, Sarfraz, Thevuthasan, Khan, Inam, Pandav, Fatima, Patel, Baralt, Ferrer, Cabrera, Michel, Sanchez-Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2022.535","20221018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39453,""
"How do the smart travel ban policy and intercity travel pattern affect COVID-19 trends? Lessons learned from Iran","COVID-19, as the most significant epidemic of the century, infected 467 million people and took the lives of more than 6 million individuals as of March 19, 2022. Due to the rapid transmission of the disease and the lack of definitive treatment, countries have employed nonpharmaceutical interventions. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the smart travel ban policy, which has been implemented for non-commercial vehicles in the intercity highways of Iran since November 21, 2020. The other goal was to suggest efficient COVID-19 forecasting tools and to examine the association of intercity travel patterns and COVID-19 trends in Iran. To this end, weekly confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 and the intercity traffic flow reported by loop detectors were aggregated at the country's level. The Box-Jenkins methodology was employed to evaluate the policy's effectiveness, using the interrupted time series analysis. The results indicated that the autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX) model outperformed the univariate ARIMA model in predicting the disease trends based on the MAPE criterion. The weekly intercity traffic and its lagged variables were entered as covariates in both models of the disease cases and deaths. The results indicated that the weekly intercity traffic increases the new weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths with a time lag of two and five weeks, respectively. Besides, the interrupted time series analysis indicated that the smart travel ban policy had decreased intercity travel by around 29%. Nonetheless, it had no significant direct effect on COVID-19 trends. This study suggests that the travel ban policy would not be efficient lonely unless it is coupled with active measures and adherence to health protocols by the people.","Nassiri, Mohammadpour, Dahaghin","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276276","20221018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39454,""
"Psychological distress and everyday discrimination among Chinese international students one year into COVID-19: a preregistered comparative study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese international students (CISs) experienced distress associated with both unique and universal stressors, among which everyday discrimination may be especially harmful. Cross-sectional design. We compared distress between CISs (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°381) and Chinese students in Chinese colleges (CSCCs; <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°305) and examined correlates of distress including the association between everyday discrimination and distress as well as moderators on this link. Compared to CSCCs, CISs reported greater depression and anxiety. Sensitivity analyses - multiple regressions controlling for covariates and coarsened exact matched (CEM) comparisons - replicated the results. 28.6% CISs reported suicidal ideation (PHQ-9 item 9) at least several days during the past two weeks. Within CISs, depression was associated with being older, female, non-heterosexual, increased everyday discrimination, decreased self-esteem, coping flexibility, perceived social support, and satisfaction with online learning. Anxiety was associated with being in undergraduate years, female, increased discrimination, decreased self-esteem, coping flexibility, and satisfaction with online learning. High perceived social support and being heterosexual weakened the association between discrimination and anxiety and depression, while high self-esteem strengthened the association between discrimination and anxiety. Our study underscored the distress experienced by CISs and highlighted risk/protective factors that may warrant attention.","Bi, Yeoh, Jiang, Wienk, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2022.2130268","20221018","COVID-19; Chinese international students; depression; intersectionality; minority stress; perceived discrimination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39455,""
"Struggling With Recovery From Opioids: Who Is at Risk During COVID-19?","Individuals in recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) are vulnerable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent findings suggest increased relapse risk and overdose linked to COVID-19-related stressors. We aimed to identify individual-level factors associated with COVID-19-related impacts on recovery. This observational study (NCT04577144) enrolled 216 participants who previously partook in long-acting buprenorphine subcutaneous injection clinical trials (2015-2017) for OUD. Participants indicated how COVID-19 affected their recovery from substance use. A machine learning approach Classification and Regression Tree analysis examined the association of 28 variables with the impact of COVID-19 on recovery, including demographics, substance use, and psychosocial factors. Tenfold cross-validation was used to minimize overfitting. Twenty-six percent of the sample reported that COVID-19 had made recovery somewhat or much harder. Past-month opioid use was higher among those who reported that recovery was harder compared with those who did not (51% vs 24%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). The final classification tree (overall accuracy, 80%) identified the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) as the strongest independent risk factor associated with reporting COVID-19 impact. Individuals with a BDI-II score Ã¢â€°Â¥10 had 6.45 times greater odds of negative impact (95% confidence interval, 3.29-13.30) relative to those who scored &lt;10. Among individuals with higher BDI-II scores, less progress in managing substance use and treatment of OUD within the past 2 to 3 years were also associated with negative impacts. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring depressive symptoms and perceived progress in managing substance use among those in recovery from OUD, particularly during large-magnitude crises.","Keith, Tegge, Stein, Athamneh, Craft, Chilcoat, Le Moigne, DeVeaugh-Geiss, Bickel","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000001096","20221018","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39456,""
"Impact of the first, second and third peak of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety, depression and stress symptoms of healthcare workers","Numerous studies have been conducted on the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, how the mental health of health workers will be affected among the number of peaks during the pandemic has not been evaluated yet. The study aims to investigate the effects of the first, second, and third peaks of COVID-19 on anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms in healthcare workers. The current study included 4031 healthcare workers, 1051 during the first peak period, 1409 during the second peak period, and 1571 during the third peak period. The Depression-anxiety-stress scale-21(DASS-21) was used to assess the participants' levels of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. The mean age of the participants was 33.74 Ã‚Â± 7.95, and 2634 (66.3 %) were female. 36.9 %(n = 1486) of the participants were physicians, 41.1 % (n = 1655) were nurses and 22.1 % (n = 890) were other healthcare workers. A statistically significant difference was documented in the DASS-21 anxiety (F(2:4028) = 502.893, p 2. Peak &gt; 1. Peak), DASS-21 depression (F(2:4028) = 46.034, p 2. Peak &gt; 1.

Our findings show that as the peak number rises, so do the levels of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers. As a result, it is possible to assert that prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic worsens mental problems (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 35).","Gundogmus, Bolu, Unsal, Alma, Gundogmus, Takmaz, Okten, Gunduz, Aydin","https://doi.org/10.4149/BLL_2022_133","20221018","COVID-19 depression.; anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39457,""

"Cyberchondria, Anxiety Sensitivity, Hypochondria, and Internet Addiction: Implications for Mental Health Professionals","Repetitive online searches for health information increase anxieties and result in Internet addiction. Internet addiction, cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, and hypochondria have been studied separately, but how these concepts are reciprocally linked has not been investigated. This study aimed to determine the levels, correlations, and predictors of Internet addiction, cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, and hypochondria among students based on the sample's characteristics. A sample of 143 university students participated in this cross-sectional online survey. A self-reported questionnaire was employed to collect data from students. The studied concepts had moderate to high correlations with each other and with the students' characteristics. Not getting infected with the coronavirus was among the demographic factors inserted into the regression model that only predicted cyberchondria. The model of cyberchondria was significant and explained 11.5% of the variance in the score of concepts. The results of the standard regression analysis indicated that the model predicting Internet addiction accounted for 41.2% of the variability. Our unique findings indicate that cyberchondria can contribute to developing Internet addiction compared to earlier studies. The findings suggest the importance of empowering students to overcome their anxieties by managing cyberchondria and Internet addiction.

"Negative Emotions, Triggers, and Coping Strategies Among Postpartum Indian Women During Second Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons for the Subsequent Waves and Beyond","The study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 associated psychological distress among pregnant and postpartum women during the second wave of COVID-19 in India. A cross-sectional survey was done using a pre-validated tool involving 491 participants attending a tertiary-care hospital during the second wave of COVID-19 in India. Three-fourths of participants experienced negative emotions such as fear and various features of depression. Participants (75%) reported COVID-related news on TV/Radio/Newspapers including social media as the major trigger for these negative emotions.

"Implications for long COVID: A systematic review and meta-aggregation of experience of patients diagnosed with COVID-19","This review aims to synthesize the available evidence of what patients experience when infected with COVID-19, both in hospital and post-discharge settings. This review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for qualitative systematic reviews and evidence synthesis. Reporting of results was presented according to the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) checklist. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a public health crisis worldwide. Many patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have varied levels of persisting mental disorders. Previous studies have reported the degree, prevalence and outcome of psychological problems. Minimal research explored the experience of patients with long COVID. The real-life experience of patients with COVID-19 from diagnosis to post-discharge can deepen the understanding of nurses, physicians and policymakers. All studies describing the experience of patients were included. Two authors independently appraised the methodological quality of the included studies using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research 2020. This systematic review aggregated patients' experience of being diagnosed with COVID-19 in both hospitalized and post-discharge settings. Finally, 17 studies met inclusion criteria and quality appraisal guidelines. The selected studies in the meta-synthesis resulted in 12 categories, and further were concluded as five synthesized findings: physical symptoms caused by the virus, positive and negative emotional responses to the virus, positive coping strategies as facilitators of epidemic prevention and control, negative coping strategies as obstacles of epidemic prevention and control, and unmet needs for medical resource. The psychological burden of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is heavy and persistent. Social support is essential in the control and prevention of the epidemic. Nurses and other staff should pay more attention to the mental health of the infected patients both in and after hospitalization. Nurses should care about the persistent mental trauma of COVID-19 survivors and provide appropriate psychological interventions to mitigate the negative psychological consequences of them. Besides, nurses, as healthcare professionals who may have the most touch with patients, should evaluate the level of social support and deploy it for them. It is also needed for nurses to listen to patient's needs and treat them with carefulness and adequate patience in order to decrease the unmet needs of patients.","Zheng, Qian, Ye, Zhang, Zhan, Li, Luo","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16537","20221018","COVID-19; experience; mental health; qualitative research; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39461,""
"Intensive care nurses' lived experience of altruism and sacrifices during the Covid-19 pandemic: A phenomenological study","The aim of this study was to understand the lived experience of altruism and sacrifices among Swedish nurses working in intensive care units (ICU) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a descriptive phenomenological study. The study was conducted between June 2020 and March 2021 and included 20 nurses who were directly involved in the ICU care of COVID-19 patients in Sweden during the pandemic. The text transcripts were analysed using Malterud's Systematic Text Condensation. The analysis revealed four themes. The work situation changed from 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°day to another-the nurses were brutally confronted with a new and highly demanding situation. Adapting to the chaotic situation-despite fear, anguish and exhaustion, the nurses adapted to the new premises. They shouldered the moral responsibility and responded to the needs of the patients and the health care system since they had the competence. Being confronted with ethical and moral challenges-the nurses were overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness and inadequacy because despite how hard they worked, they were still unable to provide care with dignity and of acceptable quality. The importance of supporting each other-collegiality was fundamental to the nurses' ability to cope with the situation. Taken together, being exposed to a constantly changing situation, facing the anguish and misery of patients, families, and colleagues, and being confronted with a conflict between the moral obligation to provide care of high quality and the possibility to fulfil this commitment resulted in suffering among the nurses. Collegial back-up and a supportive culture within the caring team were important for the nurses' endurance. The study contributes an understanding of nurses' lived experience of working during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the importance of protecting and preparing nurses and nursing organisation for potential future crises.","Slettmyr, Arman, Andermo, Malmberg, HÃƒÂ¤llstrÃƒÂ¶m, Hugelius, Schandl","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15467","20221018","COVID-19; dignity; lived experience; moral stress; nursing care; nursing science; qualitative; suffering","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39462,""
"Perception of pediatric residents from a tertiary hospital in the city of MÃƒÂ©xico regarding their training during the COVID-19 pandemic","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic, which changed the residents' teaching and learning process. The purpose of this study was to determine residents' satisfaction and impressions on their training during the pandemic in a tertiary pediatric hospital. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. An online survey was designed to determine residents' demographic and personal characteristics, as well as their perception about the theoretical and practical training, as well as about their emotional situation. The analysis separated medical students from surgical students in order to identify any differences existing between these groups, for which Ãâ€¡2 was calculated. Overall, 148 of 171 residents (86.5%) responded to the questionnaire; 75% belonged to the medical specialty and 25% to the surgical specialty. Statistically significant differences were found in terms of those training aspects they were concerned about during the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and about the difficulties associated with online learning (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Differences were also found regarding their satisfaction toward the time needed to complete their thesis (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.059) and activities outside the hospital (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.029). Regarding their degree of satisfaction in general, most medical specialty students felt slightly satisfied (43.2%) and surgical specialty students felt mostly neutral (37.8%). Regarding their feelings about their mental health, statistically significant differences were found between both groups (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.038) although both groups reported the same percentage of overall dissatisfaction (2.7%) in this area. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant challenges to medical education systems. Lack of practice in decision-making and maneuver execution are concerns for residents and may affect their future professional performance.","Blanchet, KlÃƒÂ¼nder, Morales, De Titto, Montiel","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03776-y","20221017","COVID-19; Medical education; Online education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39463,""
"Quarantining: a mentally distressful but physically comfortable experience in South Korea","Quarantine is the first response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Restricting daily life can cause several problems. This study aimed to measure the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by comparing to the pre-pandemic. HRQoL during COVID-19 quarantine was surveyed online using EQ-5D index and matched to that of the pre-pandemic-extracted from nationwide representative data of the Korea Community Health Survey- with propensity scores. A beta regression for the EQ-5D scores and a logistic analysis for individual dimensions of the EQ-5D index were performed to measure the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on health utility. The overall scores of the EQ-5D index were significantly higher in the group under quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic (0.971 SD 0.064) than those before the pandemic (0.964 SD 0.079, Diff. 0.007 SD 0.101, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.043). The beta regression for the overall scores of EQ-5D revealed that quarantining during the COVID-19 pandemic increased by 52.7% compared to normal life before the outbreak(pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.045). Specifically, ""Depression/Anxiety"" deteriorated significantly during quarantining (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.62, 95% CI:0.48-0.80). However, ""Pain/Discomfort"" and ""Mobility"" significantly improved (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.37, 95% CI:3.71-7.78 and ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.05, 95% CI:1.11-3.80, respectively). Although the world is facing a challenging moment that it has never been through before, mandatory quarantine has served as an experience that provided mental distress but physical comfort in the Korean context.","Kwon, Kim, Lee, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-022-02051-4","20221017","COVID-19; EQ-5D; Quality of life; Quarantine; Republic of Korea","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39464,""
"Service User Experience of Remote Therapy in a Community Mental Health Team During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Service Improvement Points","Aim: The rapid application of telephone and videoconferencing therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic presented an opportunity to assess its benefits, drawbacks and potential service changes from a client perspective. Method: This study gathered data from eight clients from a London secondary care mental health service via a semi-structured interview which was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Thirteen themes were identified. Remote therapy was met with gratitude, underpinned by greater convenience and specific advantages, resulting in high acceptability. Conversely, clients highlighted those changes to delivery and issues of inequality resulting in a sub-optimal medium for therapy. Discussion: Suggested service adjustments were presented with a view to optimising remote therapy for both the COVID-19 pandemic and future applications.","Jack Gilgunn et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01F3-24D-9E6","20221018","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; community mental health; qualitative; service improvement; covid-19; remote therapy; improvement science; expert by experience","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-19","",39465,""
