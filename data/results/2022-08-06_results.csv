"The association between experience of COVID-19-related discrimination and psychological distress among healthcare workers for six national medical research centers in Japan","Background: Discrimination has been identified as an important determinant of negative mental health outcomes. This study determined the association between the experience of COVID-19-related discrimination and psychological distress among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Japan. Methods: This cross-sectional study conducted a health survey among 5,703 HCWs of six national medical and research centers in Japan from October 2020 to March 2021. COVID-19-related discrimination was defined either when participants or their family members were badmouthed or when they felt discriminated against in some way. We used the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) to assess the presence of severe psychological distress ([&ge;]13 points). We used logistic regression models to examine the association between discrimination and psychological distress. We also identified job-related factors associated with discrimination. Results: Of the participants, 484 (8.4%) reported COVID-19-related discrimination and 486 (8.5%) had severe psychological distress. HCWs who were female vs. male (odds ratio [OR]=1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.28-1.55), had high vs. low viral exposure (OR=2.31, 95%CI=1.81-2.93), and worked for more than 10 hours/day vs. <8 hours/day (OR=1.42, 95%CI=1.35-1.49) were more likely to have experienced COVID-19-related discrimination. The OR (95%CI) of severe psychological distress was 1.83 (1.29-2.59) among those who experienced discrimination. The analysis was stratified by sociodemographic and job-related factors and the associations trended in the same direction across subgroups. Conclusion: Experience of COVID-19-related discrimination was associated with severe psychological distress among HCWs. During the pandemic, effective measures should be taken to prevent the development of negative mental health outcomes in HCWs who experience discrimination.","Rachana Manandhar Shrestha; Yosuke Inoue; Shohei Yamamoto; Ami Fukunaga; Makiko Sampei; Ryo Okubo; Naho Morisaki; Norio Ohmagari; Takanori Funaki; Kazue Ishitsuka; Koushi Yamaguchi; Yohei Sasaki; Kazuyoshi Takeda; Takeshi Miyama; Masayo Kojima; Takeshi Nakagawa; Kunihiro Nishimura; Soshiro Ogata; Jun Umezawa; Shiori Tanaka; Manami Inoue; Maki Konishi; Kengo Miyo; Tetsuya Mizoue","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.08.03.22278304","20220804","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35633,""

This study focuses on the suicides reflected in the local and national press between 16 March and 31 May 2020 when intense restrictions and curfews were implemented in all areas of life. Within the scope of this study, suicide cases of 303 people were examined with the relational screening model. In this direction, suicides incidents that took place during the first two and a half month-long restriction of Covid-19 and its relationship with economic developments and poverty were examined. As a result of the research, it is seen that economic-based suicides take the first place after suicides of unknown cause and psychological-based suicides, and unemployment takes the largest share among economically-based suicides. On the other hand, it has been understood that suicide can occur as a form of protest in the context of poverty and rights, and also as a result of the individual's disconnection from society.","BÃ¼rÃ¼ngÃ¼z, Nurdane","https://doi.org/10.54752/ct.1142740","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Calisma ve Toplum; 3(74):1935, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35634,""

In this study, the degrees of rejection and assimilation that different groups of people maintain regarding two types of measures designed to control the pandemic are analyzed: mandatory confinement and modification of daily routines. To do this, the emotions of a sample of 1911 people were evaluated using a questionnaire with Likert response options, an instrument constructed and validated for this research. The results allowed the identification of six emotional profiles with different sociodemographic conditions. In a pole, characterized by experiences of anger, sadness, and distrust in the face of the measures, there is a profile made up of young women, students and with a low level of economic income. At the other pole, characterized by presenting a state of comfort in the face of the pandemic and confidence in the proposed measures, there is a group made up of men, aged between 40 and 69 years, with a high educational level and high economic income. In between, we find four more profiles, with different emotional characteristics and sociodemographic conditions.

"Efectos de la pandemia en la trayectoria educativa de niÃ±as, niÃ±os y adolescentes: lecciones desde Chiapas, MÃ©xico","The Mexican government suspended school activities at all educational levels as a measure to mitigate the transmission of the SARS-CoV2 virus. Since March of 2020, it implemented a distance education modality through the use of information and communication technologies. As of February 2021, this measure was still in force. In a state like Chiapas, where a high percentage of the population lives in poverty and access to and use of technologies is limited, it is relevant to analyze with a differentiated approach to identify how such measures affect the educational trajectories of children and adolescents in conditions of greater inequality. The study analyzes the information from a telephone consultation with children and adolescents from 8 to 17 years of age Tsotsiles, Tsetales, and Mestizos from the city of San CristÃ³bal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, carried out in March 2020. It delves into the characteristics of their homes, access to services, and the use of information technologies to recover their perceptions and concerns about their school trajectories. Their voices reveal the effects that a measure such as the one implemented by the Mexican government has on their right to education and its interdependence with other rights such as food, physical and mental health, and access to information.Alternate :Desde marzo del 2020, implementÃ³ una modalidad de educaciÃ³n a distancia mediante el uso de tecnologÃ­as de la informaciÃ³n y comunicaciÃ³n.

"Two-Spirits' Response to COVID-19: Survey Findings in Atlantic Canada Identify Priorities and Developing Practices","The Wabanaki Two-Spirit Alliance, a regional Two-Spirit organization, administered an online survey in May of 2020 to identify priorities and concerns of Two-Spirit individuals and Indigenous 2SLGBTQQIA+ people in Atlantic Canada during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The respondents (n = 149) shared health concerns including deterioration(s) of mental health (56.32%). They described mental health supports (68.42%), health supports for Two-Spirit individuals (57.89%), healing gatherings (46.05%) and trans-specific supports (44.74%) as interventions in fostering Two-Spirit health. The Alliance's immediate response was to develop community-led responses to address urgent concerns. Our key promising practice has been hosting Two-Spirit gatherings as community-based health/cultural supports;the gatherings also serve as an opportunity for the Alliance to consult the Two-Spirit community about priorities and concerns. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Alliance explored ways to keep the TwoSpirit community united by maintaining social support(s).

"Indigenous Community Praxis and Programs During COVID- 19: Medicine Keeper Wellness and Creative Corner Programs","The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected Indigenous communities. Deterioration of physical and mental health within Indigenous communities has been prevalent, due to unjust social, environmental, and economic factors. These have included preexisting health conditions, unsustainable and overcrowded housing, limited health care and mental health services, and inadequate access to clean drinking water. These factors have resulted in exacerbated mental health and trauma symptoms. Indigenous communities have needed to adapt methods of attaining mental health and medical services in order to maintain personal and communal well-being. We offer a summary of the delivery of two programs: the Medicine Keeper Wellness Program and Creative Corner Program, which were conducted in northern, central interior, and southern Indigenous communities in British Columbia, Canada, by Indigenous social workers to promote individual and community wellness.

"Malay Version of Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II): A Reliability and Validity Analysis in Non- Clinical Samples","INTRODUCTION: Experiential avoidance is a key psychological process variable that measures the level of neglect or avoidance of unpleasant personal psychological experiences. It is highly correlated with the psychological flexibility construct, and both of these are important components in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) has been used to measure both constructs and the Malay version of AAQ-II has been translated and validated in the clinical sample. Hence, this study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Malay version of AAQ-II in a non-clinical sample. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The participants were recruited from 3 campuses of Universiti Malaysia Sabah namely UMSLabuan International Campus (UMSKAL), Sandakan campus, and the main campus in Kota Kinabalu. Convenience sampling was employed and the snowball method was used to recruit participants. All participants answered online questionnaires, which consist of sociodemographic information as well as the Malay version of AAQ-II, Mindfulness Awareness and Attention Scale (MAAS), General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), and Balanced Index of Psychological Mindedness (BIPM). Both classical test theory and Rasch measurement theory were used to check the reliability and validity. RESULTS: There were 370 participants in this study. Malay version of AAQ-II demonstrated good psychometric properties with Cronbachâ€™s alpha of 0.932, parallel reliability of 0.844, and satisfactory Rasch analysis. Exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor model with 7-items. AAQ-II scores were positively correlated with depressive and anxiety scores, and lower levels of mindfulness and psychological mindedness, supporting the concurrent and convergent validity. CONCLUSION: Malay version of the AAQ-II has adequate reliability and validity in assessing psychological inflexibility in the non-clinical sample and hence could be a useful psychological instrument in assessing COVID-19 mental health effect.

"Neuropsychiatric Consequences of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Synthetic Review from a Global Perspective","Some research suggests that distress, secondary to isolation and fear following COVID-19 infection, can negatively affect the long-term more than the COVID-19 infection itself. This narrative review aims to provide a global view on the neuropsychiatric consequences of COVID-19 that can be ascribed to several factors, ranging from the direct effect of infection, to the body's responses against the infection, or to the psychological sequelae of social isolation, unemployment, and fear for one's health and livelihood. Current findings show that the more severe the respiratory infection, the more likely are central nervous system (CNS) complications regarding the infection itself. The immune reactions to the infection may result in symptoms similar to chronic fatigue as well as neurocognitive deficits, which last long after the infection is gone. An increase in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and trauma-related stress may also follow upon economic fears and isolation from friends and family. The consequences of the pandemic are not limited to adults;children learning remotely and away from classmates and routine activities may develop adjustment disorders, acute stress disorder, and a variety of manifestations of grief. A summary of case reports suggests that COVID-19-related stress, economic recession, and political unrest increase the risk of suicidal behaviors and acts of violence. However, it is unknown whether manifestations of mental disorders result from social causes or whether CNS complications may be responsible.

"Health Workers' Depression, Anxiety, Stress, and Compassion Levels During the COVID-19 Outbreak","BACKGROUND/AIMS: Healthcare professionals should be evaluated for depression, anxiety and stress during and after the epidemic, and the necessary education, training and psychological support should be provided so that they can provide quality health care and maintain their compassion. This study examined health workers' depression, anxiety, stress, and compassion levels during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted using 234 health personnel who provided care to COVID-19 patients. The data were gathered using the Information Request Form, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21), and Compassion Scale (CS). RESULTS: The participants' average total score of DASS-21 was 38.28Â±13.95 and their average CS score was 93.34Â±11.77. There was a strong, negative, and significant correlation between the DASS-21 sub-dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress and the CS sub-dimensions of indifference, separation, and disengagement (p=0.000). CONCLUSION: This study determined that health workers experienced depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak and their CS remained high.","Keskin, Alev Yildirim, SentÃ¼rk, Sibel","https://doi.org/10.4274/cjms.2021.2021-19","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cyprus Journal of Medical Sciences; 7(3):321-329, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35644,""
"""Dentist as Smile Weavers"" An Online Survey on Infection Surveillance, Emergency Treatment, Economic Setbacks, and Stress Endured by Periodontists of South India during COVID-19","Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 virus introduction and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic have had a profound impact on normal dentistry, particularly periodontal treatment, around the world. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the infection surveillance, emergency treatment, economic setbacks, and stress endured by periodontists of South India during COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March to July 2021 among periodontists in South India. A total of 300 periodontists were chosen through the randomized sampling technique. The data were collected using a self-reported closed-end questionnaire consisting of 38 questions through Google Forms. The information was entered into a database and analyzed using SPSS program version 16.0. Results: A total of 300 people took part in the survey, 277 (92.3%) dentists responded to the survey in its entirety. Periodontists and postgraduates made up 24.18% and 75.9% of those who responded, respectively. For all of the questions asked, there was a statistically significant difference among the responses. The majority of respondents agreed on questions about periodontists' knowledge, practice, mentality, and financial setbacks concerning the COVID-19 epidemic. Conclusion: Most of the periodontists that we surveyed have adequate knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and have been taking adequate measures in preventing the spread of the disease. This pandemic has a negative impact on the periodontists. This study indicates a high level of depression among a significant number of periodontists. It is important to monitor and address the mental health needs of practitioners during the pandemic. The knowledge, awareness, and attitudes regarding teledentistry were found to be satisfactory among the periodontists.

"Are Face Masks a Problem for Emotion Recognition? Not When the Whole Body Is Visible","The rise of the novel COVID-19 virus has made face masks commonplace items around the globe. Recent research found that face masks significantly impair emotion recognition on isolated faces. However, faces are rarely seen in isolation and the body is also a key cue for emotional portrayal. Here, therefore, we investigated the impact of face masks on emotion recognition when surveying the full body. Stimuli expressing anger, happiness, sadness, and fear were selected from Van den Stock and de Gelderâ€™s (2011) BEAST stimuli set. Masks were added to these images and participants were asked to recognise the emotion and give a confidence level for that decision for both the masked and unmasked stimuli. We found that, contrary to some work viewing faces in isolation, emotion recognition was generally not impaired by face masks when the whole body is present. We did, however, find that when viewing masked faces, only the recognition of happiness significantly decreased when the whole body was present. In contrast to actual performance, confidence levels were found to decline during the Mask condition across all emotional conditions. This research suggests that the impact of masks on emotion recognition may not be as pronounced as previously thought, as long as the whole body is also visible.","Ross, Paddy, George, Emily","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.915927","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Neuroscience;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35647,""
"Employeesâ€™ support strategies for mental wellbeing during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic: Recommendations for employers in the UK workforce (preprint)","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond for many businesses, employees have had to adapt to new ways of working due to disruptions in traditional practices. It is therefore crucial to understand the new challenges that employees are facing when it comes to taking care of their mental wellbeing at work. To that end, we distributed a survey to full-time UK employees (N = 451) to explore how supported they felt throughout the pandemic, and to identify whether there are any additional types of support they would like to receive. We also compared employeesâ€™ intentions to seek help before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic, and assessed their current attitudes toward mental health. Based on direct employee feedback, our results show remote workers felt more supported throughout the pandemic compared to hybrid workers. We also found that employees who had previously experienced an episode of anxiety or depression were significantly more likely to want extra support at work compared to those who had not. Furthermore, employees were significantly more likely to seek help for their mental health during the pandemic compared to before. Interestingly, the largest increase in intentions to seek help during the pandemic compared to before was with digital health solutions. Finally, we found that the strategies managers have adopted to better support their employees, an employee's mental health history, and their attitude to mental health all contributed to significantly increasing the likelihood that an employee would disclose a mental health concern to their line manager. We provide recommendations that encourage organisations to make changes to better support their employees, and we highlight the importance of mental health awareness training for both managers and employees. This work is of particular interest to organisations who are looking to tailor their current employee wellbeing offer to a post-pandemic world.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/4ph2t","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35648,""
"Towards a dimensional model of risk and protective factors influencing childrenâ€™s early cognitive, social and emotional development during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Variation in infantsâ€™ home environment is implicated in their cognitive and psycho-social development. The pandemic has intensified variations in home environments through exacerbating socioeconomic inequalities, and increasing psychological stressors for some families. This study investigates the effects of parental (predominantly maternal) mental health, enriching activities and screen use on 280 24- to 52-month-oldsâ€™ executive functions, internalising and externalising problems, and pro-social behaviour;with socioeconomic status and social support as contextual factors. Our results indicate that aspects of the home environment are differentially associated with childrenâ€™s cognitive and psycho-social development. Parents who experienced sustained mental distress during the pandemic tended to report higher child externalising and internalising problems, and executive function difficulties at follow-up. Children who spent more time engaged in enriching activities with their parents showed stronger executive functions and social competence six months later. Screen use levels during the first year of the pandemic were not associated with outcomes. To mitigate the risk of persistent negative effects for this â€˜pandemic generationâ€™ of infants, our study highlights the importance of supporting parentsâ€™ mental health. As our results demonstrate the impact of social support on mental health, investing in support services and interventions promoting building support networks are likely to be beneficial.","","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/3be6u","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35649,""
"Acute and preventive treatment of COVID-19 related headache: A series of 100 patients (preprint)","Background:  Headache is a common manifestation of post-coronavirus disease (COVID) condition. We aimed to describe the need and effectiveness of acute and preventive medications in a series of 100 consecutive patients evaluated in a headache unit. Methods:  Observational descriptive study with a series of cases design. Patients with confirmed COVID diagnosis that were referred due to headache following COVID were included. Patients were evaluated and treated by headache experts. The study included patients infected between March 1, 2020, and January 31, 2022. Demographic variables and clinical information at the moment of the treatment use were gathered. Response to treatment was evaluated according to pain freedom response two hours after the use of the acute medication, and in the case of the preventive medication, the 50%, 30% and 75% responder rates were calculated. Results:  Patients were aged 48.0 (standard deviation (SD): 12.4), were female (84%) and had prior history of headache (56%), anxiety (42%), sleep disorders (37%), and depression (26%). The mean time between the infection and the evaluation was 7.2 (SD: 4.0) months. The most common headache phenotype was holocranial (63%), frontal (48%), pressing (75%), of moderate intensity (7 out of 10), and accompanied by photophobia (58%). Acute medication was required by 93%, being paracetamol (46%) the most frequently used drug, followed by ibuprofen (44%). The drugs with the higher proportion of 2-hour pain-freedom response were dexketoprofen (58.8%), triptans (57.7%), ibuprofen (54.3%) and paracetamol (43.1%).Preventive treatment was required by 75% of patients. The most frequently used drugs were amitriptyline (66%), anesthetic blockades (18%) and onabotulinumtoxinA (11%). The drugs with the higher 50% responder rate were amitriptyline (45.5%), mirtazapine (50%) and anesthetic blockades (38.9%). The higher 75% responder rate was experienced following onabotulinutoxinA (18.2%) and the higher 30% responder rate was obtained following amitriptyline and onabotulinumtoxinA (72.7%). Conclusions:  The majority of patients required acute medication, with triptans and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs being the therapies with the best results. Three quarters of patients required preventive medication. The most frequently used drug was amitriptyline, which obtained the best results. In some treatment-resistant patients, anesthetic blockades and onabotulinumtoxinA were also beneficial.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1851702/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35650,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family carers of those with profound and multiple intellectual disabilities: Perspectives from UK and Irish Non-Government Organisations (preprint)","Background:  Family carers of people with profound and multiple intellectual disabilities (PMID) experienced a reduction in healthcare services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many subsequently turned to Non-Government Organisations who worked to support families. However, little research has sought to capture the experiences of family carers or identify effective interventions which might support them. To address these concerns we explored the views of Non-Government sector workers across the UK and Ireland who supported families people with PMID during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also sought to explore their views on the characteristics of online support programmes for family carers. Methods: : This study employed a qualitative design using focus groups with participants (n=24) from five Non-Governmental Organisations across the UK and Ireland. Interview schedules included questions on challenges, supports, coping and resources which helped during lockdown restrictions. Focus groups were held online, were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The resulting transcripts were pseudonymised and subjected to thematic analysis. Findings:  Four themes were identified (i) â€˜mental health and well-beingâ€™, (ii) â€˜they who shout the loudestâ€™, (iii) â€˜lack of trust in statutory servicesâ€™ and (iv) â€˜creating an online support programmeâ€™. Mental health and well-being emerged as the largest theme and included three subthemes named as â€˜isolationâ€™, â€˜fear of COVID-19â€™ and â€˜the exhaustion of caringâ€™. Conclusions: : The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the vulnerability of family carers who were already experiencing difficulties in accessing services and supports for their families. While Non-Government Organisations have been a crucial lifeline there is urgent need to design services, including online support programmes, in partnership with family carers which adequately address their needs.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1826749/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35651,""
"Psychological Impact Assessment of Covid-19 on Migrants in Jammu City and Peripheral Area, Jammu and Kashmir, India (preprint)","Introduction:  In Indian economy, the internal migrants are the major role player in the informal sector. During Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown millions of internal migrants were severely affected. Migrants are more prone to social, economic, and psychological issues. It is quite relevant to know the impact of Covid-19 on the psychological health of migrants. The fear of starvation, fear of not being able to meet their family members, fear of getting infected, fear of death, loss of wages were the main psychological problems they faced. This paper focuses on the psychological assessment of impact of Covid-19 on migrants in the Jammu city and its peripheral areas, Union Territory Jammu & Kashmir, India. Methodology: Data is collected by personal interview method with the help of questionnaire. For analyzing the psychological impacts of Covid-19 on migrants, we used Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. 100 persons are surveyed during the study. Results: 69 percent respondent reflected that they had fear of death during pandemic period. Most of the respondent said that they were feeling nervous, helpless for not being able to attend the health needs of family even they were not able to concentrate properly and had little interest in doing things. Conclusion: the outcome of the study shows that more than half of the respondents are dealing with the psychological issues, thus along with looking at the physical needs there is need of taking care of mental health is also especially in the time of the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1817936/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35652,""
"Mental Health among Children with Long COVID during the COVID- 19 Pandemic (preprint)","Purpose:  A growing number of studies report that persons of all ages, infected with SARS-CoV-2, may experience long-term persistent symptoms, known as Long-COVID (LC) or post COVID-19 condition. This is one of the first studies examining the consequences of LC on childrenâ€™s mental health. Method In this case control study, we compared select mental health aspects of 103 children diagnosed with LC to a control group of 113 children uninfected with SARS-COV-2;all 4â€“18 years old. Both groups were assessed via parentsâ€™ questionnaires. Results In comparison to the control group, children with LC exhibited more memory difficulties. However, no group differences emerged in other functional aspects (connection with friends and engagement in physical activities), problems with concentration, or levels of emotional-behavioral problems (externalizing, internalizing, ADHD, and PTSD symptoms). We also found that children with LC had greater exposure to COVID 19 related stressors. Higher levels of parental worries regarding their childrenâ€™s functioning and economic difficulties at home significantly predicted higher levels of childrenâ€™s emotional-behavioral problems and were better predictors than the childâ€™s age, social functioning, or LC diagnosis. Conclusions LC was associated with impairments in some aspects of childrenâ€™s memory which may relate to academic functioning, but not with higher rates of emotional-behavioral problems, thus warranting interventional programs addressing school functioning and cognitive abilities in this population. Additionally, parents' economic stress and worries regarding their childâ€™s emotional adjustment during the pandemic, are important factors affecting pandemic-related emotional-behavioral problems among children, regardless of COVID-19 infection, that should be addressed.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1797505/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35653,""
"Working from home: Impacts on mental and physical health of Canadian employees during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed various aspects of our lives, including how we work. Since the start of the pandemic, numerous organizations in Canada have mandated their employees to work from home (WFH) on a full-time basis. The rapid rise in the number of remote workers and the possibility for WFH continuing in the future signifies the importance of understanding the impacts of WFH on employee well-being over the course of the pandemic in Canada. We present the findings of two surveys (initial and 6-month follow-up) to investigate the effects of mandatory WFH arrangements on worker health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. We examined the changes in employeesâ€™ mental and physical health. Initial survey was completed between October 2020 and December 2020 (n = 1617);follow-up survey was completed between May 2021 and June 2021 (n = 382). Our analyses showed significant changes in various aspects of employee mental and physical health. Burnout, stress, general mental health, and job insecurity levels significantly decreased between the two time periods. Work-related sedentary behaviour reduced over time;however, the average proportion of time spent sitting during work hours was more than 80% in both surveys. Employees received more help and feedback from their colleagues and experienced a better sense of community with their co-workers over time. The findings can inform workers and organizations on the mental and physical health effects of mandatory WFH arrangements. By understanding the impacts of WFH, employers can develop effective strategies and implement policies that help protect workersâ€™ health and well-being.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1782175/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35654,""
"Sabbaticals in US Medical Schools (preprint)","Background:  Sabbaticals are an important feature of academia for faculty and their institutions. Whereas sabbaticals are common in institutions of higher learning, little is known about their role and utilization in U.S. medical schools. This study examining sabbaticals in medical school faculty was undertaken at a time that wellbeing of health professionals was increasingly recognized as workforce and health reform priorities. Methods:  We surveyed associate deans at U.S. medical schools in 2021 about faculty who had taken sabbaticals within the past three years, the parameters of the sabbaticals, as well as institutional policies and respondents' predictions of future sabbatical use. Results:  53% of respondents reported any faculty had taken sabbaticals in the past three years ( M = 6.27;Median = 3;range = 1-60). Institutions rated enhancing research as the most important objective, while recognizing other benefits. Sabbaticals were more commonly taken by male, White, senior faculty Ph.Ds. Details about sabbaticals, including eligibility, expectations, length, financial support, and benefits were reviewed. Most (54.8%) respondents expected no change in the number of faculty seeking sabbaticals. Nearly all anticipated the COVID-19 pandemic would not affect sabbatical policies. Conclusion:  In contrast to other institutions of higher learning, sabbatical-taking by medical school faculty is rare. We explore factors that may contribute to this phenomenon, e.g., the tripartite mission, faculty clinical responsibilities, culture of medicine, and student debt. Despite financial and other barriers, a closer look at the benefits of sabbaticals is warranted as a mechanism that may support faculty well-being, retention, and mental health.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1777479/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35655,""
"Exploring staff perspectives on caring for isolated hospitalised patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study (preprint)","Background:  Strict isolation of COVID-19 patients to prevent cross infection may inadvertently cause serious adverse outcomes including psychological harm, limitations to care, increased incidence of delirium, deconditioning and reduced quality of life. Previous research exploring the staff perspective of the effect of isolation on patients is limited. The aim of this study is to understand staff perceptions of the care and treatment of isolated patients and the impact of isolation on patients, families, and staff. Method:  This qualitative, exploratory study is set in a major metropolitan, quaternary hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Data was collected in focus groups with clinical and non-clinical staff and analysed using content analysis. The hospital ethics committee granted approval. Each participant gave informed verbal consent. Results:  Participants included 58 nursing, medical, allied health, and non-clinical staff. Six main themes were identified: 1) Communication challenges during COVID-19;2) Impact of isolation on family;3) Challenges to patientsâ€™ health and safety;4) Impact on staff;5) Challenging standards of care;6) Contextual influences: policy, decision-makers and the environment. Conclusion:  Isolating patients and restricting visitors resulted in good pandemic management, but staff perceived it came at considerable cost to staff and consumers. Innovative communication technology may facilitate improved connection between all parties. Mental health support is needed for patients, families, and staff. Further research using a co-design model with input from patients, families and staff is recommended to determine appropriate interventions to improve care. Preventing the spread of infection is essential for good pandemic management, but the cost to consumers and staff must be mitigated. Preparation for future pandemics must consider workforce preparedness, adapted models of care and workflow.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1740306/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35656,""
"Enhancing COVID Rehabilitation with Technology (ECORT): Protocol for an open-label, single site randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of electronic case management for individuals with persistent COVID-19 symptoms (preprint)","Background:  As of May 2022, Ontario has seen more than 1.3 million cases of COVID-19. While the majority of individuals will recover from infection within four weeks, a significant subset experience persistent and often debilitating symptoms, known as â€œpost-COVID syndromeâ€ or â€œLong COVIDâ€. Those with Long COVID experience a wide array of symptoms, with variable severity, including fatigue, cognitive impairment, and shortness of breath. Further, the prevalence and duration of Long COVID is unclear, nor is there evidence on the best course of rehabilitation for individuals to return to their desired level of function. Previous work with chronic conditions has suggested that the addition of electronic case management (ECM) may help to improve outcomes. These platforms provide enhanced connection with care providers, detailed symptom tracking and goal setting, and access to relevant resources. In this study, our primary aim is to determine if the addition of ECM with health coaching improves Long COVID outcomes at three months compared to health coaching alone. Methods:  The trial is an open-label, single site, randomized controlled trial of ECM with health coaching (ECM+) compared to health coaching alone (HC). Both groups will continue to receive usual care. Participants will be randomized equally to receive health coaching (+/- ECM) for a period of 8 weeks and a 12-week follow-up. Our primary outcome is the WHO Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS), 36-item self-report total score. Participants will also complete measures of cognition, fatigue, breathlessness, and mental health. Participants and care providers will be asked to complete a brief qualitative interview at the end of the study to evaluate acceptability and implementation of the intervention. Discussion:  There is currently little evidence about the optimal treatment of Long COVID patients or the use of digital health platforms in this population. The results of this trial could result in rapid, scalable, and personalized care for people with Long COVID which will decrease morbidity after an acute infection. Results from this study will also inform decision making in Long COVID and treatment guidelines at provincial and national levels.

"Reflective functioning in children and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The emergence of COVID-19 has brought global awareness to the impact of the pandemic on mental health. Public health measures such as school closures and lockdowns led to overburdening both in children and their caregivers and increased emotional and behavioral problems, especially in low-income families.More work exploring familiesâ€™ reflective functioning (RF)- the capacity to understand our own and othersâ€™ mental states- might help us understand the processes associated with mental health concerns in children and adolescents living with economic hardship. Objectives:  In a sample of economically vulnerable caregiver-child dyads, the current study explored the relationship between parental and child RF, and the perceived stress levels of the caregiver and child during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method:  The study utilized Pearsonâ€™s correlation on four instruments: the Child Attachment Interview and Parent Development Interview to evaluate the level of parental and child RF;plus, the Stress in Children Questionnaire and and Perceived Stress Scale to assess the levels of stress of each member of the dyad. Results:  As expected, the RF levels of the caregiver and child were positively correlated. However, no association was found between the RF of either child or caregiver and their levels of perceived stress. Conclusions:  Despite limitations, the present findings may have important implications for interventions, specifically those designed to improve parenting RF, which positively affects childrenâ€™s mental health. Therefore, our findings highlight the potential of providing interventions based on parental RF to this population.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1692444/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35658,""
"Time-dependent moderating effect of exposure to nature on relations between perceived interior crowding, social isolation, and psychological distress during pandemic of COVID-19 (preprint)","Due to the results of the COVID-19 epidemic on mental health, some studies have highlighted the positive effects of nature exposure. Nevertheless, this beneficial role has not yet been explored over time of the pandemic. The current study examines the temporal changes in (a) social isolation, (b) psychological distress, (c) intensity of the effect of social isolation on psychological distress, and (d) moderating effect of nature exposure on the relation between perceived interior crowding, social isolation, and psychological distress. Focusing on six mid-rise housing developments in Mashhad, data were collected from 718 middle-aged women (Mage = 49.63, SD = 12.39) in two waves during the pandemic (wave1 in June 2020 and wave2 in September 2021, before nationwide vaccination). A paired-sample t-test showed increased social isolation and psychological distress after one year of the pandemic. Also, using structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis (wave 1 vs. wave 2) revealed that social isolation has an increasing influence on psychological distress over time. Exposure to nature moderates the effect of perceived interior crowding on psychological distress. However, this moderating role is time-dependent and nature exposure during the time did not necessarily assist in reducing the negative impact of perceived interior crowding. Finally, at any given time, nature exposure mitigated the effect of social isolation on psychological distress.","","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1035834/v3","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35659,""
"Massive Hydroxychloroquine Overdose in an Uncontrolled Diabetic Patient: A Case Report, Complications and Management (preprint)","Introduction:  Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial agent that has been tried out in the treatment of COVID-19, however, evidence of efficacy remains limited. Although Hydroxychloroquine overdose is not common, growing cases of poisoning with HCQ have been reported during recent years. HCQ toxicity is characterized by life-threatening symptoms which require immediate medical intervention. This report presents a suicide attempt in a hyperglycemic patient, massive ingestion of HCQ manifested by hypokalemia and acidosis.Case summaryA 47-year-old man presented at the hospital hours after massive ingestion of HCQ (100 tablets), with generalized weakness and dizziness which had led to a fall. He was drowsy and had experienced episodes of nausea/vomiting. His past medical history was remarkable for uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, confirmed by the blood glucose of 345 mg/dL, and a previous history of hospitalization a few months ago, due to a suicide attempt. He developed marked hypokalemia accompanied by acidosis, plasma potassium of 2.8 mmol/L and pH 7.34, and hypotension, blood pressure of 80/51 mm Hg, but survived with close cardiac monitoring and immediate intervention including aggressive potassium replacement, bicarbonate infusion, and charcoal administration. ConclusionConsidering the significantly increased off-label use of HCQ during the COVID-19 pandemic, this report alerts the potential for HCQ to be associated with severe electrolyte disorders, especially in predisposing conditions like diabetes. Clinicians should keep in mind the possibility of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients under hypoglycemic medications and concurrent use of chloroquine/HCQ. This therapeutic approach also suggests the benefit of even a delayed activated charcoal administration in the treatment of HCQ poisoning.","","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202207.0394.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35660,""
"Large-scale web scraping for problem gambling research: a case study of COVID-19 lockdown effects in Germany (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to prevent its spread have had a negative impact on substance use behaviour and posed a special threat for individuals at risk. Problem gambling is a major public health concern, and it is likely that the lockdown and social distancing measures have altered gambling behaviour, for instance shifting from land-based to online gambling. In this study, we used large-scale web scraping to analyse posting behaviour on a major German online gambling forum, gathering a database of more than 200k posts. We examined the relative usage of different subforums, i.e. terrestrial, online gambling and problem gambling sections, posting frequency, and changes in posting behaviour related to the casino closures that were part of the nationwide restrictions in Germany in 2020. There was a marked increase in the number of newly registered users during the first lockdown compared to the weeks prior to the lockdown, which may reflect a shift from terrestrial to online gambling. Further, there was an increase in the number of posts in the online gambling subforum with a concurrent decrease in the number of posts in the terrestrial gambling subforum. An analysis of user types revealed that a substantial number of users who posted in both the online and terrestrial forum contributed at least once to the problem gambling subforum. This subforum contained the longest posts, which were on average twice as long as the average post. Modelling the relationship between reply frequency and latency between initial posts and replies showed that the number of short-latency replies (i.e. replies posted within seven hours after the initial post) was substantially higher during the first lockdown compared to the preceeding weeks.The increase during the first lockdown may reflect the general marked increase in screen time and/or usage of online platforms and media after the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The analyses may help to identify lockdown-related effects on gambling behaviour. These potentially detrimental effects on mental health, including addiction and problem gambling, may require monitoring and special public health measures.","","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.27.22277642","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35661,""
"Experiences and practices of people categorised as being â€˜at riskâ€™ based on age during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study in the UK and Germany","ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to comparatively explore the social representations of risk in individuals categorised â€˜at riskâ€™ based on age during the COVID-19 pandemic. What characterised their sense-making of being at risk and what effects did this have on their lives, behaviour and identities?DesignInterview-based qualitative study.SettingUK and Germany, Julyâ€“August 2020.Participants11 individuals from Germany and eight from the UK were recruited purposively. Inclusion criteria: to be at risk for a severe course of COVID-19 due to age =50 years (Germany) and =70 years (UK) based on official communication by the respective national public health authority.Exclusion criteria: any form of dementia, pre-existing mental health issues, congenital physical or mental disabilities, being resident in a care home, having a personal relationship to the principal investigator.MethodsSemistructured in-depth interviews were conducted remotely. Reflexive thematic analysis was carried out to inductively develop themes illustrative of shared patterns of meaning across the whole data set.ResultsThree main themes are reported. â€˜Establishing safe spacesâ€™ (perceiving safety and risk in relation to others and implementing prevention measures to maintain safe spaces);â€˜Assessing and responding to riskâ€™ (risk as danger relative to others and risk management as a responsibility of the individual) and â€˜Considerations on the value of a lifeâ€™ (in relation to quality of life, length of life and capacity to contribute to society). Cross cutting all of these, is the notion of relational assessment.ConclusionsThe experience of risk and related behaviour is contingent on the individualsâ€™ mindset, body and the setting (geographical, political and sociocultural) one is positioned in. Negotiating identities is an inevitable process accompanying sense-making of (new) risks. Public health practice and communication could benefit from at least being informed by and at best being based on the meanings and representations of those whose health and well-being we want to ensure.","Wabnitz, Katharina, DrÃ¶ssler, Stephanie, Mayhew, Susannah","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059499","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(7), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35662,""
"Working and caring for a disabled adopted child during a pandemic","Integrating work and family demands can be challenging for families caring for a child with one or more disabilities. The pandemic and its changes to work, schooling and service delivery potentially added to these challenges. This exploratory mixed methods study sought to understand how the pandemic affected adoptive parents' workâ€“life fit and service use. A total of 200 participants responded to survey questions about parenting an adopted child with a disability prior to, and after, the onset of Covid-19. More than half of the parents (59.2%) reported that it was somewhat to very difficult to integrate both work and family demands. Parents with greater access to workplace flexibility and supportive supervisors had significantly less difficulties combining work and family. Families who reported more problems with accessing mental health services, special education and respite care reported significantly more challenges with workâ€“family fit. Parents reported increased stress due to the pandemic changes, but many also shared positive changes such as more time for family. Online services were experienced as effective for some children and reduced time spent driving to appointments. Recommendations for workplace and social service practice and policy supporting adoptive parents of children with disabilities are discussed.

"Associations between caregiver stress and child verbal abuse and corporal punishment in Thailandâ€™s impoverished Deep South region during the COVID-19 pandemic","The objectives of this study are: (1) To describe the levels of parental stress, self-reported child verbal abuse and corporal punishment among caregivers, and;(2) To assess the extent that having moderate or higher levels of parental stress is associated with self-reported child verbal abuse and corporal punishment. We randomly sampled 12 villages and sampled 40 households per village in Thailandâ€™s impoverished Deep South region in June 2020. Study participants included 466 caregivers residing in sampled households. Trained enumerators used the standard ST-5 questionnaire to measure stress level and asked the participants to self-report the study outcomes. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Approximately 19.1% of caregivers reported moderate, high, or severe level of stress. Caregivers with moderate and higher levels of stress were more likely than caregivers with low level of stress to report child verbal abuse (48% vs. 23%, respectively;Adj. OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.90, 5.11) and corporal punishment (28% vs. 8%, respectively;Adj. OR = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.36, 5.04). We found associations between caregiverâ€™s stress level and self-reported verbal abuse and corporal punishment of children in the household. However, social desirability, lack of details in the answers, and potential confounding by mental illness co-morbidities were notable limitations of the study.

"Screening for brain fog: Is the montreal cognitive assessment an effective screening tool for neurocognitive complaints post-COVID-19?","Cognitive complaints are one of the most frequent symptoms reported in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been used to estimate prevalence of cognitive impairment in many studies of PASC, and is commonly employed as a screening test in this population, however, its validity has not been established. To determine the utility of the MoCA to screen for cognitive impairment in PASC. Sixty participants underwent neuropsychological, psychiatric, and medical assessments, as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 6-8Ã‚Â months after acute COVID-19 infection. The overall sample had a mean score of 26.1 on the MoCA, with approximately one third screening below the cutoff score of 26, similar to the rate of extremely low NP test performance. MoCA score was inversely correlated with fatigue and depression measures and ethnic minority participants scored on average lower, despite similar education and estimated premorbid function. The MoCA had an accuracy of 63.3% at detecting any degree of diminished NP performance, and an accuracy of 73.3% at detecting extremely low NP performance. The MoCA may not be accurate for detecting neither mild nor more severe degrees of diminished NP test performance in PASC. Therefore, patients with persistent cognitive complaints in the setting of PASC who score in the normal range on the MoCA should be referred for formal NP assessment.","Lynch, Ferrando, Dornbush, Shahar, Smiley, Klepacz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2022.07.013","20220805","COVID-19; Cognitive deficits; Montreal cognitive assessment; Neuropsychological testing; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brain fogÃ¢â‚¬Â","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35667,""

"Risk and Resilience Pathways, Community Adversity, Decision-making, and Alcohol Use Among Appalachian Adolescents: Protocol for the Longitudinal Young Mountaineer Health Study Cohort","Alcohol use impairs psychosocial and neurocognitive development and increases the vulnerability of youth to academic failure, substance use disorders, and other mental health problems. The early onset of alcohol use in adolescents is of particular concern, forecasting substance abuse in later adolescence and adulthood. To date, evidence suggests that youth in rural areas are especially vulnerable to contextual and community factors that contribute to the early onset of alcohol use. The objective of the Young Mountaineer Health Study is to investigate the influence of contextual and health behavior variables on the early onset of alcohol use among middle school-aged youth in resource-poor Appalachian rural communities. This is a program of prospective cohort studies of approximately 2200 middle school youth from a range of 20 rural, small town, and small city (population &lt;30,000) public schools in West Virginia. Students are participating in 6 waves of data collection (2 per year) over the course of middle school (sixth to eighth grades; fall and spring) from 2020 to 2023. On the basis of an organizational arrangement, which includes a team of local data collection leaders, supervising contact agents in schools, and an honest broker system to deidentify data linked via school IDs, we are able to collect novel forms of data (self-reported data, teacher-reported data, census-linked area data, and archival school records) while ensuring high rates of participation by a large majority of youth in each participating school. In the spring of 2021, 3 waves of student survey data, 2 waves of data from teachers, and a selection of archival school records were collected. Student survey wave 1 comprised 1349 (response rate 80.7%) participants, wave 2 comprised 1649 (response rate 87%) participants, and wave 3 comprised 1909 (response rate 83.1%) participants. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the sampling frame size, resulting in a reduced number of eligible students, particularly during the fall of 2020. Nevertheless, our team structure and incentive system have proven vitally important in mitigating the potentially far greater negative impact of the pandemic on our data collection processes. The Young Mountaineer Health Study will use a large data set to test pathways linking rural community disadvantage to alcohol misuse among early adolescents. Furthermore, the program will test hypotheses regarding contextual factors (eg, parenting practices and neighborhood collective efficacy) that protect youth from community disadvantage and explore alcohol antecedents in the onset of nicotine, marijuana, and other drug use. Data collection efforts have been successful despite interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.

"The COVID-19 pandemic and children with PANS/PANDAS: an evaluation of symptom severity, telehealth, and vaccination hesitancy","The current study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with PANS/PANDAS, a condition characterized by sudden-onset obsessive-compulsive, tic, or restrictive eating symptoms following infection. We conducted an anonymous survey between February and June 2021 of 254 self-reported caregivers of minors with PANS/PANDAS. Caregivers answered questions regarding PANS/PANDAS symptoms, telehealth care, and intention to vaccinate their child against COVID-19. PANS/PANDAS symptoms during COVID-19 infections were assessed when applicable. Children's OCD symptoms and coercive behaviors towards caregivers, along with the caregivers' mental health, relationship satisfaction, and burden, were assessed using standardized questionnaires. A majority of respondents endorsed a negative impact on their child's friendships, relationships with extended family, hobbies, and academic skills due to the pandemic. Children with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 experienced new or worsened psychiatric symptoms, particularly mood lability, OCD, and anxiety. Telehealth care was the preferred treatment modality if the child had mild symptoms of PANS/PANDAS. A majority of caregivers reported high levels of relationship dissatisfaction and caregiver burden. As expected, these data suggest an overall negative impact of the COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic on children with PANS/PANDAS and their caregivers.","O'Dor, Zagaroli, Belisle, Hamel, Downer, Homayoun, Williams","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-022-01401-z","20220805","Obsessive-compulsive disorder; PANDAS; PANS; Pediatric; Psychiatry; Tics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35671,""
"Continuity and change in loneliness and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study of autistic and non-autistic adults","Previous studies have suggested that autistic adults may be negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions. In this study, we examined continuity and change in loneliness and stress, and their predictors, in 448 autistic and 70 non-autistic adults living in the Netherlands. Autistic participants were assessed on three occasions using the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and Perceived Stress Scale (pre-lockdown (T0), first lockdown (T1), and second lockdown (T2)); non-autistic participants were assessed twice (T1 and T2). Autistic adults' loneliness and stress levels remained stable across all three time points over 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, but were consistently higher than those of non-autistic adults. Other predictors of higher loneliness and stress levels at the first lockdown (T1) included low perceived social support and high levels of COVID-19 related worries. Although loneliness and stress were stable at the group level, the wellbeing of some autistic adults worsened over the course of the pandemic, while others improved. For instance, adults with a mental health diagnosis (other than autism) prior to the pandemic were more likely to increase in stress over time, whereas adults with higher perceived social support were more likely to decrease in stress over time (from T1 to T2). Factors contributing to variability in outcome require further examination. Moreover, the relatively high loneliness and stress levels in autistic adults call for attention from clinicians and service providers. LAY SUMMARY: In our study, autistic adults reported feeling more lonely and stressed than non-autistic adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. People who missed support from their social network also felt more lonely and stressed. On average, people did not change substantially in their degree of loneliness or stress over time. Yet, we noted large person-to-person differences in the wellbeing of autistic adults during the pandemic.","Scheeren, Howlin, Pellicano, Magiati, Begeer","https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2787","20220805","COVID-19; adults; autism; loneliness; stress; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35672,""
"Healthcare provider experiences during COVID-19 redeployment","Among the myriad traumatic impacts of COVID-19, the need for redeployment served as a significant stressor for healthcare providers (HCPs). This narrative review summarizes the current literature on HCP redeployment experiences and institutional support for staff, while proposing a theoretical approach to mitigating the negative impact on HCP mental health. Redeployment was a strong predictor of negative emotions in HCP during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas reflections on benefit-finding associated with redeployment were reported more frequently during later stages. In institutions where attention to redeployment impact was addressed and effective strategies put in place, redeployed HCP felt they received adequate training and support and felt satisfied with the information provided. Redeployment had the potential to yield personal feelings of accomplishment, situational leadership, meaning, and increased sense of team connectedness. Benefit-finding, or posttraumatic growth, is a concept in cancer psychiatry which speaks to construing benefits from adversity to support resilience. Redeployment experiences can result in unexpected benefit-finding for individual HCPs. Taking a benefit-finding, relational, and existentially informed approach to COVID-19 redeployment might serve as an opportunity for posttraumatic growth for both individuals and institutions.","Schulz-Quach, Lyver, Li","https://doi.org/10.1097/SPC.0000000000000609","20220805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35673,""
"Trends in all-cause mortality and inpatient and outpatient visits for ambulatory care sensitive conditions during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: A population-based study","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) remains unknown. To compare observed and expected (projected based on previous years) trends in all-cause mortality and healthcare use for ACSCs in the first year of the pandemic (March 2020 to March 2021). We conducted a population-based study using provincial health administrative data on general adul population (Ontario, Canada). Monthly all-cause mortality, and hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) and outpatient visit rates (per 100,000 people at-risk) for seven combined ACSCs (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, angina, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and epilepsy) during the first year were compared with similar periods in previous years (2016-2019) by fitting monthly time series autoregressive integrated moving-average models. Compared to previous years, all-cause mortality rates increased at the beginning of the pandemic (observed rate in March to May 2020 of 79.98 vs. projected of 71.24 [66.35-76.50]) and then returned to expected in June 2020-except among immigrants and people with mental health conditions where they remained elevated. Hospitalization and ED visit rates for ACSCs remained lower than projected throughout the first year: observed hospitalization rate of 37.29 versusÃ‚Â projected of 52.07 (47.84-56.68); observed ED visit rate of 92.55 versus projected of 134.72 (124.89-145.33).

"PUBLIC PERCEPTION ABOUT PANDEMIC SITUATION AND PREPAREDNESS TOWARDS A PROBABLE LOCKDOWN IN AN AFFECTED INDIAN STATE AMIDST THE SECOND WAVE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The COVID-19 second wave badly affected India. This study assessed public preparedness and attitude towards a new lockdown in the state of West Bengal (WB) along with perception about the COVID pandemic situation. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to all willing adult attendees of a COVID vaccination centre in Kolkata, capital city of WB. Logistic regression was applied to find the relationship between attitude towards lockdown and other selected independent variables. Of 839 persons analysed, 72.0% were non-health workers; 55.4% thought that available vaccines reduce COVID-19 risk. Among them, 54.4% wanted stricter guidelines for imposition. For preparedness, 42.6% and 28.8% said they would stock additional food and medicines respectively. On multiple logistic regression, being female, having elderly family members, perceiving the second wave as worse and favouring stricter restrictions all had odds of favourable attitude towards the new, proposed lockdown. A new lockdown was favoured by the majority. However, a well-planned and phased approach for this is needed in the light of many concerns about the previous lockdown. Mental health issues, financial security, medical help at hand and ease of travel to workplace are important issues that need to be addressed in case of future lockdown(s).","Gupta, De, Banerjee, Sinha Gupta, Chakraborty","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.190","20220805","India; Lockdown; Preparedness; SARS CoV-2; Second wave; West Bengal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35675,""
"Depressive Symptoms in Mothers With Infants: The Quantitative Evidence of the Association of COVID-19 Crisis-Related Factors in Japan","This study explores the depressive symptoms in postpartum women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Japan. An online survey conducted from May 31 to June 6, 2020 resulted in 3073 responses obtained from mothers with infants &lt; 12 mo. The point prevalence of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 9 was 28.66% for primipara and 25.83% for multipara. Logistic regression analysis indicated a negative association between the COVID-19 crisis and EPDS Ã¢â€°Â¥ 9; specifically, decreased social support and financial concern were identified as risk factors. The COVID-19-related experiences significantly increased the score of each factor of EPDS, ie, anxiety, anhedonia, and depression. During the COVID-19 crisis, the number of mothers who faced depreciation in social support and income had increased. Moreover, spending their perinatal period during the crisis increased the propensity of facing unexpected changes, such as changes of hospitals for delivery, or cancellation of parenting classes. These multiple factors were associated with an elevated risk of depression in postpartum women. In a prolonged crisis, postpartum mental health should be treated carefully with the prevention of infection.","Matsushima, Horiguchi","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.167","20220805","COVID-19; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Japan; postpartum depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35676,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with epilepsy: findings from the US arm of the COV-E study","As part of the COVID-19 and Epilepsy (COV-E) global study, we aimed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the medical care and well-being of people with epilepsy (PWE) in the United States, based on their perspectives and those of their caregivers. Separate surveys designed for PWE and their caregivers were circulated from April 2020 to July 2021; modifications in March 2021 included a question about COVID-19 vaccination status. We received 788 responses, 71% from PWE (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 559) and 29% (n=229) from caregivers of persons with epilepsy. A third (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 308) of respondents reported a change in their health or in the health of the person they care for. Twenty-seven percent (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 210) reported issues related to worsening mental health. Of respondents taking ASMs (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 769), 10% (n=Ã¢â‚¬â€°78) reported difficulty taking medications on time, mostly due to stress causing forgetfulness. Less than half of respondents received counseling on mental health and stress. Less than half of the PWE reported having discussions with their healthcare providers about sleep, ASMs and potential side effects, while a larger proportion of caregivers (81%) reported having had discussions with their healthcare providers on the same topics. More PWE and caregivers reported that COVID-19 related measures caused adverse impact on their health in the post-vaccine period than during the pre-vaccine period, citing mental health issues as the primary reason. Our findings indicate that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US on PWE is multifaceted. Apart from the increased risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes, the pandemic has also had negative effects on mental health and self-management. Healthcare providers must be vigilant for increased emotional distress in PWE during the pandemic and consider the importance of effective counseling to diminish risks related to exacerbated treatment gaps.","Dugan, Carroll, Thorpe, Jette, Agarwal, Ashby, Hanna, French, Devinsky, Sen","https://doi.org/10.1002/epi4.12637","20220805","COVID; Coronavirus; chronic illness; epilepsy risk; mental health; seizures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35677,""
"Kihon Checklist items associated with the development of frailty and recovery to robust status during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Kihon Checklist (KCL) is used to assess frailty in daily life. We aimed to identify KCL items associated with the development of frailty and recovery to robust status during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a 1-year prospective cohort study of community-dwelling adults aged 70 and 75Ã¢â‚¬â€°years in Otawara City, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. Information regarding age, sex, presence of disease and KCL items was collected in May 2020 (baseline) and June 2021 (follow-up) using a mailed questionnaire. Changes in frailty status as determined by the KCL at baseline and follow-up were evaluated. To clarify factors related to changes in the frailty status, we conducted two sets of binomial logistic regression analyses with the presence/absence of development of frailty and presence/absence of recovery to robust status at follow-up as the dependent variables and the KCL items as the independent variables. The analysis included 716 participants who provided complete responses to both questionnaires. The KCL Items 6, 10, 20, 23 and 24 were related to the development of frailty, and the KCL Items 6, 15, 21 and 23 were associated with the recovery to robust status. The baseline KCL items regarding physical function and associated mental aspects were related to both development of frailty and recovery to robust status during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cognitive and depressive declines were associated with the development of frailty, while good oral environment and sense of fulfillment in life were associated with the recovery to robust status.

"Quality and quantity of serious violent suicide attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic","While repeated shutdown and lockdown measures helped contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and self-isolation negatively impacted global mental health in 2020 and 2021. Although suicide rates did reportedly not increase during the first months of the pandemic, long-term data, and data on the quality of serious violent suicide attempts (SVSAs) are not available to date. Orthopaedic trauma patient visits to the emergency department (ED), ED trauma team activations, and SVSAs were retrospectively evaluated from January 2019 until May 2021 in four Level-I Trauma Centers in Berlin, Germany. SVSAs were assessed for suicide method, injury pattern and severity, type of treatment, and length of hospital stay. Significantly fewer orthopaedic trauma patients presented to EDs during the pandemic (<i>n</i> = 70,271) compared to the control (<i>n</i> = 84,864) period (<i>p</i> = 0.0017).

"Mental health in individuals with self-reported psychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: Baseline data from a swedish longitudinal cohort study","Individuals with psychiatric disorders may be both vulnerable and sensitive to rapid societal changes that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. To fully understand these impacts, repeated measurements of these individuals are warranted. The current longitudinal study set out to perform monthly assessment of individuals with common psychiatric disorders using established questionnaires with a possibility for them to self- rate their symptoms, over time. Recruitment of individuals who identified themselves as struggling with mental health problems, living in Sweden between July 2020 and June 2021 using an online survey. The individuals answered questions on demographics, psychiatric history, current psychiatric symptoms (e.g., Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9; General Anxiety Disorder, GAD-7), somatic health, health-care contacts and any changes therein during the pandemic. Monthly, longitudinal assessments are still ongoing (consenting participants provide data for 1 year), and here we present descriptive statistics from the baseline measurement. All measurements from baseline (&gt;400 items), and follow-ups are presented in detail. A total of 6.095 participants (average age 35 years) submitted complete baseline data. Marital status (43% single) and number of years of education (48% highest degree being high school) were evenly distributed in this population. The most common lifetime psychiatric disorder in the sample was depressive disorder (80.5%) and generalized anxiety disorder (45.9%), with a substantial proportion having severe symptoms of depression. (30.5%) and anxiety (37.1%). Lifetime suicidal ideation (75.0%) and non-suicidal self-harm (57.7%) were prevalent in the group and 14.5% reported drug use during the pandemic. Allergies (36.8%) were the most common somatic condition, followed by irritable bowel syndrome (18.7%). For those having experienced a traumatic event, 39% showed symptoms during the pandemic indicating PTSD. Regarding contact with mental health services during the pandemic, 22% had established a new contact, and 20% reported to have increased their psychiatric medication compared to before the pandemic. Baseline data collected during the pandemic from individuals in Sweden with pre-existing psychiatric disorders demonstrate that this sample represents a population suitable for an investigation on the long-term impact of the pandemic, as intended by the longitudinal investigation that is ongoing.

"Prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Status Among Healthcare Workers and Its Impact on Their Mental Health During the Crisis of COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study","After the unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the health status of the general population has suffered a huge threat, and the mental health of front-line healthcare providers has also encountered great challenges. Therefore, this study aims to: (1) investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among healthcare providers, and (2) verify the moderating role of self-efficacy in the influence of PTSD on mental health. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey of 1993 participants. The presence of depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, and PTSD was evaluated using screening tests from March 1. Sociodemographic and COVID-19-related data were also collected. A data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression. The prevalence of PTSD among healthcare providers was 9.3%. PTSD was negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r = -0.265, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), anxiety (r = -0.453, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), and depression (r = 0.708, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). Profession, daily working hours, maximum continuous working days, and daily sleep time were influencing factors of PTSD. A binary logistic regression analysis showed that physicians (OR = 2.254, 95% CI = 1.298, 3.914) and nurses (OR = 2.176, 95% CI = 1.337, 3.541) were more likely to experience PTSD than other healthcare providers. Self-efficacy has a moderating effect on the influence of PTSD on anxiety and depression. This suggests that health managers need to respond to the current psychological crisis of healthcare providers, implement appropriate psychological interventions, and minimize the psychological harm caused by COVID-19.","Yang, Liu, Liu, Ou, Wang, Ma, Fan, Shi, Shi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.904550","20220805","COVID-19; PTSD; healthcare providers; mental health; self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35681,""

"Boredom belief moderates the mental health impact of boredom among young people: Correlational and multi-wave longitudinal evidence gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic","Young people's experience of boredom and its psychological health sequelae have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study examined the moderating role of boredom beliefs-the extent to which one affectively dislikes boredom (boredom dislike) and cognitively accepts it (boredom normalcy)-on the association between boredom experience and mental well-being. We also validated a new measure of boredom beliefs in two different samples of young people. We report data from a correlational study with British young people aged 12-25 (Study 1; N =Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,495) and a 16-week eight-wave within-subject study with Israeli adolescents aged 12-18 (Study 2; N =Ã¢â‚¬â€°314). Across both studies, disliking boredom was associated with higher frequency and intensity of boredom. Boredom dislike moderated the negative association between boredom and mental well-being, such that the association was more salient among those who strongly disliked boredom. Normalizing boredom was positively associated with mental well-being. The measure of boredom beliefs demonstrated fair validity and reliability. Results provide novel insights into the potential buffering effect of boredom beliefs against the mental health impact of boredom, particularly at a time of reduced activity. These findings generalize across two different countries.","Tam, Chan, van Tilburg, Lavi, Lau","https://doi.org/10.1111/jopy.12764","20220805","COVID-19; adolescents; boredom; emotion beliefs; mental well-being; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35683,""
"Individual changes in stress, depression, anxiety, pathological worry, posttraumatic stress, and health anxiety from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults from Southeastern Germany","Many studies have previously compared the prevalence or sample means of distress and mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, while results on changes at the individual-level, and regarding multiple outcome measures are demanded. This online study investigated individual changes in stress and mental health from before the COVID-19 pandemic to the first lockdown in adults from Southeastern Germany. This region was selected as it was where SARS-CoV-2 was first documented in Germany, and also due to the implementation of strict stay-at-home orders and social contact prohibitions. From April 10-27, 2020, we collected state measures and their clinical relevance for the subareas of perceived stress: worries, tension, joy, and demands. We also collected information regarding the following mental health problems: depression, anxiety, pathological worry, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and health anxiety; as well as retrospective measures of how participants felt they have changed in comparison to before the pandemic, ranging from worse to better. The analytical sample comprised 396 adult participants. On average, participants experienced increases in worries, tension, and lack of joy, and increases in mental health problems, but a decrease in demands. Perceived increases in symptoms of depression (26.0%) and PTSD (25.5%) were significantly more frequent than in symptoms of anxiety (particularly acute fear and panic) (5.6%), pathological worry (9.8%), and health anxiety (7.3%) (ps&lt;.001). One per 10 participants (10.4%) reported an increase in depressive symptoms, and nearly two per 10 (18.4%) an increase in PTSD symptoms and additionally showed a clinically relevant symptom strain during lockdown. Interestingly, mainly non-specific PTSD symptoms associated with a general stress reaction were experienced to be increased. The findings suggest a dissociation of perceived changes in subareas of stress and mental health with a particular experience of increases in depressive and general stress symptoms and a decrease in external demands. This points to a need for a more differentiated view on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress and mental health, and for targeted interventions for mental health problems arising frequently during the pandemic.","Wechsler, Schmidmeier, Biehl, Gerczuk, Guerrero-Cerda, MÃƒÂ¼hlberger","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04148-y","20220804","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Generalized anxiety; Health anxiety; Mental health; Panic disorder; Pathological worry; Posttraumatic stress; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35684,""
"Analysis of the uptake and associated factors for virtual crisis care during the pandemic at a 24-h mental health crisis centre in Manitoba, Canada","The coronavirus pandemic necessitated the rapid transition to virtual care. At a 24-h walk-in mental health Crisis Response Centre (CRC) in Winnipeg, Canada we adapted crisis mental health assessments to be offered virtually while the crisis centre also remained open to in person visits. Little is known about the sustainability of virtual visits in the presence of comparable in person care, and which visits are more likely to be done virtually, particularly in the crisis setting. An analysis of visits to the CRC from the first local lockdown on March 19, 2020 through the third local wave with heightened public health restrictions in June 2021. Analysis of Variance was used to compare the proportion of visits occurring virtually (telephone or videoconference) during the first wave of heightened public health restrictions (lockdown 1) and subsequent lockdowns as well as the in-between periods. A binary logistic regression examined visit, sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with receipt of a virtual visit compared to an in person visit over the first year of the pandemic. Out of 5,357 visits, 993 (18.5%) occurred virtually. There was a significant difference in proportion of virtualÃ‚Â visits across the pandemic time periods (F(4, 62)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.56, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The proportion of visits occurring virtually was highest during lockdown 1 (mean 32.6% by week), with no differences between the other time periods. Receipt of a virtual visit was significantly associated with daytime weekday visits, age, non-male gender, living further away from the CRC, no prior year contact with the CRC, and visits that did not feature suicidal behaviour, substance use, psychosis or cognitive impairment. A large proportion of virtual care occurring at the outset of the pandemic reflects public anxiety and care avoidance paired with health system rapid transformation. The use of virtual visits reduced over subsequent pandemic periods but was sustained at a meaningful level. Specific visit, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics are more likely to be present in visits occurring virtually compared to those in person. These results can help to inform the future planning and delivery of virtual crisis care.","Vakil, Svenne, Bolton, Jiang, Svenne, Hensel","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04166-w","20220804","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Crisis care; Mental health; Virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35685,""
"Measuring the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on DinÃƒÂ© and White Mountain Apache school personnel, families, and students: protocol for a prospective longitudinal cohort study","This paper describes the protocol for a longitudinal cohort study, ""Project SafeSchools"" (PSS), which focuses on measuring the effects of COVID-19 and the return to in-person learning on DinÃƒÂ© (Navajo) and White Mountain Apache (Apache) youth, parents, and educators. The early surges of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure of most reservation and border town schools serving DinÃƒÂ© and Apache communities. This study aims to: (1) understand the barriers and facilitators to school re-opening and in-person school attendance from the perspective of multiple stakeholders in DinÃƒÂ© and Apache communities; and (2) evaluate the educational, social, emotional, physical, and mental health impacts of returning to in-person learning for caregivers and youth ages 4-16 who reside or work on the DinÃƒÂ© Nation and the White Mountain Apache Tribal lands. We aim to recruit up to NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 200 primary caregivers of DinÃƒÂ© and Apache youth ages 4-16 and up to NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 120 school personnel. In addition, up to nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 120 of these primary caregivers and their children, ages 11-16, will be selected to participate in qualitative interviews to learn more about the effects of the pandemic on their health and wellbeing. Data from caregiver and school personnel participants will be collected in three waves via self-report surveys that measure COVID-19 related behaviors and attitudes, mental health, educational attitudes, and cultural practices and beliefs for both themselves and their child (caregiver participants only). We hypothesize that an individual's engagement with a variety of cultural activities during school closures and as school re-opened will have a protective effect on adult and youth mental health as they return to in-person learning. The results of this study will inform the development or implementation of preventative interventions that may help DinÃƒÂ© and Apache youth and their families recover from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and positively impact their health and wellness.","Allison-Burbank, Ingalls, Rebman, Chambers, Begay, Grass, Tsosie, Archuleta, Barlow, Larzelere, Hammitt, Tingey, Haroz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13208-7","20220804","American Indian; COVID-19; Educational attitudes; Health and wellness; In-person learning; Mental health; Schools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35686,""
"Active and avoidant coping profiles in children and their relationship with anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic","Active and avoidant coping styles are important dispositional factors in the development of anxiety and depression symptoms. Children use both active and avoidant coping strategies together in daily life. No studies have investigated the relationship between active-avoidant coping profiles and internalizing symptoms in children. The present study aimed to investigate children's active-avoidant coping profiles and assess the relationship that active-avoidant coping profiles have with anxiety and depression symptoms. A two-wave longitudinal study was conducted among 322 Chinese children in the People's Republic of China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed the Children's Coping Strategies Checklist-Revised 1 at Time 1 and the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale at Time 1 and 6Ã‚Â months later (Time 2). Four active-avoidant coping profiles were revealed: low active copers, high active copers, balanced copers, and avoidant copers. Low and high active copers had lower levels of anxiety and depression symptoms than balanced copers and avoidant copers. Avoidant copers showed a larger decrease in depression symptoms than balanced copers and high active copers during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to improve children's active-avoidant coping profiles to relieve anxiety and depression symptoms.","Zhang, Zhou, Ho","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15793-4","20220804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35687,""
"Olfactory impairment in psychiatric disorders: Does nasal inflammation impact disease psychophysiology?","Olfactory impairments contribute to the psychopathology of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. Recent neuroscience research has shed light on the previously underappreciated olfactory neural circuits involved in regulation of higher brain functions. Although environmental factors such as air pollutants and respiratory viral infections are known to contribute to the risk for psychiatric disorders, the role of nasal inflammation in neurobehavioral outcomes and disease pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Here, we will first provide an overview of published findings on the impact of nasal inflammation in the olfactory system. We will then summarize clinical studies on olfactory impairments in schizophrenia and depression, followed by preclinical evidence on the neurobehavioral outcomes produced by olfactory dysfunction. Lastly, we will discuss the potential impact of nasal inflammation on brain development and function, as well as how we can address the role of nasal inflammation in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. Considering the current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which often causes nasal inflammation and serious adverse effects for olfactory function that might result in long-lasting neuropsychiatric sequelae, this line of research is particularly critical to understanding of the potential significance of nasal inflammation in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.","Hasegawa, Ma, Sawa, Lane, Kamiya","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02081-y","20220804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35688,""
"A fast online questionnaire for screening mental illness symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive effects on the situation of public mental health. A fast online questionnaire for screening and evaluating mental symptoms is urgent. In this work, we developed a new 19-item self-assessment Fast Screen Questionnaire for Mental Illness Symptoms (FSQ-MIS) to quickly identify mental illness symptoms. The FSQ-MIS was validated on a total of 3828 young adult mental disorder patients and 984 healthy controls. We applied principal component analysis (PCA), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and general log-linear analysis (GLA) to evaluate the construct and parallel validity. Results demonstrate that the proposed FSQ-MIS shows high test-retest reliability (0.852) and split-half reliability (0.844). Six factors obtained using PCA explained 54.3% of the variance and showed high correlations with other widely used scales. The ROC results (0.716-0.983) revealed high criterion validity of FSQ-MIS. GLA demonstrated the advantage of FSQ-MIS in predicting anxiety and depression prevalence in COVID-19, supporting the efficiency of FSQ-MIS as a tool for research and clinical practice.","Chen, Yan, Calhoun, Yu, Chen, Hao, Zheng","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02086-7","20220804","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35689,""
"Stress and mental health in adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis one year after the COVID pandemic: Findings from an Italian sample","The spread of COVID-19 was associated with increased stress and new mental health concerns for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), already at increased risk for depression and anxiety. This study assessed stress and mental health in adolescents and young adults with CF one year from when the pandemic began. Sixty-six pwCF (mean age=24; range 14-36) completed a new measure of the impact of COVID-19 (COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Scale-Adolescence and Young Adult; CEFIS-AYA); the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. The Italian translation of the CEFIS-AYA was performed. On the CEFIS-AYA, the mean Exposure score was 5.2 (SD=2.6) out of 28. The mean Impact score was 1.8 (SD=0.7; negative valence &gt;2.5). Individuals were more sedentary and undertaking less exercise. Average stress rating was 5.9 (SD=2), indicating moderate stress. No significant differences were found between those who did (N=12) vs did not have a COVID infection (N=54). A high percentage of participants scored above the clinical cut-off for depression (45%) and anxiety (41%), with a low proportion reporting moderate-severe symptomatology. After one-year, the pandemic was having a less significant impact on patients' daily lives. Sedentary activity and reduced exercise were common. Despite expectations that this group was particularly vulnerable, depression and anxiety scores were similar to the rates described for this population prior to the pandemic. Overall, these results suggested that pwCF are highly resilient and nearly one year after the onset of COVID-19, have returned to similar daily activities and emotional health.

"Clinical practice guidelines and expert consensus statements on rehabilitation for patients with COVID-19: protocol for a systematic review","COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease, characterised by respiratory, physical and psychological dysfunctions. Rehabilitation could effectively alleviate the symptoms and promote recovery of the physical and mental health of patients with COVID-19. Recently, rehabilitation medical institutions have issued clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and expert consensus statements involving recommendations for rehabilitation assessments and rehabilitation therapies for COVID-19. This systematic review aims to assess the methodological quality and reporting quality of the guidance documents, evaluate the heterogeneity of the recommendations and summarise the recommendations with respect to rehabilitation assessments and rehabilitation therapies for COVID-19 to provide a quick reference for front-line clinicians, therapists and patients as well as reasonable suggestions for future guidelines. The electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), Wanfang Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and websites of governments or organisations (eg, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Guidelines International Network, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and WHO) will be searched for eligible CPGs and expert consensus statements from inception to August 2022. CPGs and expert consensus statements published in Chinese or English and presenting recommendations for modern functional rehabilitation techniques and/or traditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation techniques for COVID-19 will be included. Reviews, interpretations, old versions of CPGs and expert consensus statements and those for the management of other diseases during the pandemic will be excluded. Two reviewers will independently review each article, extract data, appraise the methodological quality following the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research &amp; Evaluation II tool and assess the reporting quality with the Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare statement. The Measurement Scale of Rate of Agreement will be used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the recommendations in different CPGs and expert consensus statements. Agreement between reviewers will be calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient. We will also summarise the recommendations for rehabilitation in patients with COVID-19. The results will be narratively described and presented as tables or figures. Ethics approval is not needed for this systematic review because information from published documents will be used. The findings will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

"Anxiolytic effect of Anthemis nobilis L (roman chamomile) and Citrus reticulata Blanco (tangerine) essential oils using the light-dark test in zebrafish (Danio rerio)","The anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health condition, and anxiety is considered the sixth cause of disability surpassing diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis. Besides, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an increase in the number of psychiatric diseases diagnosis in all social layers around the world. About 55%-94% of patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders are treated with benzodiazepines, meanwhile benzodiazepines can promote several adverse effects. In this way, alternative therapies, such as essential oils may offer significant benefits in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders. However, the anxiolytic effect of these essential oils must be proper evaluated appropriate as well as the suitable dosage and side effect need further research. The aim was to evaluate the anxiolytic effect of Roman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis L.) and tangerine (Citrus reticulata Blanco) essential oils using the light-dark test in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). Both essential oils were analyzed by GC-MS and the major compounds were identified. The anxiolytic effect was evaluated by light-dark test in adult zebrafish. The results showed that roman chamomile essential oil has anxiolytic effect in adult zebrafish, whereas tangerine essential oil tends to reduce anxiety The major compounds of tangerine essential oil were limonene and ÃŽÂ³-terpinene, and the major compounds of roman chamomile were pentadecyl-3-methyl-2-butenoate, hexadecyl-3-methyl-2-butenoate, 1-piperidinol and trans-1-ethyl-3-methyl-cyclopentane. The present study demonstrated that this anxiolytic effect may be attributed to the synergistic effect of the compounds present in roman chamomile essential oil, particularly the major compounds. The roman chamomile essential oil at the highest concentration showed anxiolytic effect. The tangerine essential oil showed a tendency to reduce anxiety, but it was not statistically significative. In addition, roman chamomile and tangerine essential oils did not cause cause alteration in locomotion activity and exploratory ability of the fish.","Silveira, Santos Rubio, Poleti Martucci","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2022.115580","20220804","Anxiolytic; Essential oil; GC-MS; Light-dark test; Terpenes; Zebrafish","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35692,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 on university students in China and Africa","The COVID-19 pandemic is alarmingly a global health catastrophe that has created an unprecedented mental health decline especially in young adults, who have been noted to be a vulnerable population. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety in university students in China and Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic, the significant factors contributing to the prevalence of anxiety and depression, the differences in factors affecting the different groups being investigated and to emphasize that psychological intervention are as important as the physical interventions during and after the pandemic. The study was conducted through online surveys, with 684 participants using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 standardized scales. Comparing all groups combined, of the 636 participants, 361 (56.8%) had depression and 227 (35.7%) had anxiety. Chi squared tests at significance level (P&lt;0.05) showed that country of citizenship, religion, parents' educational background, household monthly income and, having family members with COVID-19 variables were strongly associated with depression and anxiety. In contrast, age, gender, educational background, and major showed no significant association. Comparing the individual groups separately using chi square (P&lt;0.05), the Chinese students in China group had 35.6% with depression and 13.1% with anxiety. The variable associated with both depression and anxiety was education major, with depression only was parent's educational background and with anxiety only was gender. The African students in China group had 70.3% with depression and 45.0% with anxiety. Gender was strongly associated with both depression and anxiety, and religion and having family members with COVID-19 with anxiety only. Africans in Africa had 66.0% with depression and 50.5% with anxiety. Educational background was strongly associated with depression. There was no statistically significant variable for anxiety. Chi square test showed a statistically significant difference in depression and anxiety levels with the Chinese group compared to both African groups, and no significant difference between both African groups. Our findings demonstrated that COVID-19 had a negative psychological impact on university students. Therefore, more attention should be put on youth's mental health during this pandemic.","Marahwa, Makota, Chikomo, Chakanyuka, Ruvai, Osafo, Huang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270824","20220805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35693,""
"Burnout following moral injury and dehumanization: A study of distress among Italian medical staff during the first COVID-19 pandemic period","Italy was the first country outside Asia to deal with the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and health care facilities and medical staff were not fully prepared. Research worldwide has documented the enormous effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care providers' mental health, including experiences of dehumanization, but less work has focused on factors which may influence the development of these outcomes in response to COVID-19-related stress. This study examined the association of dehumanization, self-efficacy, and alienation to burnout, depression, and PTSD among medical staff. Potential moderators included moral injury, professional role, COVID workload, and work in a critical care unit (CCU). Participants were recruited through the Internet. The sample consisted of 270 medical staff members who completed a self-report survey online. Instruments included: Human Traits Attribution Scale for dehumanization; NYP-Queens Survey-Self-Efficacy Subscale for self-efficacy; Moral Injury Events Scale for moral injury; Alienation Scale for alienation; PTSD-8 for posttraumatic stress disorder; Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression; and a single item for burnout. The analytic plan included ANOVAs, zero-order correlations, logistic regression analyses, multiple linear regression models, and parallel mediation. Results show that dehumanization was associated with higher levels of burnout, PTSD, and depressive symptoms and effects were consistent across professional role and work context. Dehumanization was significantly associated with PTSD symptoms only among those who had increased COVID-19-related caseloads. Moral injury was positively associated with dehumanization, displayed an independent association with all 3 mental health outcomes, over and above dehumanization, and tended to exacerbate the effects of dehumanization. The effect sizes across analyses were small to medium. This research confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic stressed Italian medical staff in a way not documented in the prepandemic literature. There is a need to support staff in their complex relationships and communication with patients.

We administered online self-report surveys to emergency responders (<i>N</i> = 473) and hospital personnel (<i>N</i> = 854) in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States between April and June of 2020. Surveys assessed frequency and intensity of exposure to PMIEs alongside psychological and functional outcomes. Between 20% and 30% of frontline workers reported exposure to PMIEs of at least moderate frequency and intensity. Exposure to more intense PMIEs was associated with greater psychological symptoms (i.e., stress, depression, and anxiety) and functional impairment (i.e., professional burnout), especially among emergency responders who reported frequent exposure but also hospital workers who reported few exposures. Efforts to facilitate and maintain the well-being of the public health workforce should specifically address critical incidents encountered by frontline workers that have embedded moral and ethical challenges.

"Posttraumatic growth as a moderator between pandemic-related distress and mental health symptoms in US young adults","Compared to other age groups, young adults are at risk of suffering COVID-19 pandemic-related psychological problems. Prior research suggests that such adverse events (like the pandemic) can initiate adaptive psychological changes, referred to as posttraumatic growth (PTG); however, limited studies have examined the moderating role of PTG among young adults in the United States with regard to COVID-19-related distress. Thus, this study examines whether pandemic-related distress has a differential effect on young adults' mental health symptoms based on varying levels of PTG. Using the data from 661 participants who completed all three waves of the CARES study (TÃ¢â€šÂ: April-August 2020; TÃ¢â€šâ€š: September 2020-March 2021; TÃ¢â€šÆ’: April-May 2021), a moderator analysis was performed using the PROCESS Macro to determine the moderating effect of PTG. In our data, higher levels of PTG buffered the effects of pandemic-related distress from 2020 on depressive symptoms in 2021; PTG did not show a moderating effect with anxiety as an outcome. Understanding the moderating role of PTG would help to further understand the mental health trajectories of young adults in the United States who are particularly distressed by the pandemic. Our findings suggest the importance of further exploring contributors to PTG for young adults, particularly among those who have experienced high levels of pandemic-related distress to date.

"A model of collaborative immigration advocacy to prevent policy-based trauma and harm","Research suggests that antiimmigrant policies enacted in the United States, magnified during the 2016-2020 period, propagate widespread trauma across communities of immigrants (von Werthern et al., 2018). While these policies harm all groups of immigrants, structural conditions (e.g., lack of documentation status, race, ethnicity, country of origin, and other social and legal determinants) shape how they are experienced. To address the widespread traumatic harm inflicted by racist and xenophobic policies, a group of leaders from eight Divisions of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Latinx Psychological Association (NLPA) launched an Interdivisional Immigration Project (IIP). The IIP served to develop a model for collaborative advocacy, bringing together mental health providers (i.e., psychologists, social workers), allied professionals, and immigration activists from community organizations across the country. This model was developed over the course of 1 year, coinciding with the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the amplified movement for racial justice. This article describes the key components of the IIP collaborative advocacy model: (a) structuring leadership in a democratic and egalitarian manner, (b) centering and uplifting immigrant voices, (c) forming teams across five U.S. regions, (d) facilitating critical dialogues grounded in liberatory practices, (e) centering trauma and empowerment, and (f) developing advocacy strategies. The IIP collaborative advocacy model is informing advocacy to protect immigrants from harm. This model may be used as the basis for ongoing humane immigration policy activism that centers the voices of community activists, and that pushes psychologists and allied professionals to use their positionality to support community-based efforts.

"Adding fuel to the fire? Examining exposure to potentially stressful or traumatic events before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income, Black families","The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the lives of many individuals. While emerging evidence has begun to document health (e.g., infection) and financial (e.g., job loss) consequences, less is known about the day-to-day experiences of some of the country's most vulnerable populations. The current study sought to address this gap in understanding by examining exposure to potentially stressful or traumatic experiences (PSTEs) and their relation to mental health among predominately low-income, African American/Black individuals. Adult caregivers (<i>N</i> = 110) from an ongoing longitudinal research project occurring prior the pandemic completed surveys about their exposure to COVID-19-specific PSTEs during the initial months of the pandemic. Information on participants was combined with pre-COVID-19 PSTE exposure and examined in relation to current mental health functioning (e.g., depression). Findings indicated that participants experienced several different types of COVID-19-specific PSTEs across multiple domains, including home, work, social life, and health and well-being. Results from model testing indicated that COVID-19-specific PSTEs were only associated with worry about COVID-19-specifically. Adulthood PSTEs prior to COVID-19 were also associated with current anxiety symptoms. Among low-income, African American/Black individuals with a history of exposure to PSTEs, additional PSTEs experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic may not contribute significantly to general mental health functioning above and beyond pre-COVID-19 PSTE exposures.

"Short-term psychological outcomes of Australia's 2019/20 bushfire season","We investigated how Australian community members (N = 318) indirectly and/or directly exposed to Australia's 2019/20 bushfire season differed in terms of psychological distress, posttraumatic growth, coping, physical health, and COVID-19 anxiety. This was a cross-sectional study with a nonequivalent groups design. Participants were over 18 years old, English proficient, and Australian permanent residents or citizens living in Australia at some point between June 2019 and February 2020. Participants completed a 10-minute anonymous online survey 5 to 8 weeks following the bushfires. A descriptive discriminant analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between bushfire exposure groups when considering our dependent variables of interest simultaneously and adjusting for prior mental health assistance and prior exposure to natural disasters: <i>F</i>(10, 624) = 2.83, <i>p</i> = .002; <i>V</i> = .087, partial ÃŽÂ·Ã‚Â² = .043. The group centroid for the indirect-only exposure group (-.374) was substantially lower than that for the other 2 groups (direct only: .137; direct + indirect: .224), indicating that the indirect-only exposure group could be differentiated by the fact that they more frequently reported avoidant coping strategies and endorsed lower posttraumatic growth scores than the direct-only and direct + indirect exposure groups. The variance accounted for by these discriminant variables was 8.4%, indicating a very small effect. Our results point to a need to tailor and/or expand disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts such that they might benefit community members both directly and indirectly exposed to bushfire events in Australia.

"Distortions in time perception during collective trauma: Insights from a national longitudinal study during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the protracted collective trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic, lay of distorted perceptions of time (e.g., time slowing, days blurring together, uncertainty about the future) have been widespread. Known as ""temporal disintegration"" in psychiatric literature, these distortions are associated with negative mental health consequences. However, the prevalence and predictors of temporal disintegration are poorly understood. We examined perceptions of time passing and their associations with lifetime stress and trauma and pandemic-related secondary stress as COVID-19 spread across the United States. A probability-based national sample (<i>N</i> = 5,661) from the NORC AmeriSpeak online panel, which had completed a mental and physical health survey prior to the pandemic, completed two surveys online during March 18-April 18, 2020, and September 26-October 16, 2020. Distorted time perceptions and other pandemic-related experiences were assessed. Present focus, blurring weekdays and weekdays together, and uncertainty about the future were common experiences reported by over 65% of the sample 6 months into the pandemic. Half of the sample reported time speeding up or slowing down. Predictors of temporal disintegration include prepandemic mental health diagnoses, daily pandemic-related media exposure and secondary stress (e.g., school closures, lockdown), financial stress, and lifetime stress and trauma exposure. During the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, distortions in time perception were very common and associated with prepandemic mental health, lifetime stress and trauma exposure, and pandemic-related media exposure and stressors. Given that temporal disintegration is a risk factor for mental health challenges, these findings have potential implications for public mental health.

"Knowledge, Attitude, Practices, and Vaccine Hesitancy Among the Latinx Community in Southern California Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey","The Latinx population in the United States has experienced high rates of infection, hospitalization, and death since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is little data on the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) specifically in Latinx communities in the United States. We aimed to assess COVID-19 KAP and vaccine hesitancy among a Latinx cohort in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (from July 2020 to October 2020), at a unique time when a vaccine was not available. Participants aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years were recruited at a primary care clinic in Southern California and asked to self-report sociodemographic characteristics, KAP, and vaccine hesitancy. A subset of the participants answered the vaccine hesitancy assessment as it was added after the start of data collection. KAP items were summed to create composite scores, with higher scores reflecting increased COVID-19 knowledge, positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, and disease prevention practices. Bivariate and multivariable regression models were fitted to test associations between sociodemographic characteristics and KAP scores. For our analysis, we only included patients who self-identified as Latinx. Our final data set included 265 participants. The participants had a mean age of 49 (IQR 38.5-59) years, and 72.1% (n=191) were female, 77% (n=204) had at most a high school degree, 34.7% (n=92) had an annual income &lt;US $25,000, and 11.7% (n=31) had previously tested positive for COVID-19. We found high knowledge regarding transmission and spread; moderate knowledge regarding symptoms awareness; overall negative attitudes, which included high pessimism in government public health efforts and high amounts of fear, anxiety, and frustration due to COVID-19 pandemic; and moderate participation in preventive practices. A college education was positively associated with a higher knowledge score than those without a college education (ÃŽÂ²=0.14, 95% CI 0.01-1.60; P=.04) when adjusted for covariates. Male gender had a positive association with COVID-19 attitude scores compared to female gender (ÃŽÂ²=1.61, 95% CI 0.50-2.72; P=.05), and male gender was negatively associated with the COVID-19 practices score compared to female gender (ÃŽÂ²=-0.16, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.06; P=.03), when both were adjusted for covariates. Among a subset of 203 patients, 26.6% (n=54) indicated that if the vaccine was available, they would not take a COVID-19 vaccine, and 18.7% (n=38) were unsure. Good knowledge and preventative practices in the population may have reflected effective public health messaging and the implementation of public health laws during the first wave of the pandemic; however, the overall fear and anxiety may have reflected the negative impact that the pandemic had on vulnerable populations such as the Latinx community. Although our data are a reflection of a previous time in the pandemic, we believe it captures a critical time that can be used to provide unique insights regarding potential avenues to better protect the Latinx communities against future vaccine-resistant COVID-19 strains.

"Feeding practices in public hospitals' neonatal intensive care units: An exploration into the ways in which COVID-19 affected the best practice in Gauteng","Ã‚Â South Africa's healthcare system has a multitude of pre-existing challenges prior to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, ranging from reduced number of staff, lack of resources and units being at overcapacity both in the adult and paediatric populations. The neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) require a team approach to ensure best practice with vulnerable infants, but little is known about how the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown restrictions impacted the feeding practices within the NICU. Ã‚Â This study aimed to explore the impact that COVID-19 had on the feeding practices within the NICU settings in public hospitals in Gauteng. Ã‚Â A qualitative design was employed with data collected in two NICUs in Gauteng. Data were collected in the form of observations and semi-structured interviews with healthcare workers (HCWs) in the NICU. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Ã‚Â Although the sample size of participants was limited, social distancing proved to be a challenge resulting in mothers and healthcare workers being given restricted access. This had effects on the ability to provide adequate feeding practices and resulted in anxiety for the mothers and mental health challenges for the HCWs when feeding these at-risk infants. A limitation of this study was the use of only two sites. Ã‚Â COVID-19 amplified the existing challenges in the NICU. A multidisciplinary and family-centred approach to address feeding challenges is required to offset the challenges resulting from the pandemic and subsequent lockdown.","Coutts, Neille, Louw","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajcd.v69i2.921","20220805","COVID-19; Gauteng; NICU; feeding practices; speech-language pathologists; Adult; COVID-19; Child; Communicable Disease Control; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Pandemics; South Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35702,""

"Did States With More Social Capital Pre-pandemic Offer Mental Health Protection During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Cross-Sectional View","Social capital is a well-known health determinant with both relational and geographic aspects. It can help mitigate adverse events and has been shown to impact behaviors and responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, and social capital, may serve to buffer those declines. Building from this, we assessed whether pre-pandemic social capital and contemporaneous social policy, which included indicators of social trust, civic participation, and presence of mask mandates, affected pandemic mental health, measured as the percent of the population experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety at the state level. Generalized social trust and state mask mandates were significantly associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety. Conversely, states with greater civic engagement prior to the pandemic experienced more anxiety and depression. Findings suggest that existing social capital, particularly social trust, may protect against anxiety and depression and contribute to community resilience during times of adversity. States should invest in policies and programs that increase social trust.","Dauner, Wilmot","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.947569","20220805","COVID-19; mental health; place-affect; social capital; states (of the U.S.); COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Social Capital; Social Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35704,""
"Psychometric properties of the survey work-home interaction nijmegen in Argentinian population","Frictions between work and family life have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, causing negative consequences on the mental health and quality of life of workers. Without validated instruments, it is not possible to determine the impact of Work-Family and Family-Work conflict. To date, no studies have been conducted to provide evidence of the validity and reliability of The Survey Work-Home Interaction Nijmegen (SWING; 22 items) in the population of Argentine workers. The SWING was administered to 611 Argentine workers of both sexes (73.6% female) aged between 18 and 70Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°35.33; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.16) selected from a non-probabilistic accidental sampling.

"The Impact of Psychological Capital and Social Capital on Residents' Mental Health and Happiness During COVID-19: Evidence From China","This paper studies the mediating and interactive effects of social capital on psychological capital and the feeling of happiness from the impact of COVID-19. Since its emergence, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on people's mental health and affected their hopes for the future. Lifestyle and economic conditions have also been affected and have subsequently impacted people's sense of confidence in life. This could increase the likelihood of many people developing mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression. Therefore, it is vital to study the influence of psychological capital and social capital on people's subjective psychology and happiness experiences. Using an ordered probit model, this paper studied the independent influence and interaction between psychological capital and social capital on people's happiness. The ordered probit model was chosen because subjective well-being (SWB) is an ordered variable. We further used structural equation modeling (SEM) to study the mediating effects of social capital on psychological capital and happiness. The regression results showed that both psychological capital and social capital were significantly positively correlated with happiness when controlling for other factors. In addition, psychological and social capital significantly interacted, in which the psychological capital promotes the effect of social capital on happiness. Moreover, the effect of psychological capital on happiness was greater than that of social capital, demonstrating that happiness is more greatly influenced by subjective psychological experience. The interaction coefficient of psychological and social capital was also significant, showing that the two have mutually reinforcing effects on happiness. Finally, health, income class, real estate, stranger trust, age, and urban household registration had significant positive effects on happiness, while the view of money, being female, education had a negative relationship with happiness. The SEM results showed that the mediating effect of psychological capital on happiness was partly transmitted through social capital: the total effect of psychological capital on happiness was highly significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), as was the total effect of social capital on happiness (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001); however, the coefficient for psychological capital was greater than that for social capital. Through heterogeneity analysis, we found that the relationship between psychological capital, social capital, and happiness was significantly positive in each sub-sample group. There was also a significant interaction between psychological and social capital for men, women, urban and rural residents, and higher education background sample groups. However, the interaction was not significant in the sample group without higher education. In addition, the relationship between the happiness of rural residents and their educational background and gender was not significant. We found that psychological and social capital have significant positive relationships and effects on happiness. Psychological capital demonstrated both direct and indirect influences on happiness, and further strengthens the influence of social capital on happiness. These results support a scheme to emphasize psychological support during the COVID-19 pandemic period to enhance the mental health of citizens.","Zhao, Liu, Zhang, Li, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.962373","20220805","SEM; happiness; mental health; ordered probit; psychological capital; social capital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35706,""
"Grief experience among ICU staff with loss of family members during COVID-19 outbreak in IRAN: A qualitative study","The COVID-19 crisis created a lot of problems in people's lives. Different lifestyles, mental health, communication, rituals and traditions, particularly those involved in mourning, have changed drastically. Medical staff faced numerous critically ill patients every day. This greatly distressed the staff, especially the ICU staff. The end result was considerable amounts of mental distress for the medical staff who lost family members to COVID-19 making the distress even more complex. We carried out this qualitative research to study the grief experiences of 12 Iranian ICU staff members at the Rasoul Akram Hospital who had experienced the loss of a family member to the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied the effects of how their own grief experience and how constant exposure to critically ill patients influenced their work with patients. All semi-structured interviews were held in the presence of a faculty member of the psychiatry department of Iran University of Medical Sciences. The interview on the grief experience among ICU staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, consists of 4 issues: Familiarity, Experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, Grieving the loss of a family member and Effects of parallel grief. We found five common themes in the result of the experiences of the participants based on content analysis. These consisted of: complex grieving process, new experiences for coping with loss, more empathy for patients, change the meaning of death, and the need for support in work places. Likewise, there were 22 sub themes. Paying attention to the details of staff members' life, gender differences, and cultural aspects can give us a better understanding and perception of their grief experiences. This understanding brings out valuable points which can help policy makers pass better laws for the wellbeing of society and people in order to promote leadership in turbulent times.","Nohesara, Saeidi, Mosavari, Ghalichi, Alebouyeh","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.904760","20220805","COVID-19; ICU staff; experience; grief; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35707,""
"Factors Affecting the Psychological Well-Being of Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Crisis","Health care workers (HCWs) are a group that especially suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to facing the stress of dealing with patients and social isolation, they had to worry about being infected themselves and transmitting the infection to their families. This study evaluated the fear, anxiety, and depression experienced by HCWs during the COVID-19 crisis. The sample size was 541 HCWs. Data collection was done using an online validated questionnaire through Google Docs, sent to HCWs by email and WhatsApp groups. We assessed depression and anxiety with the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), while evaluating fear with the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). A statistically significant difference was found in the perception of fear between married and unmarried people, and between those with colleagues who had died from COVID-19 infection and those without. There was a significant relation between HCWs' anxiety and a history of death from COVID-19 infection, either of friends or of close relatives. The prevalence of depression was 18.48% in the tested sample of HCWs. Participants who had close relatives or friends infected with COVID-19 showed a significantly higher degree of depression. The age group &lt;30 and those working 20 to 30 hours weekly showed higher degrees of anxiety and depression. Sociodemographic variables such as age, marital status, and working area had a significant impact on the mental and psychological health of HCWs during the COVID-19 crisis.

"Sociodemographic predictors of depression in US rural communities during COVID-19: Implications for improving mental healthcare access to increase disaster preparedness","The objective of this research is to identify sociodemographic predictors of depression for a rural population in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to enhance mental health disaster preparedness. This study uses t-tests to differentiate between gender and ethnicity groups regarding depression status; binary logistic regression to identify socio-demographic characteristics that predict depression status; and t-test to differentiate between average depression scores, measured by the PHQ-9, pre-COVID-19 pandemic (2019) and after it's start (2020). Results indicate men were less likely than women to report depression. Clients who identified as Latinx/Hispanic were 2.8 times more likely than non-Hispanics to report depression and clients who did not reside in public housing were 19.9% less likely to report depression. There was a statistically significant difference between mean PHQ-9 scores pre- and post-pandemic, with pre-pandemic scores lower on average, with a small effect size. Building on findings from this study, we propose ways to increase rural access to mental health services, through equitable access to telemedicine, to meet the needs of rural clients to increase disaster preparedness.","Cannon, Ferreira, Buttell, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.203","20220803","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35709,""
"Depression and anxiety among online learning students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","The COVID-19 pandemic introduced a global need to explore the potential and challenges of online education. To evaluate the presence of depression and anxiety in university students and their level of satisfaction with online learning during the period of social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional design was used to evaluate 152 online learning students from six different university courses: Medicine, Psychology, Law, Engineering, Physiotherapy, and Business. The evaluation of the participants was carried out through an online survey in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Also, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess participants mental health. Most of the participants reported emotional impact, followed by learning impact, financial impact, social impact, and technological impact, with a significant difference in the presence of depressive symptoms, but no significant difference in anxiety. The participants presented moderate anxiety levels, with no significant differences between genders, and mild levels of depressive symptoms with significant differences between genders. Also, younger students were more anxious than older students. In addition, female students with less social contact presented more depressive symtoms. From a clinical perspective, the findings provide insights into mental health among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings may help in the development of effective screening strategies and in the formulation of interventions that improve the mental health of students.","Pelucio, SimÃƒÂµes, Dourado, Quagliato, Nardi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00897-3","20220805","Anxiety; Depression; Mental health; Online learning; Pandemic; Students; Anxiety; Brazil; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Education, Distance; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35710,""
"Evaluation of urban green space per capita with new remote sensing and geographic information system techniques and the importance of urban green space during the COVID-19 pandemic","A recently conducted study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encouraged access to urban green space for the public over the prevalence of COVID-19 in that exposure to urban green space can positively affect the physical and mental health, including the reduction rate of heart disease, obesity, stress, stroke, and depression. COVID-19 has foregrounded the inadequacy of green space in populated cities. It has also highlighted the extant inequities so as to unequal access to urban green space both quantitatively and qualitatively. In this regard, it seems that one of the problems related to Malatya is the uncoordinated distribution of green space in different parts of the city. Therefore, knowing the quantity and quality of these spaces in each region can play an effective role in urban planning. The aim of the present study has been to evaluate urban green space per capita and to investigate its distribution based on the population of the districts of Battalgazi county in Malatya city through developing an integrated methodology (remote sensing and geographic information system). Accordingly, in Google Earth Engine by images of Sentinel-1 and PlanetScope satellites, it was calculated different indexes (NDVI, EVI, PSSR, GNDVI, and NDWI). The data set was prepared and then by combining different data, classification was performed according to support vector machine algorithm. From the landscaping maps obtained, the map was selected with the highest accuracy (overall accuracy: 94.43; and kappa coefficient: 90.5). Finally, by the obtained last map, the distribution of urban green space per capita and their functions in Battalgazi county and its districts were evaluated. The results of the study showed that the existing urban green spaces in the Battalgazi/Malatya were not distributed evenly on the basis of the districts. The per capita of urban green space is twenty-four regions which is more than 9m<sup>2</sup> and in twenty-three ones is less than 9m<sup>2</sup>. The recommendation of this study was that TÃƒÂ¼rkiye city planners and landscape designers should replan and redesign the quality and equal distribution of urban green spaces, especially during and following COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, drawing on the Google Earth Engine cloud system, which has revolutionized GIS and remote sensing, is recommended to be used in land use land cover modeling. It is straightforward to access information and analyze them quickly in Google Earth Engine.

"Examination of individuals' depression, anxiety, and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey","Purpose This research was conducted to determine the depression, anxiety, and stress levels of individuals during the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, the compatibility of the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS-21) scale results with the participants' feeling depressed, anxious, and stressed were examined. Design and methods The sample of the study consisted of 870 individuals over the age of 18 between Mayâ€“August 2021. The data of the study were collected online, using the personal information form and DASS-21. Results In our study, it was observed that 22.3Â % of the participants were severely depressed, 19.0Â % were highly anxious and 14.3Â % were highly stressed. In addition, a relationship was determined between many sociodemographic variables and depression, anxiety, and stress levels. It was found that individuals who were not vaccinated, did not receive health care, and were not satisfied with health care were more depressed, anxious, and stressed. The agreement between all DASS-21 sub-dimensions and participants' feeling is poor in terms of Cohen's kappa. The agreement is poor in the anxiety sub dimension, but moderate in the other sub-dimensions in terms of Gwet's AC1. Practice implications It is recommended that nurses develop new care and evaluation strategies for the psychosocial field in order to protect and maintain the health of individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic process, as well as more practices promoting the COVID-19 vaccine in our country.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2022.07.021","20221201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35713,""

"Parent Attitudes Towards Childhood Vaccines After the Onset of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States","Objective To understand the influence of a novel infectious disease epidemic on parent general attitudes about childhood vaccines. Methods We conducted a natural experiment utilizing cross-sectional survey data from parents of infants in Washington and Colorado participating in a larger trial that began on September 27, 2019. At enrollment, parents completed the short version of the Parental Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV-SF), a validated survey scored from 0 to 4, with higher scores representing more negative attitudes. The exposure variable was onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States, with the before-period defined as September 27, 2019 to February 28, 2020 and the after-period defined as April 1, 2020â€”December 10, 2020, with the after-period further separated into proximate (April 1, 2020â€“July 31, 2020) and distant periods (August 1, 2020â€“December 10, 2020). The outcome variable was parent negative attitudes about childhood vaccines, defined as a score of =2 on the PACV-SF. We estimated the probability of the outcome after (vs before) the exposure using log-binomial regression with generalized estimating equations adjusted for demographic confounding variables. Results Among 4562 parents, the risk of negative attitudes was lower immediately after (vs before) SARS-CoV-2 onset (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]Â =Â 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36, 0.94; PÂ =Â .027), but by Augustâ€“December 2020, the average rate of negative attitudes was 35% higher than during Aprilâ€“July 2020 (aRR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.61; PÂ =Â .0009). Conclusions A reduced risk of negative general vaccine attitudes observed immediately after SARS-CoV-2 onset was quickly attenuated.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2022.06.014","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35718,""

"Neural sensitivity to social reward predicts social behavior and satisfaction in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","Neural reward network sensitivity in adolescence is proposed to differentially impact the effects of social environments on social outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to test this hypothesis within a context of diminished in-person social interaction. We examined whether neural sensitivity to interactive social reward moderates the relationship between frequency of interactive or passive social activity and social satisfaction. Survey reports of frequency of interactions with friends, non-interactive social media use, feelings of social needs being met, and loneliness were gathered in 2020 during mandated precautions limiting in-person contact. A subset of participants previously participated in an fMRI study examining social interactive reward during a simulated peer interaction (Survey n = 76; Survey + fMRI n = 40). We found evidence of differential response to social context, such that adolescents with higher neural reward sensitivity had a strong positive association between frequency of interactive connections with friends and social needs met, while those with lower sensitivity showed no effect. Further, high reward sensitive adolescents reported higher levels of loneliness with increasing social media use, whereas low reward sensitive adolescents reported the opposite with the same behaviors. This indicates that youth with greater sensitivity to social interactive reward are more susceptible to negative effects of infrequent contact, whereas low reward sensitive adolescents are less susceptible and instead maintain social well-being through passive viewing of social content. These differential outcomes have implications for supporting youth during times of major social disruption as well as ensuring mental health and well-being more broadly.","Sarah Dziura et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0231-3F9-EDA","20220804","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Developmental Neuroscience","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-06","",35723,""
