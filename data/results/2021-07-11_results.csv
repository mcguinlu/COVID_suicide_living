"A 6-month study on the pattern of emergency department presentations for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders during COVID-19 lockdown","This study investigated the characteristics of patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders presenting to emergency departments (ED) for psychiatric treatment during the first six months of the COVID-19 lockdown in Melbourne. This cross-sectional data-base study included adult patients in the North West Area Mental Health Service's catchment area who had visited two emergency departments (EDs) during the study period (March 16-September 16, 2020) and the control period (March 16-September 16, 2019). Compared to the control period (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 467), the lockdown period (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 451) had a 6.8% more psychotic disorders. This increase was particularly noted for schizophrenia and acute transient psychosis. In a sub-analysis of psychotic disorder group alone, compared to the control period, more patients were discharged to the community in the lockdown period. In another sub-analysis, compared to the mood disorder group, psychotic disorder group included more patients in 26-35 and 46-55 age groups, men, emergency triage category, and hospital admissions and higher mean duration of ED stay in the lockdown period. Overall, patients with psychotic disorders had increased ED presentations and appeared to be in an emergency state when they present to ED during the lockdown.","Jagadheesan, Danivas, Itrat, Shekaran, Lakra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114081","20210710","COVID-19; Emergency department; Lockdown; Psychosis; Schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-11","",15858,""
"Vulnerability to COVID-19-Related Disability: The Impact of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms on Psychosocial Impairment During the Pandemic","As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals have experienced disruptions in social, occupational, and daily life activities. Individuals with mental health difficulties, particularly those with elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), may be especially vulnerable to increased impairment as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, demographic factors, such as age, gender, and race/ethnicity, may impact individual difficulties related to the pandemic. The current study examined the concurrent and prospective associations between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, broader anxiety and depression symptoms, and COVID-19-related disability. Participants recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (N = 136) completed questionnaire batteries approximately 1 month apart during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., Wave 1 and Wave 2). The results indicated that PTSD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were all associated with increased COVID-19-related disability across assessment points, rs = .44-.68. PTSD symptoms, specifically negative alterations in cognition and mood, significantly predicted COVID-19-related disability after accounting for anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as demographic factors, ÃŽÂ²s = .31-.38. Overall, these findings suggest that individuals experiencing elevated PTSS are particularly vulnerable to increased functional impairment as a result of COVID-19 and suggest a need for additional outreach and clinical care among individuals with elevated PTSD symptoms during the pandemic.","Morabito, Bedford, Woller, Schmidt","https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22717","20210710","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-11","",15859,""
"Refining ""Long-COVID"" by a Prospective Multimodal Evaluation of Patients with Long-Term Symptoms Attributed to SARS-CoV-2 Infection","COVID-19 long-haulers, also decribed as having ""long-COVID"" or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, represent 10% of COVID-19 patients and remain understudied. In this prospective study, we recruited 30 consecutive patients seeking medical help for persistent symptoms (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°30Ã‚Â days) attributed to COVID-19. All reported a viral illness compatible with COVID-19. The patients underwent a multi-modal evaluation, including clinical, psychologic, virologic and specific immunologic assays and were followed longitudinally. A group of 17 convalescent COVID-19 individuals without persistent symptoms were included as a comparison group. The median age was 40 [interquartile range: 35-54] years and 18 (60%) were female. At a median time of 152 [102-164] days after symptom onset, fever, cough and dyspnea were less frequently reported compared with the initial presentation, but paresthesia and burning pain emerged in 18 (60%) and 13 (43%) patients, respectively. The clinical examination was unremarkable in all patients, although the median fatigue and pain visual analog scales were 7 [5-8] and 5 [2-6], respectively. Extensive biologic studies were unremarkable, and multiplex cytokines and ultra-sensitive interferon-ÃŽÂ±2 measurements were similar between long-haulers and convalescent COVID-19 individuals without persistent symptoms. Using SARS-CoV-2 serology and IFN-ÃŽÂ³ ELISPOT, we found evidence of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in 50% (15/30) of patients, with evidence of a lack of immune response, or a waning immune response, in two patients. Finally, psychiatric evaluation showed that 11 (36.7%), 13 (43.3%) and 9 (30%) patients had a positive screening for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively. Half of patients seeking medical help for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome lack SARS-CoV-2 immunity. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, or not, had no consequence on the clinical or biologic characteristics of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome patients, all of whom reported severe fatigue, altered quality of life and psychologic distress.","Scherlinger, Felten, Gallais, Nazon, Chatelus, Pijnenburg, Mengin, Gras, Vidailhet, Arnould-Michel, Bibi-Triki, Carapito, Trouillet-Assant, Perret, Belot, Bahram, Arnaud, Gottenberg, Fafi-Kremer, Sibilia","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40121-021-00484-w","20210710","Disability; Long-COVID; Pain; Patient perspective; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-11","",15860,""
"Characteristics of Calls to a COVID-19 Mental Health Hotline in the First Wave of the Pandemic in New York","This report describes the development, implementation and outcomes of a ""COVID-19 Anxiety Hotline,"" designed to address the community's mental health crisis provoked by the coronavirus pandemic. The service was specifically designed using survey data regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its staff and community members. Callers had around-the-clock direct access to mental healthcare providers at no cost. Quantitative analysis showed that nearly three out of four callers experienced new onset anxiety and insomnia driven by fear of exposure, and had difficulty accessing mental health care. In addition to immediate support, referral to tele-mental health care was provided to 86% of callers. Qualitative analysis indicates the effectiveness of immediate support and appropriate referrals using a tele-health platform. Our report indicates that the service was utilized by the general population, by health care workers, and rapidly provided referrals to individuals with limited access to mental health care during the pandemic.","Abdullah, Lynch, Aftab, Shahar, Klepacz, Cristofano, Rahmat, Save-Mundra, Dornbush, Lerman, Berger, Bartell, Ferrando","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-021-00868-9","20210710","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health resources; Psychological distress; Tele-health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-11","",15861,""
"Mental health outcomes of ICU and non-ICU healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional study","Intensive care workers are known for their stressful work environment and for a high prevalence of mental health outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mental health, well-being and changes in lifestyle among intensive care unit (ICU) healthcare workers (HCW) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare these results with those of HCW in other hospital units.Ã‚Â Another objective was to understand which associated factors aggravate their mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak. This cross-sectional survey collected socio-demographic data, lifestyle changes and mental health evaluations as assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 items (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 items (PHQ-9), the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) and the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) from the 28th May to 7th July 2020. The study was carried out at Geneva University Hospitals, a group of eight public hospitals in Switzerland. ICU HCW were analyzed for mental health outcomes and lifestyles changes and then compared to non-ICU HCW. A series of linear regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with mental health scores. A total of 3461 HCW were included in the study, with 352 ICU HCW. Among ICU HCW, 145 (41%) showed low well-being, 162 (46%) symptoms of anxiety, 163 (46%) symptoms of depression and 76 (22%) had peritraumatic distress. The mean scores of GAD-7, PHQ-9 and WHO-5 were worse in ICU HCW than in non-ICU HCW (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Working in the ICU rather than in other departments resulted in a change of eating habits, sleeping patterns and alcohol consumption (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Being a woman, the fear of catching and transmitting COVID-19, anxiety of working with COVID-19 patients, work overload, eating and sleeping disorders as well as increased alcohol consumption were associated with worse mental health outcomes. This study confirms the suspicion of a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, peritraumatic distress and low well-being during the first COVID-19 wave among HCW, especially among ICU HCW. This allows for the identification of associated risk factors. Long-term psychological follow-up should be considered for HCW.","Wozniak, Benzakour, Moullec, Buetti, Nguyen, Corbaz, Roos, Vieux, Suard, Weissbrodt, Pugin, Pralong, Cereghetti","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-021-00900-x","20210710","COVID-19; Caregivers; HCW; Healthcare worker; Intensive care; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-11","",15862,""
"Pilot outcomes from a multidisciplinary telehealth versus in-person intensive outpatient program for eating disorders during versus before the Covid-19 pandemic","Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses with high rates of mortality, morbidity, and personal and societal costs. Onset of the Covid-19 pandemic led to increased ED diagnoses in the general public, as well as worsening of ED symptoms in those with an existing ED diagnosis. Heightened prevalence and severity of EDs during the pandemic is complicated by the fact that traditional modes of ED care (specialty intensive treatment provided by a multidisciplinary team) have been difficult to access during the pandemic. The current between-groups study (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 93 ED) tested a multidisciplinary intensive outpatient program (IOP) delivered via in-person (pre-pandemic; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 60) and virtually via telehealth (during the pandemic; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 33). We found no differences in outcomes via delivery mode, such that regardless of in-person versus telehealth programming, ED symptoms, depression, and perfectionism significantly decreased and body mass index significantly increased. Our findings suggest that a multi-disciplinary telehealth ED IOP program is feasible and has comparable outcomes to in-person IOP treatment. These findings have implications for treatment beyond the pandemic, suggesting that adoption of telehealth IOPs is warranted. Such delivery modes of intensive treatments for EDs could be expanded to reach underserved populations, especially in rural areas where treatment is often difficult to access.","Levinson, Spoor, Keshishian, Pruitt","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23579","20210710","Covid-19; eating disorder; intensive outpatient programs; telehealth; virtual treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-11","",15863,""
"Seeking a pot of gold with integrated behavior therapy and research to improve health equity: insights from the RAINBOW trial for obesity and depression","More than one third of adults in the United States (U.S.) live with multiple chronic conditions that affect their physical and mental health, functional outcomes, independence, and mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed not only an increased risk for infection, morbidity, and mortality among those with chronic conditions but long-standing health inequities by age, race, sex, and other social determinants. Obesity plus depression represent one such prevalent comorbidity for which few effective integrated interventions exist, prompting concern about the potential for secondary physical and mental health pandemics post COVID-19. Translational behavioral medicine research can play an important role in studying integrated collaborative healthcare approaches and advancing scientific understanding on how to engage and more effectively treat diverse populations with physical and mental health comorbidities. The RAINBOW (Research Aimed at Improving Both Mood and Weight) clinical trial experience offers a wealth of insights into the potential of collaborative care interventions to advance behavior therapy research and practice. Primary care patients with co-occurring obesity and depression were assigned to either Integrated Coaching for Mood and Weight (I-CARE), which blended Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) for weight management and the Program to Encourage Active Rewarding Lives (PEARLS) for depression, or usual care, to examine clinical, cost-effectiveness, and implementation outcomes. This commentary highlights the empirical findings of eight RAINBOW research papers and discusses implications for future studies, including their relevance in the U.S. COVID-19 context. Organized by key principles of translational behavioral medicine research, the commentary aims to examine and embrace the heterogeneity of baseline and intervention response differences among those living with multiple chronic conditions. We conclude that to prevent health and healthcare disparities from widening further, tailored engagement, dissemination, and implementation strategies and flexible delivery formats are essential to improve treatment access and outcomes among underrepresented populations.","Venditti, Steinman, Lewis, Weiner, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab069","20210710","Collaborative care; Comorbidity; Depression; Integrated intervention; Multimorbidity; Obesity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-11","",15864,""
"Public mental health problems during COVID-19 pandemic: a large-scale meta-analysis of the evidence","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed humans to the highest physical and mental risks. Thus, it is becoming a priority to probe the mental health problems experienced during the pandemic in different populations. We performed a meta-analysis to clarify the prevalence of postpandemic mental health problems. Seventy-one published papers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°146,139) from China, the United States, Japan, India, and Turkey were eligible to be included in the data pool. These papers reported results for Chinese, Japanese, Italian, American, Turkish, Indian, Spanish, Greek, and Singaporean populations. The results demonstrated a total prevalence of anxiety symptoms of 32.60% (95% confidence interval (CI): 29.10-36.30) during the COVID-19 pandemic. For depression, a prevalence of 27.60% (95% CI: 24.00-31.60) was found. Further, insomnia was found to have a prevalence of 30.30% (95% CI: 24.60-36.60). Of the total study population, 16.70% (95% CI: 8.90-29.20) experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subgroup analysis revealed the highest prevalence of anxiety (63.90%) and depression (55.40%) in confirmed and suspected patients compared with other cohorts. Notably, the prevalence of each symptom in other countries was higher than that in China. Finally, the prevalence of each mental problem differed depending on the measurement tools used. In conclusion, this study revealed the prevalence of mental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic by using a fairly large-scale sample and further clarified that the heterogeneous results for these mental health problems may be due to the nonstandardized use of psychometric tools.","Liu, Zhu, Zhang, Zhang, Zhang, Liu, Feng, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01501-9","20210710","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-11","",15865,""
"Psychological distress and trauma in doctors providing frontline care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom and Ireland: a prospective longitudinal survey cohort study","The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on doctors is a significant concern. Due to the emergence of multiple pandemic waves, longitudinal data on the impact of COVID-19 are vital to ensure an adequate psychological care response. The primary aim was to assess the prevalence and degree of psychological distress and trauma in frontline doctors during the acceleration, peak and deceleration of the COVID-19 first wave. Personal and professional factors associated with psychological distress are also reported. A prospective online three-part longitudinal survey. Acute hospitals in the UK and Ireland. Frontline doctors working in emergency medicine, anaesthetics and intensive care medicine during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Psychological distress and trauma measured using the General Health Questionnaire-12 and the Impact of Events-Revised. The initial acceleration survey distributed across networks generated a sample of 5440 doctors. Peak and deceleration response rates from the original sample were 71.6% (n=3896) and 56.6% (n=3079), respectively. Prevalence of psychological distress was 44.7% (n=1334) during the acceleration, 36.9% (n=1098) at peak and 31.5% (n=918) at the deceleration phase. The prevalence of trauma was 23.7% (n=647) at peak and 17.7% (n=484) at deceleration. The prevalence of probable post-traumatic stress disorder was 12.6% (n=343) at peak and 10.1% (n=276) at deceleration. Worry of family infection due to clinical work was the factor most strongly associated with both distress (R<sup>2</sup>=0.06) and trauma (R<sup>2</sup>=0.10). Findings reflect a pattern of elevated distress at acceleration and peak, with some natural recovery. It is essential that policymakers seek to prevent future adverse effects through (a) provision of vital equipment to mitigate physical and psychological harm, (b) increased awareness and recognition of signs of psychological distress and (c) the development of clear pathways to effective psychological care.

"Online information on face masks: analysis of websites in Italian and English returned by different search engines","Countries have major differences in the acceptance of face mask use for the prevention of COVID-19. This work aims at studying the information online in different countries in terms of information quality and content. Content analysis. We analysed 450 webpages returned by searching the string 'are face masks dangerous' in Italy, the UK and the USA using three search engines (Bing, Duckduckgo and Google) in August 2020. The type of website and the stance about masks were assessed by two raters for each language and inter-rater agreement reported as Cohen's kappa. The text of the webpages was collected from the web using WebBootCaT and analysed using a corpus analysis software to identify issues mentioned. Most pages were news outlets, and few (2%-6%) from public health agencies. Webpages with a negative stance on masks were more frequent in Italian (28%) than English (19%). Google returned the highest number of mask-positive pages and Duckduckgo the lowest. Google also returned the lowest number of pages mentioning conspiracy theories and Duckduckgo the highest. Webpages in Italian scored lower than those in English in transparency (reporting authors, their credentials and backing the information with references). When issues about the use of face masks were analysed, mask effectiveness was the most discussed followed by hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide), contraindication in respiratory disease and hypoxia, with issues related to their contraindications in mental health conditions and disability mentioned by very few pages. This study suggests that: (1) public health agencies should increase their web presence in providing correct information on face masks; (2) search engines should improve the information quality criteria in their ranking; (3) the public should be more informed on issues related to the use of masks and disabilities, mental health and stigma arising for those people who cannot wear masks.","Mehta, Ghezzi, Catalani, Vanzolini, Ghezzi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046364","20210710","COVID-19; journalism (see medical journalism); public health; world wide web technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-11","",15867,""
"Responding to COVID-19 threats to trial conduct: lessons learned from a feasibility trial of a psychological intervention for South African adolescents","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed challenges to the conduct of clinical trials. Strategies for overcoming common challenges to non-COVID-19 trial continuation have been reported, but this literature is limited to pharmacological intervention trials from high-income settings. The purpose of this paper is to expand the literature to include a low- and middle-income country perspective. We describe the challenges posed by COVID-19 for a randomised feasibility trial of a psychological intervention for adolescents in Cape Town, South Africa, and lessons learned when implementing strategies to facilitate trial continuation in this context. We used a Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle method to explore whether our adaptations were having the desired effect on trial accrual and retention. We found that stakeholder engagement, trial coordination and team communication need to be intensified while testing these procedural changes. We learned that strategies found to be effective in high-income countries required significant adaptation to our resource-constrained setting. The detailed documentation of extraneous influences, procedural changes and trial process information was essential to guiding decisions about which adaptations to retain. This information will be used to examine the potential impact of these changes on study outcomes. We hope that these reflections will be helpful to other trialists from low- and middle-income countries grappling with how to minimise the impact of public health emergencies on their research.

"Mental health, compliance with measures and health prospects during the COVID-19 epidemic: the role of health literacy","The importance of health literacy in dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic has been emphasized but scarcely addressed empirically. In this study, the association of health literacy with mental health, compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures and health prospects was assessed in a Belgian context. Data were extracted from the third of a series of cross-sectional online COVID-related surveys (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°32,794). Data collection took place for 1 week starting the 28th of May 2020. People residing in Belgium and aged 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or older could participate. Data were collected on sociodemographic background, health literacy, multimorbidity, mental health (depression, anxiety, sleeping disorder, vitality), knowledge about COVID-19, compliance with COVID-19 measures (hygiene, physical distance, covering mouth and nose on public transport and in places where physical distance cannot be respected), and health prospects (risk for health when returning to normal life and possibility of infection). Prevalence Ratio (PR) of poor mental health, non-compliance with the measures and health prospects in relation to health literacy were calculated using Poisson regressions. People showing sufficient health literacy were less likely to suffer from anxiety disorders (PRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.47, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[0.42-0.53]), depression (PRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.46, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[0.40-0.52]) and sleeping disorders (PRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.85, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[0.82-0.87]), and more likely to have optimal vitality (PRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.41, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[2.05-2.84]) than people with low health literacy. They were less at risk of not complying with the COVID-19 measures (PR between 0.60 and 0.83) except one (covering mouth and nose in places where physical distance cannot be respected). Finally, they were less likely to perceive returning to normal life as threatening (PRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.70, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[0.65-0.77]) and to consider themselves at risk of an infection with COVID-19 (PRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.75, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[0.67-0.84]). The associations remained significant after controlling for COVID-19 knowledge and multimorbidity. These results suggest that health literacy is a crucial factor in managing the COVID-19 epidemic and offer a perspective for future studies that target health literacy in the context of virus outbreaks.","Hermans, Van den Broucke, Gisle, Demarest, Charafeddine","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11437-w","20210710","COVID-19; Health literacy; Mental health; Preventive measures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-11","",15869,""
