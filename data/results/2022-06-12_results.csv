"Mental health of Spanish nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of nurses working in primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare centers in Navarre (Spain). Healthcare workers, especially nurses, are at high risk for developing mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Spain ranks among the European countries with the highest incidence of and mortality from COVID-19 and has a 31% deficit in the number of nurses compared with the average for the European Union. This was a cross-sectional study involving 800 Registered Nurses in Navarre, Spain. Four standardized instruments, along with a self-administered online questionnaire, were used to measure the impact in terms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies was used to report this study. Of the 800 nurses, 68% had some level of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, and of these, 38% had moderate or severe symptoms. Those who worked in hospital COVID units and in nursing homes showed a higher impact on their mental health. The sustained pressure that nurses have experienced in their work during the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected their mental health. This study found that nurses who worked in hospital COVID units and in nursing homes during the pandemic had worse mental health outcomes. Recommendations for nursing policy include the need to implement coaching and emotional programs to support nurses on the frontlines of the pandemic. There is also an urgent need for the implementation of national training programs to strengthen health emergency preparedness, improve response capacity, and increase the resilience of nurses to disasters.","Martin-Rodriguez, Escalda-Hernandez, Soto-Ruiz, Ferraz-Torres, Rodriguez-Matesanz, Garcia-Vivar","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12764","20220611","COVID-19; Spain; anxiety; cross-sectional; depression; healthcare levels; insomnia; mental health; nurses; posttraumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-12","",32711,""
"The Good, The Bad, The Uncertain: Diverse Provider Experiences with Telemental Health During COVID-19","This study assessed mental health provider attitudes and perceptions of telemental health (TMH) prior to and during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The study expands on earlier work by providing a more detailed qualitative analysis of provider perceptions of TMH, including its efficacy, advantages, and limitations. The current study is part of a larger mixed methods project utilizing a repeated cross-sectional design. An online survey was administered to a sample of 1,448 mental health providers. Of the survey participants, 934 offered narrative responses to open-ended questions and were included in the present study. Qualitative data was analyzed using a coding team and the Consensual Qualitative Research paradigm. Providers described both positive and negative feelings aboutÃ‚Â using TMHÃ‚Â during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Several advantages were identified, with providers clearly appreciating the role of TMH in allowing them to work continuously and safely during the public health emergency. An array of negative views and concerns were also expressed, including that TMH may not be optimal or effective in certain settings or situations. A portion of respondents also indicated a preference for face-to-face care and illuminated ways they found TMH lacking or limited.","Lawson, Doran, O'Shea, Abel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-022-09990-7","20220611","Attitudes; COVID-19 pandemic; Effectiveness; Provider perceptions; Telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-12","",32712,""
"Psychometric Properties of a Brief Version of the COVID-19 Stress Scales (CSS-B) in Young Adult Undergraduates","We extracted items to create a brief version of Taylor etÃ‚Â al.'s (2020a) COVID-19 Stress Scales (i.e., CSS-B) and examined its psychometric properties in young adults. A sample of 1318 first- and second-year undergraduates from five Canadian universities (mean[SD] age = 19.27[1.35] years; 77.6% women) completed an online cross-sectional survey that included the CSS-B as well as validated measures of anxiety and depression. The 18-item CSS-B fit well on both a 5-factor and a hierarchical model indicating that the five CSS-B dimensions may be factors of the same over-arching construct. The CSS-B factor structure displayed lower-order and higher-order configural and metric invariance across sites but not scalar invariance indicating that the intercepts/means were not consistent across sites. The CSS dimensions were positively related to measures of general anxiety and depression but not so strongly as to indicate that they are measuring the same construct. The CSS-B scale is a valid measure of COVID-19 stress among young adults. It is recommended that this shorter version of the scale be considered for use in longer surveys to avoid participant fatigue This article is protected by copyright.

"Using TikTok for public and youth mental health - A systematic review and content analysis","Globally, TikTok is now the fastest growing social media platform among children and young people; but it remains surprisingly under-researched in psychology and psychiatry. This is despite the fact that social media platforms have been subject to intense academic and societal scrutiny regarding their potentially adverse effects on youth mental health and wellbeing, notwithstanding the inconsistent findings across the literature. In this two part study, we conducted a systematic review concerning studies that have examined TikTok for any public health or mental health purpose; and a follow-up content analysis of TikTok within an Irish context. For study 1, a predetermined search strategy covering representative public and mental health terminology was applied to six databases - PSYCINFO, Google Scholar, PUBMED, Wiley, Journal of Medical Internet Research, ACM - within the period 2016 to 2021. Included studies were limited to English-speaking publications of any design where TikTok was the primary focus of the study. The quality appraisal tool by Dunne et al., (2018) was applied to all included studies. For study 2, we replicated our search strategy from study 1, and converted this terminology to TikTok hashtags to search within TikTok in combination with Irish-specific hashtags. As quantified by the app, the top two ""most liked"" videos were selected for inclusion across the following three targeted groups: official public health accounts; registered Irish charities; and personal TikTok creators. A full descriptive analysis was applied in both studies. Study 1 found 24 studies that covered a range of public and mental health issues: COVID-19 (<i>n</i> = 10), dermatology (<i>n</i> = 7), eating disorders (<i>n</i> = 1), cancer (<i>n</i> = 1), tics (<i>n</i> = 1), radiology (<i>n</i> = 1), sexual health (<i>n</i> = 1), DNA (<i>n</i> = 1), and public health promotion (<i>n</i> = 1). Studies were predominately from the USA, applied a content analysis design, and were of acceptable quality overall. In study 2, 29 Irish TikTok accounts were analysed, including the accounts of public health authorities (<i>n</i> = 2), charity or non-profit (<i>n</i> = 5), and personal TikTok creators (<i>n</i> = 22). The overall engagement data from these accounts represented a significant outreach to younger populations: total likes <i>n</i> = 2,588,181; total comments <i>n</i> = 13,775; and total shares <i>n</i> = 21,254. TikTok has been utilised for a range of public health purposes, but remains poorly engaged by institutional accounts. The various mechanisms for connecting with younger audiences presents a unique opportunity for youth mental health practitioners to consider, yet there were distinct differences in how TikTok accounts used platform features to interact. Overall, there is an absence of high quality mixed methodological evaluations of TikTok content for public and mental health, despite it being the most used platform for children and young people.","McCashin, Murphy","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045221106608","20220611","Review; children; psychology; qualitative; tiktok","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-12","",32714,""
"Rate of adolescent inpatient admission for psychosis during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective chart review","Given the concerns for mental health (MH) impacts on children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the relative paucity of research in this field, this retrospective study compares the rate of paediatric inpatient MH admissions for psychosis for a period of 11 months before and during the pandemic. We used administrative data to compare the rate and clinical characteristics of patients (&lt;18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit for a psychotic illness before (March 17, 2019 to February 17, 2020) and during (March 17, 2020 to February 17, 2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. Results showed a 66% increase in inpatient psychosis admissions from pre-pandemic rates. More males were admitted with psychosis during the pandemic. Age and length of hospitalization were not significantly different across time periods. Results highlight the importance of accessible MH care for paediatric patients with psychosis during the pandemic.","Deren, Matheson, Cloutier","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13316","20220611","COVID-19; paediatric; psychosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-12","",32715,""
"""Even if I'm undetectable, I just feel like I would die"": a qualitative study to understand the psychological and socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on women living with HIV (WLWH) in Chicago, IL","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health and well-being of people worldwide, yet few studies have qualitatively examined its cumulative effects on ciswomen living with HIV (WLWH). We aimed to explore how the pandemic has impacted WLWH, including challenges related to HIV care, employment, finances, and childcare. We also investigated how HIV status and different psychosocial stressors affected their mental health. We performed 25 semi-structured qualitative interviews with WLWH regarding the ways in which COVID-19 impacted their social determinants of health and physical well-being during the pandemic. 19 WLWH who received care at the University of Chicago Medicine (UCM) and 6 women who received care at Howard Brown Health, a federally qualified health center (FQHC) in Chicago, were interviewed remotely from June 2020 to April 2021. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Interviews were thematically analyzed for commonalities regarding HIV-specific and general experiences of WLWH during the pandemic. The majority of participants reported COVID-19 impacted their HIV care, such as appointment cancellations and difficulties adhering to antiretroviral therapy. In addition to HIV care obstacles, almost all participants described perceived heightened vulnerability to or fear of COVID-19. The pandemic also affected the socioeconomic well-being of participants, with reported financial strains and employment disruptions. Some mothers took on additional childcare responsibilities, such as homeschooling. Increased mental health concerns and negative psychological effects from the social isolation associated with the pandemic were also experienced by most participants. We gained invaluable insight into how WLWH were challenged by and adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic, including its destabilizing effects on their HIV care and mental health. Women described how they undertook additional childcare responsibilities during the pandemic and how their HIV status compounded their concerns (e.g., perceived heightened vulnerability to COVID-19). Strategies to better support WLWH in maintaining their overall health throughout the pandemic include childcare assistance, access to affordable mental health services, support groups, and education from HIV care providers. These findings have significant implications for examining future health crises through the perspective of potential gender inequalities.","Devlin, Johnson, McNulty, Joseph, Hall, Ridgway","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-022-01812-z","20220610","COVID-19; Gender disparities; Unemployment; Women living with HIV","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-12","",32716,""
"Adolescents' mental health and maladaptive behaviors before the Covid-19 pandemic and 1-year after: analysis of trajectories over time and associated factors","Adolescents have been deeply exposed to negative consequences of social distancing imposed by Covid-19. There is a lack of longitudinal studies regarding the impact on adolescents of this unfavorable condition, and their results are controversial. The aim of the present prospective study is to assess psychopathological symptoms in adolescent students over time and to evaluate what type of impact the Covid-19 pandemic had on adolescents. Moreover, the association between mental health indexes, potential risk and resilience factors is explored. Psychopathological symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, stress, emotional dysregulation, maladaptive behaviours), and potential risk and resilience factors (i.e., childhood trauma, emotional regulationÃ‚Â skills, family function, personality traits) were assessed among a sample of 153 students (72% female; mean age 16.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.49), living in a medium-size city in the north of Italy, at two time points: before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic (November 2019-January 2020) and 1Ã‚Â year later (April-May 2021). After 1Ã‚Â year, we found an increase in mean scores on anxiety, stress for future uncertainty, and higher frequency of maladaptive behaviours. By contrast, the level of stress related to social domains (i.e., school attendance, romantic relationships, peer pressure) decreased. Dysfunctional emotional regulation skills, childhood trauma, low family functioning, and specific personality traits were associated to higher psychopathological symptoms. Cluster analysis detected three groups of youths based on their change over time in psychopathological symptoms: those who worsened (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°23; 15%), improved (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°55; 34%), or remained stable (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°75; 46%). After controlling for baseline mental health status, those adolescents reporting increase in self-harm (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.61; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), binge-drinking (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.0; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007), aggressiveness (OR 1.92; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004), and binge-eating (OR 2.55; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) were more likely to present a worsened mental health condition. The present results suggest that the Covid-19 pandemic seems to have had a different impact on subgroups of students. Indeed, we found a global worsening of psychological well-being only in a subgroup of adolescents, otherwise other students remained stable or improved. Increased frequency of maladaptive behaviors was found as a predictor of worsened mental health, therefore interventions to strengthen emotional regulation strategies are warranted. Finally, the decrease of stress in social domains could be due to reduction of potential triggering situations, thus indicating only a temporary beneficial effect that requires careful monitoring.","Pedrini, Meloni, Lanfredi, Ferrari, Geviti, Cattaneo, Rossi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00474-x","20220610","Adolescence; Anxiety; Covid-19; Depression; Emotional regulation; Longitudinal; Maladaptive behaviors; Mental health; Risk factors; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-12","",32717,""
