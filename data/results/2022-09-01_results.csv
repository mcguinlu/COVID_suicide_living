"Insights on COVID-19, School Reopening Procedures, and Mental Wellness: Pilot Interviews With School Employees","BACKGROUND METHODS RESULTS IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has caused interruptions to the K-12 US school landscape since spring 2020.In summer 2020, we completed a pilot study utilizing interviews (n = 13) with school staff (ie, nurses, educators) from across the United States. We aimed to understand the status of school operation and re-entry plans after the primary period of school closure, along with resources needed for students and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.All interviewees described their school's re-entry plan as complete or in-development. Ten plans included strategies to meet students' mental health needs. Only 3 clearly planned for staff mental health resources. Interviews suggest gaps in planning and execution of mental health resources for school staff, a group already vulnerable to stress, anxiety, and burnout.Several school staff mental health resources were developed as a result of the pandemic, though ongoing impacts necessitate integration of these supports into school operation plans. This is particularly important as schools continue to navigate periods of altered operation in response to elevated community COVID-19 infection rates.As schools implement strategies to support students, similar consideration should be given to the adults in the school environment who teach and support school-aged children.

"Depression and consumption habits: a cross-cultural study","Purpose&gt;This paper aims to explore the interplay between consumption and depression through a cross-cultural study conducted in Brazil and Germany.Design/methodology/approach&gt;Data collection was conducted through an online survey. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to assess depression levels from a sample of 1,627 respondents (759 Germans and 868 Brazilians). Descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression and Mannâ€“Whitney U tests were applied.Findings&gt;Cultural characteristics are relevant in the consumption-depression interplay. The authors identified marketplace resources and stressors consisting of products categories that influence the depression level of the depressed consumer. Additionally, individuals with some level of depression presented different consumption habits than those without. A table summarizing the findings is presented at the end of the paper.Research limitations/implications&gt;Work limitations refer to the consumption categories analyzed and the large share of students in the sample.Practical implications&gt;Marketplace measures have an active role in mitigating or increasing depression levels. Thus, consumption can also be used as a transformative tool to benefit the lives of depressive individuals.

"Emotional intelligence and materialism: the mediating effect of subjective well-being","Purpose&gt;The purpose of this study is to examine the nature of the relationship between emotional intelligence and materialism by exploring how subjective well-being mediates this link.Design/methodology/approach&gt;Data was collected from surveying 1,000 Lithuanians within random sampling, and structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques using SmartPLS were used to analyze the data.Findings&gt;The results show that emotional intelligence not only has a negative indirect effect on materialism but also a positive impact on both dimensions of subjective well-being (satisfaction with life and affect balance). In addition, the findings indicate that both satisfaction with life and affect balance predict a decrease in materialism. Finally, the SEM analyzes show that the path between emotional intelligence and materialism is partially mediated by both satisfaction with life and affect balance.Social implications&gt;The results of this study expand the understanding to what extent and how emotional intelligence is able to assist in adjusting materialistic attitudes, which have become more prevalent with the respective growth of consumerism and consumer culture worldwide. In the light of unsustainable consumption patterns threatening the survival of humankind and nature, the opportunities that could reverse this trend are presented for marketers and policy makers. This study gives insight into the potential pathways for diminishing consumer materialism, which is considered detrimental to subjective well-being and mental health.Originality/value&gt;The relationship between emotional intelligence and subjective well-being has been well documented, as has the link between materialism and subjective well-being. However, the simultaneous examination of the relationship between emotional intelligence, subjective well-being and materialism is lacking. The current study adds to the understanding of materialism not only by examining the effect of under-researched antecedent such as emotional intelligence but also by explaining the underlying mechanism of subjective well-being by which emotional intelligence connects to materialism.","Rutelione, AuÅ¡ra, Å einauskiene, Beata, Nikou, Shahrokh, Lekaviciene, Rosita, Antiniene, Dalia","https://doi.org/10.1108/JCM-01-2021-4386","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Journal of Consumer Marketing; 39(6):579-594, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36898,""
"Validity of the Chinese Language Patient Health Questionnaire 2 and 9: A Systematic Review","Introduction: Chinese Americans with limited English proficiency have higher mental health needs than English speakers but are more likely to be undiagnosed and undertreated for depression. Increasing anti-Asian hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency to accurately detect depressive symptoms in this community. This systematic review examines the validity of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2/9 for depression screening in Chinese-speaking populations. Methods: We queried PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycINFO databases, examining studies through September 2021. Studies were included if they evaluated the Chinese language PHQ-2 or PHQ-9 and diagnosed depression using a clinical interview. Two investigators independently extracted study data and assessed quality using the QUADAS-2. Study sensitivities and specificities were combined in random effects meta-analyses. Results: Of 513 articles, 20 met inclusion criteria. All examined the PHQ-9;seven also examined the PHQ-2. Studies were conducted in Mainland China (17), Hong Kong (1), Taiwan (1), and the United States (1). Fourteen studies were published in English;six in Chinese. Studies were diverse in setting, participant age, and comorbidities. For the Chinese language PHQ-9, Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.765 to 0.938 for included studies (optimal cutoff scores ranged from 6 to 11). For the PHQ-2, Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.727 to 0.785 (optimal cutoff scores 1â€“3). Overall, the PHQ-9 pooled sensitivity was 0.88 (95% CI 0.86â€“0.90), and pooled specificity was 0.87 (95% CI 0.83â€“0.91). Similarly, the pooled PHQ-2 sensitivity was 0.84 (95% CI 0.80â€“0.87), and pooled specificity was 0.87 (95% CI 0.78â€“0.93). The overall risk of bias was low (12 studies) or indeterminate (8 studies). Discussion: While limited by missing study information, the Chinese language PHQ-9 appears to be a valid depression screening tool among Chinese-speaking populations across geographic and clinical settings. Further research should explore optimal cutoff scores for this population for routine depression screening and the validity of the tool to measure response to depression treatment.","Teklu, Semhar, Hallen, Pham, Li, Rocky, Tahir, Peggy","https://doi.org/10.1089/heq.2022.0030","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Equity; 6(1):574-594, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36899,""
"Womenâ€™s Roles in the Indonesian Economy during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Understanding the Challenges and Opportunities","This Survey discusses the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the livelihood of Indonesian women. The pandemic has disproportionately affected women around the world, including in Indonesia, owing to gender inequalities at work and at home. Women bear most of the burden of unpaid domestic work and care for families. The pandemic has also forced adjustments in labour utilisation, and the movement of workers from formal to informal sectors. However, it has created new opportunities, including for micro, small and medium enterprises that harness digitalisation, although the sustainability of these opportunities for women is still too early to assess, owing to the persistent gender divide in Indonesiaâ€™s digital economy. The possible long-term mental health effects of the pandemic are also something to watch.Alternate :Survei ini membahas dampak pandemi Covid-19 pada penghidupan perempuan Indonesia. Secara tidak proporsional, pandemi ini telah mempengaruhi perempuan di seluruh dunia, termasuk di Indonesia oleh karena adanya ketimpangan gender di tempat kerja dan di rumah. Umumnya perempuan bertugas menanggung beban pekerjaan rumah tangga tak berbayar serta menjaga anggota keluarga di rumah. Pandemi juga telah memaksa terjadinya penyesuaian pada utilisasi tenaga kerja dan perpindahan dari sektor formal ke sektor informal dalam pasar tenaga kerja. Namun demikian, ia juga telah menciptakan berbagai peluang baru, termasuk di sektor usaha mikro, kecil, dan menengah yang memanfaatkan digitalisasi. Masih terlalu dini untuk menelaah keberlanjutan peluang-peluang tersebut bagi perempuan, dikarenakan adanya pemisahan gender secara persisten pada perekonomian Indonesia yang berbasis digital. Selain itu, kemungkinan dampak jangka panjang pandemi pada kesehatan mental juga harus diwaspadai.","Miranti, Riyana, Sulistyaningrum, Eny, Mulyaningsih, Tri","https://doi.org/10.1080/00074918.2022.2105681","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies; 58(2):109-139, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36900,""
"One-Year Neurodevelopmental Outcomes After Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: A Prospective Cohort Study","Purpose: The aims of this study were, in a cohort of children with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), (a) to report 1-year neurodevelopmental outcomes and specifically characterize speech, language, and hearing outcomes and (b) to report the prevalence of cleft lip and/or cleft palate. Method: This prospective observational cohort study includes newborns with confirmed in utero opioid exposure who received pharmacological treatment for NOWS. During 1-year-old developmental visits, we administered standardized assessments (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development--Third Edition [Bayley-III] or Developmental Assessment of Young Children--Second Edition [DAYC-2]--due to COVID-19 restrictions). We compared Bayley-III scores to standardized population means using one-sample z tests. We report estimates, 95% confidence intervals, and two-sided p values. Results: We enrolled 202 infants (October 2018 to March 2020). Follow-up at 1-year was 80%. Infants with NOWS had lower Bayley-III scores at 1 year compared to published norms for cognitive, language, and motor domains. One infant with NOWS was diagnosed with isolated cleft palate and Pierre Robin sequence. All infants passed the newborn hearing screen, and 7.5% had a formal hearing evaluation after neonatal intensive care unit discharge, with 40% having abnormal or inconclusive results;middle ear effusion was the leading cause of abnormal hearing (66.7%). Ten percent of children received a speechlanguage pathology referral prior to 2 years of age. Infants born to mothers with mental health conditions were more likely to have Bayley-III or DAYC-2 scores below 95 in language or motor domains. Conclusions: Infants with pharmacologically treated NOWS have significantly lower cognitive, language, and motor scores on standardized developmental testing compared to population means at 1 year of age. Early speech-language pathology referral is frequently necessary to promote optimal development in this population.","Benninger, Kristen L.; Richard, Celine, Conroy, Sara, Newton, Julia, Taylor, H.

"Desire on lockdown? Sexual desire and COVID-19 stress among LGBTQ+ and cisgender, heterosexual college students","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented stressors for college students, and minority stress faced by LGBTQ + college students has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Associations between stress and sexual desire are complex, but research suggests that stress may be associated with higher solitary sexual desire and lower dyadic sexual desire. The current study examined associations between sexual desire and a multidimensional measure of pandemic stress among LGBTQ + and cisgender, heterosexual (cis-het) college students. Participants (N = 377, 57% LGBTQ+) completed an online survey during the Spring 2021 semester that included the Sexual Desire Inventory and a multidimensional COVID Stress Measure. LGBTQ + students reported higher stress in multiple domains-isolation, academics, living situation, concerns about racism and prejudice, and health care access-relative to cis-het students. For LGBTQ + and cis-het students, higher overall COVID stress, as well as higher stress related specifically to isolation and to the virus itself, were associated with higher solitary and dyadic sexual desire. Greater concern about racism and prejudice during the pandemic was associated with higher solitary sexual desire, especially for LGBTQ+ students. Our findings underscore the importance of sexuality as a means of seeking connection during an event that disrupted college students' lives in many ways. We highlight implications for university professionals, particularly the need to support LGBTQ +-affirming organizations, mental health resources, and sexual health resources as students return to college campuses. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement This study indicates that LGBTQ + college students experienced higher stress than their cisgender, heterosexual counterparts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that higher stress was associated with higher sexual desire among LGBTQ + and cisgender, heterosexual college students.

"Substance Use and Mental Health Disorders: Psychologists' Role in Bridging the Gap","Nearly 30% of people with a mental health disorder will also have a substance use disorder at some point in their lives. Despite widespread evidence of the complex interactions between mental health and substance use and the value of integrated treatment, the majority of people with concurrent disorders do not receive treatment that addresses both conditions. Psychologists are ideally suited to bridge this gap in care, but this will not be without challenges. Psychologists possess extensive skills in identifying, diagnosing, and treating mental health disorders, which are transferrable to substance use disorders. Psychologists also have formal training in supervision and consultation and thus can supervise or act as consultants for other professionals in treating concurrent disorders. They have expertise in program development, evaluation, and research and can lead projects to integrate mental health and substance use services. Barriers to psychologists bridging this gap center on siloes in our healthcare system, the lack of training for psychologists to develop competency and confidence in substance use disorder diagnosis and treatment, misperceptions about how individuals with substance use disorders respond to psychological treatment, as well as system barriers. Overcoming these barriers comes with clear benefits and will require changes to professional training, clinical practice, and research on evidence-based treatments for concurrent disorders. Agencies across Canada are calling for action to ensure individuals with concurrent disorders receive the integrated services they require. Being at the leading edge of this change offers an important opportunity for psychologists. PrÃ¨s de 30 % des personnes prÃ©sentant un trouble de santÃ© mentale auront aussi un trouble liÃ© Ã  la consommation d'une substance au cours de leur vie. MalgrÃ© les preuves rÃ©pandues au sujet des interactions complexes entre la santÃ© mentale et la consommation d'une substance et de la valeur d'un traitement intÃ©grÃ©, la majoritÃ© des gens ayant des troubles concomitants ne reÃ§oivent pas de traitement simultanÃ© pour les deux conditions. Les psychologues sont les mieux placÃ©s pour combler cette lacune, mais cela ne se fera pas sans difficultÃ©. Ils possÃ¨dent de vastes compÃ©tences pour cerner, diagnostiquer et traiter les troubles de santÃ© mentale, qui sont transfÃ©rables aux troubles liÃ©s Ã  la consommation de substances. Ils ont reÃ§u une formation en supervision et en consultation, ce qui leur permet de superviser ou de conseiller d'autres professionnels au sujet du traitement de troubles concomitants. Les psychologues possÃ¨dent une expertise en matiÃ¨re de dÃ©veloppement de programmes, d'Ã©valuation et de recherche, et ils peuvent diriger des projets visant Ã  intÃ©grer des services en santÃ© mentale et des services concernant la consommation de substances. Les obstacles au rÃ¨glement des lacunes par les psychologues sont attribuables au travail en vase clos au sein de notre systÃ¨me de santÃ©, au manque de formation qui permettrait aux psychologues d'acquÃ©rir les compÃ©tences et la confiance requises pour diagnostiquer et traiter les troubles liÃ©s Ã  la consommation de substances, Ã  la mÃ©connaissance de la rÃ©ponse des personnes ayant de tels troubles aux traitements psychologiques, ainsi qu'Ã  divers obstacles du systÃ¨me. Surmonter ces obstacles apportera des avantages nets et nÃ©cessitera des changements Ã  la formation professionnelle, Ã  la pratique clinique et Ã  la recherche sur les traitements fondÃ©s sur des preuves pour les troubles concomitants. Des organismes partout au Canada demandent que des mesures soient prises pour veiller Ã  ce que les personnes prÃ©sentant des troubles concomitants reÃ§oivent les services intÃ©grÃ©s dont elles ont besoin.

"Succeeding as a therapist: How to create a thriving practice in a changing world","Before the COVID-19 pandemic, which wreaked devastation and chaos throughout the world, the need for mental health therapists was projected to increase. Regardless of whether the pandemic fades or continues, its profound impact on people's well-being is clear. There is no doubt that COVID-19, subsequent pandemics, and other unforeseen changes in the future will expand, deepen, and intensify the need for mental health services. Preparing therapists to flourish in independent practice is one way to support the growing demand for more providers of psychological services. The pandemic also has changed the practice of therapy from sessions that are typically done in person to those conducted by teleconference. This book is a practical guide to starting, growing, and protecting a therapy practice amidst these changes. It provides essential information to successfully meet the challenges of managing a clinical practice. The book is directed not only to therapists just starting their careers but also to experienced practitioners looking to develop, improve, or change the direction of their practice. It contains most user-friendly, smaller, ""bite-size"" chapters on the essentials of succeeding as a therapist;each spotlights a different aspect of starting, growing, and protecting a practice. The chapters are organized into seven themes that flow chronologically, from the initial preparations for independent practice to closing or selling a practice. The book provides resources, including professional guidelines relevant to practitioners, recommendations for coping with subpoenas and records testimony, information for professional executors, and semistructured samples of a professional will and of interviews with immigrants.

"Psycho-behavioural responses of the general population to covid-19 after mass vaccination: A cross-sectional study","Background Previous studies have examined public psycho-behavioural responses in the early stages of the epidemic, little is known after mass vaccination has been implemented. This study aimed to investigate the public's behavioural (adoption of COVID-19 precautionary measures) and psychological (depression, anxiety and stress) responses to COVID-19 and their relationships after the launch of the territory-wide vaccination programme in Hong Kong. Methods A cross-sectional survey study using anonymous online or face-to-face questionnaires was conducted between June 2021 and September 2021. A convenience sample of Hong Kong Chinese residents aged 18 years were recruited online by referrals and from a university-run community vaccination centre. Results A total of 1893 valid questionnaires were received. The results showed that Hong Kong residents have high levels of adoption of precautionary measures and low levels of depression, anxiety and stress after the mass vaccination. Hierarchical regression analysis identified that in the fully adjusted model, the adoption of precautionary measures was a consistent protective factor (beta ranged -1.51 to -1.67, p &lt; 0.001) for depression, anxiety and stress amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions This study offers new information on the public's psycho-behavioural responses to the pandemic, as well as insights into public health planning after introducing the mass vaccination.

"Is everyone invited to the discussion table? A bibliometric analysis covid-19-related mental health literature","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has captured the mental health discussion worldwide. Examining countries' representation in this discussion could prove instrumental in identifying potential gaps in terms of ensuring a truly global conversation in times of global crisis. Methods We collected mental health and COVID-19-related journal articles published in PubMed in 2020. We focused on the corresponding authors' countries of affiliation to explore countries' representation. We also examined these articles' academic impact and correlations with their corresponding authors' countries of affiliation. Additional journals and countries' indicators were collected from the Web of Science and World Bank websites, respectively. Data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics and the VOSviewer software. Results In total, 3492 publications were analyzed. Based on the corresponding author, high-income countries produced 61.9% of these publications. Corresponding authors from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East combined accounted for 11.8% of the publications. Europe hosted corresponding authors with the most publications and citations, and corresponding authors from North America had the largest mean journal impact factor. Conclusions The global scientific discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic saw an increased contribution of academics from developing countries. However, authors from high-income countries have continued to shape this discussion. It is imperative to ensure the active participation of low- and middle-income countries in setting up the global mental health research agenda, particularly in situations of global crisis, such as the ongoing pandemic.

"Realising transformative change in adolescent health and wellbeing: a second Lancet Commission","UN agencies, major donors, networks, and governments have included young people in initiatives such as the Global Strategy for Women's, Children's, and Adolescentsâ€™ Health and its associated funding mechanisms.3 The global community has embraced a broader view of the determinants of adolescent health and wellbeing, one that recognises that effective policies lie across multiple sectors and government ministries.4 There has been investment in better data systems for adolescent health and wellbeing, notably in mental health.5 Crucially, there has also been growing recognition of young people as essential partners in advocacy and policy development.6 Freepix/Pexels/Shutterstock Yet, in 2022, the health and wellbeing of adolescents is poised at a tipping point. War, political oppression, economic insecurity, and climate catastrophe have further affected the policy landscape, bringing an increase in forced migration and compromising the future for the most disadvantaged of this generation.7 Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused huge social and economic disruption to young people, with unprecedented interruptions in education, and profound effects on mental health.8 The consequences in many countries will probably be reversals in hard-fought gains in adolescent sexual and reproductive health, food security and nutrition, education, and employment. The current UN Secretary-General has called on the world â€œto think for the long term, to deliver more for young people and succeeding generations and to be better prepared for the challenges aheadâ€.11 This Second Lancet Commission on Adolescent Health and Wellbeing seeks to ensure that today's adolescents have the means to address the unique challenges of their generation.","Baird, Sarah, Ezeh, Alex, Azzopardi, Peter, Choonara, Shakira, Kleinert, Sabine, Sawyer, Susan, Patton, George, Viner, Russell","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01529-X","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Lancet; 400(10352):545-547, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36908,""

"Pharmacological Treatment for Pediatric Anxiety Disorders","Pediatric anxiety disorders (PADs) occur in up to 20% of youth and can cause impairment across the lifespan. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) added unique pressures on those with PADs, as children and adolescents endured the longest pandemic restrictions, stymieing their ability to develop socially, emotionally, and cognitively. Although first-line treatment for PADs is psychotherapy, those with severe anxiety symptoms will require pharmacological interventions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medications are effective in treating PADs, yet only duloxetine (a SNRI) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children aged &gt;7 years with generalized anxiety disorder. Treatment of children and adolescents with benzodiazepines for PADs presents unique challenges with potential paradoxical reactions.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Perinatal Loss Experienced by the Parental Couple: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study in Italy","At the beginning of 2020, mothers and fathers who experienced perinatal events (from conception to pregnancy and postpartum period) found themselves facing problems relating to the emergency caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the associated difficulties for healthcare centers in providing care. In the unexpected and negative event of perinatal loss (miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death) more complications occurred. Perinatal loss is a painful and traumatic life experience that causes grief and can cause affective disorders in the parental couple: the baby dies and the couple's plans for a family are abruptly interrupted. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the limited access to perinatal bereavement care, due to the lockdown measures imposed on medical Healthcare Centers and the social distancing rules to prevent contagion, was an additional risk factor for parental mental health, such as suffering a prolonged and complicated grief. The main aims of this study are: to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on mothers and fathers who experienced perinatal loss during the pandemic, comparing their perceptions; to evaluate their change over time between first survey administration after bereavement and the second survey, after 6 months; to examine correlations of bereavement with anxiety, depression, couple satisfaction, spirituality and socio-demographic variables; to investigate which psychosocial factors may negatively affect the mourning process and to identify the potential predictors of the development of complicated grief. This longitudinal observational multicenter study is structured according to a mixed methods design, with a quantitative and qualitative section. It will include a sample of parents (mothers and fathers) who experienced perinatal loss during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020. There are two phases: a baseline and a follow-up after 6 months. This protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Psychological Research, University of Padova, and by the Institutional Ethics Board of the Spedali Civili of Brescia, Italy. We expect to collect data from 34 or more couples, as determined by our sample size calculation. This study will contribute to the understanding of the psychological processes related to perinatal loss and bereavement care during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will provide information useful to prevent the risk of complicated grief and psychopathologies among bereaved parents and to promote perinatal mental health.","Cena, Trainini, Tralli, Nodari, Iacona, Ronconi, Testoni","https://doi.org/10.2196/38866","20220831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36912,""

"Comparisons of home-based arts engagement across three national lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic in England","Between March 2020 and March 2021, the United Kingdom (UK) experienced three lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the evident association between arts engagement and wellbeing, this study was designed to compare the predictors and patterns of home-based arts engagement during these lockdowns. Data analysed in this study were from the UK COVID-19 Social Study run by University College London. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify predictors of arts engagement and compare (i) respondents' engagement levels during the first lockdown in April/May 2020 and their levels in pre-pandemic times (N = 23,086), (ii) their engagement levels during the second lockdown in November/December 2020 with their levels during the first lockdown (N = 11,481), and (iii) their engagement levels during the third lockdown in January/February 2021 with their levels during the first lockdown (N = 13,270). During first lockdown, 1 in 4 increased their arts engagement and 1 in 6 decreased it. Of those who increased, 2 in 5 maintained or further increased their engagement in subsequent lockdowns, but just 7% of those who had decreased their engagement increased it. Younger adults (aged 18-29) showed initial increases in first lockdown, whilst people who were not employed and those with a physical health condition showed decreases and people with a mental health condition showed changes during the first lockdown (both increases and decreases). Females and people with higher education showed continuous changes across the three lockdowns, with women being more likely to increase their engagement and those with higher education being less likely to decrease. People of ethnic minorities and those with higher income declined their engagement in the third lockdown. This study provides insight into levels of arts engagement across the three national lockdowns in the UK and suggests that the pandemic may have affected long-term cultural behaviours for some groups.","Mak, Bu, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273829","20220831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36914,""
"""Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students' physical health, mental health and learning, a cross-sectional study including 917 students from eight universities in Germany""","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected physical and mental health. Since its commencement in 2020, social distancing has become the ""new normal"". Temporary lockdowns and distance learning have disproportionately affected young adults, including university students. To identify effects of the pandemic on university students' physical and mental health and learning, this empirical study included eight universities in Heidelberg, Mannheim and Ludwigshafen. Data was collected in May and June 2020. The self-administered survey was filled by 1,246 university students. 917 students completed the survey in full. 80.6% were bachelor students (n = 738), the mean semester was 3.8 and mean age was 23.1 years. 51.8% (n = 472) were female students and 47.4% (n = 432) male students. 38.5% (n = 352) stated a deterioration in physical health and 53.1% (n = 485) in mental health. From 0 to 10, students rated mean levels of stress highest due to social distancing (5.6), spending most time at home (5.0) and e-learning (4.5). Compared to male students, female students' mental health worsened significantly (58.7% vs. 46.8%). A logistic regression analysis identified gender having a significant effect on university students' stress levels: males seemed to have a lower risk of moderate to high levels of stress compared to females (odds ratio = 0.698; 95% CI = 0.515 to 0.945). Age, city of university and semester did not show a significant effect. The results are important to both regional and international audiences as university students face similar physical and mental health challenges due to the pandemic and its public health measures. Low-threshold initiatives are needed to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. These may include measures to reinforce students' locus of control, sense of belonging, relaxation and mindfulness as well as (online) counselling services. Gender-specific differences must be taken into account.","Gewalt, Berger, Krisam, Breuer","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273928","20220831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36915,""
"Food Insecurity and Substance Use Among Young Adult College Students in the United States","Food insecurity is prevalent among college students in the United States and has been associated with substance use. We sought to provide updated prevalence estimates and associations between food insecurity and a broad range of substances during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Using cross-sectional data from the Health Minds Study (N = 94,722; September 2020-June 2021), we used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between food insecurity and several substances, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, hours worked, and residence. We then added a block of adjustments consisting of mental health factors (depression, anxiety, loneliness, financial stress). Food insecurity was associated with significantly greater odds of having used most individual substances, including greater odds of binge drinking (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.30), cigarette use (aOR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.73-2.10), vaping (aOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.62-1.87), and a range of illicit or prescription drugs (using any illicit/prescription drug; aOR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.32-1.55) These associations attenuated and many lost significance after adjusting for mental health factors. This study found evidence to suggest that food insecurity is related to substance use in a large sample of young adult college students in the United States, calling for targeted interventions.","Oh, Smith, Jacob, Du, Shin, Zhou, Koyanagi","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000001062","20220831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36916,""
"Maternal Mental Health and Infant Development During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an unprecedented need to rapidly investigate the potential consequences for maternal mental health, infant and child development, and the mother-infant relationship. Globally, the mental health of pregnant and postpartum individuals has worsened during the pandemic regardless of infection status, and these concerning changes have disproportionally affected racial and ethnic minoritized people from underserved populations. Early indicators of infant neurobehavioral outcomes suggest that while in utero exposure to a maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely negligible, limited data are available regarding the neurodevelopmental consequences for the generation of infants born during the pandemic. High maternal depression and grief during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with lower levels of self-reported maternal-infant bonding. Yet nearly all published reports of child neurodevelopmental outcomes and dyadic functioning in the context of the pandemic rely on self-reported and parent-reported measures, which are subject to bias. In the context of prior research, and considering the paucity of research on infant neurodevelopment following prenatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure and birth during the pandemic, robust scientific investigation is needed to detect indicators of compromised early outcomes that could inform widespread assessment and accessible intervention. We simultaneously caution against reflexive apprehension regarding the generation of children born during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Firestein, Dumitriu, Marsh, Monk","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.2591","20220831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36917,""
"Receipt of Telehealth Services, Receipt and Retention of Medications for Opioid Use Disorder, and Medically Treated Overdose Among Medicare Beneficiaries Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Federal emergency authorities were invoked during the COVID-19 pandemic to expand use of telehealth for new and continued care, including provision of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). To examine receipt of telehealth services, MOUD (methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release [ER] naltrexone) receipt and retention, and medically treated overdose before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This exploratory longitudinal cohort study used data from the US Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services from September 2018 to February 2021. Two cohorts (before COVID-19 pandemic from September 2018 to February 2020 and during COVID-19 pandemic from September 2019 to February 2021) of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 18 years and older with an International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification OUD diagnosis. Pre-COVID-19 pandemic vs COVID-19 pandemic cohort demographic characteristics, medical and substance use, and psychiatric comorbidities. Receipt and retention of MOUD, receipt of OUD and behavioral health-related telehealth services, and experiencing medically treated overdose. The pre-COVID-19 pandemic cohort comprised 105Ã¢â‚¬Â¯240 beneficiaries; of these, 61Ã¢â‚¬Â¯152 (58.1%) were female, 71Ã¢â‚¬Â¯152 (67.6%) were aged 45 to 74 years, and 82Ã¢â‚¬Â¯822 (79.5%) non-Hispanic White. The COVID-19 pandemic cohort comprised 70Ã¢â‚¬Â¯538 beneficiaries; of these, 40Ã¢â‚¬Â¯257 (57.1%) were female, 46Ã¢â‚¬Â¯793 (66.3%) were aged 45 to 74 years, and 55Ã¢â‚¬Â¯510 (79.7%) were non-Hispanic White. During the study period, a larger percentage of beneficiaries in the pandemic cohort compared with the prepandemic cohort received OUD-related telehealth services (13Ã¢â‚¬Â¯829 [19.6%] vs 593 [0.6%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), behavioral health-related telehealth services (28Ã¢â‚¬Â¯902 [41.0%] vs 1967 [1.9%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and MOUD (8854 [12.6%] vs 11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯360 [10.8%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The percentage experiencing a medically treated overdose during the study period was similar (18.5% [19Ã¢â‚¬Â¯491 of 105Ã¢â‚¬Â¯240] in the prepandemic cohort vs 18.4% [13Ã¢â‚¬Â¯004 of 70Ã¢â‚¬Â¯538] in the pandemic cohort; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.65). Receipt of OUD-related telehealth services in the pandemic cohort was associated with increased odds of MOUD retention (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.27; 95% CI, 1.14-1.41) and lower odds of medically treated overdose (aOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.63-0.71). Among beneficiaries in the pandemic cohort, those receiving MOUD from opioid treatment programs only (aOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47-0.63) and those receiving buprenorphine from pharmacies only (aOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.98) had lower odds of medically treated overdose compared with beneficiaries who did not receive MOUD. Emergency authorities to expand use of telehealth and provide flexibilities for MOUD provision during the pandemic were used by Medicare beneficiaries initiating an episode of OUD-related care and were associated with improved retention in care and reduced odds of medically treated overdose. Strategies to expand provision of MOUD and increase retention in care are urgently needed.","Jones, Shoff, Hodges, Blanco, Losby, Ling, Compton","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.2284","20220831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36918,""
"Presentation of Patients with Eating Disorders to a Pediatric Quaternary-Level Care Emergency Department During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Despite an overall decrease in utilization of emergency departments during COVID-19 (Hartnett et al. inÃ‚Â MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 69(23):699-704, 2020), US pediatric emergency departments experienced an increase in mental health visits for children and adolescents (Leeb et al. inÃ‚Â MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 69(45):1675-80,Ã‚Â 2020). Simultaneously, individuals with eating disorders reported increasing symptomology (Termorshuizen et al. inÃ‚Â Int J Eat Disord. 53(11):1780-90,Ã‚Â 2020). This study compares Emergency Department utilization at a pediatric quaternary-level care center by patients with eating disorders during the pandemic (March-Dec 2020) vs March-Dec 2019. We hypothesize that there was an increase in presentation of patients with eating disorders. An Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside query of the electronic medical record system identified patients with eating disorder diagnoses per ICD9/ICD10 codes aged 6-23 who presented to the Emergency Department between March 1<sup>st</sup> and December 31<sup>st</sup> of 2020 and 2019. Subsequent retrospective chart review was carried out. Patients were excluded from analysis if the presenting problem was not directly related to the eating disorder. During March-Dec 2019, 0.581% percent of all patients presented to the Emergency Department due to an eating disorder. During the same time frame in 2020, however, that percentage increased to 1.265%. Statistical significance was corrected using a Benjamini-Hochberg analysis. Despite a 66.5% decline in overall visits to the Emergency Department, the percentage of patients presenting with eating disorders doubled during the pandemic. During the pandemic, the total time spent awaiting placement significantly increased, and the number of patients identifying as transgender and/or nonbinary increased. Our data support the hypothesis that eating disorder presentation increased during the pandemic.","Lurie, Sideridis, Qayyum","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-022-09999-y","20220831","2SLGBTQIA+; Boarding; Child and adolescent psychiatry; Eating disorders; Emergency department","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36919,""
"An SBQ-R assessment of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young adults in North India","During the COVID-19 pandemic in India, an increase in the number of suicides was observed in India. Therefore, the present study aims to explore various factors affecting the mental health of an individual and their consequences. Moreover, it has been attempted to assess the suicidal risk in the population of North India by using the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R). The young adults from the North Indian population belonging to the age group of 18 to 35 years (24.93Ã‚Â±4.42 years) have been incorporated into the study. A total of 190 responses (102 males and 88 females) were recorded through online mode. The present questionnaire has incorporated the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) and some of the parameters taken from the psychology today online survey. The demographic characteristics of the respondents were described by using frequencies and percentages, means, and standard deviations. Cronbach's alpha, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO), and the Bartlett sphericity were calculated. The mean SBQ-R score was recorded to be 4.62Ã‚Â±1.5. Further, during the factor analysis with the principal component method, seven factors have explained the 70.797% of the cumulative variance with an eigenvalue of 1. The SBQ-R assessment revealed a minimal risk of suicidal behavior but the frequency distribution of the parameters taken for the psychological assessment has highlighted that anxiousness or worriedness has a significant impact on the mental health of the population at risk. Therefore, it is recommended that some precautionary measures, such as online mental health services, should be taken by the health ministry to keep the population healthy.","Rani, Krishan, Tumram, Parekh, Kanchan","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v93i4.12805","20220831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36920,""
"Induced Depressive Disorder Following the First Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine","Several COVID-19 vaccines have been implemented. However, some side effects of the vaccine have been reported, which are sometimes very harmful. Reported cases and data are still very limited regarding the psychiatric side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. To our knowledge, only one case has been reported. In this paper, we report the case of a patient who presented an acute depressive episode 24 hours after receiving his first dose of the BNT162b2mRNA vaccine. The case was a 26-year-old man with a history of Down syndrome with moderately good autonomy for daily routine tasks. The patient, who presented hypothyroidism at 10 years old and schizophrenia at 15 years old, was doing well before the vaccination and received his first dose of the BNT162b2mRNA vaccine. Twenty-four hours later, he presented depressive symptoms that resolved spontaneously after one week. Then, fifteen days later, the symptoms reappeared, and the episode lasted for 5 weeks. The patient received 10 mg/day of escitalopram besides his usual treatment. The depressive symptoms improved considerably by the second day of treatment. The presented case illustrated significant diagnostic challenges, especially when taking into account the sequential relationship between the COVID-19 vaccine and the occurrence of depressive symptoms. A single case of depression has been reported after the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. Scientific evidence suggests the important role of the immune system in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric disorders, including depression. Health professionals must take into consideration the potential psychiatric side effects even being rare so far, especially in vulnerable subjects. Further studies are required to establish the causal effects of depressive symptoms occurring during the weeks following the COVID-19 vaccine bolus injection.","Rammouz, Doufik, Aalouane, Boujraf","https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527321666220829112733","20220831","BNT162b2mRNA; COVID-19; Side effects; co-morbidities; depression; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36921,""

The current research aimed to conduct the validation of IWAH in a Chinese population and its convergent validity, as well as test the implications of IWAH in associations with help-seeking behaviour during COVID-19.Ã‚Â A serial of three studies was conducted from September 1st 2020 to the end of October 2020. The series of studies included Study 1- Exploring the dimensions of the IWAH scale with a sample of 2,881 participants, Study 2- Confirmatory Factor Analysis for the Chinese IWAH dimensions with a separate sample of 6,667 participants, and Study 3- Role of the IWAH in the COVID-19 pandemic with a sample of 9,046 participants.Ã‚Â Study 1 found the Chinese version of the IWAH scale to be a two-dimensional construct, with factor 1 - Bond with Humanity and factor 2 - Human Kinship. Study 2 confirmed the two-factor construct as found in Study 1. It also showed positive relations between IWAH and moral judgement, collectivism, nature connectedness, and negative relations with callousness, and having anxiety and depressive symptoms. Study 3 found that IWAH was negatively related to fear of COVID-19 and positively related to the likeliness of help-seeking.Ã‚Â This is the first research to test the factorial structure of the IWAH scale in a Chinese population, with the adaptation showing good psychometric properties. The implication of IWAH on fear of COVID-19 and help-seeking provided further understanding of the possible practical value of IWAH during times of global stressful life events. Furthermore, study 3 is the first to explore how IWAH relates to anxiety, depression, and callousness.","Feng, Warmenhoven, Wilson, Jin, Chen, Wang, Hamer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03607-9","20220831","COVID-19; China; The identification with all humanity (IWAH) scale; Validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36923,""
"A case series of desmoplakin cardiomyopathy: a mimic of viral myocarditis","Clinical features and imaging presentation of myocarditis can overlap with other inflammatory or arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. Desmoplakin (DSP) is an important structural cardiac protein. Mutations in the DSP gene are associated with a variant of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Interestingly, this distinct genetic cardiomyopathy can also present with a myocardial inflammation and fibrosis pattern that may mimic other forms of myocarditis including viral myocarditis, which can raise a clinical challenge. We report two cases of DSP cardiomyopathy, which were initially thought to represent coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) myocarditis. First patient is a 21-your-old woman with no past medical history but family history of presumed 'viral myocarditis' and ventricular tachycardia in her brother. She presented with acute chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes. She tested positive for COVID-19 and given the suspicion for possible COVID-19 related acute myocarditis, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging obtained and revealed regional wall motion abnormalities, several areas of subepicardial and pericardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Ambulatory cardiac monitoring showed runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and considering her family history of arrhythmogenic myocarditis, genetic testing was performed that was positive for a likely pathogenic heterozygous mutation of DSP gene. She declined the recommended implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).Second patient is a 34-year-old physician with no significant past medical history who works at a COVID-19 unit and presented with syncope and was found to have ventricular tachycardia. Echocardiogram revealed severely dilated left ventricle and globally depressed systolic function with left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%. Coronary computed tomography angiography showed no evidence of coronary atherosclerosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed several areas of mid myocardial and pericardial LGE. Subcutaneous ICD was implanted and an endomyocardial biopsy had evidence of lymphocytic myocarditis and adipose tissue infiltration of the myocardium. Genetic testing revealed pathogenic heterozygous DSP mutation. He underwent epicardial ablation for the episodes of ventricular tachycardia despite medical therapy. He was able to return to work and has not had any further episodes of arrhythmia. Mutations in the DSP gene are associated with left dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, which is a variant of ARVC. Beside left ventricular systolic dysfunction and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, carriers of these mutations may present with episodes of chest pain associated with elevated cardiac enzymes and cardiac imaging findings indistinguishable from other forms of acute myocarditis including viral myocarditis. Currently, there are no guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of this entity.","Rezaei Bookani, Minga, Wodskow, Harris, Gordon, Sarswat, Pursnani","https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytac341","20220831","Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy; Cardiac MRI; Case series; Desmoplakin; Genetic cardiomyopathy; Left dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36924,""
"Relationship among Child Maltreatment, Parental Conflict, and Mental Health of Children during the COVID-19 Lockdown in China","Children are more likely to experience maltreatment and parental conflict in a pandemic context, which can exacerbate their vulnerability to psychological disorders. The purpose of the present study was to examine mental health symptoms in children aged 0 to 10 years and consider related factors from the perspectives of maltreatment and parental conflict during the COVID-19 lockdown. Participants were 1286 parents aged 18 years and over with children aged 0 to 10 years were included. Several multivariable linear regressions were used to analyze the data. The largest variance in child mental health was explained by child maltreatment, as more maltreatment predicted higher reported psychological problems (standardized betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.49, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Comparatively, parental conflict predicted less variance in mental health problems than maltreatment (standardized betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.18, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Children who experienced more maltreatment experience and exposure to COVID-19 showed elevated levels of mental health symptoms (standardized betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.06, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), as did those who experienced parental conflict and pandemic exposure (standardized betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.06, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The findings highlight that tailored programs that focus on a healthy family environment and strategic parental support services may be particularly effective in reducing children's mental health problems due to COVID-19 exposure.","Bai, Fu, Wang, Liu, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40653-022-00478-x","20220831","COVID-19; Child Maltreatment; Mental Health; Parental Conflict","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36925,""
"Posterior Myocardial Infarction in a 45-Year-Old Javanese Woman with a 1-Month History of COVID-19-Related Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© Syndrome: A Challenging Emergency Diagnosis","BACKGROUND Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that affects peripheral nerves and may be associated with nerve pain in the upper limbs and chest. Autonomic dysfunction in GBS can result in electrocardiography (ECG) changes that include T wave inversion, ST segment depression, or ST segment elevation. Recently, GBS was been recognized as a neurological consequence of COVID-19. This report describes the challenge of emergency diagnosis of posterior myocardial infarction (MI) in a 45-year-old Javanese woman who was known to have a 1-month history of COVID-19-related Guillain-Barre syndrome. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 45-year-old patient who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with atypical angina. She had a history of GBS that started 2 weeks after she developed COVID-19. Since then, she frequently had pain in both legs and occasionally in the chest. Her electrocardiogram revealed subtle ST segment depression in the anteroseptal leads (V1-V4), along with ST segment elevation in the posterior leads (V7-V9). Cardiac marker (troponin I) was elevated and posterior regional wall motion abnormality was present on an echocardiogram. Coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the first diagonal branch of the LAD, followed by deployment of drug-eluting stents to achieve good angiographic results. The patient was diagnosed with GBS and isolated posterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS This report shows the importance of performing standard cardiac investigations for myocardial ischemia or infarction in patients known to have Guillain-Barre syndrome so that the patient can be treated appropriately and urgently to ensure the best possible outcome.","Pratama, Oktaviono, Lusida","https://doi.org/10.12659/AJCR.937105","20220831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36926,""
"Changes in distress and turnover intentions among hospital-based nurses working during the first eight months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark A prospective questionnaire study","To describe changes in distress among Danish hospital-based nurses during the early month of the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine predictors of distress and turnover intentions. Outbreak of infectious diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic can increase the likelihood that health professionals suffer from poor mental health even after the outbreak. A prospective study among 426 Danish hospital-based nurses during the early month of the pandemic. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires regarding mental health and COVID-19 worries, as well as turnover intentions. Nurses with brief work experience reported higher increase in distress. Feeling unsafe at work, having low trust in in management, and being anxious for relatives were associated with increased distress. Finally, feeling unsafe at work, being anxious for relatives, and having low trust in management were predictors of intention to change job. This study suggests that the subjective experiences of uncertainty in work during the COVID-19 pandemic have more impact on nurses' distress than COVID-19 related conditions at hospitals. Finally, the study provides empirical support for the association between COVID-19-related worries and turnover intentions. Knowledge of risk factors for psychological distress as well as predictors of turnover intention is necessary and may provide nurses and healthcare systems with the ability to respond better against future pandemics, and to retain nurses in the organization and in the profession.","Nielsen, Mejdahl, Terkildsen, Mehlsen","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13781","20220830","COVID-19 pandemic; follow-up survey; nurses; psychological distress; turnover intentions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36927,""
"BURNOUT, RESILIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY IN FRONTLINE NURSES DURING THE ACUTE PHASE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC (2020) IN MADRID-SPAIN","In April 2020, Spain was the country with the highest number of patients infected by COVID-19 in Europe. The pressure on healthcare providers has had a direct impact on nurses and their mental health. To demonstrate the causal relationship between resilience, acceptance, experiential avoidance, psychological inflexibility and burnout syndrome, all of which are measured with validated questionnaires. This was designed as a transversal correlational study with nurses who worked during the acute phase of the pandemic in public hospitals in the Community of Madrid with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in COVID-19 medical hospitalisation units, emergency services and intensive care units. Google Forms was used to obtain an informed consent sheet, sociodemographic variables, and the following questionnaires: 10 CD-Risk, Connor-Davidson Risk Resilience Scale, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The final sample included 375 nurses with a high number of consecutive days of direct exposure to an infected patient and a very high number of consecutive days without rest; almost 18% suffered from COVID-19. The nurses presented medium levels of resilience, medium levels of experiential avoidance and medium levels as measured for emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment and depersonalization. We also found a predictive correlation between all the dimensions of the burnout questionnaire in relation to the data obtained from the resilience questionnaire. There is a direct and predictive relationship between the resilience that nurses had during the acute phase of the pandemic and their capacity for acceptance, experiential avoidance, psychological inflexibility and burnout syndrome. The scores show the necessity to implement preventive measures to avoid fatal psychological consequences for nurses.","JimÃƒÂ©nez-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Corral-Liria, TrevissÃƒÂ³n-Redondo, Lopez-Lopez, Losa-Iglesias, Becerro-de-Bengoa-Vallejo","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13778","20220830","Burnout; quality of work environment; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36928,""
"Psychological impact on dental students and professionals in a Lima population during COVID-19s wave: a study with predictive models","Peru was the country with the highest COVID-19 case fatality rate worldwide during second wave of infection, with dentists and pre-professional students being susceptible to infection due to clinical procedures they perform. This situation could have generated some kind of psychological disorder within this group. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess how COVID-19 pandemic affected this population group during second wave, in relation to depression, anxiety and stress. This observational and cross-sectional study in 368 Peruvian dentists (186 students and 182 professionals), was carried out during August to November 2021. The DASS-21 Scale was used to diagnose depression, anxiety and stress. For the statistical analysis, Pearson's chi-square test was used, in addition to a logit model using odds ratio (OR) to evaluate depression, anxiety and stress with the following factors: gender, age group, marital status, monthly family income, children, academic level, history of COVID-19, COVID-19 symptomatology, close relative with COVID-19, living with vulnerable people and work dedication. In addition, predictive models were constructed considering all possible significant causes. A significance level of pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 was considered. Dental students and professionals presented significant differences in levels of depression, anxiety and stress (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.022, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; respectively). Male students were 56% less likely to develop stress (OR 0.44; CI 0.22-0.85) compared to females; while those unmarried were 81% less likely to develop stress (OR 0.19; CI 0.04-0.85). Likewise, those with children were 83% less likely to develop stress (OR 0.17; CI 0.06-0.52) and 65% less likely to develop depression (OR 0.35; CI 0.15-0.80). In addition, COVID-19 asymptomatics were 60% less likely to develop depression (OR 0.40; CI 0.17-0.92). However, having relatives with COVID-19 caused almost three times the probability of developing depression (OR 2.96; CI 1.29-6.79) and twice the probability of developing stress (OR 2.49; CI 1.07-5.78). As for dental professionals, it was noticed that those unmarried had almost three times the probability of developing stress (OR 2.93; CI 1.38-6.23); while those who only worked had twice the probability of developing stress (OR 2.37; CI 1.17-4.78). Dental students had a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress. In addition, having children and being asymptomatic were protective predictors for depression, while being male, unmarried and having children were protective predictors for stress. However, having a relative with COVID-19 was a risk predictor for depression and stress. In professionals, only working and being unmarried were risk predictors for stress.","Morales-Montoya, CÃƒÂ³rdova-Limaylla, BriceÃƒÂ±o-Vergel, Ladera-CastaÃƒÂ±eda, Garcia-Luna, Cachay-Criado, Cervantes-Ganoza, Cayo-Rojas","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18899-x","20220830","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36929,""
"Effects of Intimate Partner Violence During COVID-19 and Pandemic-Related Stress on the Mental and Physical Health of Women Veterans","Little is known about women veterans' intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic or the impacts of pandemic-related stress on their mental and physical health. To identify IPV experiences among women veterans prior to and during the pandemic, pandemic-related stressors, and examine their respective contributions to mental and physical health. National sample of women veterans drawn from a larger web-based longitudinal study. Relationships between recent IPV and pandemic-related stressors were tested with linear regressions, controlling for pre-pandemic IPV and mental and physical health symptoms, demographic, and military-related covariates. One hundred forty-two women veterans (M<sub>age</sub>=58.8 years). We assessed IPV (CTS-2), PTSD (PCL-5), depression (CESD), anxiety (DASS-A), physical health (PHQ-15), and physical health-related quality of life (SF-12) prior to the pandemic (June 2016-December 2016/January 2017) and during the pandemic study period (March 2020-December 2020/January 2021). We assessed pandemic-related stressors (EPII) during the pandemic study period. Over a third (38.7%) of participants experienced IPV during the pandemic study period (psychological: 35.9%, physical: 9.9%, sexual: 4.2%). Overall rates, frequency, and severity of IPV experience did not significantly differ between the pre-pandemic and pandemic study periods. Few participants tested positive for COVID-19 (4.2%); however, most participants reported experiencing pandemic-related stressors across life domains (e.g., social activities: 88%, physical health: 80.3%, emotional health: 68.3%). IPV during the pandemic and pandemic-related stressors were both associated with greater PTSD and depressive symptoms. Pandemic-related stressors were associated with worse anxiety and physical health symptoms. Neither IPV during the pandemic nor pandemic-related stressors were associated with physical health-related quality of life. IPV experiences during the pandemic were common among women veterans, as were pandemic-related stressors. Although IPV did not increase in the context of COVID-19, IPV experiences during the pandemic and pandemic-related stressors were linked with poorer mental and physical health.","Iverson, Dardis, Cowlishaw, Webermann, Shayani, Dichter, Mitchell, Mattocks, Gerber, Portnoy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-07589-z","20220830","cumulative stress; domestic violence; public health crises","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36930,""
"Obsessive-compulsive disorder in treatment seeking children &amp; adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","Few studies have investigated the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study aims to investigate whether the pandemic is associated with increased referral of young people with OCD, any changes in their symptom severity and treatment offered. Service data were used to investigate 58 young people (8-17Ã‚Â years) referred and assessed in the Central and Northwest London NHS Foundation Trust Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (months March-October 2018-2020). Changes in symptom severity were measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA). Patient records were reviewed to assess if COVID-19 had exacerbated symptoms. Type of treatment offered was compared. 26 (5.62%) assessments to CAMHS related to OCD in 2020, compared to 12 (1.30%) and 20 (2.27%) assessments pre-pandemic (2018 and 2019), showing a significant increase in the proportion of OCD cases (X2 (1, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°58)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.3, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). There was no significant difference in any HoNOSCA dimensions on initial assessment. However, 69.2% of patients in 2020 showed symptom worsening over the COVID-period, versus 46.7% of cases first assessed pre-pandemic. Significantly more patients were discharged without being offered treatment pre-pandemic (X2 (2, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°58)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.7, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). In 2020, there was an 8.5% increase in the frequency of medication offered. The proportion of OCD cases in CAMHS increased in 2020 despite the overall number of CAMHS referrals falling. Furthermore, many cases reportedly worsened during the pandemic, and services will need to address the increased burden of more severe cases. Further larger investigation of this subject is warranted.","Henein, Pascual-Sanchez, Corciova, Hodes","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-02071-x","20220830","CAMHS referrals; COVID-19; Children and adolescents; Cognitive behavioural therapy; ObsessiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œcompulsive disorder; Pharmacotherapy; Service evaluation; Symptom exacerbation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36931,""
"Loneliness, social isolation, and social support in older adults with active cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on mental health. The social distancing and stay-at-home orders have likely also impacted loneliness, social isolation, and social support. Older adults, particularly those with comorbidities such as cancer, have a greater potential to be impacted. Here we assessed loneliness, social isolation, and social support in older adults undergoing active cancer treatment during the pandemic. A mixed methods study in which quantitative data and qualitative response items were collected in parallel was conducted in 100 older adults with cancer. Participants completed a survey by telephone with a series of validated questionnaires to assess the domains of loneliness, social isolation, and social support as well as several open-ended questions. Baseline demographics and geriatric assessments were summarized using descriptive statistics. Bivariate associations between social isolation and loneliness and social support and loneliness were described using Spearman correlation coefficients. Conventional content analysis was performed on the open-ended questions. In a population of older adults with cancer, 3% were noted to be severely lonely, although 27% percent screened positive as having at least one indicator of loneliness by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Three Item Loneliness Scale. There was a significant positive correlation between loneliness and social isolation (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â +0.52, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05) as well as significant negative correlation between loneliness and social support (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.49, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). There was also a significant negative correlation between loneliness and emotional support (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.43, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). There was no significant association between loneliness and markers of geriatric impairments, including comorbidities, G8 score or cognition. Reassuringly, in this cohort we found relatively low rates of loneliness and social isolation and high rates of social support. Consistent with prior studies, loneliness, social isolation, and social support were found to be interrelated domains; however, they were not significantly associated with markers of geriatric impairments. Future studies are needed to study if cancer diagnosis and treatment may mediate changes in loneliness, social isolation, and social support in the context of the pandemic as well as beyond.","Clifton, Gao, Jabbari, Van Aman, Dulle, Hanson, Wildes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgo.2022.08.003","20220830","COVID-19; Geriatrics; Loneliness; Medical oncology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36932,""
"Identifying risk factors for compassion fatigue in psychologists in Aotearoa, New Zealand","Psychologists work extensively with people experiencing personal and mental health difficulties, providing psychological support and therapeutic interventions. While past research has established that psychologists are at risk of secondary traumatic stress and burnout (together comprising Compassion Fatigue), little is known about the professional and personal circumstances that mitigate their risk. The current study surveyed mental health symptoms and professional quality of life among 149 registered psychologists in Aotearoa, New Zealand (4.1% of the workforce). A broad range of experiences were considered, including psychologistsâ€™ symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, Burnout, Secondary Traumatic Stress, Compassion Satisfaction and resilience, along with contextual factors including caseload, professional support, and personal circumstances, in the second year of the pandemic. LASSO regression was used to identify variables that predicted Compassion Fatigue and Compassion Satisfaction. Although psychologists find their work rewarding and satisfying, our results indicate a high rate of psychological distress and risk of compassion fatigue in our cohort of psychologists, partly associated with increased stress from COVID-19. This study identifies risk factors including COVID related stress, working with clients at risk, and symptoms of stress and anxiety, accounting for 59% of the variance in compassion fatigue. Additional informal supervision support, resilience and increased employer support were predictive of increased Compassion Satisfaction. It is imperative to focus on professional support, personal well-being and manageable caseloads, to ensure a future sustainable psychology workforce.","Amy Kercher et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00B8-AA6-A0A","20220901","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; burnout; professional quality of life; compassion fatigue; compassion satisfaction; psychologists; aotearoa new zealand","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","",36933,""
