"Magnitude and associated factors of suicidal ideation and attempt among people with epilepsy attending outpatient treatment at primary public hospitals in northwest Ethiopia: a multicentre cross-sectional study","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess magnitude and associated factors of suicidal ideation and attempt among people with epilepsy attending outpatient treatment at primary public hospitals, northwest Ethiopia using suicide module of World Mental Health Survey initiative version of the WHO, composite international diagnostic interview. DESIGN: Multicentre-based cross-sectional study was used. SETTING: Data were collected using face to face interview from patients with epilepsy who attended outpatient treatment at primary public hospitals at northwest Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with epilepsy (n=563) who came to attend outpatient treatment during the study period were included in the study using systematic random sampling technique. OUTCOME MEASURES: Suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt and factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempt. RESULTS: The overall magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempt was 26.5% and 12.6%, respectively. Being woman adjusted OR ((AOR)=1.68, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.23), living alone (AOR=2.4, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.92), divorced/widowed/(AOR=2.2, 95% CI 1.09 to 7.8), family history of suicidal attempt (AOR=2.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.79), depression (AOR=3.18, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.45), anxiety (AOR=2.92, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.09), comorbid medical illness (AOR=2.60, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.82) and poor social support (AOR=2.35, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.40) were statistically associated with suicidal ideation. Depression (AOR=4.87, 95% CI 2.56 to 9.28) living alone (AOR=2.66, 95% CI 1.62 to 5.41), family history of committed suicide (AOR=2.80, 95% CI 1.24 to 6.39), taking medication for mental illness (AOR=2.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.46), hazardous alcohol use (AOR=2.10, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.23) were statistically associated with suicidal attempts at a p value <0.05. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempt was high among people with epilepsy. Being woman, living alone, having depression and anxiety, single, divorced/widowed in marital status, family history of suicidal attempt and poor social support were statistically associated with suicidal ideation. Having depression, living alone, family history of suicide attempt, hazardous alcohol use and drug taking for mental illness were statistically associated with suicidal attempt. Based on the findings of this study early screening, detection and management of suicide were recommended in people with epilepsy.","Nigussie, Kabtamu; Tesfaye, Bizuneh; Lemma, Alemu; Kerebih, Habtamu","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043227","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(1): e043227, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(1): e043227, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9099,""

"Anxiety and depression symptoms, the recovery from symptoms, and loneliness before and after the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population: Findings from a Dutch population-based longitudinal study","Examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and loneliness in the general population. More specifically, the study focused on prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, the extent to which individuals with existing symptoms recovered or not, the prevalence of subtypes of loneliness, and the extent to which loneliness before and during this pandemic was associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. Data was extracted from the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a probability sample of the Dutch population, with assessments on loneliness in October 2019 (T1) and June 2020 (T4), and anxiety and depression symptoms in November 2019 (T2), March 2020 (T3) and June 2020 (T4; Ntotal = 4,084). Loneliness was examined with the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and anxiety and depression symptoms with the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). Repeated measures multivariate logistic regression analyses (RMMLRA) showed a statistical significant lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms after the outbreak (T4 = 15.3%) than before (T2 = 16.8%) and during the COVID-19 outbreak (T3 = 17.2%). According to the Reliable Change Index, the distribution of recovery categories (remission, improvement, unchanged and worsening symptoms) after the outbreak did not differ significantly from the distribution of these categories before the outbreak. RMMLRA revealed that the prevalence of emotional loneliness increased significantly after the outbreak (T1 = 18.4%, T4 = 24.8%). Among individuals who were not lonely before and after the outbreak the prevalence of symptoms decreased significantly (T2 = 7.0%, T4 = 4.4%) and, likewise, among those who were not lonely anymore after the outbreak (T2 = 21.5%, T4 = 14.5%). However, the prevalence of symptoms increased significantly among those who became lonely during the pandemic (T2 = 17.9%, T4 = 26.3%). Findings suggest that this pandemic did not negatively affect the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms nor the normal recovery of symptoms among the general population during the first four months, but that emotional loneliness increased.","van der Velden, Hyland, Contino, von Gaudecker, Muffels, Das","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245057","20210107","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9113,""
"Psychological impacts from COVID-19 among university students: Risk factors across seven states in the United States","University students are increasingly recognized as a vulnerable population, suffering from higher levels of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and disordered eating compared to the general population. Therefore, when the nature of their educational experience radically changes-such as sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic-the burden on the mental health of this vulnerable population is amplified. The objectives of this study are to 1) identify the array of psychological impacts COVID-19 has on students, 2) develop profiles to characterize students' anticipated levels of psychological impact during the pandemic, and 3) evaluate potential sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, and awareness of people infected with COVID-19 risk factors that could make students more likely to experience these impacts. Cross-sectional data were collected through web-based questionnaires from seven U.S. universities. Representative and convenience sampling was used to invite students to complete the questionnaires in mid-March to early-May 2020, when most coronavirus-related sheltering in place orders were in effect. We received 2,534 completed responses, of which 61% were from women, 79% from non-Hispanic Whites, and 20% from graduate students. Exploratory factor analysis on close-ended responses resulted in two latent constructs, which we used to identify profiles of students with latent profile analysis, including high (45% of sample), moderate (40%), and low (14%) levels of psychological impact. Bivariate associations showed students who were women, were non-Hispanic Asian, in fair/poor health, of below-average relative family income, or who knew someone infected with COVID-19 experienced higher levels of psychological impact. Students who were non-Hispanic White, above-average social class, spent at least two hours outside, or less than eight hours on electronic screens were likely to experience lower levels of psychological impact. Multivariate modeling (mixed-effects logistic regression) showed that being a woman, having fair/poor general health status, being 18 to 24 years old, spending 8 or more hours on screens daily, and knowing someone infected predicted higher levels of psychological impact when risk factors were considered simultaneously. Inadequate efforts to recognize and address college students' mental health challenges, especially during a pandemic, could have long-term consequences on their health and education.","Browning, Larson, Sharaievska, Rigolon, McAnirlin, Mullenbach, Cloutier, Vu, Thomsen, Reigner, Metcalf, D'Antonio, Helbich, Bratman, Alvarez","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245327","20210107","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9114,""
"Mental health of medical professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in eight European countries - A cross-sectional survey","The death toll of COVID-19 topped 170,000 in Europe by the end of May 2020. COVID-19 has caused an immense psychological burden on the population, especially doctors and nurses who are faced with high infection risks and increased workload. To compare the mental health of medical professionals with non-medical professionals in different European countries during COVID-19, assuming that medical professionals, particularly those exposed to COVID-19 at work, would have higher depression, anxiety and stress. To determine their main stressors and most frequently used coping strategies during the crisis. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during peak COVID-19 months in eight European countries. The questionnaire included demographic data and whether the participants were exposed to COVID-19 at work or not. Mental health was assessed via the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). A 12-item checklist on preferred coping strategies and another 23-item questionnaire on major stressors was filled by the medical professionals. The sample (N=609) consisted of 189 doctors, 165 nurses and 255 non-medical professionals. Participants from France and the UK were more often assigned to the group with severe/extremely severe depression, anxiety and stress on DASS-21. Non-medical professionals had significantly higher scores for depression and anxiety. Among medical professionals no significant link was reported between direct contact with COVID-19 patients at work and anxiety, depression or stress. Ã‚Â´Uncertainty about when the epidemic will be under controlÃ‚Â´ was the most stressful aspect for healthcare professionals while Ã‚Â´taking protective measuresÃ‚Â´&quot; was the most frequently used coping strategy among all participants. COVID-19 poses a major challenge to the mental health of working professionals as a considerable proportion of our participants showed high values for depression, anxiety and stress. Even though medical professionals showed less mental stress than non-medical professionals, sufficient help should be offered to all occupational groups with an emphasis on effective coping strategies.","Hummel, Oetjen, Du, Posenato, Resende de Almeida, Losada DurÃƒÂ¡n, Ribeiro, Frisardi, Hopper, Rashid, Nasser, KÃƒÂ¶nig, Rudofsky, Weidt, Zafar, Nadine, Gwendolyn, Schultz","https://doi.org/10.2196/24983","20210107","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9115,""
"Psychiatric Clinical Profiles and Pharmacological Interactions in COVID-19 Inpatients Referred to a Consultation Liaison Psychiatry Unit: a Cross-Sectional Study","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can affect mental health in different ways. There is little research about psychiatric complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The aim of the study was to describe the psychiatric clinical profile and pharmacological interactions in COVID-19 inpatients referred to a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (CLP) unit. This is a cross-sectional study, carried out at a tertiary hospital in Spain, in inpatients admitted because of COVID-19 and referred to our CLP Unit from March 17,2020 to April 28,2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. The patients were divided in three groups depending on psychiatric diagnosis: delirium, severe mental illness (SMI) and non-severe mental illness (NSMI). Of 71 patients included (median [ICR] age 64 [54-73] years; 70.4% male), 35.2% had a delirium, 18.3% had a SMI, and 46.5% had a NSMI. Compared to patients with delirium and NSMI, patients with SMI were younger, more likely to be institutionalized and were administered less anti-COVID19 drugs. Mortality was higher among patients with delirium (21.7%) than those with SMI (0%) or NSMI (9.45%). The rate of side effects due to interactions between anti-COVID19 and psychiatric drugs was low, mainly drowsiness (4.3%) and borderline QTc prolongation (1.5%). Patients affected by SMI were more often undertreated for COVID-19. However, the rate of interactions was very low, and avoidable with a proper evaluation and drug-dose adjustment. Half of the patients with SMI were institutionalized, suggesting that living conditions in residential facilities could make them more vulnerable to infection.","Arbelo, LÃƒÂ³pez-Pelayo, SaguÃƒÂ©, Madero, PinzÃƒÂ³n-Espinosa, Gomes-da-Costa, Ilzarbe, Anmella, Llach, Imaz, CÃƒÂ¡mara, Pintor","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09868-6","20210107","COVID-19; Consultation-liaison psychiatry; Delirium; Mental health residential facilities; Pharmacological interactions; Psychopharmacology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9116,""
"The Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Healthcare Workers with Pre-Existing Psychiatric Conditions","Both healthcare workers (HCWs) and psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic appear to have elevated prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, but little is known about HCWs with psychiatric diagnoses. To examine their response to the pandemic, we analyzed their perspective, and association with psychiatric symptoms and stress among HCW with psychiatric diagnosis. Using an online survey of HCW, we analyzed demographics, work information, health factors, open-ended question, sources of stress and standardized mental health scales (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)). Sixteen out of 129 HCWs reported a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis (median age 32Ã‚Â years, 8 were females, 8 work in the emergency department). Their perception of the impact severity on symptoms was significantly correlated with all the mental health scales and with stress from avoiding physical contact. In multivariate analysis, PSS score and PCL score were associated with self-rated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on symptoms (standardized betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.51 for PCL and standardized betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.55 for PSS). GAD-7 score was significantly related to both impact (standardized betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.44) and stress from avoiding physical contact (standardized betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.53). HCWs with psychiatric diagnoses reported a range of perception of the impact of the pandemic on their symptoms with increased severity associated with worse psychiatric outcomes and more stress from avoiding physical contact with others. There is a growing importance to protect HCWs mental health, including those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, and proactively counter psychosocial consequences of healthcare crises.","MacKenzie, Daviskiba, Dow, Johnston, Balon, Javanbakht, Arfken","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09870-y","20210107","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Psychiatry; Stress; Stress response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9117,""
"Setting the Agenda for Reproductive and Maternal Health in the Era of COVID-19: Lessons from a Cruel and Radical Teacher","COVID-19 exposes major gaps in the MCH safety net and illuminates the disproportionate consequences borne by people living in low resource communities where systemic racism, community disinvestment, and social marginalization creates a perfect storm of vulnerability. We draw eight lessons from the first 8 months of the pandemic, describing how COVID-19 has intensified pre-existing gaps in the MCH support network and created new problems. For each lesson identified, we present supporting evidence and a call for specific actions that can be taken by MCH practitioners, researchers and advocates. LESSON #1: COVID-19 hits communities of color hardest, exposing and exacerbating health inequities caused by systemic racism. LESSON #2: Women experience the most devastating social, economic and mental health tolls during COVID-19. LESSON #3: Virulent pathogens find and exacerbate cracks in our public health and health care systems. LESSON #4: COVID-19 has become a pretext to limit access to sexual and reproductive health care. LESSON #5: COVID-19 has exposed and deepened fault lines in maternity care: over-medicalization, discrimination, lack of workforce diversity, underutilization of collaborative team approaches, and lack of post-delivery follow-up. LESSON #6: The pandemic adds impetus to much-needed Medicaid policy reforms that can have a lasting positive effect on maternal health. LESSON #7: Social and health policy changes, heretofore deemed infeasible, ARE possible under pandemic threat. LESSON #8: Finally, an overarching COVID-19 lesson: We are all inextricably connected.

"Applying Restorative Environments in the Home Office While Sheltering-in-Place","The objective of this review was to spotlight specific methods for people working from home to apply restorative environment research to improve productivity and mental health during shelter-in-place. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to sheltering-in-place and telework. While necessary, these strategies may lead to negative consequences such as social isolation and worse performance. However, nature environments have been shown to have a variety of positive effects in several different settings, including improved attention, positive affect, and increased job satisfaction, and these may be translated to the home workspace setting. This provides a narrative review of the environmental psychology literature, describing articles involving nature in a task performance or stress context and how it has been applied. It then moves on to discuss how these findings could possibly be applied in the context of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although beneficial results are mixed, the review found a variety of relatively simple and cost-effective methods that could assist workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, including taking a break in nature and implementing nature in the workspace. The application of restorative environment research could be an efficient way of mitigating the negative psychological effects due to at-home sheltering and telework in order to combat COVID-19.","Craig, Neilson, Altman, Travis, Vance","https://doi.org/10.1177/0018720820984286","20210107","affective factors; home health; job stress; stress; workspace design","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9119,""

The aim of this pilot study was to explore the impact of the public health emergency due to COVID-19 on individual's mental health among 299 Italian adults after a month of home isolation due to COVID-19. Cross-sectional study design. Adults of the general population were invited to a voluntary online health survey. Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to examine diverse psycho-social and stressful contextual factors associated with symptoms of psychopathology. Results indicated that females reported higher symptoms of depression, anxiety and circadian rhythm dysregulation, than males. Age and the capacity to adapt to a new environment and to cope with illness were negatively associated with all symptoms of psychopathology. Conversely, engaging in verbally aggressive behaviours and having experienced stressful events related to COVID-19 were positively related to psychopathological symptoms. Finally, social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and substance use during the past months was related to circadian rhythm dysregulation. The findings of this study raise particular concern about psychological well-being considering the negative associations between stressful events during the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms of psychological distress, and perceived social support. These results have possible significant clinical implications.","Amendola, Spensieri, Hengartner, Cerutti","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12502","20210107","COVID-19; circadian rhythm dysregulation; internalizing symptoms; psychotic-like experiences; public health emergencies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9120,""

After a baseline survey (April 2020), participants completed 3 months of daily ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Dietary, physical activity, alcohol, smoking, vaping and substance use behaviours collected retrospectively for the pre-COVID-19 period were compared with daily EMA surveys over the first 30 days during early lockdown. Predictors of behaviour change were assessed using multivariable regression models. 30% of the cohort had a COVID-19 at risk health condition, 37% were classed as deprived and 6% self-reported a mental health condition.

This article reviews the main articles that have been published so far about the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on these particularly fragile populations. The pandemic associated to COVID-19 has shifted most of the health resources to the emergency area and has consequently left the three main medical areas dealing with the elderly population (oncology, time-dependent diseases and degenerative disease) temporarily &quot;uncovered&quot;. In the phase following the emergency, it will be crucial to guarantee to each area the economic and organizational resources to quickly return to the level of support of the prepandemic state. The emergency phase represented a significant occasion of discussion on the possibilities of telemedicine which will inevitably become increasingly important, but all the limits of its use in the elderly population have to be considered. In the post-lockdown recovery phase, alongside the classic medical evaluation, the psychological evaluation must become even more important for doctors caring about people with cognitive decline as well as with their caregivers.","Iodice, Cassano, Rossini","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04902-8","20210107","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Anxiety; Behavioral effects; COVID-19; Depressive disorders; Mild cognitive impairment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9123,""
"Head lice were also affected by COVID-19: a decrease on Pediculosis infestation during lockdown in Buenos Aires","Pediculosis is a worldwide disease affecting school-aged children produced by the presence of the head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer, an obligate ectoparasite on the human scalp feeding exclusively on blood. Transmission occurs primarily through direct physical head-to-head contact. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a variant of the coronavirus. Therefore, on March 18, 2020, the Argentinean government established mandatory isolation for an indefinite period. This obligatory isolation interrupted regular classes avoiding direct contact between children, thus affecting the dispersal route of individuals and the evolution of head louse populations. In this study, we evaluated through an online survey how confinement affected the prevalence of lice during lockdown compared to the situation prior to confinement. The survey allowed to discriminate the different control strategies, the number of treatments, and the amount of insects recorded by parents. Data of 1118 children obtained from 627 surveys were analyzed. As the main result, it was observed that prevalence of lice decreased significantly from before (69.6%) to during (43.9%) COVID-19 lockdown. Moreover, head lice infestation was more effectively controlled in households with up to 2 children in comparison to households with 3 or more children. This is the first study that analyzed the prevalence of head lice during COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this work demonstrated the impact of social distance in the population dynamics of head lice and how it could affect the control strategies in the future.","Galassi, Ortega-Insaurralde, Adjemian, Gonzalez-Audino, Picollo, Toloza","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-07038-y","20210107","Buenos Aires; Covid-19; Head lice; Lockdown; Pediculosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9124,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Frontline Health Workers in Low- and Middle-Income Countries","Healthcare systems in many countries have been overwhelmed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, with increasing demands to contain and respond to the virus. The result has been increased pressure on frontline health workers. As the pandemic unfolds, the impact on health systems in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is becoming apparent. In lower resource settings, the detrimental effects on frontline health workers will likely be significant due to fragmented infrastructure, low compensation, and significant shortages of necessary resources such as personal protective equipment. These high stress conditions, coupled with risk of infection and fears and anxieties among patients, can result in grave psychosocial consequences for frontline health workers, who play a vital role in delivering the bulk of primary care services in LMICs. In this narrative review, we consider the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline health workers in LMICs. We describe the important role of frontline health workers, summarize existing literature on burnout and risks to mental health in this essential workforce, and consider how public health emergencies exacerbate these concerns to showcase their vulnerability to mental health impacts of COVID-19. We explore emerging research on the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health workers and consider possible approaches to mitigate these consequences. This review draws from existing studies and emerging evidence to highlight the critical need to consider the wellbeing of frontline health workers, and to address these challenges as health systems respond to the pandemic.","Deng, Naslund","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+Impact+of+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Frontline+Health+Workers+in+Low-+and+Middle-Income+Countries.","20210107","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9125,""

"Psychological Effects on Health Science Students After Implementation of COVID-19 Quarantine and Distance Learning in Saudi Arabia","Background The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the globe dramatically. It has affected daily life noticeably and the teaching process is one of the significantly affected aspects as the learning approach has been shifted to distance learning (DL). These new changes may affect student performance and emotional well-being. This study aimed to assess the psychologicalÃ‚Â impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and distance learning on healthcare students. Method An online self-administered cross-sectional survey was distributed to healthcare students for the period between April 2020 to June 2020. The study included students from different universities in Saudi Arabia. Knowledge and perception of COVID-19 and the experience of distance learning during the pandemic period were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Psychological effect was evaluated using Four-Item Patient Health Questionnaire for Anxiety and Depression (PHQ-4). Results A total of 721 students completed the survey with the majority being females. Around 25% of students had experienced anxiety, while 35% had depression. Severe anxiety and depression were noted in over 6% of the participants. Younger age and female gender were more affected psychologically. Students with higher scores in PHQ-4 were strongly disagreeing that hand gloves and surgical masks may help in preventing COVID-19 transmission. Students with normal psychological assessment were more likely to favor DL, while students with moderate to severe anxiety and depression disagreed. Conclusion Healthcare students have alarmingly high levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. General knowledge of the pandemic is not associated with the psychological impact. DL is a convenient approach for students with normal PHQ-4 scores. Programs to help students overcome the psychologicalÃ‚Â impact of COVID-19 are highly recommended.","Qanash, Al-Husayni, Alemam, Alqublan, Alwafi, Mufti, Qanash, Shabrawishi, Ghabashi","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11767","20210107","anxiety; coronavirus quarantine; covid 19; depression; distance learning programs; health professions students; health sciences; psycho-behavioral; saudi arabia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9128,""

We explore these effects by conducting a text analysis of the content of posts by 387,730 Weibo users. The results show that the severity of the epidemic promotes prosocial tendencies; anger motivates prosocial tendencies significantly; and the severity of the epidemic moderates the effects of three emotions-anger, sadness, and surprise-on prosocial tendencies. These findings provide a reference for exploring the positive significance of major disasters.","Ye, Long, Liu, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.588701","20210107","COVID-19; big data; negative emotion; positive emotion; prosocial tendency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9129,""
"COVID-19 Suicide Survivors-A Hidden Grieving Population","Present time has been dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. People are grieving several non-death related situations: the loss of a job, of a status, of a role, of their life. Restrictive measures and uncertainty about the future makes individuals vulnerable to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. Mental health support has been hindered and teams are reinventing themselves to reach people in need. Nevertheless, decompensation of previous psychiatric disorders, increasing levels of depression and anxiety, economical handicaps and fear of the infection, are prompting several cases of COVID-19 related suicides worldwide. Every suicide affects between 5 and 80 individuals, which are known as suicide survivors. Suicide grief is particularly challenging, with rates of complicated grief as high as 40%. Suicide survivors are at increased risk of developing depression, anxiety disorders and of suicidal behaviors. Moreover, feelings of guilt and shame, as well as social stigma, are major obstacles for them to reach form help. This article aims to review the existing literature on COVID-19 related suicides, complicated grief in suicide survivors and highlight modifiable risk factors for both conditions, as well as propose some public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic context on self-inflicted harm and its consequences on families, friends and the community. Obstacles to access to mental health support need to be overcome through the use of technology. Technicians should actively approach populations more vulnerable to develop suicidal ideation. Social media have the obligation to provide accurate an non-sensationalistic information. Families and friends should maintain social proximity, despite the need for physical distancing. When a suicide death occurs, police forces and health staff should be prepared to share the news with the family using an empathic and humane approach and providing psychological support. Funerals, memorials and other services should be held as much as possible. Closer contacts should be signalized and closely followed in order to detect the need for specific interventions. Help seeking behaviors should be promoted. Additionally, people should be educated on suicide and its impacts, in order to reduce stigma.","Pinto, Soares, Silva, Curral, Coelho","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.626807","20210107","COVID-19; complicated grief; intervention; prevention; suicide; suicide survivors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9130,""
"Cannabis and COVID-19: Reasons for Concern","The lockdown measures implemented to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 may affect (illicit) drug consumption patterns. This rapid response study investigated changes in cannabis use in a non-probability sample of cannabis users in the Netherlands during the early lockdown period. We fielded an online cross-sectional survey 4-6 weeks after implementation of lockdown measures in the Netherlands on March 15, 2020. We measured self-reported \motives for changes in use, and assessed cannabis use frequency (use days), number of joints per typical use day, and route of administration in the periods before and after lockdown implementation. 1,563 cannabis users were recruited. Mean age was 32.7 Ã‚Â± 12.0 years; 66.3% were male and 67.9% used cannabis (almost) daily. In total, 41.3% of all respondents indicated that they had increased their cannabis use since the lockdown measures, 49.4% used as often as before, 6.6% used less often, and 2.8% stopped (temporarily). One-third of those who were not daily users before the lockdown became (almost) daily users. Before the lockdown, most respondents (91.4%) used cannabis in a joint mixed with tobacco and 87.6% still did so. Among users of joints, 39.4% reported an increase in the average number consumed per use day; 54.2% stayed the same and 6.4% used fewer joints. This rapid response study found evidence that during the lockdown more users increased rather than decreased cannabis consumption according to both frequency and quantity. These data highlight the need to invest more resources in supporting cessation, harm reduction, and monitoring longer term trends in cannabis use.","van Laar, Oomen, van Miltenburg, Vercoulen, Freeman, Hall","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.601653","20210107","COVID-19; cannabis; corona; risks; route of administration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9131,""
"Prevalence of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms of High School Students in Shandong Province During the COVID-19 Epidemic","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has brought physical risks as well as psychological challenges to the whole world. High school students are a special group suffering from both the academic pressure and the threat of the epidemic. The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the psychological status of high school students in Shandong Province. <b>Methods:</b> Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, data was collected from 1,018 voluntary high school students assessed with demographic information, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and a self-designed online-study effect survey. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationships between depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and study effect. <b>Result:</b> The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 52.4, 31.4, and 26.8%, respectively, among high school students in Shandong Province during the COVID-19 epidemic. And from moderate to severe severity level, the rates of depressive symptoms and anxious symptoms were 17.6 and 4.6%. Female students exhibited a higher rate and severity of mental symptoms than male, and grade one senior high school students got a higher rate and severity of mental symptoms than the other two grades. Nearly half of the students were not satisfied with their online-study effect. The PHQ-9 score had a strong positive correlation with the GAD-7 score. Both the PHQ-9 score the GAD-7 score had a negative correlation with the study-effect survey score. <b>Conclusion:</b> Quite a number of high school students suffered from depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Sufficient attentions should be paid, and necessary supports should be provided, to protect the mental health of this special group.","Zhang, Zhai, Yang, Zhang, Zhou, Yang, Duan, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.570096","20210107","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; high school students; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9132,""
"The Psychological Impact and Associated Factors of COVID-19 on the General Public in Hunan, China","This study aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among the general public in Hunan Province, China, which could help develop psychological interventions and mental health programs. This online cross-sectional study recruited 571 participants through snowball sampling between February 2 and February 5, 2020. Data were collected through a general information questionnaire, the Public Emergency Psychological State Questionnaire, the Simple Coping Style Questionnaire, and the Public Disease Awareness on COVID-19 Scale. The total mean score of the public emergency psychological state of the sample was 0.27 (0.31) points, with only 5.78% of participants (n = 33) developing psychological distress. Avoidant coping style and disease awareness were weakly positively correlated (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.257, p &lt; 0.01) and weakly negatively correlated (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.124, p &lt;0.01) with psychological responses, respectively. There were significant psychological differences among the following variables: occupation, symptoms of fever or fatigue, discernment of the authenticity of COVID-19 information, and level of concern regarding COVID-19 (p &lt; 0.05). The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have had a minor psychological impact on the general population in Hunan Province. However, psychological health promotion in the general public is still required, especially for employees (such as company employees, migrant workers, and businessmen), individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms, limited discernment competence and unconcerned attitudes. The initiatives for improving psychological health among the general public could focus on delivering COVID-19 knowledge and alleviating avoidant coping styles. Our findings could provide important insight for the development of psychological support strategies in China, as well as in other places affected by the epidemic.","Shi, Guo, Luo, Lei, Li","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S280289","20210107","coping style; coronavirus disease 2019; disease awareness; psychological health; public health emergency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9133,""
"How can we build and maintain the resilience of our health care professionals during COVID-19? Recommendations based on a scoping review","To explore how to build and maintain the resilience of frontline healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 outbreak working conditions. Scoping review supplemented with expert interviews to validate the findings. Hospitals. We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, bioRxiv and medRxiv systematically and grey literature for articles focusing on the impact of COVID-19-like working conditions on the physical and/or mental health of healthcare professionals in a hospital setting. Articles using an empirical design about determinants or causes of physical and/or mental health and about interventions, measures and policies to preserve physical and/or mental health were included. Four experts were interviewed to reflect on the results from the scoping review. In total, 4471 records were screened leading to an inclusion of 73 articles. Recommendations prior to the outbreak fostering resilience included optimal provision of education and training, resilience training and interventions to create a feeling of being prepared. Recommendations during the outbreak consisted of (1) enhancing resilience by proper provision of information, psychosocial support and treatment (eg, create enabling conditions such as forming a psychosocial support team), monitoring the health status of professionals and using various forms and content of psychosocial support (eg, encouraging peer support, sharing and celebrating successes), (2) tasks and responsibilities, in which attention should be paid to kind of tasks, task mix and responsibilities as well as the intensity and weight of these tasks and (3) work patterns and working conditions. Findings of the review were validated by experts. Recommendations were developed on how to build and maintain resilience of frontline healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 outbreak working conditions.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak among Jimma University Medical Centere visitors in Southwestern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study","COVID-19 has posed several medical, psychosocial and economic impacts among the majority of the society. The ambiguity of its transmission, the intense desire of self-protection, family, and friends, the unknown impact of catching the disease itself, unstoppable spread, the panic and outright misinformation lead to acute stress reaction syndrome. However, reliable data related to this contagion lack the prevalence of acute stress reaction syndrome and associated factors among Jimma University Medical Centre hospital visitors in Southwestern Ethiopia. The main objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with acute stress reaction syndrome during the COVID-19 outbreak among Jimma University Medical Centre Hospital visitors, Ethiopia. An interviewer-administered cross-sectional study was conducted among 247 visitors of the Jimma University Medical Centre in Ethiopia. The study was conducted within 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of the first COVID-19 cases detected on 13 March 2020 in Ethiopia. Data on demographic and socioeconomic status were collected during the interview using structured questionnaires. The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and symptoms of insomnia were measured using the Insomnia Severity Index. Social support was evaluated using Oslo three-item Social Support Scale. Logistic regression was employed to determine the associations between dependent and independent variables. Besides, psychosocial stress score was generated using principal component analysis. A paired permutation test was also performed to determine the variability of psychosocial stress between groups. The mean age of participants was 30.47 years, and 76.5% of the participants were male. Acute stress reaction syndrome was detected in 44.1% of hospital visitors. Of the participants, 38.5%, 17.4%, 8.5% and 35.6% had a minimal, mild, moderate and severe psychological impact, respectively. Factors positively associated with acute stress reaction syndrome were individuals who perceived that COVID-19 leads to stigma (adjusted OR (AOR): 3.24, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.11 to 9.45), mild insomnia (AOR: 14.74, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 6.14 to 35.40), moderate to severe insomnia (AOR: 35.1, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 10.76 to 114.66), low social support (AOR: 4.08, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.31 to 12.67) and governmental employees (AOR: 8.09, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.38 to 47.18). The study revealed the existence of a high prevalence of acute stress reaction syndrome during the COVID-19 outbreak among different groups of the community.

"Framing global discourses on non-communicable diseases: a scoping review","The choices that policymakers make are shaped by how their problems are framed. At last, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have risen high on the global policy agenda, but there are many disputed issues. First, what are they? Their name refers not to what they are but what they are not. Second, where do their boundaries lie? What diseases are included? Third, should we view their causes as mainly biomedical, behavioural, or social, or a combination? Our failure to resolve these issues has been invoked as a reason for our limited progress in developing and implementing effective remedies. In this scoping review, we ask &quot;What is known from the existing literature about how NCDs are framed in the global policy discourses?&quot; We answer it by reviewing the frames employed in policy and academic discourses. We searched nine electronic databases for articles published since inception to 31 May 2019. We also reviewed websites of eight international organisations to identify global NCDs policies. We extracted data and synthesised findings to identify key thematic frames. We included 36 articles and nine policy documents on global NCDs policies. We identified five discursive domains that have been used and where there are differing perspectives. These are: &quot;Expanding the NCDs frame to include mental health and air pollution&quot;; &quot;NCDs and their determinants&quot;; &quot;A rights-based approach to NCDs&quot;; &quot;Approaches to achieving policy coherence in NCDs globally&quot;; and &quot;NCDs as part of Sustainable Socio-economic Development&quot;. We further identified 12 frames within the five discursive domains. This scoping review identifies issues that remain unresolved and points to a need for alignment of perspectives among global health policy actors, as well as synergies with those working on mental health, maternal health, and child health. The current COVID-19 pandemic warrants greater consideration of its impact on global NCDs policies. Future global strategies for NCDs need to consider explicitly how NCDs are framed in a changing global health discourse and ensure adequate alignment with implementation and global health issues. There is a need for global strategies to recognise the pertinent role of actors in shaping policy discourses.","Tan, Han, Shrestha, Wu, Shiraz, Koh, McKee, Legido-Quigley","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05958-0","20210107","Framing analysis; Health policy; Non-communicable diseases; Policy discourses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9137,""
"Using medical reality television as a technology-enhanced learning strategy to provide authentic patient care experiences during clinical placements: a case study research investigation","Over the last decade, the use of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) has rapidly expanded and diversified. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing demand for distance and online learning strategies to support and even replace learning experiences previously afforded by clinical placements and clerkships. An intriguing but under-researched modality is the use of medical reality television to provide authentic experiences of patient care. This strategy does not feature in published medical educational literature, though promising research is emerging from other disciplines. A programme of learning using medical reality television clips to facilitate case-based learning was developed according to the principles of 'anchored instruction', a technology-based educational theory. Clips were taken from the UK television show '24 hours in A&amp;E'. Medical students' learning experiences were investigated using a qualitative approach addressing the following research questions: - What is the perceived emotional experience of medical students when watching reality television in an educational context? - How do medical students relate their experience of watching reality television in a formal educational setting to their perceived learning needs in the clinical environment? A case study research methodology was adopted within the interpretivist paradigm<sub>.</sub> Data were triangulated from semi-structured interviews with students and non-participant observation of the teaching session. Field notes and transcripts were analysed through an inductive thematic analysis. In response to the medical reality television, a diverse range of emotions were expressed including: excitement, amusement, concern, nervousness, sadness and joy. Students identified gaps in their clinical knowledge such as interpreting results, practical aspects of prescribing and end of life care. Key themes were increased student engagement and a promotion of holistic care practices. Students perceived reality television as a highly realistic and relatable medium and an enjoyable, memorable way to contextualise learning from the classroom to real life, a finding mirrored in previous studies in other fields. The high degree of emotion expressed may explain the improved subjective memorability of the cases. Medical reality television offers a unique means of engaging students by providing authentic experiences of patient care and should be valued alongside other technology-enhanced learning strategies.","Osborne, Harrison, Fisher, Bateman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02432-7","20210107","Case study research; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Distance learning; Education; Emotion; Medical; Medical student; Online learning; Technology-enhanced learning; Television; Undergraduate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9138,""
"Evaluating the impact of Archway: a personalized program for 1st year student success and mental health and wellbeing","First-year students entering postsecondary education must navigate a new and complex academic and social environment. Research indicates that this transition and developmental period can be challenging and stressful - academically, emotionally and socially - and that mental health and wellbeing can be compromised. Additionally, mental health disorders can also compromise students' ability to successfully navigate this transition. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the incoming 2020 cohort of first-year students face heightened and new challenges. Most will have spent the conclusion of high school learning virtually, in quarantine, in an uncertain and difficult time, and are then experiencing their first year of university while living, learning and socializing off-campus, virtually and remotely. In response to COVID-19 and with an appreciation of the considerable stresses students face generally and particularly in 2020-21, and the potential effects on mental health and wellbeing, McMaster University, a mid-sized research intensive university with approximately 30,000 students, has developed an innovative program to support students, called Archway. This initiative has been developed to help to prevent and to intervene early to address common transitional issues students experience that can influence mental health and wellbeing, with the ultimate goals of increasing student connectedness, supports, and retention. The current study will use a mixed-method design to evaluate Archway and gain a better understanding of the transition into first-year postsecondary for students who engage and participate in Archway at various levels. The study will not only help to determine the effect of this program for students during COVID-19, but it will help us to better understand the challenges of this transition more broadly. Findings have the potential to inform future efforts to support students and protect their mental health and wellbeing through the use of virtual and remote platforms and mechanisms that meet their increasingly diverse needs and circumstances.","Kwan, Brown, MacKillop, Beaudette, Van Koughnett, Munn","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-10057-0","20210107","Emerging adulthood; Mental health; Support program; Transition; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9139,""

No matter which classification criteria were used, there was no statistically significant difference in the severity distribution of anxiety and depression among different groups (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05) . <b>Conclusion:</b> The anxiety and depression exist obviously among the medical staff during the epidemic period of the COVID-19, and the psychological intervention should be taken out in time. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥ÂÅ Ã¦â€”Â©Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã¦â€“Â½Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Â¹Â²Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦ÂÂÃ¤Â¾â€ºÃ§Ââ€ Ã¨Â®ÂºÃ¤Â¾ÂÃ¦ÂÂ®Ã£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¤ÂºÅ½2020Ã¥Â¹Â´2Ã¦Å“Ë†18Ã¨â€¡Â³20Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã§â€Â¨Ã£â‚¬Å Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†SASÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ£â‚¬Å Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†SDSÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Â¤Â©Ã¦Â´Â¥Ã¥Â¸â€šÃ¥ÂÅ Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã§Å“ÂÃ¥Â¸â€šÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â²â€”Ã§Å¡â€ž183Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å’â€°Ã§â€¦Â§Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¥Â²â€”Ã¤Â½ÂÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥â€™Å’Ã©ÂÅ¾Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å’â€°Ã§â€¦Â§Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¥Å“Â°Ã§â€šÂ¹Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Â¤Â©Ã¦Â´Â¥Ã¥Â¸â€šÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¥Å¸Â Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Â¤Â©Ã¦Â´Â¥Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¥Å¸Å½Ã¥Â¸â€šÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¥Å¸Â Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ©â‚¬Å¡Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¦â€°â€¹Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ§Â»Ë†Ã§Â«Â¯Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†Â&quot;Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã¦ËœÅ¸&quot;Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·,Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã§Â»â€žÃ¥Ë†Â«Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> 183Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœSASÃ¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¯Â¼Ë†48.96Ã‚Â±9.21Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’SDSÃ¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¯Â¼Ë†56.69Ã‚Â±7.57Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã©Â«ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¦Â¨Â¡[SASÃ¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Ë†33.80Ã‚Â±5.90Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Ë†â€ ,SDSÃ¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Ë†41.88Ã‚Â±10.57Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Ë†â€ ]Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.01Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¦Å“â€°87Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¯Â¼Ë†47.5%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’134Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¯Â¼Ë†73.2%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥ÂË†Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬Â69Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¯Â¼Ë†37.7%Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã§Â»â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœSASÃ¥â€™Å’SDSÃ¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¯Â¼Ë†49.40Ã‚Â±9.77Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¯Â¼Ë†55.76Ã‚Â±6.86Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©ÂÅ¾Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã§Â»â€žSASÃ¥â€™Å’SDSÃ¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¯Â¼Ë†48.69Ã‚Â±8.87Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¯Â¼Ë†57.29Ã‚Â±7.96Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã¦â€”Â Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&gt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã©Â«ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¦Â¨Â¡Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã¥Å¸Â Ã§Â»â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœSASÃ¥â€™Å’SDSÃ¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¯Â¼Ë†48.23Ã‚Â±9.04Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¯Â¼Ë†56.76Ã‚Â±7.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¥Å¸Â Ã§Â»â€žSASÃ¥â€™Å’SDSÃ¦Â â€¡Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¯Â¼Ë†50.63Ã‚Â±9.45Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¯Â¼Ë†56.54Ã‚Â±8.71Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Â¤Ã§Â»â€žÃ¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã¦â€”Â Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&gt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â½â€ Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã©Â«ËœÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã¦Â¨Â¡Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.01Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã§Â»â€žÃ©â€”Â´Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§Å Â¶Ã¦â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Â¸Æ’Ã¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã¦â€”Â Ã§Â»Å¸Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¦â€žÂÃ¤Â¹â€°Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&gt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€š <b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b> Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Å Â¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã§Å½Â°Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Âºâ€Ã§Â»â„¢Ã¤ÂºË†Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Â¹Â²Ã©Â¢â€žÃ£â‚¬â€š.","Li, Wei, Wu, Zhang, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20200227-00091","20210106","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Medical staff; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9141,""

"Pre-pandemic suicidal ideation and preventive behavior during COVID-19: A prospective cohort study","Background: Cross-sectional studies have shown associations between suicide risk factors and COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Aims: We investigated the impact of suicidal ideation on COVID-19 preventive behaviors to augment literature focused on suicide risk factors and COVID-19 preventive health measures. Significant findings may reveal factors that explain dangerous behavior and inspire policy to mitigate negative health outcomes. Method: This study used a prospective observational longitudinal design (n = 6683). A baseline survey (January 24, 2020 = before COVID-19 pandemic, T1) and a follow-up survey (between April 27 and April 30, 2020 = during COVID-19 pandemic, T2) were conducted among the general adult population in Japan. Results: Adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic factors, high suicidal ideation at T1 was associated with significantly low levels of engagement in COVID-19 preventive behaviors at T2. Limitations: As this was an Internet survey and contained selection bias, the sample may not be representative of the general population in Japan. Pandemic severity may impact results in other geographies, reducing the applicability of study findings. Conclusion: Individuals with strong suicidal ideation before the pandemic were less likely to engage in COVID-19 preventive behaviors. These individuals are at risk not only for suicide but also for infectious disease.","Hajime Sueki et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-A18-F8C","20210108","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; suicidal ideation; covid-19; public health; preventive behavior; suicide","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-08","",9145,""
