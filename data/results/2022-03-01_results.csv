"Post-acute symptoms, new onset diagnoses and health problems 6 to 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection: a nationwide questionnaire study in the adult Danish population","Background. A considerable number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 continue to experience symptoms after the acute phase. More information on duration and prevalence of these symptoms in non-hospitalized populations is needed. Methods. We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study including 152 880 individuals aged 15-years or older, consisting of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases between September 2020-April 2021 (N=61 002) and a corresponding test-negative control group (N=91 878). Data were collected 6, 9 or 12 months after the test using web-based questionnaires. The questionnaire covered acute and post-acute symptoms, selected diagnoses, sick leave and general health, together with demographics and life style at baseline. Risk differences (RDs) between test-positives and -negatives were reported, adjusted for age, sex, single comorbidities, Charlson comorbidity score, obesity and healthcare-occupation. Findings. Six to twelve months after the test date, the risks of 18 out of 21 physical symptoms were elevated among test-positives and one third (29.6%) of the test-positives experienced at least one physical post-acute symptom. The largest risk differences were observed for dysosmia (RD = 10.92%, 95%CI 10.68-11.21%), dysgeusia (RD=8.68%, 95%CI 8.43-8.93%), fatigue/exhaustion (RD=8.43%, 95%CI 8.14-8.74%), dyspnea (RD=4.87%, 95%CI 4.65-5.09%) and reduced strength in arms/legs (RD=4.68%, 95%CI 4.45-4.89%). More than half (53.1%) of test-positives reported at least one of the following conditions: concentration difficulties (RD=28.34%, 95%CI 27.34-28.78%), memory issues (RD=27.25%, 95%CI 26.80-27.71%), sleep problems (RD=17.27%, 95%CI 16.81-17.73%), mental (RD=32.58%, 95%CI 32.11-33.09%) or physical exhaustion (RD=40.45%, 95%CI 33.99-40.97%), compared to 11.5% of test-negatives. New diagnoses of anxiety (RD=1.15%, 95%CI 0.95-1.34%) or depression (RD=1.00%, 95%CI 0.81-1.19%) were also more common among test-positives. Interpretation. At the population-level, where the majority of test-positives (96.0%) were not hospitalized during acute infection, a considerable proportion experience post-acute symptoms and sequelae 6-12 months after infection.

"A biopsychosocial model of severe fear of COVID-19","COVID-19 is a respiratory infection that causes not only somatic health issues, but also frequently psychosocial burdens. The aims of this study were to investigate biopsychosocial factors that might further aggravate fear of COVID-19, and to establish a biopsychosocial model of severe fear of COVID-19. 368 participants were included in this study. Biopsychosocial factors observed comprised biological factors (somatic risk), psychological factors (state/trait anxiety, physical symptoms of anxiety, severe health anxiety, specific phobias, depression), and psychosocial factors (social support, financial losses, social media consumption, social contacts with COVID-19 infected people). Psychometric questionnaires included State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck's Anxiety Inventory, Whiteley-Index / Illness Attitude Scales, Specific Phobia Questionnaire, WHO-5 and Social Support Survey. 162/368 (44.0%) participants had almost no fear, 170/368 (46.2%) participants had moderate fear, and 45/368 (12.2%) participants had severe fear of COVID-19. Female participants showed higher levels of fear of COVID-19 than male participants (gender: Ãâ€¡2 = 18.47, p&lt;0.001). However, the level of fear of COVID-19 increased in male participants when they had contact with people who were infected with COVID-19, while in contrast the level of fear of COVID-19 decreased in female participants when they had such contacts [ANCOVA: fear of COVID-19 (contact x gender): F(1,363) = 5.596, p = .019]. Moreover, participants without relationships showed higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (marital status: Ãâ€¡2 = 14.582, p = 0.024). Furthermore, financial losses due to the COVID-19 were associated with higher levels of fear of COVID-19 [ANCOVA: fear of COVID-19(financial loss x gender): F(1, 363) = 22.853, p&lt; .001]. Multiple regression analysis revealed female gender, severe health anxiety (WI-IAS) and state /trait anxiety (STAI) as significant predictors of severe fear of COVID-19. In this study significant predictors of severe fear of COVID-19 were female gender, pre-existing state and trait anxiety, as well as severe health anxiety. The finding of significant predictors of fear of COVID-19 might contribute to detect people who might suffer most from severe, overwhelming fear of COVID-19 at an early stage.","NÃƒÂ¼rnberger, von Lewinski, RothenhÃƒÂ¤usler, Braun, Reinbacher, Kolesnik, Baranyi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264357","20220228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27641,""
"Medical education and mental health during COVID-19: a survey across 9 countries","To investigate students' experience with medical education alongside their mental and physical health since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic across nine countries. A cross-sectional online survey was distributed by local collaborators to 2,280 medical students across 148 medical schools in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and Venezuela using non-probability convenience sampling from June 22 to July 24, 2020. Students answered questions regarding teaching, internet use, COVID-19, physical and mental well-being. A multivariate logistic regression examined factors associated with depressed mood, insomnia, and headache. Academic teaching shifted to a virtual (67%, n=1,534) or hybrid environment (23%, n=531), whilst bedside teaching was suspended or cancelled (93%, n=2,120). Across all countries students were equally satisfied with the teaching modality, quantity, quality, and the evaluation system of in-person, hybrid, and online curricula. Negative changes in mental (40% (n=912) insomnia, 57% (n=1,300) emotional irritability, 47% (n=1,072) emotional instability, 41% (n=935) anhedonia, 40% (n=912) depressed mood) and physical (36% (n=821) headache, 57% (n=1,299) ocular tiredness, 49% (n=1,117) backache) health symptoms were frequently observed. Positive associations between the number of daily screen hours and depressed mood (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.09, 95%CI: 1.05-1.12, p&lt;.001), insomnia (AOR=1.08, 95%CI: 1.05-1.11, p&lt;.001), and headache (AOR=1.11, 95%CI: 1.07-1.14, p&lt;.001) were identified. Students' experience with digital and hybrid medical curricula was diverse during the pandemic. Education modality, quantity, and quality were positively evaluated. However, students' mental and physical health worsened. Besides bedside teaching, faculties ought to digitalize and strengthen social communities and extend support services for students.","Michaeli, Keough, Perez-Dominguez, Polanco-Ilabaca, Pinto-Toledo, Michaeli, Albers, Achiardi, Santana, Urnelli, Sawaguchi, RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Maldonado, Raffeeq, de Araujo Madeiros, Michaeli","https://doi.org/10.5116/ijme.6209.10d6","20220228","covid-19; depression; insomnia; medical student; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27642,""
"Opportunities to expand access to mental health services: A case for the role of online peer support communities","This study investigated whether with disruptions in care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, persons who self-identified as living with a mental health condition increased their usage of an online peer support community. We also explored whether study participants who self-reported usage of online peer support communities were interested in using these communities to connect with evidence-based interventions and mental health services. This study employed a cross-sectional online survey design. The survey was disseminated by the Inspire online peer support community and Mental Health America through various social media channels. Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted to summarize participant demographics, investigate patterns of use of online peer support communities, and interest in accessing additional programs through these platforms. There were 369 survey respondents, with a mean age of 49 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.6), of which 77% were female. Most respondents self-reported having depression (34%), post-traumatic stress disorder (25%), and anxiety-related conditions (20%). The number of respondents who reported accessing online peer support platforms multiple times a day appeared to double after March 2020. We also found an overall positive association between frequency of community use and self-reported benefit to mental health. Approximately 81% of respondents expressed interest in accessing mental health services via an online peer support community. Persons who self-report living with mental health conditions and who engage in online peer support communities expressed interest in accessing evidence-based interventions via these online platforms. Participants were most interested in services related to enhancing coping mechanisms and skills, enabling overall wellbeing, and accessing therapy.","Merchant, Goldin, Manjanatha, Harter, Chandler, Lipp, Nguyen, Naslund","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-022-09974-7","20220228","Digital peer support; Early intervention; Mental health; Online communities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27643,""
"How did we get here and where do we go from here?: Supporting undocumented students through a pandemic","Communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, exposing the influence of decades of policies that have under-resourced and marginalized these communities. The history of segregation and inadequate funding in education has been exacerbated by the pandemic, compounding the educational inequities already present in the United States. The intersection of this inequity alongside immigration policies over the past years have led the undocumented student population to be adversely impacted. The lack of access to health care and social safety net programs, fear of deportation, and an over reliance on technology for schooling leaves a large segment of students vulnerable for adverse academic, emotional, and social outcomes. This paper will trace the historical path of educational segregation, immigration policies, and how these led to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on undocumented students. It will discuss interventions for undocumented students within an antioppressive ecological framework and the ethical responsibilities that school-based mental health professionals have to support undocumented students to fulfill their highest potential, manage the emotional toll of the pandemic, and advocate for change in immigration and educational policies.

"How social support and parent-child relationship quality relate to LGBTQ+ college students' well-being during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted the well-being of many college students, particularly lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ +) students who are already at a disproportionate risk for negative mental health and well-being outcomes. To identify potential risk and protective factors we examined LGBTQ + college students' disclosure of sexual orientation, gender identity, or both (SOGI) to mothers and fathers, living arrangements (whether or not students lived with mothers and fathers), social support from family and friends, and parent-child relationship quality and their association with stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and problem drinking during the pandemic. LGBTQ + college students (<i>N</i> = 366; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 20.4) completed an online survey. Students who reported more social support from family and friends and better quality relationships with mothers or fathers had better well-being and were less likely to perceive a substantial decrease in their well-being due to the pandemic. In contrast, SOGI disclosure and whether or not students lived with mothers or fathers were generally unrelated to well-being. Findings suggest that universities should consider offering mental health resources for students living on- and off-campus, and that clinical professionals should consider strategies to help these young adults identify and maintain support systems and highlight the value of positive parent-child relationships.

"Discovering emotional patterns for climate change and for the COVID-19 pandemic in university students","The global crises of climate change and of the COVID-19 pandemic are straining young peoples' mental health and their mitigation behaviours. We surveyed German-speaking university students aged 18 to 30 years on their negative emotions regarding both crises repeatedly before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Different emotional patterns emerged for climate change and for COVID-19 with negative emotions regarding COVID-19 increasing during the pandemic. We were further able to differentiate between emotional responses associated with impaired wellbeing and those associated with mitigation efforts. Our findings emphasise the need to focus on a mixture of highly inactivating and activating emotions regarding COVID-19 as they are associated with both reduced wellbeing and mitigation behaviours. The findings broaden the understanding of how young adults react to the burden of two global crises and what role negative emotions play.","Kulcar, Siller, Juen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joclim.2022.100125","20220228","COVID-19; climate change; emotions; mental health; mitigation behavior; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27646,""
"Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Associated with Anxiety and Depression among Non-Hispanic Whites with Chronic Conditions in the US","During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, increased anxiety and depression were reported, with mixed findings among individuals of different races/ethnicities. This study examines whether anxiety and depression increased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVD-19 period among different racial/ethnic groups in the US. The Health Information National Trend Surveys 5 (HINTS 5) Cycle 4 data was analyzed. We used the time when the survey was administered as the pre-COVID-19 period (before March 11, 2020, weighted NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯77,501,549) and during the COVID-19 period (on and after March 11, 2020, weighted NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯37,222,019). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) was used to measure anxiety/depression and further compared before and during COVID-19. Separate multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with anxiety/depression after adjusting for age, sex, insurance, income, and education. A higher percentage of Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) with chronic conditions reported anxiety (24.3% vs. 11.5%, p=0.0021) and depression (20.7% vs. 9.3%, p=0.0034) during COVID-19 than pre-COVID-19. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of anxiety and depression for NHWs with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic was 2.02 (95% confidence interval of 1.10-3.73, p=0.025) and 2.33 (1.17-4.65, p=0.018) compared to NHWs who participated in the survey before the COVID-19. Limited to the NHW US population. PHQ can only be used as the initial screening tool.

"Developing public transport messaging to provide crowding information during COVID-19: Application of the COM-B model and behaviour change wheel","The COVID-19 outbreak meant that using public transport was potentially unsafe for risk of catching and transmitting the virus. UK anxiety is high with lockdowns preventing a normal way of life for over a year. A lack of ability to travel freely causes numerous declines in quality of life including social isolation and poor physical and mental health. People need crowding information to choose safer travel options and subdue coronavirus. To provide effective guidance, it is essential to empirically formulate messaging to create clarity and trust which can be acted upon in confidence. Behaviour Change Techniques incorporating the Behaviour Change Wheel and COM-B model have been utilised in vast areas of public health intervention development and messaging. There is consensus that public transport information needs to be clearer and more accessible but BCTs have not been utilised in the development of public transport advice. This paper outlines the development of crowding messaging for public transport on a platform available to UK travellers. Barriers and facilitators were explored; related behaviours, intervention functions and behaviour change techniques were mapped. Specific message phrasing was developed utilising the mapped functions and advice from the literature. With the COVID-19 outbreak, having accessible and effective messaging for safely using public transport is a continuation of the work recently conducted examining the best ways to present public health information. It is important to be transparent when developing messaging and interventions accessible to the public and this work forms a basis for continued exploration and development in this area.","Krusche, Wilde, Ghio, Morrissey, Froom, Chick","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2022.100564","20220228","Behaviour change; COVID-19; Crowding information; Intervention development public health messages; Public transport","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27648,""
"Validity and reliability of a modified short version of a stigma scale for use among Tunisian COVID-19 patients after quarantine: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 is a stigmatizing infectious disease even after healing. Until now, no COVID-19 stigma scale validated in Tunisian Arabic language among the general population is available. Developing such tools is necessary to detect COVID-19 stigma and reduce it effectively. Indeed, stigmatization of COVID-19 patients could increase the spread of this disease and its related mental health issues. We aimed at testing the validity of a translated and modified version of the 12-item HIV stigma scale among Tunisian COVID-19 patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted between November and December 2020 among a representative sample of COVID-19 patients in the governorate of Sousse, Tunisia, after quarantine. The 12-item HIV stigma scale was translated in Tunisian Arabic and then modified to be adapted to the Tunisian context. The preliminary modified version was administrated to the participants by pretrained medical doctors during phone calls. It consisted on 20 items covering the four stigma dimensions (personalized stigma, disclosure concerns, concerns with public attitudes, and negative self-image). The psychometric evaluation of this version included internal consistency as well as principal component analysis (PCA). The responses of 346 COVID-19 patients were obtained. Their median age was 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (interquartile range: 30-54.5). Females represented 60.4% of them. The PCA resulted in a three factor solution with 14 items. This 14-item scale demonstrated good internal consistency with a global Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± of 0.91 and values of 0.94, 0.93, and 0.98 for social stigma, negative self-image, and disclosure concerns, respectively. This study provides a reliable and valid instrument for stigma measuring among Tunisian COVID-19 patients. The use of this scale would contribute in reducing the spread of this new infectious disease and its related mental health issues.","Mlouki, Zammit, Ghammem, Ben Fredj, Bannour, El Echi, Ladhari, Haddedi, Ghodhbani, Maatoug, Ghannem","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.520","20220228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27649,""

"Unraveling Muscle Impairment Associated With COVID-19 and the Role of 3D Culture in Its Investigation","COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been considered a public health emergency, extensively investigated by researchers. Accordingly, the respiratory tract has been the main research focus, with some other studies outlining the effects on the neurological, cardiovascular, and renal systems. However, concerning SARS-CoV-2 outcomes on skeletal muscle, scientific evidence is still not sufficiently strong to trace, treat and prevent possible muscle impairment due to the COVID-19. Simultaneously, there has been a considerable amount of studies reporting skeletal muscle damage in the context of COVID-19. Among the detrimental musculoskeletal conditions associated with the viral infection, the most commonly described are sarcopenia, cachexia, myalgia, myositis, rhabdomyolysis, atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© Syndrome. Of note, the risk of developing sarcopenia during or after COVID-19 is relatively high, which poses special importance to the condition amid the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The yet uncovered mechanisms by which musculoskeletal injury takes place in COVID-19 and the lack of published methods tailored to study the correlation between COVID-19 and skeletal muscle hinder the ability of healthcare professionals to provide SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with an adequate treatment plan. The present review aims to minimize this burden by both thoroughly exploring the interaction between COVID-19 and the musculoskeletal system and examining the cutting-edge 3D cell culture techniques capable of revolutionizing the study of muscle dynamics.","Seixas, Mitre, Shams, Lanzuolo, Bartolomeo, Silva, Prado, Ureshino, Stilhano","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.825629","20220228","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; biomaterials; inflammation; skeletal muscle","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27651,""
"Release and Demand of Public Health Information in Social Media During the Outbreak of COVID-19 in China","Information release is a key to the macro-economy during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Diosease-2019 (COVID-19). To explore the relationship between information supply by the government and public information demand in the pandemic, this study collected over 4,000 posts published on the most popular social media platform, i.e., WeChat. Many approaches, such as text mining, are employed to explore the information at different stages during the pandemic. According to the results, the government attached great importance to the information related to the pandemic. The main topics of information released by the government included the latest situation of the pandemic, announcements by the State Council, and prevention policies for COVID-19. Information mismatch between the public and Chinese governments contributed to the economic depression caused by the pandemic. Specifically, the topics of ""the latest situation"" and ""popular scientific knowledge regarding the pandemic"" have gained the most attention of the public. The information demand of the public has changed from the pandemic itself to the recovery of social life and industrial activities after the authority announced the control of the pandemic. However, during the recession phase, the information demand has shifted to asymptomatic infections and global pandemic trends. By contrast, some of the main topics provided by the government, such as ""How beautiful you are,"" were excessive because the public demand is insufficient. Therefore, severe mismatches existed between information release of the government and public information demand during the pandemic, which impeded the recovery of the economy. The results in this study provide strategical suggestions of information release and opinion guidance for the authorities.","Tang, Wu, Chen, Lu, Zhang, Xu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.829589","20220228","COVID-19; economy recovery; information demand; information supply; social media; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27652,""
"Factors Associated With Underprivileged E-Learning, Session Jam Phobia, and the Subsequent Mental Distress Among Students Following the Extended University Closure in Bangladesh","Severe session jam phobia (SJP), the extent of underprivileged online education, and subsequent mental health disorders among students have emerged as distinguished global problems due to the overwhelming effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this research was to evaluate the impact of extended COVID-19 lockdown and its mediating factors on current e-Learning activities, the prevalence of severe SJP and psychological distress among university students in Bangladesh. A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted to assemble responses through Google Form by applying a simple snowball sampling technique among university students aged 18 years or above in Bangladesh. All ethical considerations were maintained, and univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were employed to analyze the acquired data set. Among the total analyzed data (<i>n</i> = 1,122), the male and female ratio was almost 1:1, and a remarkable segment (63.7%) was aged between 21-24 years. Alarmingly, around 50-60% of the students were suffering from severe SJP, prevailing underprivileged education in the e-Learning platform, and severe mental distress. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that the students from public universities, lower- and mid-income families, lower-aged, and junior years education groups were significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) more underprivileged than their counter groups. Besides, the monthly family income and university type significantly influenced the extent of severe SJP. Finally, the students who were female, rustic, come from low-income families (below 25,000 BDT), who had academic uncertainty, job insecurity, online exam phobia, and dissatisfaction with e-Learning education, were significantly suffering from moderate to severe mental distress. The current evidence demonstrates that a substantial number of Bangladeshi university students are struggling with extreme session jam phobia, underprivileged e-Learning education, and subsequent psychological distress, which need to be immediately addressed through concerted efforts by the government, parents, and university authorities.","Hossain, Ahmmed, Sarker, Sarwar, Bari, Khan, Shahriar, Rafi, Emran, Mitra, Islam, Mohamed","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.807474","20220228","Bangladesh; prolonged COVID-19 lockdown; psychological distress; severe fear of session jam; underprivileged online education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27653,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Cancer Patients in Germany: Impact on Treatment, Follow-Up Care and Psychological Burden","In response to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments imposed various measures to decrease the rate of disease spread, and health care policy makers prioritized resource allocation to accommodate COVID-19 patients. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in Germany (July 2020-June 2021) to assess the frequency of changes to cancer care among cancer patients and to explore the psychological impact of the pandemic writ large. Cancer patients who contacted the Cancer Information Service (Krebsinformationsdienst, KID) of the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, DKFZ) via email were invited to complete an online questionnaire, capturing demographics, cancer specifics (e.g., type, disease phase, primary place of treatment, etc.), and any changes to their medical, follow-up, psycho-oncological or nursing care. General level of psychological distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) along with face-validated items regarding worries and social isolation specific to the pandemic. In total, 13% of 621 patients reported a change to their treatment or care plan. Of those patients with changes, the majority of changes were made to follow-up care after treatment (56%), to monitoring during treatment (29%) and to psychological counseling (20%). Of the overall sample, more than half of patients (55%) reported symptoms of anxiety and 39% reported symptoms of depression. Patients with a change in cancer care were more likely to report symptoms of depression than those with no change (AOR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.26-3.76). Concern about the pandemic affecting the quality of health care was a predictor of both anxiety (AOR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.75-4.35) and depression (AOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.43-3.23). Results showed that the majority of cancer patients in our study did not experience a change in their cancer care. However, the level of anxiety and psycho-social burden of cancer patients during the pandemic was high throughout the study period. Our findings underscore the need for health care services and policy makers to assess and to attend cancer patients' medical needs, with added emphasis on patients' psychological and social well-being. This applies particularly in situations where the healthcare system is strained and prioritization is necessary.","Eckford, Gaisser, Arndt, Baumann, Kludt, Mehlis, Ubels, Winkler, Weg-Remers, Schlander","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.788598","20220228","COVID-19; anxiety; cancer care; changes in treatment; depression; health care management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27654,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health Outcomes of Healthy Children, Children With Special Health Care Needs and Their Caregivers-Results of a Cross-Sectional Study","Several studies have described widening inequalities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly for adult populations. Children and adolescents are particularly impacted by the indirect effects of the pandemic and lockdown measures, such as reduced access to or delays in health care and school closures. National surveys in several countries also show a rising mental health burden in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children with special health care needs are a particularly vulnerable group in this context as they rely on a wide range of services, which were mostly suspended during the first wave of the pandemic. This study aims: (1) to describe the mental health outcomes of children with and without special healthcare needs and of their caregivers following the first national lockdown in Germany; (2) to investigate variations in mental health outcomes and measures of pandemic burden according to socioeconomic status; (3) to assess the impact of socioeconomic status, disease complexity and psychosocial burden on parent-reported child mental health problems. We conducted an online survey among 1,619 caregivers of children aged 1-18 years from August 11th until October 5th 2020. Participants were recruited both from families of children with special healthcare needs and of healthy children. Inequalities were analysed by descriptive statistics, simple and hierarchical logistic regression modelling to explore the association between socioeconomic status and psychological outcome measures, disease complexity and general burden related to COVID-19. There was a high prevalence of 57.4% of parent-reported mental health problems in children and of a positive screening score for depression in 30.9% of parents. Parent-reported mental health problems were more likely to affect children with low socioeconomic status, with complex chronic disease and those whose parents screened positive for depression. This study highlights inequalities in parent-reported child mental health outcomes by socioeconomic status and disease complexity in a large sample of German families with and without children with special health care needs. Political measures should put children at the centre and aim to mitigate the unequal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly on the mental health of vulnerable children.","Geweniger, Barth, Haddad, HÃƒÂ¶gl, Insan, Mund, Langer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.759066","20220228","COVID-19; caregivers; children with special healthcare needs; inequalities; mental health; pandemic; socioeconomic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27655,""
"Long COVID in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study","We aimed to evaluate the Long COVID frequency, and related factors in patients followed up after hospitalization. This retrospective cohort study included 133 inpatients with COVID-19 PCR test positivity from Nigde Province, Turkey between 01.01.2021 and 28.02.2021. The characteristics of the patients were recorded by examining the files, and the symptom questioning was made by telephone interviewing with the patients approximately four months after the date of diagnosis. The presence of at least one symptom lasting more than four weeks was described as Long COVID. The frequency of Long COVID was 64.7%. The most common Long COVID symptoms were fatigue (45.9%), respiratory distress (25.6%), and muscle / joint pain (24.8%), respectively. In comparison analysis to identify factors associated with Long COVID; Long COVID was found to be more frequent among women (<i>P</i>=0.04); patients with severe COVID-19 (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), patients with prolonged hospital stay (<i>P</i>=0.03), patients with the comorbid disease (<i>P</i>=0.03), and Diabetes Mellitus patients (<i>P</i>=0.02). Additionally, the frequency of Long COVID increased as the depression score stated by the person increased after COVID-19 disease (<i>P</i>=0.02).

"Loneliness, positive, negative and disorganised Schizotypy before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Loneliness is common in psychosis and occurs along a continuum. Here we investigate inter-relationships between loneliness, three-dimensional schizotypy, and depressive symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample included 507 university students (48.3% participated before and 51.7% during the COVID-19 pandemic) who completed the Multidimensional Schizotypy Scale-Brief, the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms depression scale and the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale. Schizotypy and depression scores were regressed onto loneliness individually and in multiple regressions. The cohorts did not differ in any of the schizotypy domains (all <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.29). Depressive symptoms (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.05) and loneliness (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.006) were higher during the pandemic than before. Across cohorts, loneliness was significantly associated with positive (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.23, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001), negative (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.44, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001), and disorganised schizotypy (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.44, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001), and with depression (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.72, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001).

"Stress, PTSD, and COVID-19: the Utility of Disaster Mental Health Interventions During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In the context of an ongoing, highly uncertain pandemic, disaster mental health measures can increase community capacity for resilience and well-being, support formal mental health treatment, and help address the risk for mental health reactions in high-stress occupations. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature on disaster mental health interventions that have been helpful both prior to and during the pandemic in a broad range of applications, including for use with high-stress occupations in an effort to mitigate risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health sequelae. Evidence-based and evidence-informed disaster mental health interventions, frameworks, and treatments have been studied in pilot studies, non-randomized trials, and randomized clinical trials prior to and in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The studies have demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of these modalities and improved perceived support, as well as significant reductions in distress, and mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. A disaster mental health approach to the COVID-19 pandemic can generate opportunities for prevention and support at multiple levels with timely interventions tailored for different concerns, cultures, and available resources.","Watson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40501-021-00253-z","20220228","COVID-19; Early intervention; PTSD; Public mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27658,""

"Depression, COVID-19 Anxiety, Subjective Well-being, and Academic Performance in University Students With COVID-19-Infected Relatives: A Network Analysis","This study aimed to examine the relationship between anxiety, depression, subjective well-being, and academic performance in Peruvian university health science students with COVID-19-infected relatives. Eight hundred two university students aged 17-54Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (Mean 21.83; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.31); 658 females (82%) and 144 males (18%); who completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Subjective Well-being Scale (SWB), and Self-reporting of Academic Performance participated. A partial unregularized network was estimated using the ggmModSelect function. Expected influence (EI) values were calculated to identify the central nodes and a two-tailed permutation test for the difference between the two groups (COVID-19 infected and uninfected). The results reveal that a depression and well-being node (PHQ1-SWB3) presents the highest relationship. The most central nodes belonged to COVID-19 anxiety, and there are no global differences between the comparison networks; but at the local level, there are connections in the network of COVID-19-infected students that are not in the group that did not present this diagnosis.

"Does Playing Apart Really Bring Us Together? Investigating the Link Between Perceived Loneliness and the Use of Video Games During a Period of Social Distancing","During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries implemented social distancing measures to contain virus transmission. However, these vital safety measures have the potential to impair mental health or wellbeing, for instance, from increased perceived loneliness. Playing social video games may offer a way to continue to socialize while adhering to social distancing measures. To examine this issue further, the present online survey investigated social gaming during the pandemic and its association to perceived loneliness within a German-speaking sample. Results indicated a small positive correlation between general gaming frequency and perceived loneliness. Detailed analysis revealed a negative association between perceived loneliness and increased social forms of video gaming. Specifically, gamers with a higher social motive for gaming perceived less loneliness, but gamers with a dominant escape motive demonstrated a positive link to perceived loneliness. The use of social gaming in times of social distancing seems to play a small but significant factor in perceived loneliness compared to other demographical data. The findings are discussed with respect to methodological limitations, effect sizes, and sample characteristics. The results enrich the current knowledge on video gaming and its link to social wellbeing and provide a more nuanced picture than simplistic investigations of screen time.","Nebel, Ninaus","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.683842","20220228","COVID-19; gaming frequency; gaming motives; loneliness; mental health; social gaming","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27661,""

"Anxiety, Depression, and Stress Are Associated With Internet Gaming Disorder During COVID-19: Fear of Missing Out as a Mediator","Many teenagers suffered negative emotional states, especially anxiety and depression, during the COVID-19 outbreak, and most teenagers choose Internet games to cope with negative emotion. Previous evidence indicated that fear of missing out is related with anxiety and depression in teenagers with Internet gaming disorder, but it is unclear how fear of missing out influences depression, anxiety, or stress. Based on an I-PACE model, using Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), Fear of Missing Out Scale, and Internet Gaming Addiction Scale, and 324 middle school students as participants, this study explored the mediating effect of fear of missing out on depression, anxiety, or stress and Internet gaming disorder. The results showed that depression and stress are significantly related to Internet gaming disorder through the partial mediating of fear of missing out. Anxiety is not significantly related to Internet gaming disorder through the full mediating of fear of missing out, and anxiety and stress have a greater predictive effect on Internet gaming disorder through fear of missing out. Results also demonstrated that students who play Honor of Kings or Player Unknown's Battlegrounds have more risk to develop Internet gaming disorder. The results indicated that fear of missing out as a mediator regulates the relationship among depression, anxiety, and stress and Internet game disorder. Specifically, under the mediation of fear of missing out, teenagers with anxiety are more likely to develop Internet gaming disorder, while teenagers with depression or stress might be prone to other types of Internet use disorders.","Wang, Liu, Zhang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.827519","20220228","anxiety; depression; fear of missing out; internet gaming disorder; stress; teenagers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27663,""
"Depression, Anxiety and Sleep Alterations in Caregivers of Persons With Dementia After 1-Year of COVID-19 Pandemic","Social isolation due to COVID-19 pandemic has an important psychological impact particularly in persons with dementia and their informal caregivers. To assess frequency and severity of long-term stress-related symptoms in caregivers of patients with dementia 1-year after the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic and to identify predictors of psychological outcomes. Eighty-five caregivers were involved in a longitudinal study with 1-year follow-up during pandemic in Italy. At baseline in April 2020 a telephone interview assessed socio-demographic characteristics of caregivers and self-perception of distress symptoms. After 1 year, between March and April 2021, the same standardized interview was delivered to the caregivers' sample. In addition, scales assessing levels of depression and anxiety (DASS-21), sleep disturbances (PSQI) and coping strategies (COPE-NVI) were administered to the caregivers and to 50 age and sex-matched non-caregivers subjects. Linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the power of baseline variables to predict long-term psychological outcomes. After 1 year of pandemic frequency of caregivers' stress-related symptoms increased respect to baseline: depression (60 vs. 5, 9%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), anxiety (45, 9 vs. 29, 4%; <i>p</i> = 0.035), irritability (49, 4 vs. 24, 7%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and anguish (31, 7 vs. 10, 6%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Frequency of severe depression was higher in caregivers than in non-caregivers (<i>p</i> = 0.002) although mean levels of depression were comparable in the two groups. Long-term higher depression was predicted by a model built on baseline information (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.53, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) where being female (t = -3.61, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), having lower education (t = -2.15, <i>p</i> = 0.04), presence of feelings of overwhelm (t = 2.29, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and isolation (t = 2.12, <i>p</i> = 0.04) were significant predictors. Female sex was also predictive of anxiety (t = -2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and poor sleep quality (t = -2.17, <i>p</i> = 0.03). At 1 year follow-up caregivers of patients with dementia reported higher prevalence of all stress-related symptoms respect to the acute phase of lockdown, particularly depression. Long-lasting stressful conditions may cause exhaustion of resilience factors and increased depression.

"Covid-19 and Increased Risk of Physician Suicide: A Call to Detoxify the US Medical System","Suicide among physicians is a longstanding problem, with risk factors exacerbated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this article, we explore suicidal thoughts and behaviors among physicians and risk factors created or intensified by the work environment, such as overwork and loss of autonomy. We discuss the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has made the medical work environment more stressful (e.g. greater exposure to traumatic experiences and employment insecurity) and, consequently, elevated physician suicide risk. We also review evidence that the medical system in the United States has not adequately protected physicians' mental health. Lack of confidentiality, stigma, cost, and time, as well as intrusive medical licensing applications, remain barriers to physicians seeking help. Work pressures imposed by insurance companies and financial incentives to increase revenue while cutting costs compound physicians' work stress. We conclude that system-wide changes to the practice of medicine and policies regarding healthcare delivery are needed to improve physicians' work environments, as is research addressing the impact of the interventions to reduce their suicidal risk. The proposed changes, and greater access to timely and confidential mental health services amid and in the aftermath of the pandemic, may prove promising approaches to reduce physicians' suicide risk.","Kakarala, Prigerson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.791752","20220228","COVID-19; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; medical licensing; physician burnout; physician mental health; physician suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27665,""

The time and effort necessary for residents to devote to standarized training is extensive. Anxiety and depression can negatively affect professional development and work efficacy. The study aimed to assess the psychosocial effects of the hospital reappraisal during the post-pandemic era of COVID-19 and analyze potential risk factors leading to their symptoms of anxiety and depression. In March 2021, the ""Questionnaire Star"" electronic questionnaire system was used to collect data. A total of 96 resident doctors from the affiliated hospital of the medical school of Ningbo University were invited to complete the questionnaires. According to our study, the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in the resident doctors in the institution was 61.5 and 59.4%, respectively. The residents who were worried about clinical skills tend to have anxiety symptoms under online education (OR = 3.436, 95%CI: 1.122-10.526). Compared with participants who were assigned by other hospitals, social trainees (OR: 7.579, 95%CI: 1.747-32.885), and full-time masters (OR: 5.448, 95% CI: 1.586-18.722) were more likely to have anxiety symptoms. Participants without a labor contract (OR = 3.257, 95% CI: 1.052-10.101) had a high risk of depression symptoms. Participants who spent more time learning the details prepared for the tertiary hospital reappraisal were significantly more likely to develop anxiety and depressive symptoms.

"Accelerated HE digitalisation: Exploring staff and student experiences of the COVID-19 rapid online-learning transfer","In the UK, the first 'lockdown' of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid shift to online learning and digital technologies in Higher Education (HE). While the situation was unprecedented, extant literature on online learning suggested there would be challenges, opportunities, and benefits to this transition, and we sought to understand these via a case study of one UK HEI department at this time. To draw out in-depth and nuanced accounts of this (at time of investigation-unstudied) scenario, qualitative data were collected via semi-structured online interview or written reflection. To explore, identify and understand the experiences from both sides, and with a diverse sample, we purposively recruited both staff (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) and students (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12), from various roles and backgrounds, including those with additional learning and/or mental health needs. The 'bricolage' data were analysed inductively, utilising a latent reflexive approach, and organised into a framework around five core themes: 'methods and means of engagement'; 'learning maintenance, destruction and construction'; 'remote education and resource accessibility and literacy'; 'support and communication'; and 'life and learning: responses, adaptations and impacts'. Within these, a range of challenges, successes and, most importantly, future learning and innovation outcomes were identified by staff and students, particularly relevant to working with and supporting students with additional needs in the online learning forum. These discoveries informed a set of practical recommendations, provided here in Box 1, for (rapid implementation of) online learning (in times of stress).","Nicklin, Wilsdon, Chadwick, Rhoden, Ormerod, Allen, Witton, Lloyd","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-10899-8","20220228","COVID-19; Education Innovation; Higher education; Online learning; Qualitative; Rapid Transition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27667,""

"Relationships among adult playfulness, stress, and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic created high levels of stress that negatively affect mental health and well-being. The stress and coping process is influenced by individual difference factors, such as personality, that impact perceptual processes and emotional reactions. Adult playfulness is a personality characteristic that may lead to better mental and physical health outcomes. We test a theoretical model to determine whether the two factors of perceived stress, perceived self-efficacy (PSE) and perceived helplessness (PH), mediate the relationship among playfulness and coping in adults (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°694). Scores on the Perceived Stress Scale were high indicating high levels of pandemic-related stress. The SEM model demonstrated direct effects of playfulness on PSE, PH, adaptive, maladaptive, and supportive coping. Both dimensions of perceived stress were partial mediators in the relationship among playfulness and coping outcomes. Findings illustrate the pathways by which adult playfulness can amplify or attenuate the impact of stress perceptions on coping strategies. The importance of building psychological resources such as playfulness to boost adaptive outcomes in stressful situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed.

"Women's well-being during a pandemic and its containment","The COVID-19 pandemic brought the dual crises of disease and the containment policies designed to mitigate it. Yet, there is little evidence on the impacts of these policies on women in lower-income countries, where there may be limited social safety nets to absorb these shocks. We conduct a large phone survey and leverage India's geographically varied containment policies to estimate the association between the pandemic and containment policies and measures of women's well-being, including mental health and food security. On aggregate, the pandemic resulted in dramatic income losses, increases in food insecurity, and declines in female mental health. While potentially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19, the greater prevalence of containment policies is associated with increased food insecurity, particularly for women, and reduced female mental health. For surveyed women, moving from zero to average containment levels is associated with a 38% increase in the likelihood of reporting more depression, a 73% increase in reporting more exhaustion, and a 44% increase in reporting more anxiety. Women whose social position may make them more vulnerable - those with daughters and those living in female-headed households - experience even larger declines in mental health.","Bau, Khanna, Low, Shah, Sharmin, Voena","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2022.102839","20220228","COVID-19; Depression; Gender; India; Nutrition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27670,""
"[Acute poisoning among patients attended to in an emergency department: From the pre-pandemic period to the new normality]","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global changes that affect the daily life of the world's population, with a direct impact on individuals' physical and mental health as well as on their social and recreational habits. This study aimed to retrospectively analyze the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients attended to for acute poisoning in a hospital emergency department (ED) at three different periods of time: pre-pandemic (2019), after strict lockdown of the population in Spain (2020), and post-pandemic (2021). We analyzed 2 months (June and July) in each period. A total of 1,182 cases of acute poisoning were included. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, during lockdown, the number of patients with acute poisoning decreased (2019: 1.9% vs. 2020: 1.5%; p&lt;0.01); the ratio of men to women increased (2.0 vs. 1.4; p=0.02); and the mean age of patients increased (2019: 31.4 vs. 2020: 41.3; p&lt;0.001), a trend which continued in 2021 (38.3). Poisoning with suicidal intention also increased during the pandemic (2019: 8.71% vs. 2020: 21.0%; p&lt;0.01) whereas poisonings with a recreational intention declined (2019: 76.1% vs. 2020: 62.0%; p&lt;0.01) with a non-significant increase in 2021 (69.0%, p=0.07).

"The dynamics of trust and communication in COVID-19 vaccine decision making: A qualitative inquiry","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists coordinated a complex immunization effort that developed and distributed vaccines by December 2020. This study aimed to explain COVID-19 vaccination decision-making process to inform vaccine communication with patients and the public. Building on quantitative research on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, we conducted a grounded theory study, collecting 30 qualitative interviews with employees at a U.S. university that provided vaccine eligibility in December 2020. Analysis followed the Sort and Sift, Think and Shift method. Participants who had chosen to receive the vaccine and those who had not both described five factors that impacted their decision-making: emotional response, understanding, personal values, culture, and social norms. Across these factors, we identified three cross-cutting themes: <i>time, trust</i>, and <i>communication tactics</i>. In a time of emerging science and changing answers, the constant introduction of new information created information overload for participants. COVID-19 vaccine development was a ""grand experiment globally,"" which required trust, not only knowledge, to overcome hesitancy. The complex information environment surrounding COVID-19 vaccination requires multi-level intervention that cannot rely on knowledge translation alone.

"Spiritual Coping of Emergency Department Nurses and Emergency Medical Services Staff During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iran: An Exploratory Study","Emergency department (ED) nurses and emergency medical services (EMS) staff have been recently exposed to high levels of stress due to the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This increased stress level may influence the physical and mental health of ED nurses and EMS staff and the quality of caregiving to the patients. A spiritual coping approach is one of the most commonly used strategies to help healthcare workers manage stressful events or situations. This study explores the spiritual coping (positive or negative) among ED nurses and EMS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on 494 ED/EMS nurses in Ardabil Province in the northwest of Iran, using a convenience sampling method. The spiritual coping questionnaire (SCQ) was used to assess spiritual coping in the subjects. The results of this study showed that ED nurses and EMS staff generally used positive spiritual coping methods to reduce stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple linear regression indicated that workplace (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.22, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), service location (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and type of employment (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.13, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.012) were significant predictors of positive spiritual coping, and older age (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.13, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.045), overtime work (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.12, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), and marital status (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.12, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.021) were predictors of negative spiritual coping. Our findings indicated that positive religious behavior was the main spiritual coping strategy used by healthcare workers.

"The COVID-19 pandemic impacts all domains of quality of life in Egyptians with spinal cord injury: a retrospective longitudinal study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, several aspects of life have been affected. These aspects have been impacted especially in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). The current study explored the overall effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life (QOL) domains in persons with SCI as well as evaluated their adherence to WHO-COVID 19-preventive measures. A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted after asking participants to complete an online validated Arabic version of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires including their demographics. The WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires were completed targeting two separate occasions to represent their scores prior to and during the pandemic. Participants were asked to rate their adherence to WHO-COVID-19 preventive measures on a 10-point scale. 115 participants with complete/ incomplete SCI were recruited via social media and contacted by phone to complete the questionnaires. Persons with SCI had lower QOL scores during the COVID-19 period compared to their QOL during the pre-COVID-19 period; all QOL domains (Physical Health, Psychological, Social Relationships, and Environment) showed a significant decrease (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Regarding COVID-19 preventative measures, participants were most likely to endorse self-isolation as well as staying home measures and least likely to adhere to hand washing and social distancing measures. The robustly reduced QOL reported by individuals with SCI during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for rehabilitation and mental health services, particularly administered via telehealth, to buffer the effects of the pandemic. Additionally, psychoeducation and support regarding COVID-19 preventative behaviors in this region would be critical.","Elaraby, Shahein, Bekhet, Perrin, Gorgey","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-022-00775-0","20220227","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27676,""
"Take-home Naloxone at Opioid Treatment Programs: A Lifesaver","Opioid-related overdose deaths have increased almost 30% in the US since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Tragically, many of these deaths could be prevented with widespread availability of naloxone. One innocuous harm-reduction strategy would be the federal government mandating the provision of take-home naloxone and brief overdose education to patients at opioid treatment programs. Take-home naloxone, for instance, may be used by a friend or a family member to save the life of the patient receiving treatment for opioid use disorder. Importantly, many studies demonstrate that patients receiving take-home naloxone at an opioid treatment program will use the naloxone to reverse an overdose of someone in their social network. Other successful indications for mandated take-home naloxone include: federal inmates leaving incarceration if they have an opioid substance use disorder diagnosis and federal police officers on active duty. This editorial describes the various organizations, medical societies, and governmental agencies who may consider making robust actionable recommendations regarding naloxone for persons with opioid use disorder. The authors strongly recommend that professional organizations include take-home naloxone as a best practice for any patient who may be at an elevated risk for an opioid overdose.","Katzman, Bhatt, Comerci","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000983","20220227","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27677,""

"COVID-19-related stressors and depression in Chinese adolescents: The effects of life history strategies and gender","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people live, affecting both their physical and mental health. Adolescents are vulnerable to the stress of the pandemic, and may experience indicators of psychological distress, such as depression. This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19-related stressors on depression and the mediating role of life history strategies. A two-wave longitudinal study was conducted with 1123 adolescents (51.20% girls, M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯14.30) recruited from three junior high schools in the Northeastern province of China. Adolescents' life history strategies, depressive symptoms, and demographic variables were assessed at Time 1 (November 2019) and Time 2 (August 2020), and adolescents' experience of COVID-19-related stressors was assessed at Time 2. None of participants was infected by COVID-19 virus. COVID-19-related stressors were positively associated with depressive symptoms at Time 2 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.08, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01), after controlling for gender, age, SES and depressive symptoms at Time 1. And life history strategies partially mediated the relation of pandemic stress to depression (indirect effectÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.02, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05, 95% CI [0.004, 0.034]). There were no gender differences in the relations between stress on depression. The sample was from a district where the pandemic was not very severe, which may limit generalizability of the results. This study revealed that COVID-19-related stressors may have a long-term impact on adolescents, increasing depression through speeding up their life history strategies. Interventions should focus on life history strategies, particularly cognitive style, among adolescents during and after the pandemic.","Yang, Luo, Zhou, Chen, Xu, Ke, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.060","20220227","Adolescent mental health; COVID-19-related stressors; Depression; Gender difference; Life history strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27679,""
"Mental health and perceived impact during the first Covid-19 pandemic year: A longitudinal study in Dutch case-control cohorts of persons with and without depressive, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders","Little is known about the longer-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic beyond the first months of 2020, particularly for people with pre-existing mental health disorders. Studies including pre-pandemic data from large psychiatric cohorts are scarce. Between April 2020 and February 2021, twelve successive online questionnaires were distributed among participants of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, and Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association Study (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1714, response rate 62%). Outcomes were depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, loneliness, perceived mental health impact of the pandemic, fear of Covid-19, positive coping, and happiness. Using linear mixed models we compared trajectories between subgroups with different pre-pandemic chronicity of disorders and healthy controls. Depressive, anxiety and worry symptoms were stable since April-May 2020 whereas happiness slightly decreased. Furthermore, positive coping steadily decreased and loneliness increased - exceeding pre-Covid and April-May 2020 levels. Perceived mental health impact and fear of Covid-19 fluctuated in accordance with national Covid-19 mortality rate changes. Absolute levels of all outcomes were poorer with higher chronicity of disorders, yet trajectories did not differ among subgroups. The most vulnerable psychiatric groups may have been underrepresented and results may not be generalizable to lower income countries. After a year, levels of depressive and worry symptoms remained higher than before the pandemic in healthy control groups, yet not in psychiatric groups. Nevertheless, persistent high symptoms in psychiatric groups and increasing loneliness in all groups are specific points of concern for mental health care professionals.","Kok, Pan, Ottenheim, JÃƒÂ¶rg, Eikelenboom, Horsfall, Luteijn, van Oppen, Rhebergen, Schoevers, Giltay, Penninx","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.056","20220227","Affective disorder; Chronicity; Coronavirus; Epidemiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27680,""

Paper presents CA implementation-effectiveness study in a Veteran Affairs inpatient substance recovery care. Patients were randomized to CA or mindfulness control. Patients completed Whole Health outcomes measures at baseline, completion (post), and three-week follow-up. Interventions took 2.5Ã‚Â h. Attending psychologist assessed CA protocols and completed outcome evaluation. Due to Coronavirus, recruitment and follow-up were curtailed. Study took place in a rural northern New England Veteran Affairs inpatient substance recovery unit.

In the midst of the pandemic, at the Washington University School of Medicine we successfully conducted a fully remote clinical trial for a potential COVID-19 therapy, demonstrating the feasibility of fully remote or decentralized clinical trials.","Ahern, Lenze","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psc.2021.11.011","20220227","COVID-19; Decentralized; Fluvoxamine; Remote; Trials","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27685,""
"Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Geriatric Psychiatry","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a global pandemic. This pandemic disrupted health care for patients and providers. Uncertainty about COVID-19 played a significant role in the negative mental health impact in older adults. The effect of increasing age on morbidity and mortality in those who came down with COVID-19 has been substantial. The pandemic took a tremendous toll on the mental and physical health of older adults in general with even more severe consequences in more disadvantaged populations within the group.","Bankole","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psc.2021.11.010","20220227","COVID-19; Geriatrics; Loneliness; Mental health; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27686,""
"Impact on Child Psychiatry","The American pediatric mental health system is in crisis; the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted and exacerbated existing gaps. All youth were affected by the pandemic, an impact medicated by mental illness, the closing of schools, reduced access to mental health services, loss and bereavement, and financial and emotional stress on families. The pandemic's fallout is likely to be felt for years to come as today's youth move through successive developmental stages. Improvements in health care systems for youth, innovations in how care is delivered, and ongoing community support for recovery and resilience are needed moving forward.","Cama, Miyamoto, DeJong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psc.2021.11.009","20220227","Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Mental health; Pandemic; Parent; Psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27687,""
"Changes in Prevalence of Mental Illness Among US Adults During Compared with Before the COVID-19 Pandemic","The authors review trend and cohort surveys and administrative data comparing prevalence of mental disorders during, versus, and before the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in mental health disparities. Best evidence suggests clinically significant anxiety-depression point prevalence increased by relative-risk (RR)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.3 to 1.5 during the pandemic compared with before. This level of increase is much less than the implausibly high RRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.0 to 8.0 estimates reported in trend studies early in the pandemic based on less-appropriate comparisons. Changes in prevalence also occurred during the pandemic, but relative prevalence appears not to have changed substantially over this time.","Kessler, Chiu, Hwang, Puac-Polanco, Sampson, Ziobrowski, Zaslavsky","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psc.2021.11.013","20220227","COVID-19; Cohort study; Health disparities; Mental disorders; Trend study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27688,""
"Anxiety among the General Population of Himalayan District during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study","COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent measures taken by the government to control the situation have imposed adverse impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of the general population. We conducted a study to determine the prevalence of anxiety among general population of a Himalayan district during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in rural communities of the Himalayan district during the early stage of the pandemic using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Data was collected for a period of one month from 13th April 2020 to 13th May 2020. Ethical approval was sought from the Institutional Review Committee of Karnali Academy of Health Sciences (Reference number: 2076/2077/07). All the participants of age 18 or above were included in the study excluding those with known mental illness. Convenience sampling method was used. A total of 427 participants were included in the study. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20. Point estimate at 95% confidence interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. The prevalence rate of anxiety was 196 (45.9%) (41.15-50.64 at 95% Confidence Interval). Anxiety was more prevalent among farmers, illiterate, widowed, and old aged. The study indicates a higher prevalence of anxiety amidst the COVID-19 pandemic compared to reported studies and highlights the need for a strategic intervention to promote awareness and wellbeing at mental health level.","Pandit, Thapa, Sharma, Pokhrel, Bham, Acharya","https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.6553","20220228","anxiety; COVID-19; mental health; pandemic.; Adolescent; Aged; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27689,""
"Depression, Anxiety and Stress among Nurses Providing Care to the COVID-19 Patients: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study","Addressing adequately the mental health during and after COVID-19, as well as preparation for possible future outbreaks, requires an understanding of the nature and extent of mental health impacts, factors related to negative mental health outcomes and symptoms of mental illness. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among nurses providing care to the COVID-19 patients. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from 10th April 2021 to 30th June 2021 among 301 nurses from three COVID-19 dedicated hospitals using self-administered questionnaires. Whole sampling technique was used. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Board of Nepal Health Research Council (Registration number: 106/2021P). The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16. Descriptive statistics like frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation were calculated. Out of 301 nurses, the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was 258 (85.72%), 189 (62.80%) and 151 (49.84%) respectively. The study has shown a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among nurses in comparison to other studies in the similar settings. A quick assessment of the mental health status and mental health requirements of nurses would be helpful in responding to and reducing psychological distress in the crisis situation. The mental health status of nurses should thus be closely monitored by the employing health institutions including managing their workload, providing emotional support and responding to their personal needs.","Bhandari, Yadav, Dahal, Karki","https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.7235","20220228","anxiety; COVID-19; depression; nurses; stress disorder.; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27690,""
"How Do Chinese People View Cyberbullying? A Text Analysis Based on Social Media","The rise of cyberbullying has been of great concern for the general public. This study aims to explore public attitudes towards cyberbullying on Chinese social media. Cognition and emotion are important components of attitude, and this study innovatively used text analysis to extract the cognition and emotion of the posts. We used a web crawler to collect 53,526 posts related to cyberbullying in Chinese on Sina Weibo in a month, where emotions were detected using the software ""Text Mind"", a Chinese linguistic psychological text analysis system, and the content analysis was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. Sentiment analysis showed the frequency of negative emotion words was the highest in the posts; the frequency of anger, anxiety, and sadness words decreased in turn. The topic model analysis identified three common topics about cyberbullying: critiques on cyberbullying and support for its victims, rational expressions of anger and celebrity worship, and calls for further control. In summary, this study quantitatively reveals the negative attitudes of the Chinese public toward cyberbullying and conveys specific public concerns via three common topics. This will help us to better understand the demands of the Chinese public so that targeted support can be proposed to curb cyberbullying.","Lu, Zhao, Lai, Shi, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031822","20220228","attitude; cyberbullying; sentiment analysis; social media; text analysis; topic model; COVID-19; China; Cyberbullying; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","",27691,""
