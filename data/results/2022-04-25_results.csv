"Unguided online treatment of disturbed grief, posttraumatic stress, and depression in adults bereaved during the COVID-19 pandemic: a randomized controlled trial","Objective: This randomized controlled trial is the first study examining short-term effects of an unguided online grief-specific cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (compared to waitlist controls) in reducing early persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression symptoms in adults bereaved during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Sixty-five Dutch adults, bereaved at least three months earlier during the COVID-19 pandemic, with clinically relevant early PCBD, PTSD, and/or depression symptoms, were randomly allocated to an immediate treatment (n = 32) or waitlist condition (n = 33). Telephone interviews were conducted to assess PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptoms (measured with the Traumatic Grief Inventory-Clinician Administered, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively) at baseline, post-treatment, and post-waiting period. Participants received an eight-week unguided online grief-specific CBT including exposure, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral activation assignments. Analyses of covariance were performed. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that people in the intervention condition showed significantly lower PCBD (d = 0.90), PTSD (d = 0.71), and depression (d = 0.57) symptom-levels post-treatment relative to waitlist controls post-waiting period, while taking baseline symptom-levels and the use of professional psychological co-intervention into account. Completers analyses yielded similar results for PCBD and PTSD, but no significant between-group effect was found for depression. Conclusions: The online CBT proved to be an effective intervention, reducing PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptoms. Pending replication of these findings, online interventions may be more widely implemented in clinical practice to improve treatment options for emotionally distressed recently bereaved people.","Lyanne Reitsma et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00B6-DD3-272","20220425","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; online treatment; covid-19; depression; posttraumatic stress; prolonged grief","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-25","",30508,""
