"Changes in supervised consumption site use and emergency interventions in MontrÃƒÂ©al, Canada in the first twelve months of the COVID-19 pandemic: An interrupted time series study","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted supervised consumption site (SCS) operations in MontrÃƒÂ©al, Canada, potentially including changes in SCS visits, on-site emergency interventions, injection of specific drugs, and distribution of harm reduction materials. We used administrative data from all four MontrÃƒÂ©al SCS from 1 March 2018 - 28 February 2021 to conduct an interrupted time series study with 13 March 2020 as the intervention point. We employed segmented regression using generalised least squares fit by maximum likelihood. We analysed monthly SCS visits and materials distributed as counts, and emergency interventions and drugs injected as proportions of visits. SCS visits (level changeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -1,286; 95% CI [-1,642, -931]) and the proportion of visits requiring emergency intervention (levelÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.27% [-0.47%, -0.06%]) decreased immediately in March 2020, followed by an increasing trend in emergency interventions (slope changeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.12% [0.10%, 0.14%]) over the ensuing 12 months. Over the same period, the proportion of injections involving opioids increased (slopeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.05% [0.03%, 0.07%]), driven by increasing pharmaceutical opioid and novel synthetic opioid injections. Novel synthetic opioids were the drugs most often injected prior to overdose. The proportion of injections involving unregulated amphetamines increased immediately (levelÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.83% [2.93%, 12.73%]), then decreased over the next 12 months (slopeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -1.86% [-2.51%, -1.21%]). There was an immediate increase in needle/syringe distribution (levelÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 16,552.81 [2,373, 30,732]), followed by a decreasing trend (slopeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -2,398 [-4,218, -578]). There were no changes in pre-existing increasing trends in naloxone or fentanyl test strip distribution. Reduced SCS use and increasing emergency interventions at SCS are cause for serious concern. Findings suggest increased availability of novel synthetic opioids in MontrÃƒÂ©al, heightening overdose risk.","Zolopa, Brothers, Leclerc, Mary, Morissette, Bruneau, Hyshka, Martin, Larney","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103894","20221029","COVID-19; Harm reduction; Overdose; People who inject drugs; Supervised consumption service; Time series","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-30","",40036,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 among newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer when cancer care was returning to normal","We aim to evaluate anxiety, depression and fear of cancer progression in newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer when cancer care was returning to normal after COVID-19 by comparing them with the pre-COVID patients and explore the association of worries about further cancer care and loneliness with them. Two hundred and eighteen newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer during the pandemic were surveyed using questionnaires, and 153 patients before the pandemic were included in the control group. Logistic regression analyses were used. There were 51.8%, 44.0% and 30.7% of patients during the pandemic reported anxiety symptoms, depressive symptomsÃ‚Â and clinically significant fear of cancer progression, respectively. The risks of anxiety symptoms (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.43-3.51), depressive symptoms (1.61, 1.04-2.50)Ã‚Â and clinically significant fear of cancer progression (4.65, 2.49-8.70) were higher in patients during the pandemic than pre-COVID patients. Worries about further cancer care and loneliness were associated with 1.40-2.52 times higher risks of these psychological problems among the patients during the pandemic. The newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer during COVID-19 are at elevated risks of depression, anxiety and fear of cancer progression, and those who are worried about further cancer care and felt loneliness during the pandemic were more likely to experience psychological problems.","Li, Zhu, Gao","https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13762","20221029","COVID-19; anxiety; breast cancer; depression; fear of cancer progression; fear of cancer recurrence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-30","",40037,""
"A predictive model for hospitalization and survival to COVID-19 in a retrospective population-based study","The development of tools that provide early triage of COVID-19 patients with minimal use of diagnostic tests, based on easily accessible data, can be of vital importance in reducing COVID-19 mortality rates during high-incidence scenarios. This work proposes a machine learning model to predict mortality and risk of hospitalization using both 2 simple demographic features and 19 comorbidities obtained from 86,867 electronic medical records of COVID-19 patients, and a new method (LR-IPIP) designed to deal with data imbalance problems. The model was able to predict with high accuracy (90-93%, ROC-AUCÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.94) the patient's final status (deceased or discharged), while its accuracy was medium (71-73%, ROC-AUCÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.75) with respect to the risk of hospitalization. The most relevant characteristics for these models were age, sex, number of comorbidities, osteoarthritis, obesity, depression, and renal failure. Finally, to facilitate its use by clinicians, a user-friendly website has been developed ( https://alejandrocisterna.shinyapps.io/PROVIA ).","Cisterna-GarcÃƒÂ­a, GuillÃƒÂ©n-Teruel, Caracena, PÃƒÂ©rez, JimÃƒÂ©nez, Francisco-VerdÃƒÂº, Reina, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Billalabeitia, Palma, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Ferrer, BotÃƒÂ­a","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-22547-9","20221028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-30","",40038,""
