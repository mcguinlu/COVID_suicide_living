"Can closed-off management in communities alleviate the psychological anxiety and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic?","Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of individuals infected with the COVID-19 has been increasing worldwide, posed a substantial threat to mental health. Therefore, discovering the means for blocking the transmission path of COVID-19 and improving mental health is of great significance. Based on a survey on the life of urban and rural residents in China (in 2020), the study applied the least squares method to analyse the effect of closed-off management on the psychological anxiety and psychological stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the bootstrap decomposition method was used to test for the mediating effects of satisfaction with and confidence in pandemic prevention. The study found that closed-off management in communities exerted a negative effect on psychological anxiety and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, satisfaction with and confidence in pandemic prevention played a mediating role on the psychological anxiety and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, closed-off management in communities will not only prevent the spread of the COVID-19, but also improve satisfaction with and confidence in pandemic prevention and control. Furthermore, it will alleviate the psychological anxiety and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Zhou, Geng","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3330","20210915","COVID-19; closed-off management in communities; confidence in pandemic prevention; psychological anxiety; psychological stress; satisfaction with pandemic prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",17996,""
"Psychiatric Admissions, Referrals and Suicidal Behavior Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Denmark: A Time-Trend Study","To assess the patterns in psychiatric admissions, referrals and suicidal behavior before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized health records from hospitals and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) covering 46 % of the Danish population (n=2,693,924). In an time-trend study, we compared the number of psychiatric in-patients, referrals to mental health services and suicidal behavior in years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to levels during the first lockdown (March 11 - May 17, 2020), inter-lockdown period (May 18 - December 15, 2020) and second lockdown (December 16, 2020 - February 28, 2021). During the pandemic, the rate of psychiatric in-patients declined compared to pre-pandemic levels (RR = 0.95, 95 % CI = 0.94 - 0.96, p &lt; 0.01), with the largest decrease of 19 % observed three weeks into the first lockdown. Referrals to mental health services were not significantly different (RR = 1.01, 95 % CI = 0.92 - 1.10, p = 0.91) during the pandemic; neither was suicidal behavior among hospital contacts (RR = 1.04, 95 % CI = 0.94 - 1.14, p = 0.48) nor EMS contacts (RR = 1.08, 95 % CI = 1.00 - 1.18, p = 0.06). Similar trends were observed across nearly all age groups, sexes and types of mental disorders examined. In the age group &lt;18, an increase in the rate of psychiatric inpatients (RR = 1.11, 95 % CI = 1.07 - 1.15, p &lt; 0.01) was observed during the pandemic; however, this did not exceed the pre-pandemic, upwards trend in psychiatric hospitalizations in the age group &lt;18 (p = 0.78). The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a decrease in psychiatric hospitalizations, while no significant change was observed in referrals to mental health services and suicidal behavior. Psychiatric hospitalizations amongst children and adolescents increased during the pandemic; however, this appears to be a continuation of a pre-pandemic trend.","RÃƒÂ¸mer, Haubo Bojesen Christensen, Blomberg, Folke, Christensen, Benros","https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13369","20210915","COVID-19; Hospitalizations; Psychiatry; Referral and Consultation; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",17997,""
"Changes in values and well-being amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland","COVID-19 caused a global change in the lifestyles of people around the world. It provided a unique opportunity to examine how external circumstances impact two crucial aspects of functioning relating to ""who I am"" (values) and ""how I feel"" (well-being). Participants (N = 215) reported their values and subjective and eudaimonic well-being, nine months before the first lockdown in Poland and two weeks and four weeks into the first lockdown. We observed increased valuing of self-direction, security, conformity, humility, caring, and universalism and a decrease in valuing hedonism. Individuals experienced decreased subjective and eudaimonic well-being, with women responding with stronger negative affect intensity relative to men. Finally, we identified that individuals who were more open to change before the COVID-19 pandemic responded with higher eudaimonic well-being two weeks into lockdown relative to their less open to change peers. This study is unique in that it shows that well-being and individually held values are flexible and adaptive systems that react to external circumstances such as global critical events.","Bojanowska, Kaczmarek, Koscielniak, UrbaÃ…â€žska","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255491","20210915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",17998,""
"The Association of Delayed Care With Depression Among US Middle-Aged and Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Analysis","During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the depression level among US adults has significantly increased. Age disparity in depression during the pandemic was also reported in recent studies. Delay or avoidance of medical care is one of the collateral damages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and it can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The present study aims to assess the prevalence of depression and delayed care among US middle-aged adults and older adults during the pandemic, as well as investigate the association of delayed care with depression among those two age groups. This cross-sectional study used the 2020 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) COVID-19 Project (Early, Version 1.0) data. Univariate analyses, bivariate analyses, and binary logistic regression were applied. US adults older than 46 years old were included. Depression was measured by Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF). Delayed care was measured by four items: delayed surgery, delayed seeing a doctor, delayed dental care, and other delayed care. More than half of participants were older than 65 years old (58.23%) and 274 participants (8.75%) had depression during the pandemic. Delayed dental care was positively associated with depression among both middle-aged adults (OR=2.05, 95%CI=1.04-4.03, P&lt;0.05) and older adults (OR=3.08, 95%CI=1.07-8.87, P&lt;0.05). Delayed surgery was positively associated with depression among older adults (OR=3.69, 95%CI=1.06-12.90, P&lt;0.05). Self-reported pain was positively related to depression among both age groups. Middle-aged adults who reported higher education level (some college of above) or worse self-reported health had higher likelihood to have depression. While perceived more loneliness was positively associated with depression among older adults, financial difficulty was positively associated with depression among middle-aged adults. This study found that depression among middle-aged and older adults during the pandemic was also prevalent. The study highlighted the collateral damage of the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the association of delayed surgery and dental care with depression during the pandemic. Although surgery and dental care cannot be delivered by telehealth, telehealth services can still be provided to address patients' concern on delayed surgery and dental care. Moreover, the implementation of tele-mental health services is also needed to address mental health symptoms among US middle-aged and older adults during the pandemic. Future research that uses more comprehensive measurements for delayed care is needed to decipher the path through which delayed care is associated with depression.","Luo","https://doi.org/10.2196/29953","20210915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",17999,""
"Essential but Ill-Prepared: How the COVID-19 Pandemic Affects the Mental Health of the Grocery Store Workforce","Frontline essential workers face elevated risks of exposure to COVID-19 because of the interactive nature of their jobs, which require high levels of interaction with the general public and coworkers. The impact of these elevated risks on the mental health of essential workers, especially outside the health care sector, is not well studied. To address this knowledge gap, we examined correlations between perceptions of workplace risks and mental health distress among grocery store workers in Arizona. We collected the first statewide sample of essential workers outside the health care sector focused on mental health and well-being. A total of 3344 grocery store workers in Arizona completed an online survey in July 2020. We used multiple regression models to identify demographic and work-based correlates of mental health distress. Levels of mental health distress among respondents were high: 557 of 3169 (17.6%) reported severe levels and 482 of 3168 (15.2%) reported moderate levels. Perceptions of workplace safety were strongly correlated with significantly reduced levels of mental health distress (ÃƒÅ¸ = -1.44; SE = 0.20) and reduced perceived stress (ÃƒÅ¸ = -0.97; SE = 0.16). Financially disadvantaged workers and employees aged &lt;55 reported high levels of mental health distress. Perceptions of safety and protection in the workplace were significantly correlated with availability of safety trainings, social distancing, and policies governing customer behaviors. Lacking sufficient workplace protections, grocery store employees in Arizona experienced high levels of mental health distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing clear federal and state policies to employers to guide implementation of workplace protections may help reduce sources of mental health distress.","Mayer, Arora, Helm, Barnett","https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549211045817","20210915","COVID-19; health disparities; mental health and well-being; occupational health; risk/risk behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18000,""
"Yoga for chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain: a pilot, randomized controlled trial","To determine the feasibility of implementing a yoga intervention for cancer survivors with chronic CIPN pain, as well as the impact of the intervention on patient-reported outcomes. Cancer survivors with chronic CIPN pain were recruited from the breast, gastrointestinal, and gynecological oncology centers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive an 8-week yoga intervention or usual care. After 21/50 of participants were enrolled, the COVID-19 pandemic required the yoga intervention to be delivered virtually (i.e., Zoom). Pre- and post-intervention, participants self-reported CIPN and co-occurring symptom severity. Adherence to the intervention was defined as practicingÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°12 yoga sessions over the 8-week intervention period. Changes in patient-reported outcomes between groups were compared using Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests. Participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°28 yoga, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16 control) were mainly female (96%) and diagnosed with stage III/IV disease (66%). Overall, 19/28 (67.8%) of yoga group participants were adherent to the yoga protocol. Yoga group participants experienced significant within-group improvements in all patient-reported outcomes, including worst CIPN pain (median changeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.7, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) and sensory CIPN (median changeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.8, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), but only improvements in fatigue (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04) were significant compared to the control. There were no differences (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) in changes in patient-reported outcomes between in-person (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6) or virtual (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15) yoga group participants.

"Is Ignorance Bliss? Examining the Effect of News Media Exposure on Anxiety and Depression During the COVID-19 Pandemic","There has been a widespread increase in affective disorders after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current study, we investigated the effects of exposure to and perceived accuracy of news media and demographic characteristics on anxiety and depressive symptoms. We conducted an online survey of US adults (N = 480) using hierarchical linear regression models to understand the predictive roles of duration and frequency of news media exposure, as well as the perceived accuracy of COVID-19 portrayal by the news media, on anxiety and depression. Increased exposure duration predicted greater anxiety, and decreased frequency of exposure and perceived overreaction in the news media coverage of COVID-19 were linked to greater anxiety and depression. Perceived accuracy moderated the relationship of exposure frequency to both affective outcomes. Accordingly, our data support the importance of adequate levels of accurate and trusted information to help mitigate the overall mental health burden of the pandemic.","Hoyt, Hiserodt, Gold, Milligan, Otto","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001434","20210915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18002,""

"A Cyberbullying Media-Based Prevention Intervention for Adolescents on Instagram: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","Between 15% and 70% of adolescents report experiencing cybervictimization. Cybervictimization is associated with multiple negative consequences, including depressed mood. Few validated, easily disseminated interventions exist to prevent cybervictimization and its consequences. With over 97% of adolescents using social media (such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat), recruiting and delivering a prevention intervention through social media and apps may improve accessibility of prevention tools for at-risk youth. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of and obtain preliminary outcome data on IMPACT (Intervention Media to Prevent Adolescent Cyber-Conflict Through Technology), a brief, remote app-based intervention to prevent and reduce the effect of cyberbullying. From January 30, 2020, to May 3, 2020, a national sample of 80 adolescents with a history of past-year cybervictimization was recruited through Instagram for a randomized control trial of IMPACT, a brief, remote research assistant-led intervention and a fully automated app-based program, versus enhanced web-based resources (control). Feasibility and acceptability were measured by consent, daily use, and validated surveys. Although not powered for efficacy, outcomes (victimization, bystander self-efficacy, and well-being) were measured using validated measures at 8 and 16 weeks and evaluated using a series of longitudinal mixed models. Regarding feasibility, 24.5% (121/494) of eligible participants provided contact information; of these, 69.4% (84/121) completed full enrollment procedures. Of the participants enrolled, 45% (36/80) were randomized into the IMPACT intervention and 55% (44/80) into the enhanced web-based resources groups. All participants randomized to the intervention condition completed the remote intervention session, and 89% (77/80) of the daily prompts were answered. The retention rate was 99% (79/80) at 8 weeks and 96% (77/80) at 16 weeks for all participants. Regarding acceptability, 100% (36/36) of the intervention participants were at least moderately satisfied with IMPACT overall, and 92% (33/36) of the participants were at least moderately satisfied with the app. At both 8 and 16 weeks, well-being was significantly higher (ÃŽÂ²=1.17, SE 0.87, P=.02 at 8 weeks and ÃŽÂ²=3.24, SE 0.95, P&lt;.001 at 16 weeks) and psychological stress was lower (ÃŽÂ²=-.66, SE 0.08, P=.04 at 8 weeks and ÃŽÂ²=-.89, SE 0.09, P&lt;.001 at 16 weeks) among IMPACT users than among control group users. Participants in the intervention group attempted significantly more bystander interventions than those in the control group at 8 weeks (ÃŽÂ²=.82, SE 0.42; P=.02). This remote app-based intervention for victims of cyberbullying was feasible and acceptable, increased overall well-being and bystander interventions, and decreased psychological stress. Our findings are especially noteworthy given that the trial took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of Instagram to recruit adolescents can be a successful strategy for identifying and intervening with those at the highest risk of cybervictimization.

"Opportunity, Challenge, or Both? Managing Adolescent Socioemotional and Mental Health During Web-Based Learning","The transition to web-based learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to consider the benefits of and the risks associated with web-based technology for education, media use, and access to resources. Prior to the pandemic, children and adolescents had in-person access to peers; social relationships; educators; health care providers; and, in some cases, mental health resources and medical care in schools and community settings. Due to the introduction of universal masking and physical distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in early 2020, methods for accessing these resources have shifted dramatically, as people now rely on web-based platforms to access such resources. This viewpoint will explore equity in access to technology for web-based learning, mental health (with a focus on students of color), and the challenge of cultivating meaningful relationships on web-based platforms.

"Non-pharmacological measures implemented in the setting of long-term care facilities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and their consequences: a rapid review","Starting in late 2019, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, spread around the world. Long-term care facilities are at particularly high risk of outbreaks, and the burden of morbidity and mortality is very high among residents living in these facilities. To assess the effects of non-pharmacological measures implemented in long-term care facilities to prevent or reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents, staff, and visitors. On 22 January 2021, we searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Web of Science, and CINAHL. We also conducted backward citation searches of existing reviews. We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies that assessed the effects of the measures implemented in long-term care facilities to protect residents and staff against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary outcomes were infections, hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID-19, contaminations of and outbreaks in long-term care facilities, and adverse health effects. Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author performed data extractions, risk of bias assessments and quality appraisals, and at least one other author checked their accuracy. Risk of bias and quality assessments were conducted using the ROBINS-I tool for cohort and interrupted-time-series studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for case-control studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively, focusing on the direction of effect. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, with the author team critically discussing the ratings. We included 11 observational studies and 11 modelling studies in the analysis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries. Most studies compared outcomes in long-term care facilities that implemented the measures with predicted or observed control scenarios without the measure (but often with baseline infection control measures also in place). Several modelling studies assessed additional comparator scenarios, such as comparing higher with lower rates of testing. There were serious concerns regarding risk of bias in almost all observational studies and major or critical concerns regarding the quality of many modelling studies. Most observational studies did not adequately control for confounding. Many modelling studies used inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of the models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Overall, we identified five intervention domains, each including a number of specific measures. Entry regulation measures (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies) Self-confinement of staff with residents may reduce the number of infections, probability of facility contamination, and number of deaths. Quarantine for new admissions may reduce the number of infections. Testing of new admissions and intensified testing of residents and of staff after holidays may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain regarding whether restricting admissions of new residents reduces the number of infections, but the measure may reduce the probability of facility contamination. Visiting restrictions may reduce the number of infections and deaths. Furthermore, it may increase the probability of facility contamination, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is very uncertain how visiting restrictions may adversely affect the mental health of residents. Contact-regulating and transmission-reducing measures (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies) Barrier nursing may increase the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent cleaning and environmental hygiene measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear how contact reduction measures affect the probability of outbreaks. These measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. Personal hygiene measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidenceÃ‚Â is very uncertain.Ã‚ Mask and personal protective equipment usage may reduce the number of infections, the probability of outbreaks, and the number of deaths, but the evidence is very uncertain. Cohorting residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, although evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent contact -regulating and transmission -reducing measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Surveillance measures (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies) Routine testing of residents and staff independent of symptoms may reduce the number of infections. It may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Evidence from one observational study suggests that the measure may reduce, while the evidence from one modelling study suggests that it probably reduces hospitalisations. TheÃ‚Â measure may reduce the number of deaths among residents, but the evidence on deaths among staff is unclear.Ã‚ Symptom-based surveillance testing may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Outbreak control measures (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies) Separating infected and non-infected residents or staff caring for them may reduce the number of infections. The measure may reduce the probability of outbreaks and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. Isolation of cases may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent measures (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study) A combination of multiple infection-control measures, including various combinations of the above categories, may reduce the number of infections and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. This review provides a comprehensive framework and synthesis of a range of non-pharmacological measures implemented in long-term care facilities. These may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and their consequences. However, the certainty of evidence is predominantly low to very low, due to the limited availability of evidence and the design and quality of available studies. Therefore, true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Overall, more studies producing stronger evidence on the effects of non-pharmacological measures are needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries and on possible unintended consequences of these measures. Future research should explore the reasons behind the paucity of evidence to guide pandemic research priority setting in the future.","Stratil, Biallas, Burns, Arnold, Geffert, Kunzler, Monsef, Stadelmaier, Wabnitz, Litwin, Kreutz, Boger, Lindner, Verboom, Voss, Movsisyan","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015085.pub2","20210915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18007,""

To make a recommendation regarding whether or not to follow-up these patients psychiatrically to optimize care. In an observational cohort-study screening questions and additional questionnaires were used during two follow-up contacts to monitor cognition (MoCA), affective symptoms (HADS and IES) and overall functioning. More than half of the 29 included patients showed (neuro)psychiatric problems at both follow-up moments. Two weeks after discharge, we mainly saw symptoms related to anxiety and depression. Except for complaints related to the traumatic experience of the COVID-19, these seemed to have a favorable natural course. A negative time effect was seen for complaints consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder. Two months after discharge limitations in cognition and overall functioning appeared to be the main complaints after COVID-19. (Neuro)psychiatric symptoms after a COVID-19 are common. The natural course for affective complaints is more favorable than for cognitive functions. Specialist follow-up of patients with post-COVID psychological problems is recommended.","van Helvoort, Pop-Purceleanu, Tendolkar, Everaerd","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Neuropsychiatric+recovery+after+COVID-19+-+an+observational+cohort-study].","20210915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18008,""
"Long-term neurological manifestations of COVID-19: prevalence and predictive factors","Clinical investigations have argued for long-term neurological manifestations in both hospitalised and non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients. It is unclear whether long-term neurological symptoms and features depend on COVID-19 severity. From a sample of 208 consecutive non-neurological patients hospitalised for COVID-19 disease, 165 survivors were re-assessed at 6 months according to a structured standardised clinical protocol. Prevalence and predictors of long-term neurological manifestations were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analyses. At 6-month follow-up after hospitalisation due to COVID-19 disease, patients displayed a wide array of symptoms; fatigue (34%), memory/attention (31%) and sleep disorders (30%) were the most frequent. At neurological examination, 40% of patients exhibited neurological abnormalities, such as hyposmia (18.0%), cognitive deficits (17.5%), postural tremor (13.8%) and subtle motor/sensory deficits (7.6%). Older age, premorbid comorbidities and severity of COVID-19 were independent predictors of neurological manifestations in logistic regression analyses. Premorbid vulnerability and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection impact on prevalence and severity of long-term neurological manifestations.","Pilotto, Cristillo, Cotti Piccinelli, Zoppi, Bonzi, Sattin, Schiavolin, Raggi, Canale, Gipponi, Libri, Frigerio, Bezzi, Leonardi, Padovani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05586-4","20210915","COVID-19; Cognitive impairment; Depression; Fatigue; Hyposmia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18009,""
"A study of anxiety, depression and stress symptoms among Fayoum medical students during COVID-19 lockdown, Egypt","The widespread pandemic of COVID-19 virus carries not only physical hazards, but also major psychological effects especially among medical students. The aim was to investigate the psychological effects of COVID-19 on medical students and the factors affecting them. The study was carried out with an online questionnaire distributed through Google Forms for medical students at Faculty of Medicine, Egypt. The questionnaire included socio-demographic questions, validated psychometric tools for the assessment of depression, anxiety and stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Stress Scale-Revised (IES-R) were applied. The total number of participants was 282 students. Percentage of participants with clinically significant depression was 75.2%, anxiety was 56.4% and stress was 52.9%. Those showed PTSD probability was 54.3%. The multivariate regression analysis revealed that IES remained significantly associated with gender and previous road accidents, depression and anxiety remained significantly associated with personal history of psychiatric illness, while stress remained significantly associated with gender and previous road accidents. Medical students were highly depressed, anxious and stressed during period of COVID-19 pandemic. Being a female, having previous history of psychiatric illness and previous road accident were highly associated with increasing the psychological impact of COVID-19.","Soltan, Soliman, Dawoud","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41983-021-00377-2","20210915","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Psychological impact; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18010,""
"Increased risk of health professionals to feel traumatized during the COVID-19 pandemic","Health professionals may be a vulnerable group to posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To investigate how health professionals who experienced a traumatic event are expressing PTSS and factors related to risk for higher PTSS symptomatology can inform how health professionals are facing their role in this crisis. This was an Internet cross-sectional survey. Participants were 49,767 Brazilian health professionals who have ever faced a traumatic event, which was about 25.9% of an initial sample of health professionals. PTSS symptoms were assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and latent profile analysis (LPA) explored subpopulations within participants based on their scores. Distinct profiles were compared for psychological distress (e.g., depression and anxiety) and quality of life. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between IES-R profiles and COVID-19 related experiences, thoughts, and perceptions. A two-profile model was the most appropriate for the IES-R data pointing out a group with a high level of PTSS (named high-PTSS; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10,401, 20.9%) and another expressing a low level of symptoms (named low-PTSS; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39,366, 79.1%). The high-PTSS profile demonstrated worse psychological scores (global psychological distress, somatization, depression, and anxiety) and worse quality of life (physical, psychological, social, and environmental) with moderate magnitudes. Small but significant predictors of the high-PTSS profile included sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 related experiences, thoughts, and perceptions. Most individuals who experienced a traumatic event were not in the high-PTSS profile. For those who were, however, psychological and quality of life measures were much worse. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, several characteristics emerged as risks to report trauma.","Braule Pinto, Serpa, de Paula, Costa, Robis, Diaz, Joaquim, da Silva, de Miranda, Malloy-Diniz","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97783-6","20210915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18011,""
"Having more virtual interaction partners during COVID-19 physical distancing measures may benefit mental health","Social interactions play an extremely important role in maintaining health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical distancing measures, however, restricted the number of people one could physically interact with on a regular basis. A large percentage of social interactions moved online, resulting in reports of ""Zoom fatigue,"" or exhaustion from virtual interactions. These reports focused on how online communication differs from in-person communication, but it is possible that when in-person interactions are restricted, virtual interactions may benefit mental health overall. In a survey conducted near the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (N<sub>2020</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°230), we found that having a greater number of virtual interaction partners was associated with better mental health. This relationship was statistically mediated by decreased loneliness and increased perceptions of social support. We replicated these findings during the pandemic 1Ã‚Â year later (N<sub>2021</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°256) and found that these effects held even after controlling for the amount of time people spent interacting online. Convergent with previous literature on social interactions, these findings suggest that virtual interactions may benefit overall mental health, particularly during physical distancing and other circumstances where opportunities to interact in-person with different people are limited.Open Science Framework repository: https://osf.io/6jsr2/ .","Sahi, Schwyck, Parkinson, Eisenberger","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97421-1","20210915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18012,""
"Chronic Pain in Schoolchildren and its Association With Psychological Wellbeing Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current longitudinal observational study aimed to explore how chronic pain among schoolchildren changed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how changes in chronic pain were related to changes in psychological wellbeing and COVID-19-related experiences. Data were collected from NÃ‚Â = 777 German schoolchildren (aged 9-17Ã‚Â years) at two assessments before and one assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Participants self-reported chronic pain experience, anxiety, depression, and quality of life across all assessments; and COVID-19-related experiences at the last assessment. Trajectories of anxiety, depression, and quality of life as well as COVID-19-related experiences were analyzed separately for groups of stable chronic pain trajectories compared to chronic pain trajectories that changed during the pandemic. Chronic pain prevalence was lowest at the assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic (22.8% vs. 29.2% and 29.9% before the pandemic). However, 4.6% experienced new chronic pain onset during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was preceded by heightened depression and anxiety, as well as lowered quality of life scores. These students were also more likely to describe time with their family during the COVID-19 pandemic as tense compared to students who did not develop chronic pain. During the COVID-19 pandemic boys were more likely to recover from ongoing chronic pain than girls. Overall, during the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of chronic pain decreased. However, stressful situations and pre-existing vulnerabilities in psychological wellbeing can facilitate the development of chronic pain during the pandemic.","Rau, Grothus, Sommer, Grochowska, Claus, Zernikow, Wager","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.027","20210915","Adolescents; Anxiety; COVID-19; Children; Chronic pain; Depression; Longitudinal study; Quality of life; School-age population","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18013,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmacy students' personal and professional learning","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted both healthcare delivery and the education of healthcare students, with a shift to remote delivery of coursework and assessment alongside the expansion of the scope of practice of Alberta pharmacists. The objective of this research was to understand how the learning of pharmacy students at the University of Alberta was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to 397 pharmacy students in years one through three. Students responded to three short-answer reflection questions: (1) how has the COVID-19 pandemic situation affected your learning; (2) from a pharmacy and pharmacy school perspective, what have you learned since the COVID-19 pandemic began; and (3) from a personal perspective, what have you learned about yourself since the COVID-19 pandemic began? A thematic analysis was undertaken of students' responses to these reflection questions. A total of 53 students responded to the survey (response rate 13%). Two major themes were identified across all three reflection questions, with several subthemes: remote learning (learning environment, knowledge transfer, knowledge retention, assessment) and mental health (appreciation, stress, extroversion, motivation). Adaptability, routine, professional identity, and the role of the pharmacist were also identified as less prevalent themes. Pharmacy students' responses led to the identification of several themes related to their learning given the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased understanding of student perceptions has the potential to improve the remote delivery of education, support increased university-wide mental health resourcing, and shape pharmacy curriculum development.","Nagy, Hall, Charrois","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cptl.2021.07.014","20210915","COVID-19; Learning; Pandemic; Pharmacy school; Pharmacy student; Thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18014,""
"Return to classes impact on mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the necessary social isolation and distancing measures - that were adopted to prevent spreading the virus, including the suspension of university classes - negatively impacted the mental health of young adults. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether returning to online classes, even not presential, during the social isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic, affected the mental health of university students. Forty students (10 men and 30 women) (age, 22.3Ã‚Â±3.8 years; body mass, 62.5Ã‚Â±17.8 kg; height, 165.6Ã‚Â±8.7cm) from undergraduate health courses participated in the study. The students answered a self-administered questionnaire designed to gather personal and quarantine information as well as information about the frequency of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms. The questionnaire was answered before and after the return to online classes. There was a significantly lower frequency of depression symptoms after the return to online classes (Z = -2.27; p = 0.02). However, there was no difference in anxiety symptoms before and after returning to online classes (Z = -0.51; p = 0.61). Return to online classes positively impacted the mental health (decrease of frequency of depression symptoms) of university students. Future studies are needed to observe whether the changes observed after returning to school are maintained over time.","Seffrin, Puccinelli, Vivan, Vancini, de Lira, Nikolaidis, Rosemann, Knechtle, Andrade","https://doi.org/10.1017/neu.2021.31","20210915","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; social isolation; students; universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18015,""
"A prospective investigation of developmental trajectories of psychosocial adjustment in adolescents facing a chronic condition - study protocol of an observational, multi-center study","Relatively little is known about protective factors and the emergence and maintenance of positive outcomes in the field of adolescents with chronic conditions. Therefore, the primary aim of the study is to acquire a deeper understanding of the dynamic process of resilience factors, coping strategies and psychosocial adjustment of adolescents living with chronic conditions. We plan to consecutively recruit NÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°450 adolescents (12-21Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) from three German patient registries for chronic conditions (type 1 diabetes, cystic fibrosis, or juvenile idiopathic arthritis). Based on screening for anxiety and depression, adolescents are assigned to two parallel groups - ""inconspicuous"" (PHQ-9 and GAD-7Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°7) vs. ""conspicuous"" (PHQ-9 or GAD-7Ã‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°7) - participating in a prospective online survey at baseline and 12-month follow-up. At two time points (T1, T2), we assess (1) intra- and interpersonal resiliency factors, (2) coping strategies, and (3) health-related quality of life, well-being, satisfaction with life, anxiety and depression. Using a cross-lagged panel design, we will examine the bidirectional longitudinal relations between resiliency factors and coping strategies, psychological adaptation, and psychosocial adjustment. To monitor Covid-19 pandemic effects, participants are also invited to take part in an intermediate online survey. The study will provide a deeper understanding of adaptive, potentially modifiable processes and will therefore help to develop novel, tailored interventions supporting a positive adaptation in youths with a chronic condition. These strategies should not only support those at risk but also promote the maintenance of a successful adaptation. German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), no. DRKS00025125 .

"Suicide in French Polynesia: a retrospective analysis based on medicolegal documents and interview with family","To analyse the epidemiological data on suicide in French Polynesia (FP). Data on suicides were collected from the Public Health Direction, Judicial Police Investigations Court of Justice records, the Centre d'OpÃƒÂ©rations et de Renseignements de la Gendarmerie, patient records for those hospitalized in psychiatry and from psychological autopsies. The dataset consisted of 316 suicide cases in FP over 25 years (1992-2016). In FP, suicide was more frequent in men (sex ratio 3.2:1), young people (mean age, 34.4 years) and individuals with previously diagnosed psychiatric disorders (100 of 316; 31.6%) The most common method of suicide was hanging (276 of 316; 87.3%). A history of previous suicide attempts was found in 25 of 56 (44.6%) of suicide cases, when documented. The most common potential triggering factors for suicide were emotional problems. The suicide rates have remained stable during 1992-2016 (mean 10.6/100Ã‚Â 000 inhabitants per year), with periods of economic crises increasing suicide rates. These results provide valuable information to enable the effective targeting of suicide prevention strategies toward those at high risk. Economic crises had larger impacts in the French overseas territories than mainland France. Given the unprecedented economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in FP, there is an urgent need to implement suicide epidemiological surveillance and prevention programmes.","AmadÃƒÂ©o, Rereao, Vanquin David, Nguyen, SÃƒÂ©guin, Beauchamp, Favro, Trouche, Malogne, Goodfellow, Gokalsing, Spodenkiewicz, Sy, Bocage-BarthÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©my, Sebti, Tuheiava, Jehel, De Leo","https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605211003452","20210915","COVID-19; French Polynesia; Suicide mortality; psychological autopsy; social crisis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-16","",18017,""
