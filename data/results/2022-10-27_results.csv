"What is the current state of public health system preparedness for infectious disease emergencies? A scoping review","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to demonstrate the risks and profound health impacts that result from infectious disease emergencies. Emergency preparedness has been defined as the knowledge, capacity and organizational systems that governments, response and recovery organizations, communities and individuals develop to anticipate, respond to, or recover from emergencies. This scoping review explored recent literature on priority areas and indicators for public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) with a focus on infectious disease emergencies. Methods: Using scoping review methodology, a comprehensive search was conducted for indexed and grey literature with a focus on records published from 2017 and 2020 onward, respectively. Records were included if they: a) described PHEP, b) focused on an infectious emergency, and c) were published in an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development country. An evidence-based all-hazards Resilience Framework for PHEP consisting of 11 elements was used as a reference point to identify additional areas of preparedness that have emerged in recent publications. The findings were summarized thematically. Results: The included publications largely aligned with the all-hazards Resilience Framework for PHEP. In particular, the elements related to collaborative networks, community engagement, risk analysis and communication were frequently observed across the publications included in this review. Emergent themes were identified that expand on the Resilience Framework for PHEP. These were related to mitigating inequities, public health capacities (vaccination, laboratory system capacity, infection prevention and control capacity, financial investment in infrastructure, public health legislation, phases of preparedness), scientific capacities (research and evidence-informed decision making, climate and environmental health), and considerations for health system capacity. Conclusions: The themes from this review contribute to the evolving understanding of critical public health preparedness actions; however, there was a paucity of recent evidence on PHEP indicators. The themes can expand on the 11 elements outlined in the Resilience Framework for PHEP, specifically relevant to infectious disease emergencies and risks. Further research will be important to validate these findings, and expand understanding of how refinements to PHEP frameworks and indicators can support public health practice.","Jessica M Lee; Rachel Jansen; Kate E Sanderson; Fiona Guerra; Sue Keller-Olaman; Michelle Murti; Tracey L O'Sullivan; Madelyn P Law; Brian Schwartz; Laura E Bourns; Yasmin Khan","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.25.22281308","20221026","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39808,""
"Covid-19 pandemic has polarized the society toward negative and positive traits depending on a person's resilience and certain predispositions","The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a major disruption affecting almost all aspects of health, social and economic dimensions of our lives on an almost unprecedented global scale. While Covid-19 itself is, first and foremost, a pernicious physical illness, its highly contagious nature has caused significant psychological stress with occasional dire mental health consequences which are still not fully understood. To address this issue, we have conducted a longitudinal study by administering standard self-reporting questionnaires covering five major personalities and six mental traits of subjects before and a few months after the outbreak. Results revealed the distribution of population scores to become more extreme in either positive or negative trait directions despite the stability of average trait scores across the population. Higher resilience was found to be positively correlated with improved trait scores post-pandemic. Further investigations showed that certain predispositions could have an effect on trait score change post-Covid depending on the subject's pre-Covid scores. In particular, in the subjects with moderate scores, there was a significant negative correlation between the positive trait scores and the post minus pre-positive trait scores. By examining various traits and personalities, these findings depict a more thorough picture of the pandemic's impact on society's psychological well-being and reveal certain predispositions and vulnerabilities that shape the mental health landscape in the post-Covid period with implications for mental health policies in dealing with Covid-19.","Taraneh Attary; Leila Noorbala; Ali Ghazizadeh","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.25.22281466","20221026","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39809,""
"Quantification of the burden, unmet needs, management, and COVID 19 impact of living with Pompe disease in the UK: results of an online patient survey","Pompe disease is a rare, progressive, multisystemic disease. Here we report results of an online quantitative survey of people living with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) in the UK, with the aim to better understand and quantify their experiences throughout the disease journey. 37 participants (male, n=19 [51%];mean age, 54.1 years;mean age at symptom onset, 33.2 years;mean age at LOPD diagnosis, 42.5 years;received =1 misdiagnosis, n=17 [46%]) completed the survey consisting of 42 questions in January 2022. Results revealed that most participants received assistance with day-to-day living (n=30, 81%), with the most frequent LOPD-associated symptoms being walking difficulties (n=35, 95%), fatigue (n=35, 95%) and muscle weakness (n=34, 92%). 26 participants (70%) were being treated with standard-of-care enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) at the time of the survey;14 (54%) of those for &gt;10 years and 20 (77%) deeming their condition to have deteriorated since treatment began. Several patients receiving ERT mentioned the need for more efficacious or novel treatments (n=6, 23%) and the use of a delivery method less invasive than intravenous (n=5, 19%) as desired improvements to ERT. Many participants stated the provision of ancillary therapies (eg physiotherapy [n=27, 73%], dietary advice [n=18, 49%]) and mental health counselling [n=17, 46%]) would help them better manage their condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a period of increased anxiety and physical deterioration for many participants, with 50% (n=13) of those on ERT stating their treatment had been interrupted due to the pandemic. However, several people mentioned initiation of home-based/self-administered therapies (n=4, 11%) and reduced travel (n=5, 14%) as beneficial outcomes of the pandemic. Findings from this study further characterise the challenges faced by people living with LOPD, highlighting the need for varied patient support and more efficacious treatment options.

"The Utility of Passive and Portable Sensor Data for Monitoring the Symptomatology of Depression and Anxiety: E-Poster Viewing","Introduction: Mobile devices and smartphones have made technology in healthcare more accessible to patients, with COVID-19 further expediting the integration of technology into healthcare. Depression and anxiety are measured via self-report, personality assessments, or during a psychological evaluation with a mental health clinician. These methods of assessing symptomatology lack the benefits of today's technology. This study aims to explore the utility of passive and portable data collection in individuals with anxiety and depression. Materials / Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted through ScienceDirect, PubMed, NCBI, and JMIR electronic databases for studies that were published between 2015-2021 using the following keywords: depression, mobile health, digital phenotyping, mobile applications, mobiles phones, passive EMA, psychiatric assessment, and mhealth. Inclusion criteria;(1) peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2021;(2) studies published in English;(3) studies that use data sensors to monitor and measure the symptomatology of anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular health. A total of 15 studies met criteria. Result(s): Of the 13 studies reviewed, all found at least some correlation between mobile phone usage and depressive symptomatology. 5 studies found a large correlation between GPS data and severity of depressive symptomatology. Contrastingly, one study found that, although people with depressive symptoms spend less time calling and texting others, they spend more time on their phones. Another study states that individuals with depression let their phones ring for longer and have more missed calls. Additionally, 6 studies found a correlation between usage and anxious symptomatology. Mobile phone utilization was found to be far less correlated with anxiety and is a weaker predictor of such symptomatology. The studies found that increased calls, speech presence, and social media usage were directly correlated with increased anxiety. Discussion(s): All research analyzed shows the significance of passive sensor data when screening individuals for emotional symptomatology. This is stated with the implication that EMA are used alongside the sensor data to give a comprehensive picture of the patient. GPS data plays a central role in the ability to screen for symptomatology related to depression and anxiety due to location variability or lack thereof. Conclusion(s): Future research should focus on longer-term studies, that collect more passive data, and have larger sample sizes to ensure that the full extent of interaction between these pathologies can be understood. It should also be noted that other sensors such as ambient light and audio sensors displayed significant results, however, data on their ability to correlate to symptomatology is limited. Learning Objectives: 1. Learn the new and emerging methods of screening for depression and anxiety. 2. Learn new ways to interpret passive sensor data. 3. Learn how a combined approach of passive data collection and active EMA can improve the identification of symptomatology.

"Multi Targeting Deep Brain Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression: A 22 Month Follow up Case Report: Track 2: Brain Stimulation for Treatment Resistant Depression, Pain, and Parkinson's Disease","Introduction: According to WHO, there are more than 300,000,000 people worldwide suffering from depression. It is the world's leading cause of disability and contributes significantly to the overall global burden of disease. 30% of the patients are refractory, being possible candidates for surgical treatment by means of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). We present the follow up at 22 months of a patient with Treatment Refractory Depression (TRD) operated on with a new combination of targets. Materials / Methods: The diagnostic criteria used are those established by Mayberg et al: DSM IV-TR criteria for major depressive disorder with a major depressive episode of at least 1 year duration, with a minimum score of 20 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D). Result(s): 55-year-old male. HAM-D: 26-point. It was decided to simultaneously implant Area 25 (SCG/Cg 25) and the Inferior Thalamic Peduncle (ITP) in order to contemplate the synergistic effect of stimulation of both structures. On December 5, 2018, it was successfully implanted, with previously published techniques, using a deep brain micro register system and stereotactic planning to define the coordinates of each selected target for the implantation of the four tetrapolar electrodes, model 6145 (Abbott) for Area 25 and model 6149 for ITP (Abbott). The electrode implanted in Area 25 was kept lit for 3 months, then only the corresponding to the ITP for an additional 3 months, and finally the four electrodes simultaneously maintaining the stimulation parameters reported in the literature. Post-surgical HAM-D scales were performed, with the following results: * Exclusively Area 25 (21/03/19) = 10 points * Exclusively ITP (13/06/19) = 9 points * Area 25 + ITP (08/08/19) = 14 points. * Area 25 + ITP (19/12/19) = 5 points. * Area 25 + ITP (08/10/20) = 5 points. Discussion(s): The possibility of multiple targets is technically possible and appropriate in very well selected cases. Conclusion(s): The patient showed a statistically significant improvement. Despite maintaining a rating of 5, it is worth mentioning that the patient refers feeling ""better"" than the previous year considering the time of year (spring), and the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. This confirms some reports that mention the maintenance of the effect in the long term, even at 8 years, or even an improvement after almost two years can be seen. We consider that the synergism obtained by simultaneous stimulation of both targets could be more effective in terms of control of the depressive state at the long term. Supplemental Data: none. Learning Objectives: 1- To present a new therapeutic modality of multitargeting DBS for major depression. 2- To demonstrate that the combination of surgical targets is a possible option in carefully selected patients. 3- To demonstrate that the therapeutic effect is maintained over the time.

"Transcutaneous Electrical Cranial-Auricular Stimulation (Tecas) for Treatment of Insomnia Disorder with Comorbid Major Depressive Disorder: A Case Series: E-Poster Viewing","Introduction: Insomnia disorder (ID) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly comorbid, above 80% of MDD patients have insomnia disorder. Acupuncture as a major complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy, is utilized extensively in Asia to treat mental health disorders.Transcutaneous electrical cranial-auricular stimulation (TECAS) is a potential new type of acupuncture treatment for MDD and ID which combines the scalp points and auricular points most commonly used by acupuncturists. It has the advantages of portability, quantifiable stimulation parameters and comfort, especially for home treatment under the normal situation of COVID-19, which can avoid the risk of infection due to frequent hospital trips. Materials / Methods: 10 ID-MDD patients were treated by TECAS which was administered at the bilateral auricular acupoints, Bai Hui (GV-20) and Yin Tang (GV-29) (waveform:4/20 Hz, wave width: 0.2ms+/-30%) for twice a day last 8 weeks. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale(HAMD) of ID-MDD patients were evaluated before and after treatment. Result(s): HAMD-17 scores of 10 patients were lower at 4 and 8 weeks than before TECAS treatment, and the reduction was greater at 4 weeks than at 8 weeks. PSQI scores of 8 patients decreased at 4 and 8 weeks compared with before treatment, and the decrease was greater in the fourth week than in the 8th week. Insomnia of 2 patients improved at 4 weeks of treatment, but became worse in the 8th week as before treatment.7 out of 10 patients showed full insomnia response (50% reduction in PSQI) and 8 patients showed full depression response (50% reduction in HAMD-17 scores). Discussion(s): We suggest TECAS is a good therapeutic strategy to modulate the vagus nerve and trigeminal nerve propagate through electrical stimulation projected by neurons from peripheral sites to the central nervous system. Furthermore, we speculate that TECAS can make the trigeminal nerve afferent fibers and vagus nerve auricular branch carry messages from head facial stimulation to NTS, locus coeruleus, raphe nucleus, medullary reticular activating system and structure of the thalamus, and then to feel, edge, cortical and subcortical structures, so the electrical stimulation subcortical can cause direct regulation, namely the change of cortical excitability. Conclusion(s): These preliminary results in this group of CID-MDD patients are encouraging and need to be replicated in prospective sham-controlled studies with larger sample sizes. In addition, for patients with insomnia and depression, it is important to consider combining TECAS with psychotherapy to avoid the interference of acute negative emergency events.

Learning Objectives: 1. To provide a new non-drug method for acupuncture treatment of insomnia and depression;2. Provide preliminary experimental results for the large-sample experimental design of TECAS for the treatment of insomnia and depression;3.

"Distinguer la narcolepsie de type 2, lâ€™hypersomnie idiopathique, la dÃ©pression et la somnolence dans le syndrome post-COVID-19","RÃ©sumÃ© Les syndromes dâ€™hypersomnolence dâ€™origine centrale (c.-Ã -d. narcolepsie de type-1, narcolepsie de type-2Â et hypersomnie idiopathique), la dÃ©pression ainsi quâ€™un sous-type du syndrome post-COVID-19Â peuvent Ãªtre confondus lors de lâ€™Ã©tablissement dâ€™un diagnostic. Ce dÃ©fi diagnostique sâ€™explique par un symptÃ´me clinique caractÃ©ristique retrouvÃ© dans les quatre conditions, la somnolence diurne excessive, un chevauchement phÃ©notypique considÃ©rable entre la narcolepsie de type-2Â et lâ€™hypersomnie idiopathique ainsi quâ€™une symptomatologie dysphorique pouvant Ãªtre prÃ©sente autant dans les hypersomnolences centrales que dans un sous-type du syndrome post-COVID-19. ConsidÃ©rant lâ€™importance dâ€™un diagnostic valide sur lâ€™efficacitÃ© des traitements et des interventions futures, il est essentiel de dÃ©finir prÃ©cisÃ©ment ces quatre conditions. Dans cette revue, nous reprendrons les critÃ¨res diagnostiques, les prÃ©sentations cliniques et les connaissances actuelles en ce qui a trait Ã  la pathophysiologie de ces troubles en portant une attention particuliÃ¨re aux Ã©lÃ©ments distinctifs de la narcolepsie de type-2, de lâ€™hypersomnie idiopathique, des Ã©pisodes dÃ©pressifs avec hypersomnolence et du syndrome post-COVID-19Â avec somnolence. Bien que de nombreuses Ã©tudes se soient penchÃ©es sur les valeurs diagnostiques des diffÃ©rents outils employÃ©s dans lâ€™identification des hypersomnolences centrales, trÃ¨s peu de marqueurs physiologiques ont Ã©tÃ© identifiÃ©s. Une meilleure comprÃ©hension de ces conditions cliniques pourrait permettre lâ€™identification de marqueurs objectifs spÃ©cifiques Ã  chaque condition rÃ©duisant ainsi la possibilitÃ© dâ€™une erreur diagnostique et optimisant les plans de traitement. Summary Central disorders of hypersomnolence, including narcolepsy type-1 and type-2 as well as idiopathic hypersomnia, depression and a subtype of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome might be confused when establishing a diagnosis. This diagnostic challenge can be explained by the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness, a clinical symptom that is observed in all four conditions, an overlap in the phenotypic traits of narcolepsy type-2 and idiopathic hypersomnia, as well as the presence of depressive symptoms observed in central disorders of hypersomnolence and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome subtypes. Considering the importance of a valid diagnostic on treatment's efficacy and future interventions, it is essential to define those conditions with precision. In this review, we will discuss the diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation and current state of knowledge with regards to the pathophysiology of central disorders of hypersomnolence and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. We will pay particular attention to the characteristics specific to narcolepsy type-2, idiopathic hypersomnia, depressive episodes with hypersomnolence, and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome with drowsiness. While many studies have assessed the ability of different tools used to diagnose central disorders of hypersomnolence, very few have focused on physiological markers. A better understanding and identification of biomarkers specific to narcolepsy type-1 and type-2, idiopathic hypersomnia and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome will reduce the possibility of misdiagnoses and allow the development of optimal treatment plans.","Massicotte, M.

"EXPLORING THE GENOME-WIDE GENETIC OVERLAP BETWEEN ANXIETY AND FEAR DISORDERS",": Background: Twin studies have consistently shown a high genetic overlap amongst anxiety disorders and depression. Some research has also identified modest genetic specificity to fear-based anxiety disorders not shared with general anxiety. Identifying the genetic variants shared amongst all anxiety disorders or specific to one or more requires large sample sizes. Measuring anxiety disorders in large cohorts typically involves in-depth symptom-based diagnoses or minimally phenotyped single-item self-report diagnoses. A trade-off exists between maximising sample size and the level of detail in the phenotyping. Aims: First, to explore genetic correlations between generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and the fear disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia and social phobia) using a combination of in-depth and minimal phenotyping. Second, to compare the results from using minimal phenotyping of the anxiety disorders to that of in-depth phenotyping. Methods: We will use two case-only samples for analyses: the Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study (~N = 18,000) and the Australian Genetics of Depression Study (AGDS) (~18,000). In addition, we will use three studies that provide both cases and controls: the COVID-19 Psychiatric and Neurological Genetics (COPING) study (N = ~10,000), the QSkin study (N = ~18,000) and the UK Biobank (N = ~157,366). We will conduct three independent sets of case-control anxiety disorder genome-wide association studies (GWAS) before meta-analysing all five samples together (expected N cases ~53,000, N controls ~160,000). Results from GWAS meta-analyses of lifetime anxiety disorder, GAD, and fear-based disorders will be used to explore genetic correlations across anxiety disorders and depression and a wide range of complex traits. As sensitivity analyses, we will explore genetic correlations between anxiety phenotypes assessed using minimally phenotyped single-item diagnoses versus in-depth symptom-based diagnoses. Results: We hypothesise that the anxiety disorders will have a SNP-based heritability of approximately 15%. We also hypothesise that GAD and fear-based disorders will be moderately to highly genetically correlated, with some genetic variants that are specific to the fear disorders [1].

"The associations between COVID-19-related stressors and mental health outcomes for survivors of past interpersonal and non-interpersonal trauma","The mental health difficulties of trauma survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic have been under-reported. This study explored the moderating role of trauma history and trauma type (interpersonal and non-interpersonal) in the association between COVID-19-related stressors and depression, anxiety, and stress. A sample of nÂ =Â 321 participants ages 19 to 71 (MÂ =Â 36.63, SDÂ =Â 10.36) was recruited from across the United States through MTurk. Participants reported the number of COVID-19-related stressors, trauma history and psychological symptoms. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses, controlling for age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, and income levels, were used to determine (a) whether COVID-19-related stressors are associated with adverse mental health outcomes;(b) whether trauma history and (c) trauma type moderated this association. Results revealed significant interactions;for those with a trauma history, exposure to COVID-19-related stressors was associated with higher levels of depression (ÃŸÂ =Â .21, p &lt; .05) and anxiety (ÃŸÂ =Â .19, p &lt; .05). For those with a history of interpersonal trauma specifically, COVID-19-related stressors were associated with depression (ÃŸÂ =Â .16, p &lt; .05) more so than for those without a trauma history. These findings highlight the vulnerability of trauma survivors to the unprecedented COVID-19-related stress.","Maharaj, Reena, Tineo, Katherine, Flores-Ortega, Marisol, Cordova, Diego A.; Iskhakova, Alexandra, Linn, Rose, Nikulina, Valentina","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejtd.2022.100300","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Trauma & Dissociation;: 100300, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39828,""
"Characteristics of Fatal Drug Overdoses among College Age Decedents in Tennessee, 2019-2020","Purpose: College age persons experienced unique disruptions to their regular lives during the COVID-19 pandemic, sometimes resulting in negative coping mechanisms. We examined changes in the number of and characteristics of college age fatal drug overdoses before and during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a statewide cross-sectional study to determine the changes in the number and characteristics of college age fatal drug overdose decedents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using 2019-2020 data from the Tennessee State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System. We defined college age as 18-24 years. Frequencies and rates were generated to compare demographics, circumstances, and toxicology between 2019 and 2020. Results: From 2019-2020, 336 college age persons experienced an unintentional or undetermined fatal drug overdose in Tennessee. Characteristics of college age decedents: mean age 21.7 years, 68.5% males, and 71.4% White. Rates of fatal overdoses among college age persons increased 50.0% overall, 150.1% for female decedents, and 141.7% for Black decedents. Fewer people were treated for substance use disorder or mental health conditions (p=0.0243) in 2020. Conclusion: This analysis can inform local and regional public health workers to implement focused prevention and intervention efforts to curtail the overdose epidemic among college age persons in Tennessee.","Korona-Bailey, Jessica, Mukhopadhyay, Sutapa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dialog.2022.100050","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Dialogues in Health;: 100050, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39829,""
"Effectiveness of the Incredible Years parenting program for children with behavioral problems: An experience in a developing country during a pandemic","â€¢ A parenting program established in a developed country could be transferred to a developing country with minimal adaptation, despite minimum resources and engagement barriers. â€¢ With some modifications, it is still feasible to deliver a group-based parenting program during a pandemic period. â€¢ A modified version of School Age BASIC Incredible Years parenting program was effective in improving both children and parental outcomes among children with clinical levels of behavioral problems. Although parenting programs have been supported as an effective family-based intervention for children's behavioral problems, they are underutilized in developing countries. This randomized controlled study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Incredible Years parenting program (IYPP) in improving behavioral problems in children, parenting stress, and parental mental health. Seventy motherâ€“child dyads from three tertiary hospitals in Malaysia were divided into the IYPP and waitlist control groups. Weekly parent training sessions were adjusted during the pandemic period. Child's total difficulty scores of the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire (SDQ-TDS), Parental Stress Scale (PSS) scores, and parental DASS-21 scores were measured at pre- and post-intervention, and follow-up, and analyzed using generalized estimating equation (GEE). Compared to the control group at baseline, the intervention group showed a 4.2- and a 3.5-point significantly lower SDQ-TDS at 2 weeks post-intervention and 3 months follow-up, respectively (B = -4.20, 95 % CI: -6.68, -1.72, p = 0.001;B = -3.51, 95 % CI:-6.37, -0.66, p = 0.016), a 5.0-point significantly lower PSS at 3 months follow-up (B = -5.03, 95 % CI: -9.16, -0.90, p = 0.017), and a 4.1-point significantly lower general stress scores at 2 weeks post-intervention (B = -4.06, 95 % CI: -7.20, -0.92, p = 0.011). Effect sizes were small (d s = 0.28â€“0.40). There was no significant intervention effect on maternal anxiety and depression scores. The modified parenting program was effective in improving children's behavior, parenting stress, and general stress among mothers of children aged 6â€“12 years presented with borderline and abnormal levels of behavioral problems, with sustained effects demonstrated for child behavior. However, the interpretation of these findings requires careful consideration of potential pandemic-instigated challenges and implications.

"CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID-19 INFECTION-RELATED MYOCARDITIS: AN UPDATED SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","SESSION TITLE: Late Breaking Posters in Critical Care SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/18/2022 01:30 pm - 02:30 pm PURPOSE: This systematic review aims to better understand the clinical characteristics, comorbidities, diagnostic findings, and clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19 myocarditis. METHODS: A search for â€œCOVID-19 OR SARS COV-2 OR Coronavirus AND Myocarditisâ€ was performed on 1/4/2022. 2011 studies from Embase and 1165 studies from PubMed were identified. Selection criteria included studies on SARS COV-2 infection-related myocarditis. 142 PubMed and 104 Embase studies were identified. Studies were appraised per protocols and s, vaccine-related myocarditis, uncertain vaccine/infection-related myocarditis, and, systematic reviews. Duplicate studies were removed. A total of 53 articles from which 57 cases were selected to be part of this systematic review. Data on age, sex, days since diagnosis, comorbid conditions such as morbid obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD, preexisting CHF, ischemic heart disease, D- Dimer, ferritin, high sensitivity troponin, BNP, EKG, echocardiogram, cMRI findings, medications, ventilation requirements, and mortality were extracted from 57 studies and were analyzed using IBM SPSS v26. RESULTS: Mean EF was 32.65 Â± 16.57 %. EKG findings of diffuse ST elevation were present in 22% of all cases. Echocardiogram findings of diffuse hypokinesis present in 42.1% and depressed EF in 31.6% of all cases. 21.1% required non-invasive ventilation while 26.3% of all cases ended up requiring mechanical ventilation. Ischemic cardiomyopathy was present in 1.7%, Hypertension in 24.5%, Hyperlipidemia in 7%, Morbid obesity, and a previous diagnosis of CHF was present in 0% of all cases. Overall mortality was seen in 5.3% of all cases. 50% of the cases reported using cardiac MRI (cMRI) and 58% with reported cMRI findings met the Lake Louis criteria for diagnosis of myocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review presents findings of demographics, comorbidities, diagnostic findings, and clinical outcomes of adult COVID-19 patients with myocarditis. The mean days since COVID-19 diagnosis has a wide range due to varied presentations noted in case reports. The previously presumed high-risk factors for COVID-19-related myocarditis are not present in a significant percentage of the cases. SARS-CoV2 myocarditis-related mortality is lower in cases than expected. In the setting of the appropriate clinical context, acute/subacute chest pain, with elevated cardiac biomarkers, abnormal EKGs, and echocardiogram findings in patients with recent or /remote SARS-CoV2 infection/ vaccination, a clinical diagnosis of myocarditis can be made in absence of cMRI. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV2-related myocarditis can be made based on clinical presentation, abnormal EKG, and echocardiogram with or without the added benefit of cardiac MRI. This systematic review aims to update current knowledge on the characteristics of COVID-19 infection-related myocarditis.

"ACUTE PERICARDITIS CAUSED BY COVID-19 INFECTION AND ITS MANAGEMENT","SESSION TITLE: Extraordinary Cardiovascular Reports SESSION TYPE: Rapid Fire Case Reports PRESENTED ON: 10/18/2022 01:35 pm - 02:35 pm INTRODUCTION: The incidence of acute pericarditis is 3.32 per 100,000 person-years (11). Patone et. Al, found that 0.001% had acute pericarditis after a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, while 11.9% were COVID-19 positive (11). 1.5% of patients with COVID- 19 developed new onset pericarditis and six-month all-cause mortality was 15.5% (2). CASE PRESENTATION: 48-year-old male with no known past medical history who presented with acute onset of sharp, left-sided chest pain and associated with dyspnea on exertion. He was not vaccinated for COVID-19 and denied being around any sick contacts. On physical examination he was afebrile, normotensive and saturating 99% on room air. EKG initially showed diffuse ST elevations in leads II,III, aVF, V2-V6. Initial high sensitivity trop was &lt;6. He was incidentally found to be COVID positive. Initial echocardiogram was not suggestive of wall motion abnormalities or pericardial effusions. He was not initiated on management for COVID-19 pneumonia as he was asymptomatic and on room air. He was started on colchicine 0.6 mg BID and ibuprofen 400 TID for pericarditis treatment and symptoms resolved on follow up. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 causing pericarditis is relatively rare and our patient presented with pericarditis and no associated respiratory symptoms. The clinical signs of pericarditis include: a pleuritic or sharp chest pain relieved by leaning forwards, a pericardial friction rub auscultated near the left sternal border and EKG changes including diffuse ST elevations or PR depressions seen in the leads I,II,III, aVL, aVF and the precordial leads V2-V6 (3). The common complications seen with pericarditis are pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis (1). A common etiology for pericarditis is a viral illness which can be seen to precede the cardiac symptoms and be seen as flu-like symptoms or as gastrointestinal symptoms. Treatment is with colchicine and NSAIDs. Aspirin has been the drug of choice in patient's who present with pericarditis following a myocardial infarction, solely because the other NSAIDs have been studied and shown to interfere with myocardial healing (3)(4). NSAIDs were believed to be harmful in patient's diagnosed with COVID, due to upregulation of ACE2 receptors in multiple sites which is used by SARS-COV-2 as a point of entry into cells (9). Drake et. Al, looked at patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and found use of NSAIDs did not play any significant role in mortality (10). First-line therapy for pericarditis is NSAIDs and colchicine. Second line therapy can be with corticosteroids and refractory therapy is generally with intravenous human immunoglobulins, Azathioprine or anti-IL1 agents such as Anakinra (12). CONCLUSIONS: COVID 19 continues to present with varying levels of comorbidities. Timely diagnosis and intervention of pericarditis precipitated by COVID-19 can lead to near complete recovery and prevent fatal outcomes. Reference #1: Dababneh E, Siddique MS. Pericarditis.

"REFRACTORY HYPOXEMIA: A CASE OF DAPSONE-INDUCED METHEMOGLOBINEMIA IN A PATIENT WITH COVID-19","SESSION TITLE: Drug-Induced and Associated Critical Care Cases Posters 2 SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/19/2022 12:45 pm - 01:45 pm INTRODUCTION: Methemoglobinemia is an increase in methemoglobin (mHb) level characterized by functional anemia and tissue hypoxia. It can be caused by congenital enzymes deficiencies, but it is usually acquired. Dapsone, an oxidizing agent, is a medication commonly associated with acquired methemoglobinemia (1). We describe the diagnosis and management of a COVID-19 patient with acquired methemoglobinemia due to Dapsone. CASE PRESENTATION: 84-year-old female with history of MPO-ANCA vasculitis with renal involvement, CKD4 and anemia of chronic disease presented with shortness of breath, lethargy and weakness. Initially, the patient was saturating (SpO2) 80% on room air and was placed on 4L nasal cannula (NC) with improvement to 92%. CT of the chest showed b/l GGOs consistent with atypical pneumonia and patient tested positive for COVID-19. About 4 months prior, she had received 2 doses of Rituximab and on high steroid therapy that was tapered to 5mg of prednisone daily. She has been on Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole for PJP prophylaxis, but due to hyperkalemia the medication was stopped. After confirming no G6PD deficiency, she was started on Dapsone 100mg daily. During hospitalization, she was given dexamethasone 6 mg daily and Dapsone was continued. On hospital stay day 6, a rapid response was called after oxygen dropped to 78% while walking on 6L NC. She was placed on high flow NC 100% and SpO2 went up to 90%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) was then obtained showing pO2 of 334, oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) of 83 and mHb of 17.4. The SpO2-PaO2 gap and elevated mHb lead to the diagnosis of Dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia. Dapsone was discontinued. Patient received a one-time dose of 1mg/kg IV of methylene blue. One hour later her dyspnea had improved and was on 3L NC. Repeat ABG showed improvement of oxyHb (98) and decreased mHb (2.2). DISCUSSION: Physiologically, mHb is less than 1% of total Hb (1) and occurs when the iron in the porphyrin group of heme is oxidized from ferrous to the ferric form (2). Ferric heme binds oxygen irreversibly causing a left shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. Clinical presentation tends to correlate with mHb levels, and it varies from being asymptomatic to fatigue, dyspnea, confusion, seizure, cyanosis resistant to oxygen therapy (mHb &gt; 15%) and death. Methylene blue is safe and can be consider when mHb level is greater than 10 to 20% (2). Methylene blue was administer to our patient given the presence of COVID (leaving patient more susceptible to medication-induced methemoglobinemia (3)) and chronic anemia which made her less likely to tolerate state of reduced oxygen delivery. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of methemoglobinemia is a rare cause of hypoxemia that is often overlooked. In patients with risk factors (COVID, medication exposure) a high index of suspicion is needed when interpreting an ABG (SpO2-PaO2 gap) for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

"BILATERAL PNEUMOTHORAX, PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM, AND SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA: A CASE OF A RARE SYNCHRONOUS TRIAD IN ASTHMA EXACERBATION","SESSION TITLE: Obstructive Lung Disease Case Report Posters SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/17/2022 12:15 pm - 01:15 pm INTRODUCTION: Individual cases of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema have been reported in asthma attacks, but rarely coincide. Pathophysiology is secondary to obstruction in the minor airways leading to air-trapping and barotrauma of distal airways with subsequent alveolar rupture. This case illustrates a case of asthma exacerbation with a synchronous triad of rare complications. CASE PRESENTATION: 65-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, asthma and hypertension presented with shortness of breath, wheezing, and productive cough since four days ago. Vital signs were remarkable for tachypnea and saturation of 91%. Physical examination revealed respiratory distress, and auscultation disclosed diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezing. Limited bedside ultrasound showed B-lines compatible for pulmonary edema. Arterial blood gases were compatible with respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia. Laboratories showed leukocytosis, hypotonic hyponatremia, normal brain natriuretic peptide, and negative COVID-19 PCR test. Chest Xray (CXR) demonstrated changes concerning for pneumonia with superimposed pleural effusion. The patient was admitted with the impression of asthma exacerbation versus community acquired pneumonia. Initially, the patient was placed in bi-level positive airway pressure to aid in respiratory discomfort, broad spectrum antibiotic regimen, and diuresis therapy. On follow up, she was found hypoxic with periorbital edema, dyspnea, and subcutaneous emphysema in neck, upper extremities, and thorax for which emergent intubation was performed. CXR and Thoracic CT confirmed pneumomediastinum, large right sided pneumothorax and a moderate left sided pneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy. At the Intensive Care Unit, treatment included combination therapies with levalbuterol, ipratropium, terbutaline, theophylline, budesonide, IV steroids and magnesium without appropriate response. Mechanical ventilator was set to protective lung parameters to avoid worsening barotrauma. Subsequently, she was paralyzed for 48 hours to aid in synchrony and allow adequate pulmonary gas exchange. Nonetheless, severe bronchoconstriction was persistent along with depressed neurological status. Two months later, the patient passed away. DISCUSSION: We believe our patient developed barotrauma secondary to a cough attack combined with positive airway pressure. Similarities in presentation such as dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia may prove difficult in differentiation. Although each of these pathologies separately can generally be self-limiting depending on size and hemodynamic compromise, the combination can be mortal and clinical suspicion is important in fast diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our case demonstrates the importance of suspicion of barotrauma in patients with asthma attacks not responding adequately to therapy or developing worsening hypoxia which can be detrimental.

"A CASE OF ANKLE SURGERY CAUSING SEVERE IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS (IPF) EXACERBATION: SHOULD I ALLOW MY PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS UNDERGO SURGERY?","SESSION TITLE: Critical Diffuse Lung Disease Cases 1 SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/19/2022 12:45 pm - 12:45 pm INTRODUCTION: Acute exacerbations (AE) of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are well recognized in the progression of this uniformly fatal disease. Here we describe a case of AE of undiagnosed IPF after ankle surgery. Our aim is to discuss the role of non-pulmonary surgery as a precipitating factor and its outcome. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of chronic smoking, recent open reduction internal fixation of left ankle 5 days before the presentation, comes to the emergency room with acute onset, gradually worsening shortness of breath along with non-productive cough and pleuritic chest pain. He denied any sick contacts, COVID exposure, travel history, inhalation of toxic fumes, or any chemical/pets/bird exposure. He was saturating around 85% on room air, was switched to a nasal cannula with improvement in saturation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism but diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGO) were noted bilaterally with no effusion or emphysematous changes, which were new compared to CT chest 10 days prior (that is 5 days before ankle surgery) which showed only mild reticular opacity along anterior convexity of the lungs bilaterally. He was started on intravenous steroids with gradual improvement in clinical status. Bronchoscopy biopsies revealed no malignant cells, bronchoalveolar lavage with no infections, and a negative serum autoimmune panel. He was discharged with outpatient follow-up for a repeat CT chest 6 weeks later which showed improvement in GGO (not back to baseline) and he was still requiring oxygen support. DISCUSSION: The most common triggers for IPF are smoking, environmental toxins, viral (COVID infection) or bacterial infections, medications like antidepressants, beta-blockers, NSAIDs. There is increasing evidence that surgery can cause acute respiratory worsening in IPF, presumably through increased mechanical stress to the lungs. Prolonged mechanical ventilation, high tidal volume, and high concentration of supplemental oxygen during surgery have been proposed as potential causes(1). As per the results from the retrospective study, the incidence of postoperative AE of IPF in patients undergoing non-pulmonary surgery is slightly lower than in patients undergoing pulmonary surgery (2,3). As in our case, non-pulmonary surgery procedures can pose risk for IPF exacerbation, but at this time we have limited research evidence to conclude if this exacerbation can alter the course of the disease. Some studies showed preoperative elevated C-reactive protein as a possible risk factor for AE of IPF after a non-pulmonary surgery but a multicenter study is needed to clarify the preoperative risk factors for AE of IPF after non-pulmonary surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We need further studies to check risk factors and disease course alteration, to have better guidance to classify preoperative risk in our IPF patients.

"RELATIONSHIP OF RELIGIOSITY TO BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN A UNIVERSITY SETTING","SESSION TITLE: Novel Education and Assessments of Trainees SESSION TYPE: Rapid Fire Original Inv PRESENTED ON: 10/17/2022 12:15 pm - 1:15 pm PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic led to increased psychological burdens in all ages. As the crisis continues with few signs of abatement, the impact in a university setting is unclear. Very limited literature examines the relationship between religiosity, burnout and mental health. We examined the relationship of religiosity to the prevalence of burnout, depression and anxiety in a university setting. METHODS: We emailed a survey questionnaire to all faculty, staff and students at a single, faith based university in Februaryâ€“March, 2022. The survey contained three validated scales: including the 16-item Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) with sub-domains of eight exhaustion and eight disengagement ratings, the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to measure psychological distress, and the 5-item Duke University Religion Index (DUREL). The survey obtained institutional review board approval. RESULTS: One hundred twenty five respondents completed the survey, from 17 faculty, 18 staff and 90 students. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 30 (12) years, with 70% female. Burnout thresholds determined with a mean score of = 2.25 for exhaustion and = 2.10 for disengagement revealed a prevalence of 32% and 73%, respectively. HAD-depression and HAD-anxiety scores = 8 were reported by 41% and 62% of respondents, respectively. Higher disengagement and exhaustion scores correlated with symptoms of depression and anxiety (all p &lt; 0.001). Sixty-one participants (49%) attended a church service at least once or more per week and 46 (37%) spent time in religious activities (e.g. reading the bible and prayer) each day. However, intrinsic religious activities and attending organized religious meetings were not associated with burnout, depression or anxiety (each p &gt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the mean total OLBI score (burnout) between faculty, staff and students (all p &gt; 0.05). However, faculty had lower anxiety and depression scores compared to staff and students (all p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: â€¢ A high level of burnout prevails in this academic institution during this pandemic. One-third of respondents had symptoms of exhaustion, and over 70% reported a disengaged attitude. â€¢ Over 40% of respondents potentially experience clinically relevant depression, and 60% experience clinically relevant anxiety. â€¢ Religious activities were not associated with burnout, depression or anxiety. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: â€¢ Academic institutions should focus on providing coping strategies (promote awareness, offer education, and maintain robust referral systems) to alleviate the symptom burdens of burnout, depression and anxiety among faculty, staff and students alike. â€¢ The role of religiosity in this faith based setting is unclear. Religiosity may impart a more protective benefit in non-ecumenical universities. DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Candice Williams No relevant relationships by Abebaw Yohannes","Yohannes, A.

"IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF HOUSE STAFF","SESSION TITLE: Trainees: Mental Well-Being and Performance SESSION TYPE: Original Investigations PRESENTED ON: 10/16/22 10:30 am - 11:30 am PURPOSE: Mental health amongst house staff is poorly understood and at the forefront of many discussions regarding medical education and medical training. The COVID-19 pandemic which reached the United States in 2020, provided a novel situation which many house staff were unaccustomed. Few studies have been performed to assess mental health of house staff in relation to this pandemic. We would like to assess and study the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression in house staff during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODS: House staff in academic institution were invited to complete a survey anonymously via email from November 2021-January 2022. The survey was a compilation of 3 separate questionnaires: PCL-5 evaluating for PTSD, DASS-21 assessing depression, anxiety, and stress, and GAD-7 assessing anxiety. Scores were reported in mean and standard deviation. Prevalence of each disease was reported in frequency and percentage. T-test was used to compare scores between primary team (internal medicine, emergency medicine (EM), family medicine, and pulmonary and critical care (PCCM)) and non-primary team, and the scores between exposed (Anesthesiology, EM, PCCM) and non-exposed groups. Chi-squared analysis was performed to compare the prevalence of each disease between primary/non-primary and highly exposed/non-exposed groups. RESULTS: 60 house staff from 10 departments responded to the survey. Departments were stratified into primary and non-primary team as well as highly exposed and non-exposed group. Highly exposed group had significant higher mean scores of PTSD (20.92Â±19.45 vs 11.03Â±12.31, p=0.02), DASS-21 â€“ depression (13.83Â±11.16 vs 6.39Â±8, p=0.004), and DASS-21 - stress (15Â±11.27 vs 8.17Â±8.03 p=0.008) compared to non-exposed group. The prevalence of moderate to severe depression (15(62.5%) vs 9(25%) p=0.007), stress (11(45.83%) vs 6(16.67%) p=0.02), and anxiety (7(29.17%) vs 3(8.33%) p=0.03) are significantly higher in exposed group. For primary team, the mean scores and prevalence of each disease are higher than non-primary team, though these are not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health amongst house staff has been impacted by the COVID pandemic. Symptoms of PTSD, Depression, Stress, and Anxiety were noted amongst house staff in relation to the pandemic. Our study demonstrated a clear impact on house staff that were in highly exposed fields. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: With continued emphasis on wellness for house staff, early recognition of mental health difficulties will be ideal to promoting wellness. Understanding the implications of pandemics and other high volume clinical scenarios upon the mental health of house staff could aid in early interventions to promote resident wellness. As the COVID pandemic continues to ebb, further studies will need to be done to assess the long term implications of the pandemic on the mental health of medical professionals DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Prangthip Charoenpong No relevant relationships by Anum Sheikh No relevant relationships by Najam Siddiqui","Siddiqui, N.

"COMMONLY USED MAGNESIUM SULFATE UNCOMMONLY CAUSING PULMONARY EDEMA","SESSION TITLE: Drug-Induced Critical Care SESSION TYPE: Rapid Fire Case Reports PRESENTED ON: 10/19/2022 12:45 pm - 1:45 pm INTRODUCTION: Intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSo4) is commonly used for inpatient magnesium repletion. However, it is infrequently shown to be associated with the development of pulmonary edema. We present a case of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema after starting magnesium infusion in a patient recovering from COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: 60 year old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer presented with hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. CT angiogram of her chest showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities with no evidence of pulmonary embolism. She had prolonged weaning from high flow nasal cannula and was treated with antibiotics, remedesivir, and dexamethasone. Following treatment, her inflammatory markers significantly improved. On day thirty, she was on 25 L at 45% FiO2 on high flow nasal cannula. Her magnesium level was low at 1.5 mg/dl, and 2 grams of intravenous MgSo4 was given for replacement. A few minutes after starting the infusion, the patient complained of metallic taste, severe shortness of breath, and tachypnea with a drop in oxygen saturation to 67%, which improved with increasing oxygen. CXR showed worsening perihilar infiltrates compared to prior, suggesting acute pulmonary edema. An echocardiogram showed normal function without evidence of structural abnormalities. Thyroid function was normal. She did not receive any blood products or opioids prior to this event. She responded very well to diuresis, was weaned to 5L nasal cannula in three days, and was eventually discharged on 2L supplemental oxygen. DISCUSSION: Pulmonary edema is due to the movement of excess fluid into the alveoli. It can be due to cardiogenic and noncardiogenic causes. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is due to a rise in transcapillary filtration, causing an increase in capillary permeability due to several factors, most importantly direct endothelial damage due to inflammation. Mechanisms for MgSo4 induced pulmonary edema are unknown, but theories include direct capillary damage or transient cardiac depression. It is seen in studies to be an independent risk factor for the development of pulmonary edema in pregnancy. Higher risk is associated with faster MgSo4 infusion, less concentrated MgSo4, and infection[1]. She was on abemaciclib for breast cancer before her admission, known to cause pneumonitis but was thought unlikely to cause her acute decompensation. The lack of other etiologies explaining sudden respiratory failure, her rapid improvement on stopping magnesium, and her response to diuretics supported our diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema involves addressing the underlying cause of the event and is mainly supportive. Given how commonly Mgso4 is used for repletion in the inpatient setting, MgSo4 induced pulmonary edema should be in the differential for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and promptly addressed.

"BOOZE, BETAS, AND A FATTY SOLUTION TO SPARE PANDEMIC WOES","SESSION TITLE: Cases of Overdose, OTC, and Illegal Drug Critical Cases Posters SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/17/2022 12:15 pm - 01:15 pm INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic raised economic strife, social isolation, fear from contagion, and anxiety to a level where 45% of surveyed U.S. adults report a detriment to their mental health. With U.S. suicide rates up from 10 to 14 cases per 100,000 over the past 20 years, the health and safety of a vulnerable mental health population becomes more of a concern. We report a case of an individual with depression who was resuscitated after severe toxicity from alcohol and beta-blocker ingestions. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old woman with prior suicide attempts was found in an obtunded state after finishing a 20-pack of beer and swallowing a propranolol 20 mg pill bottle. On admission, she presented with bradycardia, hypotension, and alteration to a Glasgow Coma Scale of 9 with emesis residue on her face. Her blood gas revealed an anion-gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.26, lactate of 2.53, normal potassium and calcium, and glucose of 134 mg/dL. Toxicity labs were notable for an alcohol of 199 mg/dL. Her EKG demonstrated a junctional bradycardia with a p-wave complex after the QRS consistent with retrograde depolarization of the atrium (Image 1). She was intubated to protect her airway. She subsequently developed cardiac arrest secondary to pulseless electrical activity. She underwent CPR for 33 minutes with boluses of intravenous epinephrine, glucagon, insulin, calcium gluconate, and sodium bicarbonate prior to return of spontaneous circulation. Due to failure of transcutaneous pacing, a transvenous pacer was placed. In concert with Poison Control, she was started on an a euglycemic insulin drip and an intralipid infusion. Her hemodynamics improved, and she was weaned off pacing and ICU interventions within 24 hours. She was discharged a week after admission with no residual morbidities. DISCUSSION: Overdose from nonselective beta-blockers can result in bradycardia, hypotension, seizures, QRS widening, QTc prolongation with ventricular tachy-arrhythmias, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia. Understanding the pharmacodynamics of beta-blocker toxicity enables targeted interventions to improve: chronotropy with epinephrine, glucagon, and pacing;inotropy with insulin, calcium, glucagon, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors;QRS widening with sodium bicarbonate;and QTc prolongation with magnesium or lidocaine. The high lipid solubility of propanol allows for intravenous lipid infusions to aid in drug elimination for patients in refractory cardiogenic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lack of labs for monitoring beta blocker toxicity, our case demonstrates successful resuscitation in a severe overdose. Perhaps an absence of hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, QRS and QTc changes, and tachy-arrhythmias in this incident portended to a decreased morbidity and mortality. Ultimately, we reaffirmed the role of intralipid infusions as a critical treatment adjunct for recovery from cardiogenic shock secondary to beta blockade. Reference #1: Sher L.

"REIMAGINING CARE AFTER THE ICU: LEVERAGING TELEMEDICINE FOR PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 IN THE ICU","SESSION TITLE: What Lessons Will We Take From the Pandemic? SESSION TYPE: Rapid Fire Original Inv PRESENTED ON: 10/19/2022 11:15 am - 12:15 pm PURPOSE: Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) affects 50% of ICU survivors leading to significant healthcare utilization. COVID-19 survivors are at higher risk for developing PICS given the prolonged duration of critical illness. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using telemedicine (TM) for the transitional care (TC) of post ICU COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: This prospective randomized un-blinded controlled study was conducted from July 2021 to January 2022. Adults admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 infection and discharged home were included. Those who lacked communication and internet services, and had pre-morbid conditions preventing independent self-care were excluded. 40 patients were recruited with 20 patients in each arm. The study group (SG) underwent a telemedicine (TM) visit within 2 weeks of discharge, where vital signs logs (VSL), virtual six-minute walk test (v6MWT), and EuroQoL 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire were reviewed. The control group (CG) received a TM visit within 6 weeks of discharge and completed the EQ-5D questionnaire. This study was approved by the WVU IRB (#2104284924). RESULTS: Both groups had similar baseline characteristics. Completion rate of the VSL and v6MWT was 50% in the SG. 39% of SG came off oxygen supplementation compared to 33% in the CG. There was less anxiety/depression, increased request, and compliance to follow-up in pulmonary clinic noted in SG compared to CG, however this difference was not statistically significant. All readmissions were non- preventable (n=3;2 CG, 1 SG). 100% survival rate was noted in both groups at 30-days. 5% of patients were lost to follow up in both groups due to non-working communication devices and lack of response despite multiple attempts made for the TM visit. 67% (2/3) of primary care physicians (PCP) felt that this intervention helped establish continuity of care. 83% (5/6) of participants felt that an intensivist led TC visit provided closure for their ICU hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference noted in outcomes between the 2 groups, however, this is likely due to underpowered sample sizes. This form of TC is well received by both PCP and patients in screening and mitigation of PICS. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This pilot study is the first in the region to show the acceptability and feasibility of using TM for the TC of ICU COVID survivors. It is vital to ensure ICU survivors receive targeted multidisciplinary management to prevent PICS. TM can be utilized in the future for the TC of all ICU survivors.

"A LESSON ON ANCHORING BIAS DURING A PANDEMIC: A CASE PRESENTATION","SESSION TITLE: Cases of Overdose, OTC, and Illegal Drug Critical Cases Posters SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/17/2022 12:15 pm - 01:15 pm INTRODUCTION: Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias where one relies too heavily on initial information early on in the decision making process, affecting subsequent decisions due to future arguments being discussed in relation to the ""anchor. Overemphasis on COVID-19 due to the pandemic has impacted the timely diagnosis and treatment of other diseases. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old man with a past medical history of COVID 19 in 12/2020 presents to the ED with increasing weakness, chest pain, recurrent fevers, diarrhea, and cough. CXR revealed bilateral infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia/pulmonary edema. Patient was empirically started on ceftriaxone. CT chest was suspicious of COVID-19;however repeat testing was negative. Diarrhea did not improve. Patient later admitted to recent travel to Jamaica. Ova and parasite, C-difficile, and stool culture were negative. On hospital day 8, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation for worsening hypoxic respiratory failure Infectious disease was consulted for recurrent fevers of unknown origin and diarrhea with recent travel. Testing for typhoid fever, hantavirus, malaria, HIV, zika virus, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever were performed. Consent was obtained for HIV testing. HIV antibody tests were positive, CD4 count of 7, and viral load greater than 900k. Since a new diagnosis of AIDS with a CD4 count of 7 was obtained, the patient was subsequently tested for opportunistic infections such as TB. TB sputum PCR testing was positive but AFB smear was negative for TB. Antiretroviral and tuberculosis treatments were initiated. DISCUSSION: Anchoring bias can delay critical diagnoses and impede patient care if it is not recognized. According to Watson et. al, one way physicians circumvent the thought of pretest probability when ordering tests based on patient history and the subsequent list of differential diagnoses is anchoring bias. Bypassing the pretest probability also alters the sensitivity and specificity of testing because results that do not confirm or rule out a top differential diagnosis are thought to be inaccurate and are then repeated attributing the initial result to a bad specimen or an improper collection of the specimen. CONCLUSIONS: The case presented exemplifies clearly the concept of anchoring bias. Upon initial presentation, the patient had nonspecific symptoms such as weakness, chest pain, recurrent fevers, diarrhea, and cough, all of which can be symptoms of COVID 19 in the setting of a global pandemic. It is clear that the initial diagnosis based on these symptoms was COVID 19. When initial testing was negative, anchoring bias still played a role in the decision to test the patient once again, despite the first negative test. Repeat testing still did not support the diagnosis of COVID 19, which expanded the differential diagnosis and ultimately led to the correct diagnosis of AIDS with concomitant TB infection.

"HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE OVERDOSE","SESSION TITLE: Cases of Overdose, OTC, and Illegal Drug Critical Cases Posters SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/17/2022 12:15 pm - 01:15 pm INTRODUCTION: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is commonly prescribed for the management of connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite its widespread use, there are limited case reports describing HCQ intoxication and management. HCQ toxicity presents predominantly with cardiovascular manifestations, including hypotension, arrhythmias, and QT interval prolongation on electrocardiogram (EKG). Other findings include visual disturbances, altered mental status, and hypokalemia. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 60-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and depression. She presented to the emergency department (ED) after ingesting 10-15 tablets of HCQ 200 mg in a suicide attempt. In the ED, she was noted to be lethargic and tachycardic. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 127 beats per minute and prolonged QTc of 680msec. The diagnostic evaluation also revealed hypokalemia with potassium 3.7mmol/l. Initial management in the ED included administration of activated charcoal, potassium supplementation, and intravenous bicarbonate infusion. The patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and supportive care. Serum electrolyte panel and EKG were monitored. The patient made an uneventful recovery after 2-3 days. The QT interval normalized, and hypokalemia improved. She was subsequently discharged to an inpatient psychiatric unit. DISCUSSION: Although HQC is commonly prescribed, there is limited data describing overdose. Our case of HCQ overdose presented as changes in mental status, QT interval prolongation, and hypokalemia. Similar findings have been reported in previous case reports. Management includes early gastric decontamination with activated charcoal, potassium supplementation, and supportive care. Intravenous bicarbonate infusion has been utilized for prolonged QT intervals, and benzodiazepines have been used for agitation and sedation. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, HCQ toxicity can be life-threatening. It is a commonly prescribed agent, and therefore the clinician should be aware of its toxicity profile and management.

"BETA BLOCKER AND CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER OVERDOSE COMPLICATED BY COVID-19 PNEUMONIA AND RENAL FAILURE IN A PATIENT WITH SEVERE OBESITY","SESSION TITLE: A Look Into Poisoning and Drug Overdoses SESSION TYPE: Rapid Fire Case Reports PRESENTED ON: 10/18/2022 12:25 pm - 01:25 pm INTRODUCTION: We present a case of a 64-year-old woman with severe obesity (BMI 53) who presented with shock after beta-blocker (BB) and calcium channel-blocker (CCB) overdose. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented after an intentional suicide attempt, taking multiple antihypertensive medications, including tablets of nifedipine 90mg, carvedilol 25mg, and losartan 100mg. She had also been experiencing shortness of breath and lower extremity pain for several days. Upon arrival, she was lethargic and minimally responsive, and was found to be in shock with a heart rate 63. She was intubated for airway protection and started on multiple vasopressors including norepinephrine, phenylephrine, vasopressin, dopamine and epinephrine for circulatory support. She was also found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. She was given activated charcoal, received gastric lavage, and whole bowel irrigation. She received a bolus of regular insulin at 1U/kg, and subsequently started on a high-dose insulin infusion titrated to 11U/kg/h along with dextrose infusion and calcium gluconate. By day four of admission, vasopressor requirements had been reduced to only norepinephrine and the insulin infusion had been successfully discontinued. However, her hospital course was further complicated MRSA and Pseudomonas pneumonia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. She continued to develop refractory shock, and remained over 50 liters net positive. Her condition progressively deteriorated and her gross volume overload was difficult to manage, and ultimately expired on day ten of admission. DISCUSSION: The management of CCB and BB overdose has been studied, with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic therapy (HIET)1,2 as our choice. Our patient's decline was likely secondary to the high volumes of dextrose infusion required after HIET. With underlying renal failure, insulin clearance proved to be a significant challenge. Such severe obesity with a weight-based regimen resulted in over 1500U insulin/hr at any given point with our patient. Renal clearance is governed by a proportion of t/V, where t denotes length of a dialysis session and V the volume of fluid in the patient's body.3 Patients with significant volume would require extensive dialysis sessions and fluid balances would be challenging. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was attempted later in her hospital course. However, the patient was not able to tolerate it as she had progressed to multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS: HIET has shown to be a successful management strategy for CCB and BB overdose. However, weight-based dosing can prove to be a challenge in patients with severe obesity. CRRT should be considered early in severely obese patients that undergo HIET, given the rapid accumulation of fluid secondary to the large-volume insulin and dextrose infusions. Further investigations should look into identifying maximal safe dosages of HIET, especially in severely obese patients. Reference #1: Cole JB, Arens AM, Laes JR, Klein LR, Bangh SA, Olives TD.

"HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION AMONG PATIENTS DISCHARGED ALIVE POST-COVID-19 HOSPITALIZATION","SESSION TITLE: COVID-19 Infections: Issues During and After Hospitalization SESSION TYPE: Original Investigations PRESENTED ON: 10/17/2022 01:30 pm - 02:30 pm PURPOSE: To characterize the health care utilization (HCU) of patients after discharge from a hospitalization due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Retrospective analysis from a national cohort using the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart. Included all adults hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 between April 2020 and March 2021, with prior 12 months of continuous enrollment. HCU of patients discharged to a home setting was evaluated in three periods (0-90 days;91-180 days;181-275 days post-discharge). HCU was defined as emergency department (ED) visits, inpatient (IP) admissions, rehabilitation/skilled nursing facility (SNF) admissions, outpatient (OP) and telemedicine visits and was expressed as the number of visits per 10,000 person-days to adjust for time from discharge. We also examined the distribution of office visits by provider specialty RESULTS: We identified 91,374 unique patients who were discharged alive after a hospitalization due to COVID-19. A greater percentage of patients was discharged to a home setting (n=63,674 or 65.6%: home 41.54%;home with home health services 14.65%: home with outpatient services 4.42%) than to a non-home setting (26.23%: i.e., SNF, hospice, rehabilitation facility, etc.). The patients discharged to a home setting were mostly white (58.8%), females (53.4%), whose mean age was 72.4 (SDÂ± 12). The percentage of office visits to Primary care provider (57.8%;48.3%, 47.7%), Cardiology (7.7%;8.0%;7.4%) Pulmonary medicine (4.7%;3.9%;3.1%) varied in the 3 time periods evaluated. Additionally, the outpatient visits to endocrinology (1.3%, 1.6%, 1.7%), Neurology (1.1%, 1.5%, 1.5%), Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (0.7%, 1.0%, 1.2%), Psychiatry (0.7%, 0.9%, 1.1%) and other mental health professionals (0.4%, 0.5%, 0.5%) increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: In our nationally representative study, health care utilization remains high among patients discharged to a home setting after a hospitalization due to COVID-19. Additionally, the use of mental health services increased overtime among survivors. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Understanding post-discharge health care utilization of patients after an index hospitalization due to COVID-19 will help health systems prepare and allocate resources for the most likely to be used services.

"Depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review protocol","Depression is a common mental disorder and is a major cause of years lived with disability. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in the prevalence of depression worldwide. Our aim is to identify and synthesise the determinants of depression, the diagnostic assessment tools used to evaluate depression, and the interventions carried out since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the population aged 60 and older. A systematic review of the literature will be conducted. The following databases will be searched: CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MedicLatina, MEDLINE with Full Text, and Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection. The search strategy will include the following Medical Subject Headings or similar terms: ""Depression"", ""Depressive Disorder"", ""Depressive Symptoms"", ""Older Adults"", ""Aging"", ""Elderly"", Pandemic"" and ""COVID-19"". Two independent reviewers will ascertain whether the resulting articles meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and perform the analysis of data quality. Disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer. All studies reported between December 2019 and March 2022 meeting the following criteria will be included: studies in adults aged 60 and over, and articles written in English, Portuguese, Spanish or German. Information on determinants of depression, assessment instruments used to assess depressive symptoms and/or interventions to decrease depression are reported. Studies will not be excluded based on geographical area study context (eg, community, culture or specific environment). All studies related to diagnostic assessment, care planning and/or intervention strategies specifically for older adults with depression will be included. As only secondary data will be analysed, no ethical approval is required for this study.

"Cross-sectional survey of the Mental health and Addictions effects, Service impacts and Care needs of children, youth and families during the COVID-19 pandemic: the COVID-19 MASC study protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous negative effect on the mental health and well-being of Canadians. These mental health challenges are especially acute among vulnerable Canadian populations. People living in Canada's most populous province, Ontario, have spent prolonged time in lockdown and under public health measures and there is a gap in our understanding of how this has impacted the mental health system. This protocol describes the Mental health and Addictions Service and Care Study that will use a repeated cross-sectional design to examine the effects, impacts, and needs of Ontario adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey of Ontario adults 18 years or older, representative of the provincial population based on age, gender and location was conducted using Delvinia's AskingCanadians panel from January to March 2022. Study sample was 2500 in phases 1 and 2, and 5000 in phase 3. The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test and Diagnostic Statistical Manual-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure-Adult were used to assess for substance and mental health concerns. Participants were asked about mental health and addiction service-seeking and/or accessing prior to and during the pandemic. Analyses to be conducted include: predictors of service access (ie, sociodemographics, mental illness and/or addiction, and social supports) before and during the pandemic, and Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> tests and logistic regressions to analyse for significant associations between variables and within subgroups. Ethics approval was obtained from the Sunnybrook Research Ethics Board.

"Exploring factors associated with complete mental health of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic","To explore a wide range of factors associated with complete mental health (i.e., positive mental health - the presence of flourishing, and the absence of mental illness - depressive and anxious symptoms) among Portuguese pregnant women, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative cross-sectional study. Data were collected through an online survey placed on social media websites targeting pregnant Portuguese adult women between October 2020 and April 2021. The sample comprised 207 pregnant women. A multivariate logistic regression model showed that higher levels of self-compassion and higher engagement in mindful self-care practices increased the likelihood of reporting complete mental health during pregnancy. Promoting self-compassion and mindful self-care may be particularly important in pregnant women, as these psychological factors appear to contribute to complete mental health during COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic represented a demanding period for pregnant women. Our findings highlight that targeting the promotion of self-compassion and mindful self-care practices during stressful periods could significantly contribute to their overall mental health.","Monteiro, Fernandes, Pires, Moreira, Melo, AraÃƒÂºjo-Pedrosa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2022.103521","20221026","Anxious symptoms; COVID-19 pandemic; Complete mental health; Depressive symptoms; Flourishing; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39847,""
"Virtually-delivered Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for Canadian veterans with PTSD: A study protocol for a nation-wide effectiveness and implementation evaluation","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains a significant treatment challenge among Canadian veterans. Currently accessible pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for PTSD often do not lead to resolution of PTSD as a categorical diagnosis and have significant non-response rates. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY), a complementary and integrative health (CIH) intervention, can improve symptoms of PTSD. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this intervention has pivoted to virtual delivery and may be reaching new sets of participants who face multiple barriers to care. To evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of virtually delivered Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) on decreasing PTSD symptom severity, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and pain, and improving quality of life in Canadian veterans affected by PTSD. Using a mixed-methods approach guided by the RE-AIM framework, we will conduct a hybrid type II effectiveness and implementation study of virtually delivered Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for Canadian veterans. Effectiveness will be evaluated by comparing virtually delivered SKY to a waitlist control in a single-blinded (investigator and data analyst) randomized controlled trial (RCT). Change in PTSD symptoms (PCL-5) is the primary outcome and quality of life (SF-36), symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and pain (BPI) are secondary outcomes. The SKY intervention will be conducted over a 6-week period with assessments at baseline, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, and 30 weeks. The reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention will be evaluated through one-on-one semi-structured interviews with RCT participants, SKY instructors, health professionals, and administrators that work with veterans. This is the first investigation of the virtual delivery of SKY for PTSD in veterans and aims to determine if the intervention is effective and implementable at scale.","Ryk, Simpson, Hosseiny, Notarianni, Provencher, Rudnick, Upshur, Sud","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275774","20221026","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39848,""
"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with menstrual irregularities among women of reproductive age","Biological and psychological mechanisms may be responsible for menstrual irregularities occurring among women during the COVID-19 pandemic. From January 2019 to September 2021, women (18- to 45-years-old and not using hormonal contraception) were recruited in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Cross-sectional, self-report surveys collected data on menstrual irregularities, COVID-19 vaccination, stress, depression, and loneliness. A EUA approved rapid test assay using whole blood measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests described menstrual irregularities among women recruited before versus after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and with detectable versus undetectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. A logistic regression examined the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and menstrual irregularities controlling for age, stress, depression, and loneliness. Among 182 women enrolled, 73 were enrolled after pandemic onset, and 36 provided vaccination data. Having detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was associated with a higher percentage of menstrual irregularities among unvaccinated women (0% vs. 39%, p = .026) and among all women regardless of vaccination status (31% vs. 5%; p = .005). Adjusting for age and psychological variables, the odds of menstrual irregularities were 7.03 times (95% CI [1.39, 35.60]; p = .019) higher among women with detectable antibodies compared to women without detectable antibodies. Neither enrollment date, age, nor psychological factors were associated to menstrual irregularities. Biological mechanisms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be responsible for irregular menstruation and should be further examined to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's health.","Cherenack, Salazar, Nogueira, Raccamarich, Rodriguez, Mantero, Marsh, Gerard, Maddalon, Jones, Klatt, Alcaide","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276131","20221026","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39849,""
"Mass Depopulation of Swine during COVID-19: An Exploration of Swine Veterinarians' Perspectives","This qualitative study (n = 25) was created to better understand the mental health of U.S. swine veterinarians who were involved in the mass depopulation events related to COVID-19. A total of 25 swine veterinarians, participants in a previous larger quantitative study, volunteered to be interviewed about their experiences related to the COVID-19 mass depopulation event. Themes that emerged from these interviews included: (1) the need to be better prepared for crisis events; (2) lack of public understanding; (3) moral distress; (4) empathy for others, especially young veterinarians; (5) sources of support; (6) pride, honor and gratitude; and (7) an overarching theme of emotional distancing and detachment-concerns external to one's own mental health. Based on our results, we recommend additional training and supportive services for those who might be involved in future depopulation efforts. Additionally, we suggest that the veterinary profession prioritize public education campaigns to help the public better understand the need for depopulation.","Bussolari, Packman, Currin-McCulloch, Strand, Kogan","https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci9100563","20221026","COVID-19; depopulation; large animal; swine; veterinarian; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39850,""
"[Dyspnea: neurobiological and clinical aspects]","An analysis of the results of studies carried out by specialists of the Russian Respiratory Society over the past 15 years is given. The article also includes the main provisions set out in the III Guidelines for dyspnea. A significant part of the manual is devoted to the recent achievements in studying neurophysiological processes in the brain structures during the development of dyspnea. These achievements were driven by image-diagnosis methods. An important aspect of this series of works for the clinical practice was identifying dyspnea domains and developing the instruments to assess severity. Analysis of the data on dyspnea from the clinical practice showed a highly heterogenic clinical picture, which must be taken into account in the management of individual patients. A diagnostic algorithm for long-term follow-up of patients with dyspnea syndrome is also discussed. The attention of doctors is drawn to the features of dyspnea during COVID-19; the disproportion between the sensory perception of respiratory discomfort and the degree of oxygen desaturation is emphasized. It was concluded that in the Russian-speaking environment of patients, doctors should actively use a verbal characteristic of dyspnea the language of dyspnea.

"When the Pandemic Will Be Over: Lots of Hope and Some Concerns","The COVID-19 pandemic significantly threatened healthcare systems worldwide. The worst-hit population has been represented by older people with underlying chronic comorbidities, while children and adolescents developed mild or asymptomatic forms of the disease. However, certain medical conditions (i.e., obesity, respiratory, or neurological or immune disorders) may increase the risk for poor health outcomes even in young and middle-aged people. Beyond the direct negative effects of the infection, the pandemic posed several health challenges through an increase in psycho-social issues (i.e., anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep alterations, loneliness, reduced assistance, and loss of income). Accordingly, the pandemic is negatively impacting the accumulation of the functional reserves of each individual, starting from early life. With the long-term effects of the pandemic to be seen in the coming years, clinicians must be prepared to manage such high clinical complexity of people they encounter, through the implementation of multidimensional and multidisciplinary interventions.","Azzolino, Spolidoro, Mazzocchi, Agostoni, Cesari","https://doi.org/10.3390/geriatrics7050116","20221026","COVID-19; frailty; intrinsic capacity; life course; long COVID; nutrition; public health; rehabilitation; sarcopenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39852,""
"Effect of Confinement on Anxiety Symptoms and Sleep Quality during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted lifestyles worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of confinement on anxiety symptoms and sleep quality in people living in extreme southern latitudes. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were administered to 617 people, 74.2% of whom were women. The sample was grouped according to confinement: the zone of confinement (CZ) (46.5%) and the zone of partial confinement (PZ) (53.5%). In addition, the sample was further categorized into four age subgroups (18-25 years; 26-40 years; 41-50 years; over 50 years). Higher levels of anxiety and worse sleep quality were found in the CZ group than in the PZ group. Women had higher levels of anxiety and worse sleep quality than men. A significant bidirectional relationship between anxiety and sleep quality was observed, even after controlling for sex. This study demonstrated that women and young adults were more vulnerable to the effects of confinement on anxiety symptoms and sleep quality in populations at southern latitudes.","Alvarado-Aravena, Arriaza, Castillo-Aguilar, Flores, Dagnino-Subiabre, Estrada-Goic, NÃƒÂºÃƒÂ±ez-Espinosa","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12100398","20221026","COVID-19; anxiety; confinement; mental health; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39853,""
"Exploring the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Well-Being of Migrant Populations in Europe: An Equity-Focused Scoping Review","The pandemic is aggravating health inequalities, particularly mental health inequalities, while revealing the social determinants of these inequalities, including migration as a social determinant that mediates the interaction of social, economic, cultural, institutional, and structural factors with health indicators. Therefore, it is of most relevance to identify the multiple interconnected factors that influence the mental health and well-being of migrant populations. A scoping review was developed to map the research performed in this area and to identify any gaps in knowledge, following the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. MEDLINE, Scopus, and WHO Global Health research databases on COVID-19 were searched from January 2020 to October 2021. The review followed the inclusion criteria Population/Concept/Context (PCC): Population-Adult International migrants (including refugees, asylum seekers, and undocumented migrants); Concept-determinants of (and factors influencing) mental health and well-being; Context-COVID-19 anywhere in the world. Of the sixty-five selected studies, eleven were from European countries and were the focus of this review with special attention to health inequalities experienced by migrants in Europe. The results cover a diversity of themes related to the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of migrants (country-level environmental factors, social determinants of mental health, mental health indicators and outcomes), responses (such as solidarity and resilience), populations, and study methods. The evidence found can inform recommendations and interventions focused on health promotion and mitigation of the inequalities accentuated by the pandemic.","AlarcÃƒÂ£o, Virgolino, Stefanovska-Petkovska, Neves","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12100393","20221026","coronavirus disease 2019; mental health and well-being; migration; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39854,""
"Risk Factors Associated with Mental Health Outcomes during the Post-Quarantine Period of the COVID-19 in Saudi Population: A Cross-Sectional Study","The present study aims to evaluate the mental health symptoms in the Saudi population during the COVID-19 post-quarantine period and to identify the risk factors associated with the severity of the symptoms. Anxiety was measured with the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire, depression with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, insomnia with the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and distress with the 22-item Impact Event Scale-Revised questionnaire. A total of 885 respondents answered the online questionnaires. The majority were women (72.8%), married (67.4%), have children (59.3%), and with high education levels (93.2%). The results showed that a high number of the respondents experienced mild to severe symptoms of anxiety (533; 60.3%), depression (659; 47.5%), insomnia (510; 57.6%), and distress (645; 72.9%).

"Experiencing Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Lockdown in Poland: A Cross-Sectional Study of the Mediating Effect of Resiliency on Prenatal Depression Symptoms","The COVID-19 pandemic in Poland brought uncertainty, not only to the general population but also to women preparing for childbirth, which increased the risk of mental health illnesses during this special period of life. Resilience, which refers to positive adaptation or the ability to maintain good mental health, can be a protective factor against the development of psychiatric problems such as depressive symptoms. This study aimed to assess the protective role of resilience in the relationship of such risk factors as traumatic childbirth perception and pandemic-related pregnancy stress with prenatal depressive symptoms. The study was performed at the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 80 pregnant women took part. A mediation analysis, an independent <i>t</i>-test, and a Pearson correlation analysis were conducted. The lower resilience group declared the inclusion of slightly more participants (<i>n</i> = 41; 51.2%); 39 women (48.8%) demonstrated a higher risk of prenatal depression. The analysis revealed a significant direct effect between pandemic-related stress and prenatal depression (ÃŽÂ²c = 0.285, SE = 0.05, t = 2.63, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) as well as between pandemic-related stress and resilience (ÃŽÂ²a = -0.283, SE = 0.07, t = -2.61, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) and between resilience and prenatal depression (ÃŽÂ²b = -0.585, SE = 0.07, t = -6.34, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). After the introduction of resilience as a mediator, the strength of the relationship not only decreased, but also ceased to be statistically significant (ÃŽÂ²c' = 0.120, SE = 0.04, t = 1.29, <i>p</i> = 0.19), which indicates that it was in a full mediation state (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.39, F = 25.31, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001; Z = 2.43, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). The results indicate that in pregnant women, a high level of resilience protects them from the effects of pandemic-related stress on perinatal depression symptoms.","Studniczek, Kossakowska","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12100371","20221026","COVID-19; pandemic-related pregnancy stress; prenatal depression; resilience; traumatic childbirth perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39856,""
"Toward a Deeper Understanding of Gut Microbiome in Depression: The Promise of Clinical Applicability","The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has dramatically increased the global prevalence of depression. Unfortunately, antidepressant drugs benefit only a small minority of patients. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new interventions. Accumulating evidence supports a causal relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and depression. To advance microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics of depression, a comprehensive overview of microbial alterations in depression is presented to identify effector microbial biomarkers. This procedure generated 215 bacterial taxa from humans and 312 from animal models. Compared to controls, depression shows significant differences in ÃŽÂ²-diversity, but no changes in microbial richness and diversity. Additionally, species-specific microbial changes are identified like increased Eggerthella in humans and decreased Acetatifactor in rodent models. Moreover, a disrupted microbiome balance and functional changes, characterized by an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Desulfovibrio and Escherichia/Shigella) and depletion of anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium) are consistently shared across species. Confounding effects of geographical region, depression type, and intestinal segments are also investigated. Ultimately, a total of 178 species and subspecies probiotics are identified to alleviate the depressive phenotypes. Current findings provide a foundation for developing microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics and advancing microbiota-oriented precision medicine for depression.","Liu, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Zhang, Wu, Zhao, Wang, Pu, Ji, Xie","https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202203707","20221026","depression; gut microbiome; microbial biomarkers; microbiota-based therapeutics; precision medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39857,""
"Prevalence of mental health disorders in children and adolescents in the Republic of Ireland: a systematic review","Referrals to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) have increased in recent years. Services are already under-resourced and the adverse psychological impact of Covid-19 is likely to increase demand. Accordingly, an understanding of prevalence of mental health (MH) disorders among youth is imperative to help inform and plan services. To establish prevalence of MH disorders among youth (under 18) in Ireland. A systematic review using pre-defined search terms in PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase and CINAHL was conducted. Empirical studies conducted in Ireland, in youth and focusing on MH disorders were included. From a total of 830 papers identified, 38 papers met inclusion criteria. Significant variation in rates of MH disorders was evident based on study methodology. Screening questionnaires for general psychopathology reported rates of 4.8-17.8% scoring above clinical cut-offs, with higher rates for ADHD (7.3%). Studies examining depression ranged from 4% to 20.8%, while rates for 'current' MH disorder, determined by semi-structured interview, were 15.5%, while 'lifetime' rates varied from 19.9% to 31.2%. Fewer than half (44%) of those identified as 'in need' of specialist MH services were accessing CAMHS. Data on MH disorders among Irish youth is limited, and studies showed significant variance in rates, making service planning difficult. There is an urgent need for serial epidemiological surveys, with clear operational criteria for clinically impairing MH difficulties. Such studies are essential to understand potential demand and service planning. This is most urgent given the expected increased demand post Covid-19.","Lynch, McDonnell, Leahy, Gavin, McNicholas","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2022.46","20221026","CAMHS; Ireland; Republic of Ireland; children and adolescents; epidemiology; mental health; prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39858,""
"Relationship between nurses' resilience and depression, anxiety and stress during the 2021 COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan","The COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan had a significant impact on medical services. These changes posed a threat to nurses' mental health. Resilience may protect nurses from the psychological impact of COVID-19. This study aimed to understand nurses' resilience and its relationship with nurses' characteristics (life and work situations) and mental health (depression, anxiety and stress) during the outbreak. A cross-sectional study. This study surveyed the nurses at a hospital from 9 August 2021, to 20 August 2021. The content of the questionnaire included nurses' characteristics, resilience and mental health. There was an association between higher resilience and lower mental health problems.

"The challenges of mental health of staff working with people with intellectual disabilities during COVID-19--A systematic review","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great risk to the mental health of health workers (HWs). There are likely to be particular concerns for staff working with adults with an intellectual disability, where infection control may be more challenging. We conducted a systematic review of original research examining the mental health of HWs working with people with intellectual disability, published between March 2020 and July 2021. Five original research studies were included. A high proportion of HWs working with people with intellectual disability reported having had poor mental health including stress, anxiety, and depression. This manifested in similar patterns as for other HWs and also some specific patterns seen as the need to manage increased rates of mental health issues of the people they support. Sources of support and resilience were also identified. The support system should target risk factors, answer unmet needs, and build resilience. More research is also required on the ongoing and long-term effects.","Chen, Allen, Fallon, Mulryan, McCallion, McCarron, Sheerin","https://doi.org/10.1177/17446295221136231","20221026","COVID-19; health workers; intellectual disability; mental health; vulnerable people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39860,""
"Exploring young people's perspectives on mental health support: A qualitative study across three geographical areas in England, UK","Improving young people's (YP) mental health and well-being is a global public health priority. Despite continued commitment within the UK policy agenda to improve the mental health and well-being of YP, the incidence of mental health issues continues to rise. This has been further compounded by the outbreak of COVID-19 which has disproportionately affected YP in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. Understanding YP's perspectives on what supports their mental health is important to develop policies that meet their needs. We conducted focus groups (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°18 with 42 YP aged 13-21) in three geographical areas with high levels of deprivation in England, UK. Recruited through six local youth organisations, each group of YP took part in three interlinked focus groups designed to explore their perceptions of what impacts their health in their local area, and their understandings of health inequalities through participatory methods. Throughout their discussions, YP foregrounded the significance of mental health and mental health support structures. YP perceived challenges to accessing mental health provision and an unmet need for support within their local communities. Alongside this, YP consistently highlighted the importance of youth groups for promoting good mental health and mitigating challenges to poor mental health. However, ongoing cuts to the voluntary sector and universal services continue to impact areas and individuals in the greatest need. In the face of deficits in formal mental health support, our findings highlight the pressing need for increased investment in services focused on prevention (such as youth groups) in areas of high deprivation.","Holding, Crowder, Woodrow, Griffin, Knights, Goyder, McKeown, Fairbrother","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.14078","20221026","inequalities; mental health; mental health support; young people; youth work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39861,""
"Recovery in Mind: A Recovery College's journey through the Covid-19 pandemic","The Covid-19 restrictions of 2020-2021 are known to have undermined theÃ‚Â UK population's mental health. Working alongside staff, peer trainersÃ‚Â and students at Recovery in Mind (RiM), a Recovery College (RC) in West Berkshire, England, this mixed-methods study is amongst the first to investigate how an RC has responded to the pandemic. Working in co-production with RiM staff and peer-trainers, this study employed a mixed-methods design, gathering Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) well-being outcome measures by questionnaireÃ‚Â and student experience, learningÃ‚Â and co-production by interviews. This research found that RiM continued to produce demonstrable improvements in student mental health. Students welcomed the way that RiM adapted to offering online and socially distanced provisions. Students valued the skills that RiM taught and the way that RiM courses reinforced prior learning; above this, however, they valued the mutual support and sense of community that participation provided. This study underlines the value of RCs maintaining 'hidden curriculums' of peer support and community involvement. This research emphasizes co-production as not only a tool for empowerment or service improvement but as a valuable skill for personal mental health recovery. Even when operating under the most unforeseen or challenging of conditions, RCs should always endeavour to prioritize and maintain co-production. In accordance with the RC ethos, this was an entirely co-produced study, with academic researchers and RiM staff and peer trainers working democratically in partnership with one another to design and manage the study and to write up and disseminate findings. To ensure the independence and rigour of findings, data analysis was undertaken by external academic researchers.","Yoeli, Ryan, Hensby, Habermehl, Burton, Sin","https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13635","20221026","Covid-19; Recovery College; co-production; peer trainers; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39862,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Older Primary Care Patients and Their Family Members","The COVID-19 pandemic introduced mandatory stay-at-home orders and concerns about contracting a virus that impacted the physical and mental health of much of the world's population. This study compared the rates of depression and anxiety in a sample of older primary care patients (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years old) and their family members recruited for a clinical trial before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were dyads enrolled in the Caregiver Outcomes of Alzheimer's Disease Screening (COADS) trial, which included 1,809 dyads of older primary care patients and one of their family members. Mean scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) were measured and compared before and during the pandemic. We found no difference in depression and anxiety among dyads of older primary care patients and their family members recruited before and during COVID-19. Additionally, we found that older primary care patients and family members who reported their income as comfortable had significantly lower depression and anxiety compared to those who reported having not enough to make ends meet. Along with this, older primary care patients with a high school education or less were more likely to have anxiety compared to those with a postgraduate degree. Moreover, our findings support the notion that certain demographics of older primary care patients and family members are at a higher risk for depression and anxiety, indicating who should be targeted for psychological health interventions that can be adapted during COVID-19. Future research should continue monitoring older primary care patients and their family members through the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Seibert, Schroeder, Perkins, Park, Batista-Malat, Head, Bakas, Boustani, Fowler","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6909413","20221026","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39863,""
"Perspectives of Parents and Teachers on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children's Socio-Emotional Well-Being","The negative impacts of COVID 19 on children's holistic development have been reported by researchers around the world. This qualitative study explored teachers' and parents' perspectives on the impact of physical/social distancing and school closure policies on children's socioemotional development. The study was conducted in fall 2020. The sample included four U.S. Preschools teachers (for 4-year-olds), four international preschool teachers (for 4, 5-year-olds), three U.S. Kindergarten teaches (for 5-year-olds), and 4 U.S. parents of 4 and 5-year-olds. Interviews were conducted over Zoom. Participants shared that the social deprivation experienced by children such as lack of friendships, absence of peer learning and peer communication, loss of play time, and lack of socialization impacted their children's socialization skills, higher order thinking development, mental health, and activity levels. Participants also shared that their children exhibited externalizing behaviors such as acting out, throwing tantrums, seeking negative attention, aggressiveness, lying, and showing disrespect. Participants reported children's life skills acquisition issues such as their over reliance on parents and difficulty in performing routine tasks. Participating teachers who taught 5-years-olds reported lower levels of fine motor skills among their students. The findings of the study suggest that although children have experienced severe academic learning loss during the pandemic, the post-pandemic ECE curriculum must keep a strong socio-emotional and practical life skills focus which contributes to children's overall well-being. Future studies may adopt a mixed method design in multi-country contexts to evaluate the impact of interventions implemented by early childhood programs on children's socioemotional health.","Watts, Pattnaik","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-022-01405-3","20221026","COVID-19 pandemic; International contexts; Practical life skills; Preschool and kindergarten teachers; Qualitative research; Socio-emotional development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39864,""
"Behind the Frontline: A Review on the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Workers","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has been havoc that spreadÃ‚Â like wildfire, snatching the lives of many, attacking the mental health of many more, and leaving a major chunk with the constant fear of contracting this illness. It need not be mentioned that the aftermath of this pandemic was much more on frontline workers as compared to the general population. It has now become evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced medical services and assets. This unpredictable mass health crisis had a significant impact on healthcare facilities, clinical transportation, patients with healthcare workers (HCWs), and their families. This difficult situation reinforces the requirement to step forward and take the necessary steps to shield frontline workers from deeds of violence and assaults. In this context, the present article reviews the impact the COVID warriors had on their physical, social, and especially psychological health. It revealed that the COVID-19 outbreak imparted a lesson greater than ever, that shielding the health and lives of HCWs is crucial to enable a better worldwide outcome. Be it doctors or nurses or paramedical staff, no one is exempt from the horrendous effect this crisis created on the mental as well as the physical and socialÃ‚Â well-being. Frontline HCWs demonstrated more degradation of these dimensions of their health and wellbeing as compared to non-frontline healthcare staff. Constant exposure to various infectious agents over the years, along with strenuous duties in the healthcare setup, led to neglected health. Being in direct contact with several COVID patients for longer durations imposed a greater risk on frontline workers. Not manyÃ‚Â studies have been done on this aspect, as health care workers are altruistically involved in saving lives rather than focusing on their own health. Efforts should be made to have a closer look at the aftermathÃ‚Â of this havoc on HCWs and go into the depth of depredation in order to better manage any forthcoming healthcare crisis without hampering the well-being of HCWs.","Chhablani, Choudhari","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29349","20221026","covid 19; frontline workers; healthcare workers; impact of pandemic; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39865,""
"Unusual Presentation of COVID-19 Headache and Its Possible Pathomechanism","Headache was the most common neurological symptom during the H1N1 pandemicÃ‚Â in 2009 and the most recrudescing symptom of human coronavirus (hCoV) in 2016. Even in this prevailing global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the main neurological symptom is found to be a headache.Ã‚Â Headache phenotypes identified with COVID-19 are largely migraine, tension-type headache, or cough headache located in the frontotemporal or occipital region with wavering intensity and essentially of acute onset. We present two cases of unusual headache phenotypes with COVID-19 infection and attempt to shed light on their pathomechanism. Trigeminal autonomic cephalgia may be a possibility in our case, triggered by the virus itself, either directly or through an indirect path elaborated well in the pathomechanism segment. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARs-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located in the peripheral nerve and intracranial vascular endothelium, sensitizing the trigeminovascular system by further interacting with higher cortical pain centers via the thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, producing pain. CSF analysis along with opening pressure measurement in Case 2 may portray a comprehensive understanding of our patient's headache. Coupling with the dorsal pons and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), the hypothalamus could be the supreme generator for an attack. Hypothalamic perturbance could be a possible phenomenon for abnormal headache experiences and requires further validation. The possible COVID-19 pain pathway pathomechanism engaging interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha aided with a cortical spreading depression disturbing the hypothalamus is also described in this study. Undoubtedly, this pandemic could prove to be a guiding tool for mankind, for a comprehensive understanding of the enigmatic concepts of headaches.","Daripa, Lucchese","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29358","20221026","ace2; cgrp; covid-19; headache; hypothalamus; pathomechanism; trigeminal ganglion; trigeminal nucleus caudalis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39866,""
"Mental health and lifestyle in mental health nurses: a cross-sectional, nation-wide study from Uganda during COVID-19 times","mental health nurses (MHNs) work in potentially high-stress settings, in particular in low-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic the risk might be high. This multi-centre, cross-sectional study explored the prevalence of psychological distress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among Ugandan MHNs and investigated associations between these mental health outcomes and lifestyle factors. in this cross-sectional study, participants completed the Kessler-6 (K-6), PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), simple physical activity questionnaire (SIMPAQ), physical activity (PA) vital sign (PAVS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI, and alcohol use disorder identification test-concise (AUDIT-C). Spearman Rho correlations and Mann Whitney U tests were applied. of 108 included MHNs (age =34.8Ã‚Â±10.0 years; 55.6% female) 92.6% had psychological distress (K-6Ã¢â€°Â¥13), 44.4% elevated PTSD symptoms (PCL-%Ã¢â€°Â¥41), 74.1% was physically inactive (less than 150min/week on PAVS), 75.9% reported poor sleep quality (PSQI&gt;-5) and 24.4% harmful drinking (AUDIT-CÃ¢â€°Â¥3 for women and -Ã¢â€°Â¥4 for men).

"2020 COVID-19-Related Lockdown: the Relationships Between Coping Strategies, Psychological Adjustment and Resilience Among a Non-clinical Sample of British Adults","To curb COVID-19 infections, the British government enforced a series of lockdowns resulting in restrictions on movement and socialisation. This study assessed which groups may have been at higher risk of emotional distress among a non-clinical sample of British adults. It also examined which coping strategies, if any, related to more positive psychological adjustment and higher resilience scores. A cross-sectional, correlational study was carried out. Using a convenience sample, an online survey was conducted in April-June 2020. One hundred ninety-four participants completed the Brief COPE (coping), the GAD-7 (anxiety), the PHQ-9 (depression), the CD-RISC (resilience), and provided demographic information. Participants used mainly coping strategies considered to be adaptive. They exhibited mild/moderate anxiety and depression symptoms, and moderate resilience scores. However, some individuals displayed significantly higher distress symptoms and lower resilience scores than others, especially those aged under 35 (particularly 18-24), those not working, those who were single and/or childless. Results also show that coping strategies including substance use, behavioural disengagement and self-blame were associated with anxiety and/or depression symptoms, conversely, positive reframing related to lower anxiety symptomatology. Interventions promoting positive reframing may be helpful. Similarly, interventions promoting connection to others, a factor known to enhance resilience, may be beneficial. This is particularly relevant to groups who may be more at risk of psychological distress, such as young individuals.","Lafarge, Milani, Cahill, GÃƒÂ¶rzig","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42844-022-00079-5","20221026","Adversity; Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping; Depression; Lockdown; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39868,""
"Prevalence and factors associated with food insecurity in eight high-altitude cities in Peru during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective, cross-sectional study","Food insecurity has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting an estimated 260 million people. However, little evidence is available on how pandemic-related characteristics influence food security in a high-altitude population. The objective of this study was to assess factors associated with food insecurity in high-altitude Peruvian cities during the second epidemic wave of COVID-19. A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in eight Peruvian cities over 1,500Ã‚Â m above sea level. An online survey measuring food security, presence of anxiety &amp; depressive symptoms, sleep quality, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), resilience, and sociodemographic characteristics was disseminated through social networks between December 2020 and February 2021. Generalized linear models were used to identify an association between the study variables. Of 700 participants, the median age was 23Ã‚Â years, and more than half were female (56.7%). The prevalence of food insecurity was 37.1%. Anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and PTSD were present in 72.7%, 64.1%, and 15% of respondents, respectively. The prevalence of food insecurity was higher in people with fair (PR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.23-2.07) and very bad perception of their health (PR: 4.06, 95% CI: 2.63-6.26), individuals seeking mental health support (PR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.25-1.62), and in those who lost their job due to the pandemic (PR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.62-2.04). Having moderate (PR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.26-1.83) and moderate to severe depressive symptoms (PR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.11-2.27) also increased the prevalence of food insecurity. During the pandemic, the prevalence of food insecurity has increased in the Peruvian high-altitude population, revealing the need for preventive strategies. Identification of pandemic-related characteristics that influence food insecurity can guide interventions in at-risk individuals and reduce the long-term impact of this problem on overall health and quality of life.","Zila-Velasque, Grados-Espinoza, Quispe-Chura, Valdiviezo-Morales, Diaz-VÃƒÂ©lez, Valladares-Garrido","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14372-6","20221027","COVID-19; Food security; High-altitude cities; Mental health; Peru; Public health; Female; Humans; Young Adult; Adult; Male; COVID-19; Pandemics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prevalence; Peru; Cities; Retrospective Studies; Quality of Life; Altitude; Food Supply; Food Insecurity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39869,""
"Anxiety in the adult population from the onset to termination of social distancing protocols during the COVID-19: a 20-month longitudinal study","The social distancing protocols (SDPs) implemented as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic may seriously influence peoples' mental health. We used a sample of 4361 Norwegian adults recruited online and stratified to be nationally representative to investigate the evolution of anxiety following each modification in national SDPs across a 20-month period from the onset of the pandemic to the reopening of society and discontinuation of SDPs. The mean anxiety level fluctuated throughout the observation period and these fluctuations were related to the stringency of the modified SDPs. Those with a high initial level almost in unison showed a substantial and lasting decrease of anxiety after the first lifting of SDPs. A sub-group of 9% had developed a persistent anxiety state during the first 3Ã‚Â months. Younger age, pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, and use of unverified information platforms proved to predict marked higher anxiety in the long run. In conclusion, individuals with a high level of anxiety at the outbreak of the pandemic improved when the social distancing protocols were lifted. By contrast, a sizeable subgroup developed lasting clinical levels of anxiety during the first 3Ã‚Â months of the pandemic and is vulnerable to prolonged anxiety beyond the pandemic period.","Hoffart, Bauer, Johnson, Ebrahimi","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-22686-z","20221027","Adult; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Physical Distancing; Longitudinal Studies; Anxiety; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39870,""
"The â€˜Cost of Living Crisisâ€™ and its effects on health: A qualitative study from the UK","OBJECTIVE The study explored the impacts of an economic crisis â€“ the UKâ€™s â€˜cost of living crisisâ€™ â€“ on mental and physical health from the perspectives of people themselves. It also explored how people coping with this crisis, and as a secondary objective, explored if, and if so how, the COVID-19 pandemic was shaping, their experiences or views of the cost of living crisis. DESIGN This qualitative study consisted of online focus groups carried out between September 14th- 29th 2022. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. SETTING Focus groups took place via (Zoom) videoconferencing. PARTICIPANTS Participants (n= 28) were all UK adults, recruited as part of the Public Views during the Covid Pandemic (PVCOVID) study. RESULTS Most participants, and particularly those on low or insecure income or living in deprived communities, felt that the cost of living crisis was having negative impact on their mental and emotional health and wellbeing. Analysis generated five main themes, three related to why the cost of living crisis was affecting their health: (1) Anxiety over an uncertain future; (2) Worry about others; (3) A loss of control and two related to the ways in which people were coping, or trying to cope, with the crisis: (1) Resilience and Family and community support. CONCLUSIONS. This study found that the cost of living crisis is having significant impacts on health, particularly on the mental health of those on low- or insecure-incomes or from deprived communities. Further research and policy investment is needed to explore ways to provide emotional as well as practical/financial support for those most vulnerable to economic crises.","Simon Nicholas WIlliams et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00AE-028-B8A","20221026","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; mental health; health behaviours; cost of living crisis; public attitudes; economic strain; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-27","",39871,""
