"Trauma and stressor-related disorders among health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic and the role of the gender: A prospective longitudinal survey","Health-care Workers (HCW) are facing a critical situation caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) which could impact on their mental health status. In addition, HCW women have been identified as a group at high-risk of developing psychological distress, although no previous longitudinal studies have explored this issue in a sample of HCW. The main aim of the study was to observe the temporal pattern of the stress reactions among HCW as well as to explore its potential predictors of poor outcome. Moreover, we analyzed possible gender differences in stress reaction responses. One thousand for hundred and thirty-two HCW responded an online survey including sociodemographic, clinical, and psychometric tests in May 2020 while 251 HCW answered in November 2020. Bivariate and multivariate analyses as well as repeated measures analyses were used to achieve the aims of the study. The proportion of HCW who fulfilled Acute Stress Disorder criteria did not change over the follow-up period, although we observed a significant improvement in stress reactions responses among HCW. Proximal factors were the most salient predictors of traumatic reactions. Repeated analyses revealed significant gender differences in acute stress reactions. In addition, women showed significantly greater improvement than men in re-experiencing the traumatic event and hyperarousal dimensions. Monitoring of working conditions as well as emotional reactions in HCW facing major disasters should be carried out to prevent the development of peritraumatic stress reactions. In addition, HCW women are characterized by a different pattern of progression in stress responses.","Canal-Rivero, Armesto-Luque, Rubio-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Rodriguez-MenÃƒÂ©ndez, Garrido-Torres, CapitÃƒÂ¡n, Luque, Crespo-Facorro, Ruiz-Veguilla","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.021","20220115","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-16","",25592,""
"Clinical factors associated with lower health scores in COVID-19 related persistent olfactory dysfunction","Patients suffering from persistent COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction (OD) commonly report parosmia. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 OD and parosmia is critical to prioritizing research and interventions. This study investigates the impact of parosmia and other clinical and disease characteristics on health state utility values (HUVs) for those with persistent COVID-19 OD. Patients with a history of COVID-19 diagnosis and persistent OD were recruited from a tertiary medical center and a social media support forum for chemosensory dysfunction. Clinical characteristics and disease specific symptoms were obtained along with self-reported history of smell function and presence of parosmia. HUVs were calculated using indirect (EuroQol-5Dimension, [EQ-5D]) and direct measures (VAS). This study included 286 subjects (75.52% female) with persistent COVID-19 related OD. The meanÃ‚Â±SD HUVs based on EQ-5D and VAS were 0.81Ã‚Â±0.14 and 0.73Ã‚Â±0.21, respectively. Mean self-reported smell function (on a 0-10 scale) was 9.67Ã‚Â±1.25 pre-COVID-19, 0.93Ã‚Â±2.34 at diagnosis, and 3.39Ã‚Â±2.32 current. 89.16% of subjects reported parosmia and 24.13% sought medical care for anosmia. Seeing an MD for OD (p&lt;0.001), female gender (EQ-5D only, p = 0.002), a history of chronic pain (p&lt;0.05) and depression/anxiety (EQ-5D only, p&lt;0.001) predicted worse health. Parosmia and persistent symptoms such as shortness of breath were associated with lower EQ-5D and VAS scores but did not independently predict lower health scores on multivaiable analysis. Persistent COVID-19 OD results in health states comparable to other chronic diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

"The Changing Tides of Caregiving During the COVID-19 Pandemic: How Decreasing and Increasing Care Provision Relates to Caregiver Well-Being","Pandemic-specific changes to the caregiving context, (e.g., attempts to reduce exposure, physical distancing requirements) may lead to changes in care provision. This study uses the 2020 National Health and Aging Trends Study Family Members and Friends COVID-19 questionnaire to explore changes in the amount of care provision during COVID-19 and associations with stress process outcomes of caregiving. The sample includes 1020 caregivers who provided care for an older adult during COVID-19. Caregivers indicated whether their hours of care decreased, stayed stable, or increased during the pandemic. We describe reasons for change in care and compare changes in care by demographic and care-related characteristics using Chi-squares and ANOVAs, and relate changes in care with stress process outcomes (e.g., overload, COVID-related anxiety) using multivariable linear regression. Caregivers were 60.7 years old on average, 69.3% female and 18.6% were non-white. While most caregivers reported no change, 30.5% reported an increase and 11.5% reported a decrease in the amount of pandemic care provided. Relative to maintaining stable care provision, an increase was associated broadly with worse mental health and care-related stress, whereas a decrease was associated with greater emotional difficulty related to care and lower levels of positive affectivity. Those who changed their care provision during the pandemic predominantly did so to protect their care recipient from COVID-19 exposure. Increasing one's care provision was strongly associated with worse mental health and well-being. Supports for caregivers who take on additional care tasks during the pandemic could have great public health benefit.","Leggett, Koo, Park, Choi","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbac002","20220115","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-16","",25594,""

"Neuropsychological Correlates of Internet Addiction","The Internet, mobile phones, and other similar tools are often necessary for the current functioning of both private life and business. During these two years of pandemic (2019-2021), Internet use, especially different games and mobile phones, were indispensable for the global population. Internet addiction is defined as a psychological dependence on the internet, regardless of the type of activity once logged on. Many studies have confirmed the correlation of stress, depression, and anxiety with internet addiction. It has also been proven that internet addiction, per se, increases the risk of depression, anxiety, and stress. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has generated and promoted social isolation along with unmonitored and increased screen time, all of which are the main causes of internet addiction. The aim of this article is to give a short review of internet addiction research, terminology, and symptoms related to brain functioning. The source material was articles cited in the database, PubMed. Our interest was especially oriented towards the personality characteristics of users and addicted persons as well as neuroimage findings among affected people. We selected the newest articles, published in the period of 2012-2021, of which there are more than 2000. The selected obtained results will be presented and discussed.","Pop-Jordanova, Loleska","https://doi.org/10.2478/prilozi-2021-0031","20220115","internet addiction; neuroimaging; psychological factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-16","",25596,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Those Supported in the Community with Long-Term Mental Health Problems: A Qualitative Analysis of Power, Threat, Meaning and Survival","Research suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on those already living with mental health problems, though there is also evidence of resilience. However, to date there has been limited in-depth qualitative investigation. We interviewed 15 people living with long-term mental health problems who, before the pandemic, were being supported by third sector organisations, to explore how they experienced lockdowns and accessing services remotely. Template analysis was informed by the Power Threat Meaning Framework and suggested that participants experienced significant threats to their mental wellbeing and recovery which were exacerbated by current or previous powerlessness and inequality. Although participants described positive coping strategies, several described a return of unhelpful behaviours that had contributed to the original difficulties. The findings illustrate the wider contributions of social and economic context to mental health problems and the importance of ensuring that people do not feel abandoned and are proactively supported.","Leeming, Lucock, Shibazaki, Pilkington, Scott","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-021-00932-4","20220115","COVID-19; Mental health; Power Threat Meaning Framework; Qualitative; Service Users","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-16","",25597,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of dentists in Wales","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has had a large impact on dentistry across Wales. Dentists were facing significant levels of psychological distress prior to the pandemic, so it was important to monitor dentists' mental health during this unprecedented challenge.Aims To gain both an understanding of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has been having on the mental health of dentists working in Wales, as well as understanding the levels of stress the pandemic has caused. We also aimed to understand the specific causes of stress.Results High levels of stress were found, with 82% of respondents saying stress levels in the dental team have increased noticeably. Three-quarters of respondents have gone to work despite not feeling mentally well enough. Working conditions and financial pressures caused by the pandemic have directly impacted the mental health of many dentists. As a result, they have been using both adaptive and maladaptive coping methods to cope with the stress of the pandemic, with over one-third of respondents drinking alcohol more frequently than before the pandemic.Conclusions The pandemic has had a profound impact on the professional lives of dentists working in Wales. Their interactions with patients and colleagues have been greatly affected, as well as their work and working conditions. These have all substantially contributed to increased stress levels. Without significant improvements to the working conditions of dentists, as well as continued psychological support, large-scale burnout in the future is not only possible, but likely.","Owen, Seddon, Clarke, Bysouth, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41415-021-3756-7","20220115","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-16","",25598,""
"Nurses' eating habits in Lebanon during the economic and health crises: a cross-sectional study","Nurses face multiple stressors that can influence their lifestyle, thus affecting their health status. Scarce are the scientific data on the nutritional status of nurses, especially during health crises. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the eating habits of hospital nurses in the context of an exceptional economic situation in Lebanon. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a web-based questionnaire, targeting a non-random sampling of frontline nurses using the snowball technique. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were carried out. The population of the study included all registered nurses working in the Lebanese hospitals. A total of 533 nurses completed the questionnaire; 500 surveys were selected after excluding the ones presenting conditions that may affect their eating behavior. The majority of the respondents were women (78.6%) with a mean age of 33 years [18-60] [SD,7.44 years]. Most of them (57.6%) had a crowding index Ã¢â€°Â¥1. The consumption of different food groups decreased during these crises. There was a significant correlation between stress and deterioration of healthy food consumption, which provides beneficial nutrients and minimizes potentially harmful elements, especially for meat (OR 2.388, CI 1.463 to 3.898, PÃ‚Â &lt; 0.001). The decrease in monthly income showed a real impact on the consumption of healthy food such as meat (OR 2.181, CI 1.504 to 3.161, PÃ‚Â &lt; 001), fruits (OR 1.930, CI 1.289 to 2.888, PÃ‚Â = 0.001), and milk and dairy products (OR 1.544, CI 1.039 to 2.295, PÃ‚Â = 0.031). The pandemic and in particular the economic crisis has changed the consumption of healthy food among hospital nurses in Lebanon. Similar research and support may be extended to include other frontline health care workers.","Nohra, Naim, Chaaban, Rothan-Tondeur","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-021-00775-1","20220115","COVID-19; Eating habits; Economic crisis; Frontline nurses; Lebanon; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-16","",25599,""
