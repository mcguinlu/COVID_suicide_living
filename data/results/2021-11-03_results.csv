"Patterns of suicide ideation across eight countries in four continents during the COVID-19 pandemic era: repeated cross-sectional study","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and countries' response measures, have had a globally significant mental health impact. This mental health burden has also been fuelled by an infodemic; an information overload, which includes misinformation and disinformation. Suicide, the worst mental health outcome, is a serious public health problem which can be prevented with timely, evidence-based, and often low-cost interventions. Suicide ideation, one important risk factor for suicide, is thus important to measure and monitor, as are the factors which may impact on it. This investigation has two primary aims: (1) to estimate and compare country specific prevalence of suicide ideation at two different time points, overall and by gender and age groups; and, (2) to investigate the influence of sociodemographic and infodemic variables on suicide ideation. A repeated online eight country (Canada, United States of America, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, Philippines and New Zealand) cross-sectional study was undertaken of adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years; with measurement wave 1 conducted from 29th May 29 to 12th June 2020, and measurement wave 2 conducted from 6-18th November 2021. Self-reported suicide ideation was derived from item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Age standardized suicide ideation rates were reported, a binomial regression model was used to estimate suicide ideation indication rates for each country and measurement wave, and logistic regression models were then employed to relate sociodemographic, pandemic, and infodemic variables to suicide ideation. The final sample totalled 17,833 adults; 8,806 (49.4%) from measurement wave 1 and 9,027 (50.6%) from wave 2 - with over 1,000 from each country at each time-point. Overall, 24.2% and 27.5% of participants reported suicide ideation at measurement waves 1 and 2, respectively, a difference that was significant (P&lt;.001). Considerable variability was observed in suicide ideation age standardized rates between countries, ranging from 15.6% in Belgium (wave 1) to 42.9% in Hong Kong (wave 2). Frequent social media usage was associated with increased suicide ideation at wave 2 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.72; P&lt;.001) but not wave 1 (AOR=1.11, 95% CI .96-1.23; P=.16). However, having a weaker sense of coherence (SOC) (AOR=3.80, 95% CI 3.18-4.55, at wave 1 and AOR=4.39, 95% CI 3.66-5.27, at wave 2; both P&lt;.001) had the largest overall effect size. Suicide ideation is prevalent and significantly increasing over time in this COVID-19 pandemic era, with considerable variability between countries. Younger adults and those residing in Hong Kong carried disproportionately higher rates. Social media appears to have an increasingly detrimental association with suicide ideation, although having a stronger SOC had a larger protective effect. Policies and promotion of SOC, together with disseminating health information that explicitly tackles the infodemic's misinformation and disinformation, may importantly reduce the rising mental health morbidity and mortality triggered by this pandemic.","Schluter, GÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©reux, Hung, Landaverde, Law, Mok, Murray, O'Sullivan, Qadar, Roy","https://doi.org/10.2196/32140","20211102","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-03","",19807,""
"The Longitudinal Psychological, Physical Activity, and Financial Impact of a COVID-19 Lockdown on Older Adults in Singapore: The PIONEER-COVID Population-based Study","Several countries have implemented ""lockdown"" measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To examine the psychological, physical activity (PA), and financial impact of a 2-month COVID-19 lockdown on older adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years in Singapore, and to identify factors associated with adverse lockdown-related outcomes. We interviewed 496 community-dwelling adults (mean age (SD): 73.8 (7.6) years; 54.8% female) during the lockdown who had previously participated in a population-based epidemiological study. Validated questionnaires were utilized to assess loneliness and depressive symptoms at both timepoints, while inhouse questionnaires were used to assess PA and financial difficulty during lockdown. Multivariable regression models determined the lockdown-related change in loneliness and depression scores, and the factors associated with adverse outcomes. Loneliness increased significantly during the lockdown period (p&lt;0.001) while depressive symptoms decreased (p=0.022). Decreased PA, greater financial problems, male gender, Indian ethnicity, living alone, having a greater body mass index and perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 were all associated with worsening loneliness scores. A total of 36.9% and 19.6% participants reported decreased PA and had financial problems during the lockdown, respectively. Unemployment was associated with decreased PA, while self-employed individuals, cleaners, retail workers, and smokers had greater odds of experiencing financial difficulty. Despite a decrease in depressive symptoms, our population of older Asians reported a significant increase in loneliness and decreased PA, with one-fifth experiencing financial problems during lockdown. Our data suggest that more targeted public health efforts are needed to reduce repercussions of future lockdowns. This article is protected by copyright.

"Working from home and positive/negative experiences due to social distancing as interacting factors of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Chinese general population","This study investigated the associations between some factors related to working from home status (WFHS) and positive/negative experiences due to social distancing and their interactions effects on depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. A random population-based telephone survey interviewed income-earning adults in the Hong Kong general population during April 21-28, 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°200). Mild to severe depression (according to PHQ-9) was reported by 12% of the participants. The prevalence of WFHS categories was 14% for 3-7Ã‚Â days and 13% forÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°8Ã‚Â days (past 2 weeks). The multivariable regression analysis showed that, social isolation (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.36; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), relaxation feeling in daily life (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°- 0.22; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002), and WFHSÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°8Ã‚Â days (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.15; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.027), but not perceived huge inconvenience and improved family relationship, were associated with depressive symptoms. Statistically significant interaction effects were found. Some positive experiences buffered the potential harms of some negative experiences of social distancing on depressive symptoms; WFHSÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°8Ã‚Â days significantly moderated the risk/protective effects of social isolation, improved family relationship, and relaxation feeling on depressive symptoms. Social distancing is double-edged. Positive experiences should be maximized while negative experiences be minimized, as both were directly and interactively associated with depression. Intensive but not mild to moderate (&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°80%) WFHS may impact depressive symptoms negatively via its direct association with depression; it also moderated the associations between positive/negative experiences due to social distancing and depression. Further research is required to discern the inter-relationships among WFHS, positive/negative experiences of social distancing, and depression to better cope with the stressful pandemic.","Yu, Lau, Lau","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02179-6","20211102","COVID-19; China; Depression; Interaction; Social distancing; Working from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-03","",19809,""
"Emergency Medical Services and Syndromic Surveillance: A Comparison With Traditional Surveillance and Effects on Timeliness","Traditional public health surveillance of nonfatal opioid overdose relies on emergency department (ED) billing data, which can be delayed substantially. We compared the timeliness of 2 new data sources for rapid drug overdose surveillance-emergency medical services (EMS) and syndromic surveillance-with ED billing data. We used data on nonfatal opioid overdoses in Kentucky captured in EMS, syndromic surveillance, and ED billing systems during 2018-2019. We evaluated the time-series relationships between EMS and ED billing data and syndromic surveillance and ED billing data by calculating cross-correlation functions, controlling for influences of autocorrelations. A case example demonstrates the usefulness of EMS and syndromic surveillance data to monitor rapid changes in opioid overdose encounters in Kentucky during the COVID-19 epidemic. EMS and syndromic surveillance data showed moderate-to-strong correlation with ED billing data on a lag of 0 (<i>r</i> = 0.694; 95% CI, 0.579-0.782; <i>t</i> = 9.73; df = 101; <i>P</i> &lt; .001; and <i>r</i> = 0.656; 95% CI, 0.530-0.754; <i>t</i> = 8.73; df = 101; <i>P</i> &lt; .001; respectively) at the week-aggregated level. After the COVID-19 emergency declaration, EMS and syndromic surveillance time series had steep increases in April and May 2020, followed by declines from June through September 2020. The ED billing data were available for analysis 3 months after the end of a calendar quarter but closely followed the trends identified by the EMS and syndromic surveillance data. Data from EMS and syndromic surveillance systems can be reliably used to monitor nonfatal opioid overdose trends in Kentucky in near-real time to inform timely public health response.","Rock, Quesinberry, Singleton, Slavova","https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549211018673","20211102","COVID-19; EMS; opioid overdose; syndromic surveillance; time-series analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-03","",19810,""
"An eHealth Intervention for Promoting COVID-19 Knowledge and Protective Behaviors and Reducing Pandemic Distress among Sexual and Gender Minorities: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial (#SafeHandsSafeHearts)","Existing data on COVID-19 disparities among vulnerable populations portend excess risk for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) and other persons outside of heteronormative and cisgender identities (i.e., LGBT+). Owing to adverse social determinants of health, including pervasive HIV and sexual stigma, harassment, violence, barriers in access to healthcare, and existing health and mental health disparities, sexual and gender minorities in India and Thailand are at disproportionate risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease. Despite global health disparities among LGBT+ populations, there is a lack of coordinated, community-engaged interventions to address the expectable excess burden of COVID-19 and public health-recommended protective measures. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief, peer-delivered eHealth intervention to increase COVID-19 knowledge and public health-recommended protective behaviors and reduce psychological distress among LGBT+ people residing in Bangkok, Thailand, and Mumbai, India. Subsequent to the RCT, we will conduct exit interviews with purposively sampled subgroups, including those with no intervention effect. SafeHandsSafeHearts is a 2-site, parallel waitlist-controlled RCT to test the efficacy of a 3-session, peer counselor-delivered eHealth intervention based on motivational interviewing and psychoeducation. The study methods, online infrastructure and content were pilot tested with LGBT+ individuals in Toronto, Canada before adaptation and roll-out in the other contexts. The primary outcomes are COVID-19 knowledge (index based on U.S. CDC items), protective behaviors (index based on WHO and U.S. CDC guidelines), depression (PHQ-2) and anxiety (GAD-2). Secondary outcomes include loneliness, COVID-19 stress, and intended care-seeking. We will enroll N = 310 participants in each city, age 18 years and older, one-third cisgender gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, one-third cisgender lesbian, bisexual and other women who have sex with women, and one-third transfeminine, transmasculine and gender nonbinary people. Participants will be equally stratified in the immediate intervention and waitlist control group. Participants are mainly recruited from online social media accounts of community-based partner organizations. They can access the intervention on a computer, tablet, or mobile phone. SafeHandsSafeHearts has 3 sessions delivered weekly over three successive weeks. Exit interviews will be conducted online with 3 subgroups (n = 12 per group; N = 36 in each city) of purposively selected participants, to be informed by RCT outcomes and focal populations of concern. The RCT was funded in 2020. The study protocol was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04870723). The trials started recruitment as of August 1, 2021, and all RCT data collection will likely be completed by December 31, 2021. The SafeHandsSafeHearts RCT will provide evidence about the effectiveness of a brief, peer-delivered e-Health intervention developed for LGBT+ populations amid the COVID-19 pandemic. If the intervention proves effective, it will provide a basis for future scale-up in India and Thailand, and other low- and middle-income countries.

"Risk for depression tripled during the COVID-19 pandemic in emerging adults followed for the last 8 years","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly increased depression rates, particularly in emerging adults. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal changes in depression risk before and during COVID-19 in a cohort of emerging adults in the U.S. and to determine whether prior drinking or sleep habits could predict the severity of depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Participants were 525 emerging adults from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), a five-site community sample including moderate-to-heavy drinkers. Poisson mixed-effect models evaluated changes in the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) from before to during COVID-19, also testing for sex and age interactions. Additional analyses examined whether alcohol use frequency or sleep duration measured in the last pre-COVID assessment predicted pandemic-related increase in depressive symptoms. The prevalence of risk for clinical depression tripled due to a substantial and sustained increase in depressive symptoms during COVID-19 relative to pre-COVID years. Effects were strongest for younger women. Frequent alcohol use and short sleep duration during the closest pre-COVID visit predicted a greater increase in COVID-19 depressive symptoms. The sharp increase in depression risk among emerging adults heralds a public health crisis with alarming implications for their social and emotional functioning as this generation matures. In addition to the heightened risk for younger women, the role of alcohol use and sleep behavior should be tracked through preventive care aiming to mitigate this looming mental health crisis.","Alzueta, Podhajsky, Zhao, Tapert, Thompson, de Zambotti, Yuksel, Kiss, Wang, Volpe, Prouty, Colrain, Clark, Goldston, Nooner, De Bellis, Brown, Nagel, Pfefferbaum, Sullivan, Baker, Pohl","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721004062","20211102","Alcohol; COVID-19 pandemic; depression; emerging adults; longitudinal; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-03","",19812,""

A cross-sectional study conducted in the postnatal ward of Lady Hardinge Medical College and Smt. Sucheta Kriplani Hospital, New Delhi from August 2020 to February 2021 using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to estimate point prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) in the stratified zones (suspect and nonsuspect) of the hospital. Total of 408 postpartum women,204 each (COVID-19 suspects, and nonsuspects zone) were enrolled. Prevalence of Postpartum depression using an EDPS score of &gt;9 was 11.9 %. Prevalence of depression (17.9%; vs 4.85%, p &lt;0.001) and level of depression (5.01Ã‚Â±3.41 vs 4.14Ã‚Â± 2.54, p 0.004) was significantly higher in mothers in isolated quarantine wards of COVID-19 suspect zone as compared to nonsuspect zones. Anhedonia was reported significantly higher (p &lt;0.001) in suspect zone mothers. Multivariate analysis showed 'stay in COVID-19 suspect zone' and 'COVID-19 Suspect status' as a significant predictor of PPD.

"An mCARE study on patterns of risk and resilience for children with ASD in Bangladesh","Community-wide lockdowns in response to COVID-19 influenced many families, but the developmental cascade for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be especially detrimental. Our objective was to evaluate behavioral patterns of risk and resilience for children with ASD across parent-report assessments before (from November 2019 to February 2020), during (March 2020 to May 2020), and after (June 2020 to November 2020) an extended COVID-19 lockdown. In 2020, our study Mobile-based care for children with ASD using remote experience sampling method (mCARE) was inactive data collection before COVID-19 emerged as a health crisis in Bangladesh. Here we deployed ""Cohort Studies"", where we had in total 300 children with ASD (150 test group and 150 control group) to collect behavioral data. Our data collection continued through an extended COVID-19 lockdown and captured parent reports of 30 different behavioral parameters (e.g., self-injurious behaviors, aggression, sleep problems, daily living skills, and communication) across 150 children with ASD (test group). Based on the children's condition, 4-6 behavioral parameters were assessed through the study. A total of 56,290 behavioral data points was collected (an average of 152.19 per week) from parent cell phones using the mCARE platform. Children and their families were exposed to an extended COVID-19 lockdown. The main outcomes used for this study were generated from parent reports child behaviors within the mCARE platform. Behaviors included of child social skills, communication use, problematic behaviors, sensory sensitivities, daily living, and play.

"Management of burnout among the staff of primary care centres in Spain during the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2","The provision of healthcare during the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus represented a challenge for the management of the resources in the primary care centres. We proposed assessing burnout among the staff of those centres and identifying factors that contributed to its appearance and those that limited it. An observational study which, by means of anonymous questionnaires, collected information about: (i) demographic variables; (ii) the characteristics of each position; (iii) the measures implemented by the medical decision-makers in order to provide care during the pandemic; and (iv) the Burnout Clinical Subtype Questionnaire (BCSQ-36). We performed a descriptive analysis of the burnout mentioned by the staff, and, by means of a multivariate analysis, we identified the factors which influenced it. Using logit models, we analysed whether receiving specific training in COVID-19, feeling involved in decision-making processes, and/or working within different healthcare systems had effects on the development of burnout. We analysed the replies of 252 employees of primary care centres in Spain with an average age of 45 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.7) and 22 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.4) years of experience. 68% of the participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°173) indicated burnout of the frenetic subtype. 79% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°200) of the employees had high scores in at least one burnout subtype, and 62% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°156) in at least two. Women older than 45 had a lower probability of suffering burnout. Receiving specific training (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.28; CI95%: 0.11-0.73) and feeling involved in decision-making (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.32; CI95%:0.15-0.70) each reduced the probability of developing burnout. Working in a different department increased the likelihood of developing burnout of at least one clinical subtype (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.85; CI95%: 1.38-5.86). The staff in primary care centres have developed high levels of burnout. Participation in decision-making and receiving specific training are revealed as factors that protect against the development of burnout. The measures taken to contain the adverse effects of a heavy workload appear to be insufficient. Certain factors that were not observed, but which are related to decisions taken by the healthcare management, appear to have had an effect on the development of some burnout subtypes.","Aranda-Reneo, Pedraz-Marcos, Pulido-Fuentes","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-021-00679-9","20211102","BCSQ-36; Burnout; COVID-19; Mental health; Primary care; SARS-CoV-2; Workload","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-03","",19816,""
"Unexpected changes in birth experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: Implications for maternal mental health","This study examined the rates of unexpected birth experiences due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with women's postpartum mental health symptoms (depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD). Our cross-sectional analysis included postpartum women (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°506) who reported on birth plan changes attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic through the PEACE (Perinatal Experiences and COVID-19 Effects)Ã‚Â Study, an online survey that took place between MayÃ‚Â 2020 and May 2021. Covariates included sociodemographic variables, number of days since the pandemic, pre-pregnancy mental health history, and protective factors such as social support, distress tolerance, and resilience. Prevalent COVID-19 pandemic changes in the birth experience included not having support people (e.g., partners and friends) permitted to participate in the baby's delivery (33.5%), reduced access to preferred medications before or after delivery (9.7%), unavailable health care providers for the baby's birth as planned (9.6%), and other changes (13.8%). The reduced access to medications was associated with those reporting higher levels of depressive (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.10, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and PTSD symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.07, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05).

Unexpected changes to the birth experience due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have small but persistent effects on depressive and PTSD symptoms.

"Youths' and Parents' Experiences and Perceived Effects of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety Disorders in Primary Care: Mixed Methods Study","Anxiety is common among youths in primary care. Face-to-face treatment has been the first choice for clinicians, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital psychological interventions have substantially increased. Few studies have examined young people's interest in internet treatment or the attitudes they and their parents have toward it. This study aims to investigate adolescents' and parents' attitudes toward and experiences of internet-based cognitive behavioral anxiety treatment in primary care and its presumptive effects. The study used mixed methods, analyzing qualitative data thematically and quantitative data with nonparametric analysis. Participants were 14 adolescents and 14 parents recruited in adolescent primary health care clinics. The adolescents and their parents filled out mental health questionnaires before and after treatment, and were interviewed during ongoing treatment. The quantitative data indicated that the internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program used in this study was successful in reducing symptoms (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>=8.333; P=.02) and that adolescents' motivation is essential to the treatment outcome (r=0.58; P=.03). The qualitative results show that youths highly value their independence and freedom to organize treatment work on their own terms. The parents expressed uncertainty about their role and how to support their child in treatment. It was important for parents to respect the youths' need for autonomy while also engaging with them in the treatment work. Internet treatment in primary care is accepted by both youths and their parents, who need clarification about the difference between their role and the therapist's role. Patient motivation should be considered before treatment, and therapists need to continue to develop the virtual alliance. Finally, primary care should be clearer in informing adolescents and their parents about the possibility of internet treatment.","Lilja, Rupcic Ljustina, Nissling, Larsson, Weineland","https://doi.org/10.2196/26842","20211101","CBT; adolescents; anxiety; cognitive behavioral therapy; digital health; experiences; internet; mixed methods; parents; primary care; youths","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-03","",19818,""
"Implementing a Telehealth Supportive Counseling Center With PMHNP Students","This educational innovation describes the implementation of a telehealth supportive counseling center for psychiatric/mental health nurse practitioner (PMHNP) students at a small graduate school. The free, nurse-run, health care center was at risk due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in-person care restrictions. Due to COVID-19, PMHNP faculty and students pivoted to offer services via telehealth for the summer 2020 semester. Planning and implementation strategies regarding this pivot are presented. PMHNP students conducted a total of 82 visits, recording a 150% increase in clients served during the telehealth implementation. On average, students accrued between 39 and 73 supervised clinical hours. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical placements as well as access to health care services were jeopardized. Through innovation and flexibility, PMHNP students were able to continue accruing supervised clinical hours, and an identified need in the community was continued to be met. <b>[<i>J Nurs Educ</i>. 2021;60(11):651-654.]</b>.","Brown, Swales, Sabo","https://doi.org/10.3928/01484834-20210914-02","20211101","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-03","",19819,""
"R U OK?","Recently, some high-profile athletes and other celebrities have raised the visibility and public discussion of issues of mental health. The dialogue about mental health and the most extreme effect of depression, increased suicide rates, is needed now more than ever. The level of moral distress that our health care workers are experiencing in this recent spike of corona-virus disease (COVID-19) infection is taking an incredible social, emotional, and professional toll. Some describe their experience as post-traumatic stress disorder, and others report experiencing numbness, fog, despair, and hopelessness. The intervention discussed here, R U OK?, is gaining traction on social media as a way that everyone can engage to help to address the effects on individuals. <b>[<i>J Contin Educ Nurs</i>. 2021;52(11):500-501.]</b>.","Jones-Schenk","https://doi.org/10.3928/00220124-20211008-03","20211101","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-03","",19820,""
"Association Between Adverse Childhood Experiences and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes","To examine the association between adverse childhood experiences and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This cohort study included individuals who enrolled in a perinatal collaborative mental health care program (COMPASS [the Collaborative Care Model for Perinatal Depression Support Services]) between 2017 and 2021. Participants completed psychosocial self-assessments, including an adverse childhood experiences screen. The primary exposure was adverse childhood experiences measured by the ACE (adverse childhood experience) score, which was evaluated as a dichotomized variable, with a high ACE score defined as greater than three. Secondary analyses used the ACE score as a continuous variable. Adverse pregnancy outcomes including gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) births were abstracted from the electronic health record. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed, including mediation analyses. Of the 1,274 women with a completed adverse childhood experiences screen, 904 (71%) reported one or more adverse childhood experiences, and 290 (23%) reported a high ACE score (more than three adverse childhood experiences). Adverse childhood experience scores were not associated with gestational diabetes or SGA births. After controlling for potential confounders, individuals with high ACE score had 1.55-fold (95% CI 1.06-2.26) increased odds of having hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and 2.03-fold (95% CI 1.38-2.99) increased odds of preterm birth. Each point increase in ACE score was not associated with a statistically increased odds of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.15); however, each additional point on the adverse childhood experiences screen was associated with increased odds of preterm birth (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05-1.22). Mediation analyses demonstrated tobacco use, chronic medical problems, and obesity each partially mediated the observed association between high ACE scores and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Having chronic medical comorbidities partially mediated the observed association between high ACE scores and preterm birth. One in four individuals referred to a perinatal mental health program who were pregnant or postpartum had a high ACE score. Having a high ACE score was associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth. These results underscore how remote events may reverberate through the life course.","Miller, Fleming, Ekpe, Grobman, Heard-Garris","https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000004570","20211101","Adult; Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events; Adverse Childhood Experiences; COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Mental Health Services; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; Psychiatric Rehabilitation; Risk Assessment; SARS-CoV-2; Self-Assessment; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-03","",19821,""
"Burnout, depression and anxiety among Swiss medical students - A network analysis","It is well established that burnout in medical students is associated with depression and anxiety at a syndromal level. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate about the extent to which burnout overlaps with depression and anxiety. The emerging network approach to psychopathology offers a new perspective on the interrelations between mental disorders focusing on symptom-level association. In this cross-sectional study, we exploratively investigated the associations among burnout, depression, and anxiety in 574 swiss medical students using a network analytic approach for the first time. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder respectively. Burnout was assessed with two single-item questions, one referring to emotional exhaustion and the other to depersonalization. We found a dense network in which at least one dimension of burnout was related to eleven of the sixteen included symptoms. This suggests that burnout is closely related to depression and anxiety but also has its own characteristics. Notably, suicidal ideation was not associated with either emotional exhaustion or depersonalization after adjusting for the influence of the remaining symptoms of anxiety and depression. Hence, the well-documented relationship between burnout and suicidal ideation in medical students may be entirely mediated by the experience of anxiety and depression. Hence, the well-documented relationship between burnout and suicidal ideation in medical students might be fully mediated by the experience of anxiety and depression. The collection of the sample after the first wave of infections during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and the non-representativeness of the investigated sample limit the study's generalizability.","Ernst, Jordan, Weilenmann, Sazpinar, Gehrke, Paolercio, Petry, Pfaltz, MÃƒÂ©an, Aebischer, Gachoud, Morina, von KÃƒÂ¤nel, Spiller","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.09.017","20211102","Burnout; Medical students; Mental health; Network analysis; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; RNA, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Students, Medical; Switzerland","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-03","",19822,""
