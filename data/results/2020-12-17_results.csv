"Accelerated intermittent theta burst as a substitute for patients needing electroconvulsive therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: study protocol for an open-label clinical trial","Background: Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is one of the leading causes of disability in Canada and is associated with significant societal costs. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an approved, safe, and well-tolerated intervention for TRD. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the number of visits to the clinic is a potential approach to significantly minimize exposure and transmission risks to patients. This can be accomplished by administering multiple treatment sessions in a single day, using an rTMS protocol known as accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS). The objective of this novel study is to assess the feasibility, acceptance and clinical outcomes of a practical high-dose aiTBS protocol, including tapering treatments and symptom-based relapse prevention treatments, in patients with unipolar depression previously responsive to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or patients warranting ECT due to symptom severity. Methods: All patients with unipolar depression referred to the brain stimulation service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) who warrant ECT will be offered screening to assess for eligibility to enroll in this trial. This open label, single group trial consists of 3 phases. In the acute treatment phase, treatment will occur 8 times daily for 5 days a week, until symptom remission is achieved or a maximum of 10 days of treatment. In the tapering phase, treatments will be reduced to 2 treatment days per week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 treatment day per week for 2 weeks. Patients will then enter the symptom-based relapse prevention phase including virtual check-ins and a treatment schedule based on symptom level. Remission, response and change in scores on several clinical measures from baseline to the end of the acute, tapering and relapse prevention phases represent the clinical outcomes of interest. Discussion: Findings from this novel clinical trial may provide support for the use of aiTBS, including tapering treatments and symptom-based relapse prevention treatments, as a safe and effective alternative intervention for patients needing ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daniel M.

"The impact of working during the Covid-19 pandemic on health care workers and first responders: mental health, function, and professional retention","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected front line health care workers (HCW) and first responders (FR). The infection risk from SARS CoV-2, the high mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the duration of the pandemic have created sustained and often traumatic stressors affecting HCW and FR. Objectives: To assess the relationship of COVID-19 stressor frequency scores to psychiatric rating scale scores amongst HCW and FR. To determine if psychiatric rating scale scores mediate stressor effects on perceived work function and likelihood of remaining in current occupation. Design: Observational, self-report in a convenience sample Participants: 118 HCW and FR caring for COVID-19 patients in the United States. Main Measure: COVID-19 related stressor frequencies were assessed using a 17-item questionnaire. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL5), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (for depression) (PHQ9), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7). Key Results: Stressor frequency scores correlated significantly with PCL5 scores (R=.57, p<1e-8), PHQ scores (R=.35, P<.001), ISI scores (R=.38, p<1e-4), and GAD7 scores (R=.39, p<.001), likelihood of staying in current occupation (R=-.39,p<1e-4), and trouble doing usual work (R=.33,p<.001). 51% of HCW and 44% of FR indicated decreased likelihood of staying in their current occupation. PCL5 scores substantially mediated the association between stress frequency scores and work function impairment. Conclusions: These results direct attention to recognizing potentially treatable psychiatric symptoms, particularly those of PTSD, in HCW and FR experiencing COVID-19 related stressors. They also suggest that mitigating COVID-19 related stressors when possible, such as by providing adequate personal protective equipment, can improve HCW and FR mental health, work function and retention in the health care work force.","Rebecca C Hendrickson; RoisÃ­n A.

"Un nuevo contrato social postpandÃ©mico El papel de la EconomÃ­a social","RESUMEN: Â¿QuÃ© es lo que hace que una sociedad plural funcione armoniosamente, que la economÃ­a sea inclusiva y que la democracia no caiga en el caos polÃ­tico? En este artÃ­culo sostendrÃ© que ese pegamento es el contrato social  Cuando ese pegamento existe, progreso econÃ³mico, social y polÃ­tico avanzan de la mano  SucediÃ³ asÃ­ en los llamados ""Treinta Gloriosos"", las tres dÃ©cadas que siguieron a la Gran DepresiÃ³n de los Treinta y la Segunda Guerra mundial  Sin embargo, a partir de los aÃ±os ochenta del siglo pasado ese pegamento se fue disolviendo y, en paralelo, el crecimiento econÃ³mico dejÃ³ de ser sinÃ³nimo de progreso social y la democracia entrÃ³ en barrena  El reto ahora es reconstruir ese pegamento, al modo como se logrÃ³ tras las grandes guerras  En mi opiniÃ³n, ese pegamento, en primer lugar, ha de venir de un nuevo contrato social postpandÃ©mico  En segundo lugar, el nÃºcleo de ese nuevo contrato social estÃ¡ en la reforma de la empresa para corregir la mala distribuciÃ³n del excedente (valor aÃ±adido) entre salarios, sueldos de altos directivos y dividendos  Un nuevo contrato social progresista tiene que apoyarse en la recuperaciÃ³n del papel fundamental del tercer pilar de la prosperidad: la EconomÃ­a social Alternate abstract:Beyond the insidious and morally contemptible personality of the authoritarian political leaders that have emerged in the last decade, the political ""supply"" of populism responds to a real ""demand"" for popular policies that exists in advanced societies  This demands a rebalancing of economic policies in favour of the working classes, the middle classes and the social groups that have not benefited from the economic growth of the last decades  This social demand responds to an objective cause: the increase in inequalities and economic insecurity  Coinciding with the neoliberal shift in social and economic policies that accompanied the shift to conservatism in the late 1970s and with the hyper-globalization and the change of skin that global corporate capitalism experienced from the 1990s onward, large groups of middle classes in developed countries saw their jobs, their welfare, their opportunities, and the lifestyles of the communities in which they lived disappear or deteriorate  The Covid-19 pandemic has only accentuated these inequalities  This malaise with inequality and economic insecurity is fertile ground for political polarization and authoritarian political populism  In this sense, inequality and economic insecurity have acted as a powerful solvent of the glue that every liberal society needs to function harmoniously, to make the market economy inclusive, and to prevent democracy from falling into the chaos of authoritarian populism  The challenge now is to rebuild that glue, as it was done after the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II  This essay argues, first, that this glue must come from a new post-pandemic social contract  Secondly, that the core of that new social contract is in the reform of the enterprise to correct the misallocation of surplus (value added) between wages, top management salaries and dividends  The correction of this malfunctioning distribution requires investigating its causes  Here it is argued that there are two  On the one hand, the bias that capitalism acquired from the eighties in benefit of shareholders and to the detriment of workers, suppliers, customers and communities  On the other hand, that corporate concentration and the market power acquired by large corporations has led to stagnation of real wages and the precarization of employment  The malfunctioning of distribution is not, however, the only source of inequality and economic insecurity  They also come from the malfunctioning of pre-distribution  To the extent that technological change has opened a gap between the capabilities and skills of the population and the professional profiles needed by companies, this gap brings about inequality of income and employment opportunities  On the other hand, the redistributive mechanisms of the Welfare State, both taxes and social programs, have seen their capacity to correct the inequality produced by the economy reduced  To respond to this inequality and economic insecurity, the political offer of new social contracts is wide and varied: the neoliberal, the extreme right, the extreme left and the radical progressive  All try to respond to the problem of distribution, but they do so through different paths, depending on whether they emphasize pre-distribution, redistribution, or distribution  The historical experience of the 1930s teaches us that not everyone is well reconciled with the future  A new progressive social contract must be based on the recovery of the fundamental role of the third pillar of prosperity: the Social Economy  Its abandonment in recent decades in favour of the market and the State is one of the causes of the inability of market economies to generate good jobs now","Costas, AntÃ³n","https://doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.100.18715","","Database: COVIDWHO;

Resilience and psychopathological symptoms of nurses in the isolation ward was assessed by Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90). A total resilience score was 87.04 Â± 22.78. The SCL-90 score was 160- to 281 (202.5 Â± 40.79). Only 8.70% of the nurses (n = 8) had a total SCL-90 score >160, suggesting positive symptoms. The majority of nurses had 0 to 90 positive self-assessment items (median 14); 19.57% (n = 18) had > 43 positive items. Interpersonal sensitivity, depression, hostility, and paranoid ideation scores were below national averages (p=0.000, 0.040, 0.002, 0.004, respectively). SCL-90 items reflecting diet and sleep conditions were higher(P = 0.009), and somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism domains and scores were similar to national averages (P>0.3). With exception of somatization and other domains, the mean resilience score was negatively associated with the scores of other SCL-90 domains.

"People's Experiences and Satisfaction With Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Australia: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has rapidly been adopted to deliver health care services around the world. To date, studies have not compared people's experiences with telehealth services during the pandemic in Australia to their experiences with traditional in-person visits. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare participants' perceptions of telehealth consults to their perceptions of traditional in-person visits and investigate whether people believe that telehealth services would be useful after the pandemic. METHODS: A national, cross-sectional, community survey was conducted between June 5 and June 12, 2020 in Australia. In total, 1369 participants who were aged &#8805;18 years and lived in Australia were recruited via targeted advertisements on social media (ie, Facebook and Instagram). Participants responded to survey questions about their telehealth experience, which included a free-text response option. A generalized linear model was used to estimate the adjusted relative risks of having a poorer telehealth experience than a traditional in-person visit experience. Content analysis was performed to determine the reasons why telehealth experiences were worse than traditional in-person visit experiences. RESULTS: Of the 596 telehealth users, the majority of respondents (n=369, 61.9%) stated that their telehealth experience was ""just as good as"" or ""better than"" their traditional in-person medical appointment experience. On average, respondents perceived that telehealth would be moderately useful to very useful for medical appointments after the COVID-19 pandemic ends (mean 3.67, SD 1.1). Being male (P=.007), having a history of both depression and anxiety (P=.016), and lower patient activation scores (ie, individuals' willingness to take on the role of managing their health/health care) (P=.036) were significantly associated with a poor telehealth experience. In total, 6 overarching themes were identified from free-text responses for why participants' telehealth experiences were poorer than their traditional in-person medical appointment experiences, as follows: communication is not as effective, limitations with technology, issues with obtaining prescriptions and pathology results, reduced confidence in their doctor, additional burden for complex care, and inability to be physically examined. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our sample's responses, telehealth appointment experiences were comparable to traditional in-person medical appointment experiences. Telehealth may be worthwhile as a mode of health care delivery while the pandemic continues, and it may continue to be worthwhile after the pandemic.","Isautier, Jennifer Mj; Copp, Tessa; Ayre, Julie; Cvejic, Erin; Meyerowitz-Katz, Gideon; Batcup, Carys; Bonner, Carissa; Dodd, Rachael; Nickel, Brooke; Pickles, Kristen; Cornell, Samuel; Dakin, Thomas; McCaffery, Kirsten J","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24531","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e24531, 2020 Dec 10.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e24531, 2020 Dec 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8312,""

It is critical to understand the mental and physical health of adolescent athletes during this time. OBJECTIVE: To describe the health of athletes during COVID-19-related school closures and sport cancellations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A national sample recruited via social media. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>002 US adolescent athletes (age = 16.3 Â± 1.2 years, females = 52.9%, males = 47.0%) completed an anonymous online survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Demographic information collected was sex, grade, sport(s) played, and zip code. Assessments used were the General Anxiety Disorder 7-Item for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 for quality of life. Mental health, physical activity, and health-related quality-of-life variables were compared among sex, grade, sport(s) played, and poverty level using means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from the survey-weighted analysis of variance. RESULTS: Females reported a higher prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (females = 43.7% versus males = 28.2%). The Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale score was highest (best) for grade 9 (mean = 14.5, 95% CI = 14.0, 15.0) and lowest for grade 11 (mean = 10.9, 95% CI = 10.5, 11.3. The prevalence of depression symptoms was highest in team sport (74.1%) and lowest in individual sport (64.9%) participants. The total Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory score was lowest (worst) for athletes from counties with the highest poverty levels (high: mean = 74.5, 95% CI = 73.7, 75.3; middle: mean = 78.9, 95% CI = 78.0, 79.8; and low: mean = 78.3, 95% CI = 77.4, 79.1). CONCLUSIONS: The health of US adolescents during the COVID-19-related school closures and sport cancellations varied to differing degrees depending on sex, grade level, type of sport participation, and level of poverty.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were collected 6 April to 19 April 2020 using online-based, self-administered questionnaires. SETTING: 19 hospitals and health centres in Vietnam. PARTICIPANTS: 7 124 HCWs aged 21-60 years. RESULTS: The COVID-19 response-involved HCWs had higher anxiety likelihood (OR (95% CI)=4.41 (3.53 to 5.51)), higher depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=3.31 (2.71 to 4.05)) and lower HRQoL score (coefficient, b(95% CI)=-2.14 (-2.89 to -1.38)), compared with uninvolved HCWs. Overall, HCWs who smoked or drank at unchanged/increased levels had higher likelihood of anxiety, depression and lower HRQoL scores; those with unchanged/healthier eating, unchanged/more physical activity and higher HL scores had lower likelihood of anxiety, depression and higher HRQoL scores. In comparison to uninvolved HCWs who smoked or drank at never/stopped/reduced levels, involved HCWs with unchanged/increased smoking or drinking had lower anxiety likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.34 (0.14 to 0.83)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.26 (0.11 to 0.60)), and lower depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.33 (0.15 to 0.74)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.24 (0.11 to 0.53)), respectively. In comparison with uninvolved HCWs who exercised at never/stopped/reduced levels, or with those in the lowest HL quartile, involved HCWs with unchanged/increased exercise or with one-quartile HL increment reported lower anxiety likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.50 (0.31 to 0.81)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.57 (0.45 to 0.71)), lower depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.40 (0.27 to 0.61)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.63 (0.52 to 0.76)), and higher HRQoL scores (b(95% CI)=2.08 (0.58 to 3.58)), or (b(95% CI)=1.10 (0.42 to 1.78)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity and higher HL were found to protect against anxiety and depression and were associated with higher HRQoL. Unexpectedly, smoking and drinking were also found to be coping behaviours. It is important to have strategic approaches that protect HCWs' mental health and HRQoL.","Tran, Tien V; Nguyen, Hoang C; Pham, Linh V; Nguyen, Minh H; Nguyen, Huu Cong; Ha, Tung H; Phan, Dung T; Dao, Hung K; Nguyen, Phuoc B; Trinh, Manh V; Do, Thinh V; Nguyen, Hung Q; Nguyen, Thao T P; Nguyen, Nhan P T; Tran, Cuong Q; Tran, Khanh V; Duong, Trang T; Pham, Hai X; Nguyen, Lam V; Vo, Tam T; Do, Binh N; Duong, Thai H; Pham, Minh Khue; Pham, Thu T M; Nguyen, Kien Trung; Yang, Shwu-Huey; Chao, Jane C J; Duong, Tuyen Van","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041394","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(12): e041394, 2020 12 07.; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(12): e041394, 2020 12 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8314,""
"How primary healthcare in Iceland swiftly changed its strategy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic","OBJECTIVE: To describe how the primary healthcare (PHC) in Iceland changed its strategy to handle the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Descriptive observational study. SETTING: Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. POPULATION: The Reykjavik area has a total of 233 000 inhabitants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number and the mode of consultations carried out. Drug prescriptions and changes in the 10 most common diagnoses made in PHC. Laboratory tests including COVID-19 tests. Average numbers in March and April 2020 compared with the same months in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Pragmatic strategies and new tasks were rapidly applied to the clinical work to meet the foreseen healthcare needs caused by the pandemic. The number of daytime consultations increased by 35% or from 780 to 1051/1000 inhabitants (p<0.001) during the study period. Telephone and web-based consultations increased by 127% (p<0.001). The same tendency was observed in out-of-hours services. The number of consultations in maternity and well-child care decreased only by 4% (p=0.003). Changes were seen in the 10 most common diagnoses. Most noteworthy, apart from a high number of COVID-19 suspected disease, was that immunisation, depression, hypothyroidism and lumbago were not among the top 10 diagnoses during the epidemic period. The number of drug prescriptions increased by 10.3% (from 494 to 545 per 1000 inhabitants, p<0.001). The number of prescriptions from telephone and web-based consultations rose by 55.6%. No changes were observed in antibiotics prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: As the first point of contact in the COVID-19 pandemic, the PHC in Iceland managed to change its strategy swiftly while preserving traditional maternity and well-child care, indicating a very solid PHC with substantial flexibility in its organisation.","Sigurdsson, Emil Larus; Blondal, Anna Bryndis; Jonsson, Jon Steinar; Tomasdottir, Margret Olafia; Hrafnkelsson, Hannes; Linnet, Kristjan; Sigurdsson, Johann Agust","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043151","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(12): e043151, 2020 12 07.; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(12): e043151, 2020 12 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8315,""
"The implementation of telehealth to assess, monitor and treat neurodevelopmental disorders: a systematic review","In response to COVID-19 there is increasing momentum behind the development and delivery of telehealth. To assess the anticipated exponential growth in telehealth it is important we accurately capture how telehealth was used in specific fields of mental health prior to COVID-19. The aim of this review was to highlight how telehealth had been used with clinical samples in the neurodevelopmental (NDD) field, including for patients with NDD, their families, and healthcare professionals. To identify which technologies show greatest potential for implementation into health services the review evaluates the technologies for effectiveness, economic impact, and readiness for clinical adoption. A systematic search of the literature was undertaken (April 2018 - updated until December 2019) using: Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, Embase, and PsycInfo. Data extracted included the type of technology, how the technology was used (assessment, treatment, monitoring), participant characteristics, reported outcomes and the authors' views on clinical effectiveness, user impact (including feasibility and acceptability), economic impact, and readiness for clinic adoption. A quality review of the research is reported using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) Levels of Evidence. A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. These included participants and/or their families with autism spectrum disorders (ASD; n=21), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD; n=8), ADHD and/or ASD (n=3), communication -disorders (n=7), and tic disorders (n=2). The majority of studies were with children/young people and/or their caregivers. The focus of most studies was treatment (n=33), rather than assessment (n=4) or monitoring (n=5). Telehealth services demonstrated promise for being clinically effective, predominantly in relation to diagnosing and monitoring NDDs. In the treatment of NDD, telehealth services were usually equivalent to control groupsÃ‚Â¬. There was some evidence for positive user and economic impact, including service delivery efficiencies, such as increasing treatment availability and decreasing waiting times. However, these factors were not widely recorded across all the studies. Telehealth was demonstrated to be cost-effective in the few studies that considered this. The quality of the studies varied, with many having small sample sizes and inadequate control groups. Only 11/42 were randomized controlled trials, the main other methodologies included case studies or case series (n=12), qualitative studies (n=6), and non-comparative trials (n=5). The use of telehealth has the potential to increase the availability of treatment, decrease waiting times for diagnosis, and aid in the monitoring of NDD. Further research, with more robust and adequately powered study designs as well as consideration of cost-effectiveness and efficiency savings, is needed. The review highlights the extent of the use of telehealth technologies prior to COVID-19 and the movement to invest in remote access to treatments. The review protocol for the main paper was registered with PROSPERO [CRD42018091156].","Valentine, Hall, Young, Brown, Groom, Hollis, Hall","https://doi.org/10.2196/22619","20201216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8316,""
"Illustrating time trends of public's attention towards suicide around the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems around the world. Emerging evidence has suggested that significantly fewer patients seek help for suicidality at clinical settings amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which elicits concerns of an imminent mental health crisis as the course of the pandemic continues to unfold. Clarifying the relationship between public's attention to the knowledge about suicide and public's attention to the knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic may shed some insight into prevention strategies for a putative surge of suicidal wave in relation to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this retrospective longitudinal time-series study is to understand the relationship between temporal trends of search interests in suicide and COVID-19-related terms, such as social distancing, school closure, and lockdown, etc. We used Google Trends platform to collect daily interest levels for the search terms that included suicide and several other mental health-related issues, as well as COVID-19-related search terms, over the period between 14 February 2020 and 13 May 2020. Correlational analysis was performed to determine the association between the search term ''suicide'' and COVID-19 related search terms in 16 countries. The Mann-Kendall test was used to examine the significance of the search interest levels of suicide before and after school closure. We found that levels of search interest in &quot;suicide&quot; were statistically significantly inversely correlated with levels of search interest in the term &quot;COVID-19&quot; or &quot;coronavirus&quot; in nearly all the countries between 14 February 2020 and 13 May 2020. Additionally, search interest in ''suicide'' also showed significant negative correlations with many COVID-19 related search terms, albeit which varied among countries. The Mann-Kendall test was used to examine the significance of the search interest levels of suicide before and after school closure. The Netherlands, New Zealand, UK and USA showed significant negative trends in the interest levels of suicide in the two-week period preceding the school closure. In contrast, the interest levels of suicide showed a significant positive trend in Canada and the USA after school closures. The public's attention to suicide might inversely correlate with the public's attention to COVID-19-related issues. Additionally, some anti-contagion policies, such as school closure, might have led to a &quot;turning point&quot; for mental health crisis because the attention to suicidality increased after the restrictions were in place. The results suggest that an increased risk of suicidal ideation may ensue due to the ongoing anti-contagion policies. Timely intervention strategies for suicides, therefore, should be an integral part in the efforts to flatten the epidemic curve.","Burnett, Eapen, Lin","https://doi.org/10.2196/24694","20201216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8317,""

"Food insecurity and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Food insecurity has been linked to adverse mental health outcomes. This study assessed the association between household food insecurity and self-perceived mental health status and anxiety symptoms among Canadians in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 2 collected cross-sectional data from May 4 to 10, 2020, on Canadians aged 15 years or older residing in the ten provinces. The brief six-item Household Food Security Survey Module was used to measure participants' households as food secure or marginally, moderately or severely food insecure within the previous 30 days. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between food security status and self-perceived fair or poor mental health and moderate or severe anxiety symptoms, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Approximately one in seven Canadians (14.6%) lived in a household that experienced some level of food insecurity. Of these individuals, 9.3% reported recently accessing free food from a community organization. About one in five Canadians self-perceived their mental health as fair or poor (22.0%), or self-reported moderate or severe anxiety symptoms (18.2%). With covariate adjustment, individuals in households with moderate food insecurity had nearly three times higher odds of reporting fair or poor mental health, and moderate or severe anxiety symptoms, compared with individuals in food-secure households. Among those with severe food insecurity, adjusted odds ratios were 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0 to 7.9) for fair or poor mental health, and 7.6 (95% CI: 3.9 to 14.7) for moderate or severe anxiety symptoms. In the early period of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada, household food insecurity was independently associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Monitoring both food insecurity and mental health will be important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Polsky, Gilmour","https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202001200001-eng","20201216","COVID-19 financial impacts; GAD-7; SARS-CoV-2; food security; pandemic; perceived mental health; self-report","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8319,""

"'It was difficult, but our struggle to touch lives gave us strength': The experience of nurses working in COVID-19 wards","Nurses are considered important healthcare professionals during the management of the pandemic process due to the considerable amount of time they spend in the face-to-face nursing of infected patients. To optimise the service of healthcare workers, it is recommended that the mental health needs of the health workforce are addressed. This study aimed to explore the experiences and coping strategies of Turkish nurses working in pandemic units. A grounded theory design was applied. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 nurses. The data were analysed according to the constant comparative method. The study generated a core category ('It was difficult working in the unknown, but our struggle to touch lives gave us strength'), showing that all nurses felt heroic via the satisfaction of touching patients' lives and uncertain. Four main categories emerged: being caught in the pandemic, empowerment for coping with the struggle, challenges during the coping process, and effects of the pandemic on life. Nurses felt that their profession was sacred and valued by society, and comprehensive support had facilitated the process. Nurses had difficulty in managing their fear of infecting others and adapting to many new elements, the learning process, and a lack of understanding of their role as team members. The nurses attending to the pandemic have experienced the effects of COVID-19 on their lives, such as psychological growth, psychological symptoms, and being labelled as high-risk. Nurses would be further empowered by government and society's support and acceptance of professionalism in nursing. The findings suggest that the resources for the psychological support of nurses in the pandemic should be increased. Regular and intensive training for nursing is necessary to promote adaptation and efficacy in crisis management.","Deliktas Demirci, Oruc, Kabukcuoglu","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15602","20201216","COVID-19; coping process; experience; grounded theory; nurses; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8323,""

The sample of this cross-sectional study was comprised of 801 participants aged 18 or older and residing in Spain. Data collection was carried out during March and April 2020. Data of mental health (GHQ12) and well-being (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) indicators, and those of a wide number of social, demographic, and economic variables were recorded. Linear regression models were built to value associations between mental health and social, demographic, and economic indicators. Mental health morbidity was higher in women, younger people, individuals with medium studies, people with fewer children, singles, students, and unemployed individuals. Positive affect was higher among women, people with a high level of studies, those not co-living with dependent seniors, the self-employed, the employed, and those working outside home. Negative affect was negatively associated with age and number of children and was higher among women, people with basic studies, singles, individuals co-living with dependent seniors, homemakers, and students.

"The Rebooting in Sports and Physical Activities After COVID-19 Italian Lockdown: An Exploratory Study","The lockdown imposed in Italy to reduce the spread of COVID-19 posited unusual challenges to people practicing sports and physical activities. The rebooting of activities highlighted the need to cope with new behaviors and routines, such as wearing a face mask while exercising. We conducted a web-based survey in Italy at the start of physical activities' rebooting, to investigate how people reacted to the new norms. Participants completed the questionnaires assessing insomnia, regulatory self-efficacy, optimism, mood states, and mental toughness. Age, gender, and environment were assumed as design variables. Results showed that in outdoor activities, the younger females as compared to the older manifest less regulatory self-efficacy, while the younger males manifest more regulatory self-efficacy than the older. In indoor activities, a reversed pattern of regulatory-self-efficacy was observed. Regarding life orientation, younger participants showed less optimism and positive expectation for the future and seem to be more exposed to the unexpected effects of the restrictions: they showed more sleep disturbances, confusion, depression, anger, and fatigue and less vigor and mental toughness than older participants.

"COVID-19 Related Knowledge and Mental Health: Case of Croatia","<b>Background and Aims:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has led to radical and unexpected changes in everyday life, and it is plausible that people's psychophysical health has been affected. This study examined the relationship between COVID-19 related knowledge and mental health in a Croatian sample of participants. An online survey was conducted from March 18 until March 23, 2020, and a total of 1244 participant responses were collected (85.5% were women and 58.4% completed secondary education). Measures included eight questions regarding biological features of the virus, symptoms, and prevention, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Optimism-Pessimism Scale. According to the answers given on the questions on COVID-19 related knowledge, participants were divided in two groups: (1) informed and (2) uninformed on each question. They were then compared in the expressed levels of anxiety, depression, pessimism, and optimism. Full vs. partial mediation models with optimism/pessimism as a mediator in the relationship between anxiety/depression and the accuracy of responses for questions about handwashing and ways of transmission were estimated. Participants who responded correctly on the question about handwashing had higher levels of anxiety, depression, and pessimism than those participants whose answer was incorrect, while participants who answered correctly on the question about the percentage of patients who develop serious breathing problems had higher levels of depression than those who answered incorrectly. Lower levels of anxiety and pessimism were observed in the participants who answered correctly about ways of transmission. Higher levels of pessimism were found in participants who scored incorrectly on questions about the efficiency of antibiotics, most common symptoms, and the possibility of being infected by asymptomatic carriers. Higher levels of knowledge about handwashing were predicted by higher levels of anxiety and pessimism. Higher levels of knowledge about ways of transmission were predicted by lower levels of anxiety and lower levels of pessimism. The examined relationships between anxiety/depression and knowledge were mediated by pessimism. The findings of this study suggest that knowledge about COVID-19 may be useful to reduce anxiety and depression, but it must be directed to the promotion of health behaviors and to the recognition of fake news.","GaliÃ„â€¡, MustapiÃ„â€¡, Ã…Â imuniÃ„â€¡, SiÃ„â€¡, Cipolletta","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567368","20201216","COVID-19; COVID-19 related knowledge; anxiety; coronavirus; depression; mental health; optimism; pessimism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8327,""

"Alcohol Consumption in China Before and During COVID-19: Preliminary Results From an Online Retrospective Survey","<b>Background:</b> Alcohol is an important aspect of Chinese culture, and alcohol use has been traditionally accepted in China. People with stress, anxiety, and depression may use more alcohol. More people reported symptoms of anxiety and depression during the outbreak of COVID-19. Thus, people may drink more alcohol during the outbreak of COVID-19 than before COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> An online retrospective survey was conducted on a total sample of 2,229 participants. Drinking behaviors before and during COVID-19, current risky drinking and hazardous drinking, and the association between high-risk drinking and mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and stress) were assessed <i>via</i> self-reported measures on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). <b>Results:</b> This study found that, compared with before COVID-19, alcohol consumption was slightly decreased during COVID-19 (from 3.5 drinks to 3.4 drinks, <i>p</i> = 0.035) in the overall sample. Most (78.7%) alcohol drinkers were males. Before and during COVID-19, males consumed more drinks per week (4.2 and 4.0 vs. 1.3 and 1.2 drinks), had a higher percentage of heavy drinking (8.1 and 7.7% vs. 4.4 and 2.7%), and more drinking days per week (2.1 and 2.1 vs. 1.0 and 0.9 days). Males also had more risky drinking (43.2 vs. 9.3%) and hazardous drinking (70.2 vs. 46.6%) than female counterparts. This study also found that high-risk drinking predicted anxiety in females. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study suggests a slight reduction in alcohol consumption during COVID-19.

"The Medium-Term Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Referrals to Secondary Care Mental Health Services: A Controlled Interrupted Time Series Study","To date, there is a paucity of information regarding the effect of COVID-19 or lockdown on mental disorders. We aimed to quantify the medium-term impact of lockdown on referrals to secondary care mental health clinical services. We conducted a controlled interrupted time series study using data from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), UK (catchment population ~0.86 million). The UK lockdown resulted in an instantaneous drop in mental health referrals but then a longer-term acceleration in the referral rate (by 1.21 referrals per day per day, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41-2.02). This acceleration was primarily for urgent or emergency referrals (acceleration 0.96, CI 0.39-1.54), including referrals to liaison psychiatry (0.68, CI 0.35-1.02) and mental health crisis teams (0.61, CI 0.20-1.02). The acceleration was significant for females (0.56, CI 0.04-1.08), males (0.64, CI 0.05-1.22), working-age adults (0.93, CI 0.42-1.43), people of White ethnicity (0.98, CI 0.32-1.65), those living alone (1.26, CI 0.52-2.00), and those who had pre-existing depression (0.78, CI 0.19-1.38), severe mental illness (0.67, CI 0.19-1.15), hypertension/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease (0.56, CI 0.24-0.89), personality disorders (0.32, CI 0.12-0.51), asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.28, CI 0.08-0.49), dyslipidemia (0.26, CI 0.04-0.47), anxiety (0.21, CI 0.08-0.34), substance misuse (0.21, CI 0.08-0.34), or reactions to severe stress (0.17, CI 0.01-0.32). No significant post-lockdown acceleration was observed for children/adolescents, older adults, people of ethnic minorities, married/cohabiting people, and those who had previous/pre-existing dementia, diabetes, cancer, eating disorder, a history of self-harm, or intellectual disability.

"Current and Future Potential Impact of COVID-19 on Kratom (<i>Mitragyna speciosa</i> Korth) Supply and Use","Kratom (<i>Mitragyna speciosa</i> Korth., Rubiaceae) is native to and has traditional use in Southeast Asia. The number of kratom users outside of Southeast Asia has increased significantly in recent decades with use spreading to the Unites States (US) and Europe. Because of its reputed opioid-like psychoactive effects at higher doses, kratom has been regulated in several countries and is subject to an import ban by the US Food and Drug Administration. Nonetheless, in the US it is estimated that 10-15 million people consume kratom primarily for the self-treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, to mitigate withdrawal from or dependence on opioids, and to self-treat opioid use disorder or other substance use disorders (SUDs). Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage in the supply of kratom products may place unexpected burdens on kratom users, potentially influencing some who use kratom for SUD self-treatment to regress to harmful drug use, hence increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes, including overdose. Inadequate treatment, treatment barriers, and increases in the sales of adulterated kratom products on the internet or in convenience stores could exacerbate circumstances further. Although there are currently no verified indications of kratom scarcity, researchers and clinicians should be aware of and remain vigilant to this unanticipated possibility.","Singh, Brown, Cinosi, Corazza, Henningfield, Garcia-Romeu, McCurdy, McMahon, Prozialeck, Smith, Swogger, Veltri, Walsh, Grundmann","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.574483","20201216","COVID-19; OUD; SUD; kratom; withdrawal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8331,""

Comprehending the situation is crucial for anticipating any change in the environment and delivering optimal care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a training to increase situational awareness and mutual care designed for health care workers (FoCo) in a randomized controlled trial with additional qualitative analysis. We also investigated the perception of the training for the COVID-19 pandemic moment, in May 2020, almost 6 months after we finished the data collection at the Emergency Care Unit, which became a COVID-19 treatment reference for the care of a population depending on the public health system, in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

"Mental Health and Health-Related Quality-of-Life Outcomes Among Frontline Health Workers During the Peak of COVID-19 Outbreak in Vietnam: A Cross-Sectional Study","Mental health is an important component of the protection strategy for healthcare workers (HCWs). However, it has not been well described in Vietnam during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aims to measure the psychological distress and health-related quality-of-life among frontline healthcare workers during the peak of the outbreak in Vietnam. We conducted a cross-sectional survey on 173 health workers at two national tertiary hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam from March to April 2020. The psychological distress was measured by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21), Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). EQ-5D-5L was used to determine the health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes. Among 173 HCWs, the proportion of reported depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and stress was 20.2%, 33.5%, and 12.7%, respectively. The median EQ-5D-5L index score was 0.93 (IQR=0.85-0.94), and the anxiety/depression aspect had the highest reported problems. The most COVID-19-specific concerns among frontline HCWs were the reduction of income (59%) and the increase of living costs (54.3%). HCWs working in the COVID-19-designated hospital had a significantly higher rate of mental health problems and had a lower HRQoL outcome than those working in non-COVID-19-designated hospitals. Other factors associated with psychological distress and sleep problems include age, job title, income, chronic diseases status, and years of working in healthcare settings. HCWs who were Ã¢â€°Â¥30 years old, had higher working years, had higher incomes, and had mental health and sleep problems were more likely to have lower HRQoL scores. We reported a moderate rate of psychological distress and lower HRQoL outcomes among frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam. Various factors were found to be associated with mental health and HRQoL that might be useful for implementing appropriate interventions for HCWs in low-resource settings.","Manh Than, Minh Nong, Trung Nguyen, Phu Dong, Ngo, Thu Doan, Thu Do, Huyen Thi Nguyen, Van Do, Xuan Dao, Quang Nguyen, Ngoc Pham, Duy Do","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S280749","20201216","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; health workers; health-related quality-of-life; mental health; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8333,""
"The Role of Resilience and Gender in Relation to Infectious-Disease-Specific Health Literacy and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Anxiety is one of the psychological problems being experienced by the general population during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Health literacy, such as infectious-disease-specific health literacy, is associated with anxiety, but the mechanism of such association is not clear. This study explored the relationship between infectious-disease-specific health literacy and anxiety. We conducted an online survey in Hubei province, the early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1038 COVID-19-negative participants accomplished a battery of online survey tools determining their sociodemographic characteristics, perceived risk of acquiring COVID-19, infectious-disease-specific health literacy, resilience, and anxiety symptoms. We examined the moderated mediation models, in which the mediator was resilience and the moderator was gender. Most (63%) of the study participants experienced at least mild anxiety. The indirect effect of infectious-disease-specific health literacy on anxiety through resilience was -0.282 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-0.511, -0.083]), contributing to 32.7% of the total effect of health literacy on anxiety. Resilience fully mediated the association. The mediation effect of resilience tended to be stronger for the male participants than for the female participants as the moderation effect of gender remained until we included perceived risk of acquiring COVID-19 in the model. Resilience was found to mediate the association between infectious-disease-specific health literacy and anxiety. Individuals with good infectious-disease-specific health literacy are more likely to acquire higher resilience, which may in turn decrease their anxiety level. Males may benefit more from the mediation effect of resilience during the current pandemic. Infectious-disease-specific health literacy programs may help reduce the anxiety of the program participants by enhancing their resilience during a pandemic.","Xiao, Xiao, Yao, Chen, Saligan, Reynolds, Wang","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S277231","20201216","anxiety; health literacy; infectious-disease-specific health literacy; mental health; pandemic; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8334,""
"Psychiatric Manifestations of COVID-19 and Their Social Significance","Alterations in complex behavioral patterns during the extended period of the COVID-19 pandemic are predicted to promote a variety of psychiatric disease symptoms due to enforced social isolation and self-quarantine. Accordingly, multifaceted mental health problems will continue to increase, thereby creating a challenge for society and the health care system in general. Recent studies show that COVID-19 can directly or indirectly influence the central nervous system, potentially causing neurological pathologies such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. Thus, chronic COVID-19-related disease processes have the potential to cause serious mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Importantly, mental health problems can foster systemic changes in functionally-linked neuroendocrine conditions that heighten a person's susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. These altered defense mechanisms may include compromised &quot;self-control&quot; and &quot;self-care&quot;, as well as a &quot;lack of insight&quot; into the danger posed by the virus. These consequences may have serious social impacts on the future of COVID-19 survivors. Compounding the functionally related issues of altered mental health parameters and viral susceptibility are the potential effects of compromised immunity on the establishment of functional herd immunity. Within this context, mental health takes on added importance, particularly in terms of the need to increase support for mental health research and community-based initiatives. Thus, COVID-19 infections continue to reveal mental health targets, a process we must now be prepared to deal with.","Ptacek, Ptackova, Martin, Stefano","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.930340","20201216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8335,""
"Psychiatry's Past Can Be Psychiatry's Future","In the last half of the 20th century, psychiatry lost many of the conditions needed for unhindered practice. I compiled from searches of the literature the 20th century changes in the arenas of psychiatric practice and the sources of these changes. I determined how these changes are shaping 21st century health and well-being. The neglect of the severely mentally ill, first in Bedlams and now on Boulevards, reflects a wide loss of resources. Psychiatry's patients have lost a past of community-based mental health services, interdisciplinary care teams, preventive consultation with social agencies, and, with reimbursements targeted for 15-minute visits, time adequate with the physician to individualize diagnosis and treatment. With the Covid-19 and other epidemics, economic inequalities, an economic crisis, unrest over police violence, and racism, psychiatry can find in its past the resources to engage 21st century psychiatric and other problems.","Becker","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001242","20201216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8336,""
"Impacts of the COVID-19 Shutdown on Gambling Patterns in Australia: Consideration of Problem Gambling and Psychological Distress","The COVID-19 pandemic reduced access to gambling and contributed to widespread psychological distress. Psychological distress is a known risk factor for problem gambling as it can motivate excessive gambling as a coping response. The availability of gambling is considered a factor in maintaining problems. This paper aimed to investigate the impact of the shutdown of gambling venues on Australians, particularly among those vulnerable to mental health problems and gambling disorder. Australian adults who had gambled at least once in the past 12 months (NÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 764, 85.2% male) completed an online cross-sectional survey. Self-report measures retrospectively assessed typical monthly gambling frequency and expenditure before and after the COVID-19 venue shutdown, problem gambling, and psychological distress. Significant median decreases in gambling frequency were observed, both online and overall. No relationship was found between psychological distress and baseline or increases in gambling. Greater problem gambling severity was related to higher baseline gambling, but not to increases in gambling. Exploratory analysis showed that individuals engaged in moderate-risk gambling, but not problem gambling, were more likely to report increased gambling frequency compared to nonproblem and low-risk gamblers combined. Findings provide important insights into how changes in availability influence gambling participation, and for understanding the effectiveness of forced restrictions and venue exclusion strategies. Most people moderated their gambling when venue-based gambling was unavailable and opportunities for sports betting were limited. However, harms experienced by individuals with some gambling problems may have been exacerbated during the period of limited access. Policies to enhance prevention and treatment of gambling problems are necessary even when availability is reduced.","Gainsbury, Swanton, Burgess, Blaszczynski","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000793","20201216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8337,""
"COVID-19 and Cannabidiol (CBD)",": COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in devastating mortality and morbidity consisting of socioeconomic and health effects that have included respiratory/pulmonary, cardiovascular, mental health and neurological consequences such as anxiety, depression, and substance use. Extensive efforts are underway to develop preventive vaccines and therapeutics such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, convalescent plasma, and others to treat COVID-19 but many report residual mental health problems after recovery. Cannabis products such as cannabidiol (CBD) are being advertised for the treatment of COVID-19 associated mental health problems and substance use disorders. This commentary will briefly clear the myth that CBD can ameliorate a wide range of COVID-19 associated health effects including anxiety, depression, or any substance use disorder, and show that there is a clear lack of sufficient unbiased clinical evidence from well-designed double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials to prove the antianxiety or antidepression therapeutic properties of CBD and support its wide use as medicine to treat COVID-19- associated mental health conditions or substance use disorders. Finally, we suggest that addiction physicians must play an important role in dealing with their patients requesting CBD prescription for treating any of these conditions.","Khalsa, Bunt, Maggirwar, Kottilil","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000771","20201216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8338,""

"The effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the incidence of deliberate self-harm injuries presenting to the emergency room","The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th March 2020. The UK government introduced strict social distancing measures on 23rd March 2020, with the country put into a full lockdown to further halt the spread of the virus.The aims of this article are to ascertain whether there was a rise in the incidence of deliberate self-harm (DSH) presentations to the emergency department at a level one trauma center associated with the introduction of lockdown measures. An observational study from a level one trauma center was carried out. Retrospective data from 23rd March 2020 to 1st May 2020 was collected and compared to the same time period in 2019. Data was collected from coded electronic patient records. Total attendances to the Emergency Department (ED) reduced from 2019 to 2020 (5198 and 3059 respectively). There was a significant increase in the total number of self-harm presentations between 2019 and 2020 (103 vs 113, p-value &lt;0.001) as well as paracetamol, NSAID and opiate overdoses, with more cases requiring hospital admission in 2020 vs 2019. Societal lockdown measures secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant effect on the mental health of patients. One way this can be detected is through an increased incidence and severity of deliberate self-harm injuries presenting to the ED.

"The risk for nonpsychotic postpartum mood and anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears to be the largest pandemic of our times. The aim was to recognize the risk factors for nonpsychotic postpartum mood and anxiety disorders (NPMADs) in women during the pandemic and state of emergency police lockdown in Serbia. We assessed 108 postpartum women who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and an additional survey constructed for this study. We also used the additional, previously mentioned survey, in 67 healthy age-matched women with children who were Ã¢â€°Â¥2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age. The additional survey allowed us to gain insight into the impact of the pandemic as well as postpartum period on the risk of NPMADs. In 16 (14.8%) subjects we found a score Ã¢â€°Â¥10 on EPDS. Higher rates on the EPDS were noticed in elderly, single, and unemployed, women who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, or women who were dissatisfied with their household income (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The risk of NPMADs was linked significantly to quarantine, and social isolation, the absence of social support, as well as having emotional problems. Postpartum women, compared to non-postpartum women, were more anxious and had feelings of helplessness during social isolation. Understanding the factors that increase the risk of NPMADs during the pandemic could help prevent mental disorders during a possible future pandemic.","Stojanov, Stankovic, Zikic, Stankovic, Stojanov","https://doi.org/10.1177/0091217420981533","20201216","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; mental disorders; mood; postpartum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8341,""

"Piece of Cake: Coping with COVID-19","To limit the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many individuals were instructed to stay at home, and teleworking became commonplace. Meanwhile, many others were laid off or worked reduced hours, and some front line workers were required to work longer hours. Concurrently, a surge in reports of &quot;pandemic baking&quot; suggested a cascade effect on eating behaviors, which may be an inadvertent strategy to cope with stress. We conducted an online survey of people living in Canada or the United States (<i>N</i> = 680) to assess how employment change may have been experienced as stressful and linked to a shift in food choices. Regression models suggested that reduced hours and being laid off were associated with greater stress appraisals, avoidant- and emotion-focused coping responses, and negative affect. In turn, negative affect was associated with eating to cope and unhealthy snack choices, like salty or sweet treats. Our study emphasizes that under stressful conditions, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, some coping strategies may contribute to the greater vulnerability to downstream effects, particularly those relating to eating choices and nutritional balances.","Chee, Koziel Ly, Anisman, Matheson","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12123803","20201216","COVID-19; coping; employment; food choice; mental health; salty; snack; stress; sweet; whole food","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8343,""
"Mood variability among early adolescents in times of social constraints: A daily diary study during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated governmental regulations have drastically changed the daily social lives of children, adolescents and adults. Changes in the social context may particularly affect children who are in the transition to adolescents (henceforth referred to as early adolescents) as adolescence is a crucial period for peer interactions and development of independence and autonomy. Yet, the impact of the pandemic and associated governmental regulations on early adolescentsâ€™ emotional well-being has yet to be clarified. In the current study, we explored daily fluctuations in mood in 54 early adolescents (Mage = 11.07) during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the role of parents and peers on adolescentsâ€™ mood variability was investigated. Adolescents rated their mood (i.e., happiness, anger, sadness, anxiety) and peer interactions once a day during four separate weeks across different weeks of containment measures in the Netherlands. Moreover, adolescents reported on their experienced attachment to parents and peers and internalizing problems during baseline and the final measurement, respectively. Results showed relatively stable levels of mood during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, individual differences in mood variability during the first assessment week were negatively associated with the experienced level of attachment to both parents and peers. Moreover, heightened levels of mood variability did not mediate the link between attachment and internalizing problems. Lastly, the quality of offline contact, but not online contact, was negatively related to adolescentsâ€™ mood variability. Overall, this study suggests that mental well-being of early adolescents may not necessarily be affected by the COVID-19 crisis, and that social connectedness to parents or peers may facilitate resilience to distress and daily mood fluctuation in early adolescents.","Susanne Asscheman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-4D6-ED9","20201217","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-17","",8344,""
