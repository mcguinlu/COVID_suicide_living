"Mortality among Adults Ages 25-44 in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Abstract: Introduction: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused a marked increase in all-cause deaths in the United States, mostly among adults aged 65 and older. Because younger adults have far lower infection fatality rates, less attention has been focused on the mortality burden of COVID-19 in this demographic. Methods: We performed an observational cohort study using public data from the National Center for Health Statistics at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and CDC Wonder. We analyzed all-cause mortality among adults ages 25-44 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Further, we compared COVID-19-related deaths in this age group during the pandemic period to all drug overdose deaths and opioid-specific overdose deaths in each of the ten Health and Human Services (HHS) regions during the corresponding period of 2018, the most recent year for which data are available. Results: As of September 6, 2020, 74,027 all-cause deaths occurred among persons ages 25-44 years during the period from March 1st to July 31st, 2020, 14,155 more than during the same period of 2019, a 23% relative increase (incident rate ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.21-1.24), with a peak of 30% occurring in May (IRR 1.30; 95% CI 1.27-1.33). In HHS Region 2 (New York, New Jersey), HHS Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas), and HHS Region 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada), COVID-19 deaths exceeded 2018 unintentional opioid overdose deaths during at least one month. Combined, 2,450 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in these three regions during the pandemic period, compared to 2,445 opioid deaths during the same period of 2018. Meaning: We find that COVID-19 has likely become the leading cause of death (surpassing unintentional overdoses) among young adults aged 25-44 in some areas of the United States during substantial COVID-19 outbreaks.","Jeremy S Faust; Harlan Krumholz; Katherine L Dickerson; Zhenqiu Lin; Cleavon Gilman; Rochelle P.

"Predictors of PTSD, depression and anxiety in UK frontline health and social care workers during COVID-19","Objectives: The objectives of this study were to identify demographic, work-related and other predictors for clinically significant psychological distress, including PTSD, depression, and/or anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in UK frontline health and social care workers (HSCWs), and to compare rates of PTSD, depression and anxiety across different groups of HCSWs. Design: An online survey was conducted in the weeks following the initial peak in cases (27 May to 23 July 2020). Setting: The participants worked in a variety of healthcare roles UK hospitals, nursing or care homes and community settings. Participants: A convenience sample (n=1194) of frontline UK health and social care workers completed the survey (including allied healthcare professionals, carers, clinical support staff, nurses and midwives, and other health and social care roles). Main outcome measures: PTSD was assessed using the PTSD subscale of the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ); Depression assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); Anxiety was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Results: Logistic regression analyses examined predictors for depression, anxiety and PTSD separately, and also investigated the predictors of meeting the criteria for at least one of the three conditions. Over 57% of respondents met the threshold for clinically significant PTSD, anxiety or depression, and symptom levels were reasonably high and comparable across occupational groups. Participants who were more concerned about infecting others, who felt they could not talk with their managers, who reported feeling stigmatised due to their role and who had not had reliable access to personal protective equipment (PPE) were more likely to meet criteria for a clinically significant mental disorder. Being redeployed during the pandemic, and having had COVID were associated with a higher likelihood of meeting criteria for PTSD. Higher household income was associated with reduced odds for a mental disorder. Conclusions: This study identifies predictors of clinically significant distress during COVID-19 and highlights the need for reliable access to PPE. Further research should investigate mental disorders in under-represented HSCW groups and examine barriers to communication between managers and staff. Identifying risk factors for PTSD, depression and anxiety among HSCWs, and providing treatment for those who need it, is critical given that subsequent waves of COVID-19 and other healthcare crises are inevitable.","Talya Greene; Jasmine Harju-Seppanen; Mariam Adjeniji; Charlotte Steel; Nick Grey; Chris R Brewin; Michael A Bloomfield; Jo Billings","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216804","20201025","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6378,""

"Stigmatization of psychiatric and justice-involved populations during the COVID-19 pandemic","Psychiatric and justice-involved populations are known to be stigmatized and particularly vulnerable to adverse outcomes during COVID-19  The increased attention toward vulnerable populations from healthcare authorities, the media, and the general public has made it critical to uncover any developing stigmatization toward these groups and the possible consequences  The prioritization of public safety and shift in the prioritization of resource allocation and service delivery could lead to a rise in negative perceptions toward these already stigmatized groups  Thus, it is imperative to consider how the unique characteristics of vulnerable groups may impact their physical and mental health as well as their care during this pandemic  In this paper, we describe the challenges that psychiatric, correctional, and forensic psychiatry populations have faced during COVID-19 and how a rise in stigmatization could lead to adverse outcomes  Specifically, we outline the influence of the media on public perceptions and how stigmatization may be reflected in the allocation of resources, policies, and related decision-making during COVID-19","Chaimowitz, Gary Andrew, Upfold, Casey, GÃ©a, Luiza Paul, Qureshi, Aamna, Moulden, Heather Marie, Mamak, Mini, Bradford, John McDonald Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110150","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry;: 110150, 2020.; Publication details: Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry;: 110150, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6395,""

"Investigating the Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on the Psychological Health of University Students and Their Attitudes Toward Mobile Mental Health Solutions: Two-Part Questionnaire Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019, and it was officially declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak and the safety measures taken to control it caused many psychological issues in populations worldwide, such as depression, anxiety, and stress. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the psychological effects of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak on university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to investigate the students' awareness of mobile mental health care apps as well as their attitudes toward the use of these apps. METHODS: A two-part self-administered web-based questionnaire was delivered to students at United Arab Emirates University. The first part of the questionnaire assessed the mental state of the participants using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the second part contained questions investigating the participants' awareness of and attitudes toward mental health care apps. Students were invited to fill out the web-based questionnaire via social media and mailing lists. RESULTS: A total of 154 students participated in the survey, and the majority were female. The results of the GHQ-12 analysis showed that the students were experiencing psychological issues related to depression and anxiety as well as social dysfunction. The results also revealed a lack of awareness of mental health care apps and uncertainty regarding the use of such apps. Approximately one-third of the participants (44/154, 28.6%) suggested preferred functionalities and characteristics of mobile mental health care apps, such as affordable price, simple design, ease of use, web-based therapy, communication with others experiencing the same issues, and tracking of mental status. CONCLUSIONS: Like many groups of people worldwide, university students in the UAE were psychologically affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Although apps can be useful tools for mental health care delivery, especially in circumstances such as those produced by the outbreak, the students in this study showed a lack of awareness of these apps and mixed attitudes toward them. Improving the digital health literacy of university students in the UAE by increasing their awareness of mental health care apps and the treatment methods and benefits of the apps, as well as involving students in the app creation process, may encourage students to use these tools for mental health care.","Drissi, Nidal; Alhmoudi, Ayat; Al Nuaimi, Hana; Alkhyeli, Mahra; Alsalami, Shaikha; Ouhbi, Sofia","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/19876","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;4(10): e19876, 2020 Oct 20.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;4(10): e19876, 2020 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6409,""

"Child and Family Outcomes Following Pandemics: A Systematic Review and Recommendations on COVID-19 Policies","OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of mental health outcomes and needs of children and families during past pandemics was conducted based on the PRISMA protocol. The objectives were to evaluate the quality of existing studies on this topic, determine what is known about mental health outcomes and needs of children and families, and provide recommendations for how COVID-19 policies can best support children and families. METHODS: Seventeen studies were identified through a search of PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: Studies examining child outcomes indicate that social isolation and quarantining practices exert a substantial negative impact on child anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and fear symptoms. Potential risk factors such as living in rural areas, being female, and increasing grade level may exacerbate negative mental health outcomes for children. Studies examining parental and family outcomes indicate that parents experience high stress, anxiety, and financial burden during pandemics. The age of the parent and family socioeconomic status (SES) appeared to mitigate negative outcomes, where older parents and higher SES families had lower rates of mental health problems. Parents' fear over the physical and mental health of their children, concerns over potential job loss and arranging childcare contributes to elevated stress and poorer well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this review suggest current gaps in COVID-19 policies and provide recommendations such implementing ""family-friendly"" policies that are inclusive and have flexible eligibility criteria. Examples include universal paid sick leave for parents and financial supports for parents who are also frontline workers and are at an elevated risk for contracting the disease.","C Fong, Vanessa; Iarocci, Grace","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsaa092","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Pediatr Psychol;2020 Oct 21.; Publication details: J Pediatr Psychol;2020 Oct 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6411,""

When uncertainty features one or more of them, the risk of health outcomes increases, specifically with respect to mental health. This contribution compares the experience of the severe earthquake that hit Emilia-Romagna region (North Italy) in May 2012 and the epidemic of CoViD-19 officially started in Italy in February 2020. Both experiences were lived by the authors, as citizens and mental health professionals. The considerations presented stemmed out from the clinical experience and are articulated around some key words: surprise, length, places, society, work, welfare, feelings, economics. Similarities and differences are presented, suggesting that new therapeutic devices are necessary, to hold and treat patients during this specific epidemic, as well as during future ones.

"""<i>AndrÃ  tutto bene</i>"": Associations Between Character Strengths, Psychological Distress and Self-efficacy During Covid-19 Lockdown","The Covid-19 pandemic obliged people around the world to stay home and self-isolate, with a number of negative psychological consequences. This study focuses on the protective role of character strengths in sustaining mental health and self-efficacy during lockdown. Data were collected from 944 Italian respondents (mean age = 37.24Â years, SD = 14.50) by means of an online survey investigating character strengths, psychological distress and Covid-19-related self-efficacy one month after lockdown began. Using principal component analysis, four strengths factors were extracted, namely transcendence, interpersonal, openness and restraint. Regression models with second-order factors showed that transcendence strengths had a strong inverse association with psychological distress, and a positive association with self-efficacy. Regression models with single strengths identified hope, zest, prudence, love and forgiveness as the strengths most associated with distress, love and zest as the most related to self-efficacy and zest to general mental health. Openness factor and appreciation of beauty showed an unexpected direct relation with psychological distress. These results provide original evidence of the association of character strengths, and transcendence strengths in particular, with mental health and self-efficacy in a pandemic and are discussed within the field of positive psychology.","Casali, Nicole; Feraco, Tommaso; Ghisi, Marta; Meneghetti, Chiara","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10902-020-00321-w","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Happiness Stud;: 1-20, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: J Happiness Stud;: 1-20, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6414,""

"Eating disorder pathology and compulsive exercise during the COVID-19 public health emergency: Examining risk associated with COVID-19 anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty","COVID-19 has led to disruptions in daily living and increased uncertainty about physical, financial, social, and psychological consequences, which may contribute to anxiety, eating disorder (ED) pathology, and compulsive exercise. Individual factors, such as intolerance of uncertainty, may impact risk for ED pathology and CE in response to COVID-19 anxiety. The current study examined associations between COVID-19 anxiety, trait intolerance of uncertainty, and COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty and ED pathology and compulsive exercise. Undergraduate participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°= 295) completed a series of online questionnaires between March and April of 2020. COVID-19 anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty were associated with ED pathology, but not compulsive exercise. Additionally, both trait and COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty moderated associations between COVID-19 anxiety and compulsive exercise and ED pathology. COVID-19 anxiety was more strongly related to compulsive exercise and ED pathology for individuals with lower intolerance of uncertainty. COVID-19 anxiety may increase risk for ED pathology and may be specifically important in determining risk for ED pathology and compulsive exercise among individuals with lower intolerance of uncertainty. These results contribute to a growing body of research aimed at understanding the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 and suggest that individual factors (e.g., anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty) are important in determining risk for ED pathology and compulsive exercise in the context of the pandemic.","Scharmer, Martinez, Gorrell, Reilly, Donahue, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23395","20201024","COVID-19; anxiety; compulsive exercise; eating disorder; intolerance of uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6416,""
"Hospital staff well-being during the first wave of COVID-19: Staff perspectives","The purpose of this research is to determine the impact of working during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of staff at one 600-bed acute hospital in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. This exploratory study is part of a larger mixed methods survey project, reporting the qualitative data from an on-line survey of clinical staff working at one acute hospital between April 16th and May 13th, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses to five free-text questions were analysed using inductive content analysis. 321 medical, nursing, allied health and non-clinical staff responded to the survey. Respondents reported anxiety, fear and uncertainty related to the pandemic, from the perspectives of work, home, family and community. They reported feeling confused by inconsistent messages received from government, hospital executive, managers and media. Seven themes were identified: (i) worrying about patient care, (ii) changed working conditions, (iii) working in the changed hospital environment, (iv) impact of the pandemic, (v) personal isolation and uncertainty, (vi) leadership and management and (vii) additional support needed for staff. Despite the pandemic being comparatively well-controlled in Australia, all disciplines reported a high degree of anticipatory anxiety. Staff working in healthcare require both managerial and psychological support to minimise anxiety and promote well-being and resilience in order to deal with the health crisis. Regular unambiguous communication directing the way forward is crucial.","Digby, Winton-Brown, Finlayson, Dobson, Bucknall","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12804","20201024","COVID-19; acute care; hospital staff; mental health; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6417,""

"Electrocardiographic findings at presentation and clinical outcome in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection","The main severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome. Recent studies, however, reported that cardiac injury, as assessed by troponin levels, is associated with a worse outcome in these patients. No study hitherto assessed whether the simple standard electrocardiogram (ECG) may be helpful for risk stratification in these patients. We studied 324 consecutive patients admitted to our Emergency Department with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Standard 12-lead ECG recorded on admission was assessed for cardiac rhythm and rate, atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction, abnormal Q/QS wave, ST segment and T wave changes, corrected QT interval, and tachyarrhythmias. At a mean follow-up of 31 Ã‚Â± 11 days, 44 deaths occurred (13.6%). Most ECG variables were significantly associated with mortality, including atrial fibrillation (P = 0.002), increasing heart rate (P = 0.002), presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB; P &lt; 0.001), QRS duration (P &lt;0 .001), a QRS duration of Ã¢â€°Â¥110 ms (P &lt; 0.001), ST segment depression (P &lt; 0.001), abnormal Q/QS wave (P = 0.034), premature ventricular complexes (PVCs; P = 0.051), and presence of any ECG abnormality [hazard ratio (HR) 4.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.40-8.76; P &lt; 0.001]. At multivariable analysis, QRS duration (P = 0.002), QRS duration Ã¢â€°Â¥110 ms (P = 0.03), LBBB (P = 0.014) and presence of any ECG abnormality (P = 0.04) maintained a significant independent association with mortality.

"Association between Physical Activity and Mood States of Children and Adolescents in Social Isolation during the COVID-19 Epidemic","The COVID-19 epidemic adversely affects the lifestyle of people. This study aimed to examine the impacts of social isolation on physical activity (PA) levels and mood states of children and adolescents and to explore the correlation between them during the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 9979 children and adolescents (11.63 Ã‚Â± 1.23 years old) from Yan'an, China volunteered to participate in this study and completed online questionnaires. PA and mood states were measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and Profile of Mood States (POMS), respectively. The results showed that the mean of students' moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was 23.19 min per day. The total mood disturbance in the moderate and high-level PA groups were significantly lower than those in the low-level PA group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, boys and girls had significant differences in PA levels (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and the PA levels of students in different grades were also significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Meanwhile, boys' mood states were worse than girls'. The Grade 4 in primary schools had the worst mood states while Grade 5 had the best mood states. The results suggested that the MVPA of students has dropped badly, compared with the results of previous studies investigated in normal times. In addition, the PA level had a significantly positive impact on the mood states of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic. Sex and grades were factors which affected the PA levels and mood states. This study can help policymakers and healthcare professionals understand PA and mood states of Chinese children and adolescents during the epidemic. We should pay attention to the changes in PA levels and mood states of children and adolescents.","Zhang, Zhu, Kang, Qiu, Lu, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17207666","20201024","COVID-19; mental health; physical activity; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6420,""
"Accessibility and allocation of public parks and gardens in England and Wales: A COVID-19 social distancing perspective","Visiting parks and gardens supports physical and mental health. We quantified access to public parks and gardens in urban areas of England and Wales, and the potential for park crowdedness during periods of high use. We combined data from the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance Survey to quantify (i) the number of parks within 500 and 1,000 metres of urban postcodes (i.e., availability), (ii) the distance of postcodes to the nearest park (i.e., accessibility), and (iii) per-capita space in each park for people living within 1,000m. We examined variability by city and share of flats. Around 25.4 million people (~87%) can access public parks or gardens within a ten-minute walk, while 3.8 million residents (~13%) live farther away; of these 21% are children and 13% are elderly. Areas with a higher share of flats on average are closer to a park but people living in these areas visit parks that are potentially overcrowded during periods of high use. Such disparity in urban areas of England and Wales becomes particularly evident during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown when local parks, the only available out-of-home space option, hinder social distancing requirements. Cities aiming to facilitate social distancing while keeping public green spaces safe might require implementing measures such as dedicated park times for different age groups or entry allocation systems that, combined with smartphone apps or drones, can monitor and manage the total number of people using the park.","Shoari, Ezzati, Baumgartner, Malacarne, Fecht","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241102","20201023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6421,""

"The Use of Storytelling With Grief Reactions in Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Children are living through the COVID-19 pandemic and the traumatic changes the virus has had on the structure and schedule of their daily existence. They are struggling to cope with the loss of the normalcy of their lives and the resulting sense of grief. As the loneliness and isolation required by social distancing can worsen grief, it is important to increase communication with children and include strategies to reduce stress and increase resilience. Storytelling is the oldest form of teaching and has multiple benefits, including identifying emotional states, developing a vocabulary to allow self-advocacy, encouraging the use of strategy, and promoting a sense of hope. In addition, models of positive psychological attitude can diminish anxiety and divert attention to a more productive and positive outlook. Stories are powerful tools and convey thoughts, ideas, and values while encouraging purposeful discussion. For children, hearing stories is a rich avenue to gain insight, resources, and approaches to cope with these unprecedented times. It would be helpful to explore the long-term effects on children of COVID-19-related confinement and loss.

"Factors Associated With Mental Health Disorders Among University Students in France Confined During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and quarantine measures have raised concerns regarding their psychological effects on populations. Among the general population, university students appear to be particularly susceptible to experiencing mental health problems. To measure the prevalence of self-reported mental health symptoms, to identify associated factors, and to assess care seeking among university students who experienced the COVID-19 quarantine in France. This survey study collected data from April 17 to May 4, 2020, from 69Ã¢â‚¬Â¯054 students living in France during the COVID-19 quarantine. All French universities were asked to send an email to their students asking them to complete an online questionnaire. The targeted population was approximately 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯600Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 students. Living in France during the COVID-19 quarantine. The rates of self-reported suicidal thoughts, severe distress, stress, anxiety, and depression were assessed using the 22-item Impact of Events Scale-Revised, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the 20-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (State subscale), and the 13-item Beck Depression Inventory, respectively. Covariates were sociodemographic characteristics, precariousness indicators (ie, loss of income or poor quality housing), health-related data, information on the social environment, and media consumption. Data pertaining to care seeking were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors. A total of 69Ã¢â‚¬Â¯054 students completed the survey (response rate, 4.3%). The median (interquartile range) age was 20 (18-22) years. The sample was mainly composed of women (50Ã¢â‚¬Â¯251 [72.8%]) and first-year students (32Ã¢â‚¬Â¯424 [47.0%]).

"Discovery of novel pyrazole derivatives as a potent anti-inflammatory agent in RAW2647 cells via inhibition of NF-Ã„Â¸B for possible benefit against SARS-CoV-2","Due to unavailability of a specific drug/vaccine to attenuate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the current strategy to combat the infection has been largely dependent upon the use of anti-inflammatory drugs to control cytokines storm responsible for respiratory depression. Thus, in this study, we discovered novel pyrazole analogs as a potent nuclear factor kappa B (NF-Ã„Â¸B) inhibitor. The compounds were assessed for NF-Ã„Â¸B transcriptional inhibitory activity in RAW264.7 cells after stimulation with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), revealing Compound 6c as the most potent analog among the tested series. The effect of Compound 6c was further investigated on the levels of interleukin-1ÃŽÂ², tumor necrosis factor-ÃŽÂ±, and interleukin-6 in LPS-stimulated RAW267.4 cells by enzyme immunoassay, where it causes a significant reduction in the level of these cytokines. In Western blot analysis, Compound 6c also causes the inhibition of inhibitor kappa B-ÃŽÂ±Ã‚Â and NF-ÃŽÂºB. It was found to be snugly fitted into the inner grove of the active site of NF-Ã„Â¸B by forming H-bonds and a nonbonded interaction with Asn28 in a docking analysis.","Masih, Agnihotri, Srivastava, Pandey, Bhat, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1002/jbt.22656","20201023","NF-Ã„Â¸B; SARS-CoV-2; docking; inflammation; pyrazole","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6427,""
"Peer support for junior doctors: a positive outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic?","The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed new, intense and, as yet, unquantifiable strain on the wellbeing of healthcare professionals. Similarities are seen internationally with regards to the uptake of psychological support offered to healthcare professionals during a pandemic. Junior doctors are in a unique position to offer and access peer support; this is an evidence-based strategy to promote psychological wellbeing of junior doctors through the COVID-19 pandemic and into the future. The development of peer support networks during the pandemic may lead to reduced physician burnout and improved patient care in the future.

"Remodelling elective hospital services in the COVID-19 era - designing the new normal","The provision of elective clinical services has decreased during the initial phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to enable hospitals to focus on acute illness. Any end to the pandemic through widespread vaccination, effective treatment or development of herd immunity may be years away. Until then, hospitals will need to resume treating other diseases while also attempting to eradicate transmission of COVID-19 within the healthcare setting. In this article we suggest six major themes which could affect the design and delivery of elective clinical services: hospital avoidance, separation of high- and low-risk groups, screening, maintenance of adequate infection control, and new ways of working.","King, Hothi","https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0079","20201024","COVID-19; Healthcare system design; modernising healthcare","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6429,""

"Immediate impact of stay-at-home orders to control COVID-19 transmission on mental well-being in Bangladeshi adults: Patterns, Explanations, and future directions","We aim to evaluate the immediate impacts of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders on the mental well-being of Bangladeshi adults. We recruited 1404 healthy adults following the Bangladesh government's lockdown announcement. A questionnaire comprising the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale was used to define mental health. The overall mean score for well-being was 42.4, indicating that 51.9% of adults suffered from poor mental health. And within that 48% of males and 57% of females were depressed. The mean scores for government workers, unemployed workers, and business employees were 45.1, 39.6, and 39.5, respectively. Confounding adjustments in multivariable linear regression models revealed that married women, unemployed and business communities, and individuals returning to villages were heavily depressed. Stay-at-home orders had significant repercussions on mental health and created a gender disparity in depression among adults. Suggestions include promoting mental health for women, unemployed, and business individuals. Married women need to be taken into special consideration as their mental well-being is worse. Older people (50Ã‚Â years of age and over) reported a high day-to-day variation in their mental health. These results should be factored in when discussing the mental health of adults and communities to cope with quarantine.","Ali, Ahsan, Khan, Khan, Hossain","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-020-05345-2","20201025","Bangladesh; Covid-19 pandemic; Depression; Lockdown; Mental well-being; Social distance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6431,""
"Medical student support for vulnerable patients during COVID-19 - a convergent mixed-methods study","The coronavirus pandemic has exerted significant impacts on primary care, causing rapid digital transformation, exacerbating social isolation, and disrupting medical student and General Practice [GP] trainee education. Here we report on a medical student telephone initiative set-up by a final year GP trainee (the equivalent of a family medicine resident), which aimed to support patients at high risk and vulnerable to the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 [Covid-19]. In addition, it was hoped the project would mitigate a digital divide, enable proactive anticipatory planning, and provide an active learning environment to compensate for the pandemic's impact on medical education. Thirty-three medical students conducted daily telephone conversations with high risk and vulnerable patients as specified by the initial NHSE published lists. They confirmed public health messages, offered details for voluntary support groups, established need for medication delivery, explored levels of digital connectivity, and prompted discussions around end-of-life choices. Students had access to online reflective resources and daily remote debriefing sessions with the GP trainee. A convergent mixed-methods evaluation was subsequently undertaken, using quantitative process and descriptive data and individual qualitative interviews were conducted according to a maximal variation sampling strategy with students, General Practitioners [GPs], and the GP trainee. Inductive thematic analysis was then applied with cross-validation, respondent validation, and rich evidential illustration aiding integrity. Ninety-seven 'high risk' and 781 'vulnerable' calls were made. Individuals were generally aware of public heath information, but some struggled to interpret and apply it within their own lives. Therefore respondents felt students provided additional practical and psychological benefits, particularly with regard to strengthening the links with the community voluntary groups. The project was widely liked by students who reported high levels of skill development and widened awareness, particularly valuing the active learning environment and reflective feedback sessions. This study demonstrates utilization of medical students as wider assets within the primary health care team, with an initiative that enables support for vulnerable patients whilst promoting active medical education. Ongoing integration of students within 'normal' primary health care roles, such as chronic disease or mental health reviews, could provide similar opportunities for supported active and reflective learning.","Hughes, Beard, Bowman, Chan, Gadsby, Hughes, Humphries, Johnston, King, Knock, Malhi, Mickute, Okpalugo, Oliver, Perera, Pickles, Pollock, Pullen, Samuels, Sexton, Shutler, Smith, Tanner, Ladds","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02305-z","20201025","COVID-19; Education; General practice; Medical students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6432,""
"Smart technology for physical activity and health assessment during COVID-19 lockdown","The worldwide lockdown in response to COVID-19 pandemics has often led to physical inactivity and social distancing. When combined, these factors may affect quality and life and increase the risk of different diseases. Therefore, assessment of physical activity levels should be encouraged to monitor and identify those at a higher risk of inactivity. Smart technology is a promising tool to assess physical activity and health, and may be particularly useful during a period of general lockdown. An online survey was developed and shared among the Italian general population to collect data about physical activity and daily routine changes between January 2020 and the lockdown period from 23rd to 29th of March. Participants were asked to provide data such as daily step count (Steps) or heart rate (HR) measured and collected by their smart technology devices. Four hundred participants were included in the final analysis. During the lockdown, the number of steps dropped from 8,284Ã‚Â±4,390 to 3,294Ã‚Â±3,994 steps (p&lt; 0.001), while mean peak HR decreased from 61.3Ã‚Â±18.2% to 55.9Ã‚Â±17.3% (p&lt; 0.001). These findings provide objective data about the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity, thus encouraging the use of smart devices to monitor and promote healthy lifestyles while faced with a confinement condition.","Buoite Stella, AjÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡, Furlanis, Cillotto, Menichelli, Accardo, Manganotti","https://doi.org/10.23736/S0022-4707.20.11373-2","20201023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6433,""

"Anxiety disorders, climate change, and the challenges ahead: Introduction to the special issue","Climate change involves (1) increases in the prevalence of extreme weather events (e.g., wildfires, floods, hurricanes), (2) more gradual climatic changes (e.g., rising sea levels, desertification), and (3) increased risks of pandemics and other widespread disease outbreaks. Anxiety evoked by the threat of climate change can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Adaptive anxiety can motivate climate activism, such as efforts to reduce oneâ€™s carbon footprint. Maladaptive anxiety can take the form of anxious passivity, where the person feels anxious but incapable of addressing the problem of climate change, and may take the form of an anxiety disorder triggered or exacerbated by climatic stressors. Such stressors may involve exposure to extreme weather events or may involve exposure to other stressors such as forced migration due to rising sea levels or desertification. Three types of interventions are needed to address the various types of climate-related anxiety: (1) programs that motivate people to overcome anxious passivity and thereby take action to mitigate the effects of climate change, (2) treatment programs that address anxiety associated with exposure to climatic stressors, and (3) programs that build resilience at an individual and community level, to help people better cope with the challenges ahead.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102313","20201201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-26","",6435,""
