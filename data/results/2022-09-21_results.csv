"Responding to disruption: Exploring the transition to telehealth in mental-health occupational therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background COVID-19 presented significant challenges for occupational therapy (OT) services in Ireland. Public health guidelines necessitated a transition of services from face-to-face delivery to the use of telehealth modalities. Telehealth has yet to be extensively researched within mental health OT, with a particular need for an increased understanding of therapeutic processes when conducted remotely. Aim To explore the experiences of occupational therapists transitioning to telehealth service provision. Material and Methods This study employed a qualitative, descriptive design to examine the experiences of therapists transitioning from face-to-face to telehealth services within a mental health service. Data was collected using comprehensive, semi-structured interviews with four participants and analysed thematically. Results This study yielded three major themes: 1) responding to disruption, 2) reconsidering practice with technology and 3) therapeutic use of the 'virtual self'. Conclusions Adaptation to telehealth provision requires planned, gradual transition but offers unique opportunities for therapeutic engagement. How space is considered in therapy as well as therapists' communication styles are components of practice which are altered when conducted remotely. Significance The disruption caused by COVID-19 presented opportunities for considering the delivery of OT services. As services emerge from social restrictions it is likely that their recent experiences will be utilised in reconfiguring the future delivery of mental-health OT services.","Aislinn Duffy; Bryan Boyle; Eoin Gorman; Sarah Hayes","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.19.22280127","20220920","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37918,""
"Mothering and Stress during COVID-19: Exploring the Moderating Effects of Employment","Using primary data from the Assessing the Social Consequences of COVID-19 study, the authors examined how the pandemic affected the stress levels of women with and without coresiding minor children (mothers vs. nonmothers), paying special attention to the moderating role of employment status. The ordinary least squares regression results show that following the pandemic outbreak, among full-time working women, mothers reported smaller stress increases than nonmothers. In contrast, among part-time and nonemployed women, mothers and nonmothers experienced similar stress increases. Also, full-time working mothers reported smaller stress increases than women with most other mothering and employment statuses. Changes in women's employment status, following pandemic onset, had limited impacts on the patterns of stress change. This study contributes to research on parenting and health by showing that during times of crisis, full-time employment may be protective of mothers' mental health but may not buffer the mental health deterioration of women not raising children.","Yan, X.; Sayer, L.

"Teacher stress and COVID-19: Where do we go from here?","Teachers, a population already vulnerable to high stress, experienced increased demands and threats to their coping resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic likely will continue to exact a toll on the mental health of the teaching workforce. A silver lining from COVID-19 could come from teacher stress research conducted during the pandemic, which provides directions for how to improve the occupational lives of teachers. To this end, Christopher McCarthy, Madison Blaydes, Caroline H. Weppner, & Richard G.

"Health Challenges and Community College Student Outcomes Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study details the prevalence of community college studentsâ€™ reports of serious health events both before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. Survey responses from a representative sample of students within the largest community college at the City University of New York highlighted serious health challenges. Findings indicated that serious health challenges (including illness/injury/disability/mental health) were a significant factor in predicting studentsâ€™ outcomes during the spring 2020 term. However, health-related events that occurred prior to the onset of the pandemic had a substantially and significantly larger correlation with course outcomes than those that occurred after the onset of the pandemic. This suggests that serious health issues may be a major barrier to student progress at community colleges, even outside of the conditions of a global pandemic, and that the pandemic may have only exacerbated this significant but often overlooked preexisting issue.

"An Afterthought: Staff of Color and Campus Wellness Within Higher Education Responses to COVID-19","While higher education has continued to adjust to COVID-19, which has included moving to virtual platforms and supporting students' mental health, what is absent from these conversations is the campus staff enacting the rapidly changing university context. These professionals in academic and student affairs, residential life staff, and advising staff have had to readjust roles, responsibilities, and programs, all while facing ambiguous threats of budget cuts and struggling with their own wellness. Through a qualitative study at a midwestern university using Critical Race Theory, this study focuses on both the pandemic as well as the endemic concerns of racism Staff of Color experience at their higher education institutions. Findings reveal disconnects between university values and communication with the (lack of) financial prioritization and care.

"The Association between Balanced Time Perspective, Personality Traits, Subjective Well-Being, and Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The present study examines whether time perspectives (i.e., Past Negative, Past Positive, Present Hedonistic, Present Fatalistic and Future), Deviation from the Balanced Time Perspective (DBTP), and personality traits (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience) are good candidates to explain subjective well-being and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an online survey, we recruited 1483 participants during the Italian mandatory lockdown. Multiple regressions analysis showed that time perspectives strongly predicted subjective well-being, depression, and stress. Participants highly oriented on Past Positive and Future had higher subjective well-being, while participants highly oriented on Past Negative and Present Fatalistic had lower subjective well-being. Regarding DBTP, participants who greatly deviated from the optimal temporal balance reported lower well-being and were more distressed. Regarding the impact of personality traits, extraversion and neuroticism were the factors that better explained subjective well-being, level of stress, and depression, whereas higher levels of openness were associated with lower levels of depression. Finally, DBTP was a significant moderator in the relationships of extraversion and neuroticism with subjective well-being. Implications for time-perspective theory and practical contributions of the study are discussed.

This paper focuses on the identification of false news and the use of cutting-edge detection methods in the context of news, user, and social levels. Fake news detection taxonomy was proposed in this research. This study examines a variety of cutting-edge methods for spotting false news and discusses their drawbacks. It also explored how to detect and recognize false news, such as credibility-based, time-based, social context-based, and the substance of the news itself. Lastly, the paper examines various datasets used for detecting fake news and proposed an algorithm.","Ali, Ihsan, Bin Ayub, Mohamad Nizam, Shivakumara, Palaiahnakote, Nurul Fazmidar Binti Mohd, Noor","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6072084","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing (Online); 2022, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37926,""
"Research on the Emotional Evolution Mechanism of Network Public Opinion Based on an Information Ecosystem","As an important carrier of public emotion expression, public opinion spreads on a large scale with the continuous upgrading of social networks, and effectively controlling the spreading process of public opinion is an essential topic of contemporary social research. In view of the competition between positive and negative information in the process of public opinion dissemination, this paper introduces the theory of emotional infection and proposes a network public opinion communication model based on emotional contagion, considering the reinforcement effect of different individual mentalities and the influence of government intervention. Based on the data from the COVID-19 epidemic situation, MATLAB simulation technology is used to verify the validity of the model, and the effect of strengthening the validity and government intervention on public opinion control is discussed. According to the experiment, three conclusions have been come up with. First, a positive reinforcement effect can enhance the ignorant participants' ability to maintain the same emotion as the infected information. When positive information repeatedly stimulates the ignorant, it will positively strengthen the ability of people with a positive mentality to maintain positive emotions, which is significantly beneficial to public opinion control. Its essence is to increase the effect of positive information's belief factor on the dynamic infection rate. When negative information repeatedly stimulates an ignorant person, it will positively strengthen the ability of the person with a negative attitude to maintain negative emotion, which is not conducive to public opinion control. Second, a negative reinforcement effect will strengthen the ignorant ability to change the same emotion as the infected information. When negative information repeatedly stimulates the ignorant, the negative reinforcement effect will strengthen the positive people's ability to change negative information into positive emotion, which is significantly beneficial to public opinion control. Its essence is to increase the effect of suspicion factor on the dynamic immunization rate. It will strengthen the positive mentality and negative mentality into the path of immunization, which is beneficial to epidemic control. When positive information repeatedly stimulates the ignorant, it will negatively strengthen the ability of the negative mentality to change the positive information into negative emotions, which is not beneficial to the control of public opinion. It will be harmful to strengthen the path of positive and negative mentality into immunization, which is beneficial to epidemic control. Third, the earlier the government intervenes in public opinion, the better it will be. The essence of intervention is to decrease the dynamic incitement rate.

"A Plain Bayesian Algorithm-Based Method for Predicting the Mental Health Status and Biomedical Diagnosis of University Students","The purpose of this study was to assess e-learning during Corona epidemic regarding advantages, limitations, and their recommendations for managing learning during the epidemic. Based on a case study, this study used qualitative research. Sixteen students from King Saud Universityâ€™s College of Education were invited to take part. These students receive their online lectures via the â€œZoomâ€ application. A 20-minute WhatsApp one-on-one semiorganized interview was likewise utilized. To guarantee the reliability, iCloud was utilized to record gatherings and meetings for direct record (adaptability, constancy, confirmability, and validity). Results were presented in three themes: advantages of employing distance education, limitations of usages, and recommendations for improvements. Analyzing the feedbacks collected from students by the four interviewers, important characteristics of distance education emerged. They were student-centered learning, which included: comfortable, self-directed learning, asynchronous learning, and flexibility. The most common limitations associated with distance education, in general, included inefficiency, that is, lack of student feedback, and lack of attentiveness. As for recommendations for improvements the most obvious characteristics that became evident in studentsâ€™ responses were teaching and assessment and quality enhancement.","Wang, Jiao","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2617488","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience : CIN; 2022, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37928,""
"A media surveillance analysis of COVID-19 workplace outbreaks in Canada and the United States","A media surveillance analysis was conducted to identify COVID-19 workplace outbreaks and associated transmission risk for new and emerging occupations. We identified 1,111 unique COVID-19 workplace outbreaks using the Factiva database. Occupations identified in the media articles were coded to the 2016 National Occupational Classification (V1.3) and were compared and contrasted with the same occupation in the Vancouver School of Economics (VSE) COVID Risk/Reward Assessment Tool by risk rating. After nurse aides, orderlies, and patient service associates (n = 109, very high risk), industrial butchers and meat cutters, and poultry preparers and related workers had the most workplace outbreaks reported in the media (n = 79) but were rated as medium risk for COVID-19 transmission in the VSE COVID Risk Tool. Outbreaks were also reported among material handlers (n = 61) and general farm workers (n = 28), but these occupations were rated medium-low risk and low risk, respectively. Food and beverage services (n = 72) and cashiers (n = 60) were identified as high-risk occupations in the VSE COVID Risk Tool. Differences between the media results and the risk tool point to key determinants of health that compound the risk of COVID-19 exposure in the workplace for some occupations and highlight the importance of collecting occupation data during a pandemic.","Fenton, S.; Quinn, E.

"Prevalence and correlates of fearing a partner during the COVID-19 pandemic in Britain: Findings from Natsal-COVID","IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown restrictions (e.g., only interacting within households) induced personal and relationship stressors, which might create conditions that increase intimate partner violence (IPV). We estimated the prevalence and correlates of experiencing IPV in the first year of the pandemic.MethodWe used data from the Natsal-COVID Wave 2â€”a web-panel survey undertaken one year after the initial British lockdown from 23 March 2020. Quotas and weighting were used to achieve a quasi-representative sample of the British general population. Participants were asked about fearing a partner, which is a simple and effective way to identify IPV experiences.ResultsIn our sample (n = 6302), 9.0% of women and 8.7% of men reported fearing a partner in the first year of the pandemicâ€”about three-quarters of whom reported this occurring more than once. Sociodemographic characteristics associated with fearing a partner during this period included being younger, having had a same-sex sexual partner in the past five years, and being in a relationship. Fearing a partner reportedly affected most of these participants in multiple aspects of their lives. Controlling for age, women (73.3%) were more likely than men (49.9%) to indicate that fearing a partner made them feel anxious or depressed;men were more likely to report increased substance use (30.8% vs. 18.4%) and affected work/studies (30.0% vs. 20.0%).DiscussionPopulation-level estimates of IPV during the pandemic highlight harmful experiences that occurred alongside other wide-ranging hardships, and the associations presented identify key populations with potential ongoing need.","Tanton, Clare, Willis, Malachi, Conolly, Anne, Baxter, Andrew, PÃ©rez, Raquel BosÃ³, Riddell, Julie, Dema, Emily, Copas, Andrew, Macdowall, Wendy, Bonell, Chris, Mercer, Cath, Sonnenberg, Pam, Field, Nigel, Mitchell, Kirstin","https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-BASHH-2022.171","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sexually Transmitted Infections; 98(Suppl 1):A83, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37930,""
"The Mystery Arts Box Project: a qualitative exploration of the experiences, benefits, and challenges of participating in a remotely delivered art and craft project for British veterans with visual impairment","IntroductionThe clinical application of the arts among military personnel and veterans has been well documented, particularly in relation to service-related mental health difficulties. However, the impacts of engaging recreationally with art activities on general well-being remain underexplored and even more so among those living with visual impairment (VI). This pilot explored the artistic experiences of veterans with VI participating in a remotely delivered art and craft project during continued COVID-19 restrictions in Spring/Summer 2021.MethodsSix participants received a mystery arts box (MAB) containing a selection of materials, collated to encourage experimentation with unfamiliar techniques. Participants were asked to journal their process as they developed a final piece/pieces. They were invited to join group video calls to share work and ideas and seek guidance. Semistructured interviews were run with participants at the end of the project. Journal and interview data were thematically analysed.ResultsAnalysis identified 11 themes relating to initial and ongoing responses to the MAB and creative and journalling process. Several benefits were identified, including artistic learning, trying something new, and social, cognitive and emotional experiences. The value of the activity to participantsâ€™ lives within the context of the ongoing pandemic was also considered. Challenges were associated with the use of unfamiliar materials, impacts of sight loss and the limitations of remote delivery.ConclusionThis pilot brings to the fore the everyday artistic experience of veterans living with VI and considers the benefits, challenges and well-being implications of a remotely delivered arts activity. Findings illustrate the importance of ensuring accessibility of artistic activities to those for whom disability might limit participation and highlight the ongoing role that remotely delivered arts activities might play in meeting the social and recreational needs of individuals beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Castle, Claire, Engward, H.; Kersey, T.; Kirk-Partridge, L.","https://doi.org/10.1136/military-2022-002174","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Military Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37931,""
"Are children who need help in contact with services?/what do we know about patterns of service contact?","BackgroundEven prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, referrals to child and adolescent mental health services have been rising, in conjunction with increased focus and demand on school based mental health support. This study investigates whether children with mental health problems are becoming more or less likely to be in contact with sources of help, examining secular trends using NHS Digitalâ€™s national child mental health surveys. These are the only repeated national epidemiological surveys to include standardised psychiatric diagnostic assessments in cross-sectional community samples of children and young people, using stratified probability sampling.Data Mental Health of Children and Young People (MHCYP) 2017 and British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Surveys 1999 and 2004 (BCAMHS), including ICD-10 psychiatric diagnoses from the validated Development and Wellbeing Assessment and parent and young person reported mental-health-related contact with a range of public sector services.MethodsDescriptive and trend analyses (using Stata v.17) of prevalence of service contact in relation to diagnosis amongst participants in 1999, 2004 and 2017, using survey weights to take account of selection probabilities and non response. Analysis is ongoing, early analyses of 2017 data are presented in this .ResultsIn MHCYP 2017 (n=7,654;5 to 19 years;mean age 11.2;49.7% female), of those with a diagnosis, a quarter (24.9%) reported contact with specialist mental health services, and 67.8% reported mental health-related contact with any education, health or social care service. In 5 to 16 year olds, males were more likely to have contact than females (75.1%, 95% CI 70.5â€“79.1% versus 64.3%, 95% CI 58.7â€“69.6%, p=0.0025). In 17 to 19 year olds, levels of service contact were higher amongst females (59.0%, 95% 48.8â€“68.4%) than males (47.8%, 95% CI 34.4â€“61.7%), although confidence intervals for estimates overlapped.ConclusionWhilst most participants with a diagnosis reported some type of service contact, only a quarter had contact with a specialist service (similar to the proportion reported in BCAMHS 2004). There were also gender and age differences in patterns of contact. Analyses in progress are examining trends in contact as well as trends in inequalities in contact to identify groups who may be under-served. Given that Covid-19 is likely to have amplified existing inequalities, and has impacted child mental health at a population level, our analyses will incorporate data from MHCYP 2020 & 2021 once these become available.","Mathews, Frances, Ford, Tamsin, Newlove-Delgado, Tamsin","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2022-SSMabstracts.130","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 76(Suppl 1):A62-A63, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37932,""
"Covid-19 risk behaviours in young people: a mixed-methods survey aimed at understanding the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic","BackgroundYoung people in Gwent, Wales, were identified as a group of concern, with elevated Covid-19 case incidence during periods of 2021, sometimes in combination with low testing uptake. It was recognised that approaches to manage the pandemic have been generic for the whole population and not necessarily young-person friendly.The survey is one element of a wider project which aims to use behavioural insight to inform the development of an effective intervention to support positive behaviours in 16â€“18 year olds, thus minimising the harms associated with Covid-19. The objectives of the survey were;to develop an understanding around young peopleâ€™s behaviours in terms of Covid-19 testing practices, as well as self-isolation preparedness and associated challenges.MethodsAn online questionnaire was created, piloted and refined. It comprised of a combination of quantitative and qualitative questions. It was distributed to all full-time students at the local further education college through their college App. The responses (n=588) were exported electronically, allowing an analysis to be undertaken using Excel and descriptive statistics to be obtained. A thematic analysis was undertaken for the open-ended questions. Responders were categorised as either 16â€“18 or 19+.Results47% of respondents would take both an LFT and a PCR test if they were symptomatic, followed by 18% who would only take an LFT. This was contrary to guidance at the time, which recommended a PCR test when symptomatic. The main concerns in presenting for testing were entire households being required to self-isolate (40%), followed by friends (24%). 35% stated they had not considered preparing for self-isolation, despite evidence suggesting it can make it less of a challenge. Mental health/well-being were cited as the biggest concerns for individuals self-isolating (40%);challenges highlighted were falling behind on college work and a lack of financial support, this was followed by missing the social aspect of the college environment.DiscussionThe insight gathered will inform an intervention to support positive behaviours in young people. This includes strengthening communication to ensure they understand the most up-to-date guidance and where to access this. Financial support schemes and mental well-being provision should be communicated effectively through routes to young people, to increase participation in self-isolation and other control measures moving forward into the endemic phase of Covid-19.There are limitations to consider, one of which is the response rate (9%), where there could fundamentally different views from those who chose not to respond.","Beach, Florence, Rogerson, Emma, Deacon, Tracey","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2022-SSMabstracts.125","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 76(Suppl 1):A60, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37933,""
"Factros that influence mental health of university and college students in the UK: a systematic review","BackgroundWorsening mental health of students in higher education is a public policy concern and the impact of measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 has heightened awareness of this issue. Preventing poor mental health and supporting positive mental wellbeing needs to be based on an evidence informed understanding what factors influence the mental health of students.MethodsWe undertook a systematicreview of observational studies that measured factors associated with student mental wellbeing and poor mental health. Extensive searches were undertaken across five databases. We included studies undertaken in the UK and published within the last decade (2010â€“2020). Due to heterogeneity of factors, and diversity of outcomes used to measure wellbeing and poor mental health the findings were analysed and described narratively.ResultsOur search identified 2567 citations, following the removal of duplications. Following screening by two reviewers, we included 30 studies, most of which were cross sectional in design. Those factors most strongly and consistently associated with increased risk of developing poor mental health included students with experiences of trauma in childhood, those that identify as LGBTQ and students with autism. Factors that promote wellbeing include developing strong and supportive social networks. Students who are prepared and able to adjust to the changes that moving into higher education presents also experience better mental health. Some behaviours that are associated with poor mental health include lack of engagement both with learning and leisure activities and poor mental health literacy.ConclusionImproved knowledge of factors associated with poor mental health and also those that increase mental wellbeing can provide a foundation for designing strategies and specific interventions that can prevent poor mental health and ensuring targeted support is available for students at increased risk. A critical risk factor for poor mental health,identified in this review was social isolation and a powerful protective factor was a sense of belonging. Strategies that support the development of supportive networks for young people in university settings is vital for positive mental health.","Campbell, Fiona, Blank, Lindsay, Cantrell, Anna, Baxter, Susan, Blackmore, Christopher, Dixon, Jan, Goyder, Elizabeth","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2022-SSMabstracts.124","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 76(Suppl 1):A60, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37934,""
"How can childhood obesity prevention policy be more effective and equitable following the COVID-19 pandemic?","BackgroundDespite being a public health priority in the UK for decades, rates of childhood obesity are continuing to rise along highly unequal lines. Investigating how families have engaged with food and food environments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to understand the conditions which shape peoplesâ€™ ability to consume nutritious diets.MethodsWe conducted a remote longitudinal qualitative study, engaging 62 parents of school or nursery age children across three case study sites in England;Bradford, Folkestone and London Borough of Brent. Participants were recruited purposively to represent the demographics of each study site and comprise a range of family structures. Methods informed by ethnographic and participatory approaches were adapted for a remote setting. These comprised: semi-structured interviews, photo-elicitation, participatory mapping, and oral diaries. Participants engaged with these methods three times at six-month intervals between October 2020 and December 2021. Data from each time point was analysed cross-sectionally and the whole data set longitudinally using trajectory analysis.ResultsCOVID-19 and its early impacts necessitated a reorganisation of daily routines and food practices, an adjustment of existing food practices, and/or an establishment of new ones. Some of these changes persisted beyond the context of lockdowns, such as households who had pivoted to alternative means of sourcing food (e.g. vegetable boxes) initially to avoid COVID-19 transmission maintaining this long-term due to perceived cost-saving and health benefits. Other changes were largely confined to the context of lockdown, such as the use of baking and cooking from scratch to provide entertainment in the absence of other opportunities for leisure. Householdsâ€™ ability to enact and maintain practices beneficial for both nutrition and wellbeing was dictated by the availability of finances, time and social support systems. Changes to diet perceived as negative came about through financial insecurity, the gendered division of care work and mental health impacts associated with this burden.ConclusionCOVID-19 has revealed the multiple resources and systems of support that underpin familiesâ€™ ability to eat well and, when disrupted, can limit capacity to procure and prepare nutritious foods. These contexts have the capacity to occur again both on a large scale in society (e.g. financial recessions and periods of food system disruption) and in the context of an individualâ€™s lifetime (e.g. ill health, job loss or loss of social support networks). Policy now has a window of opportunity to implement learnings from this period and shape obesity prevention policy to be more effective and equitable.","Charlotte Gallagher, Squires, Coleman, Paul, Isaacs, Anna, Hawkes, Corinna","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2022-SSMabstracts.88","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 76(Suppl 1):A43, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37935,""
"Together through tough times: A qualitative study into factors supporting community resilience to poor mental health in disadvantaged communities in the UK","BackgroundLiving in an area experiencing economic and social deprivation is a known risk factor to poor mental health and wellbeing. There is considerable need to prevent poor mental health outcomes through action on the social determinants of health. This paper is concerned with how some communities experiencing disadvantage appear to be more resilient to poor mental health and wellbeing (community resilience).MethodsA qualitative case study approach was used to carry out an in-depth exploration of what factors support community resilience in four communities experiencing disadvantage in the United Kingdom.74 semi-structured interviews were undertaken remotely with 39 residents and 35 VCSE groups, community leaders and other local stakeholders. Interviews explored resilience narratives, assets and protective factors, and local challenges. Community analysis workshops and resilience mapping workshops in each site further explored insights from interviews. Data analysis was undertaken using cross-case, thematic analysis.ResultsCommunities experiencing disadvantage encounter a range of daily and enduring challenges to good mental health and wellbeing. Four overlapping and interacting themes support community resilience: (i) Community hubs and local VCSE networks enable a community to support one another and respond effectively to challenges;(ii) Opportunities to participate and make connections within communities strengthens social connections, builds local capacity and empowers people;(iii) Open and supportive environments to talk about mental health and wellbeing help reduce stigma and gives people the tools to help one another;and (iv) Community identities and collective narratives that establish a shared sense of belonging help people to feel secure and connected.ConclusionCommunity resilience can be understood in terms of the amount of resources â€“ articulated in terms of capital (e.g. financial, social, cultural, human, natural, physical/built) â€“ that communities can draw on in response to challenges and how well they are mobilised. VCSE organisations and networks play a significant role both building and mobilising different capitals in communities experiencing disadvantage. However, communities experiencing disadvantage face enduring challenges (e.g. poor housing, insecure employment, Covid-19). While VCSE organisations can directly support communities at a local level, their ability to affect structural change is limited to campaigning and advocacy. Responsibility for addressing these issues lie with local and national government. A thriving VCSE sector is important for community resilience in communities experiencing disadvantage as a mechanism for both sustainably building and mobilising community resources in the face of daily and enduring challenges.","Southby, Kris, Bidey, Tim, Grimes, Duncan, Khor, Zoe, South, Jane, Bagnall, Anne-Marie","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2022-SSMabstracts.58","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 76(Suppl 1):A28-A29, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37936,""
"Did trade union presence and membership protect against deteriorating mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic?","BackgroundTrade union membership has massively declined in economically advanced economies. In addition, considerable variation exists between indicators of unionization, including trade union membership or presence rates. However, trade union membership and collective bargaining rates have recently risen in the UK. Yet, studies on the association between collective bargaining and workersâ€™ mental health are sparse and non-existent in the current pandemic context. This study examines whether the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK workersâ€™ mental health is moderated by the presence of trade unions within their industrial sector.MethodsWe used UK Household Longitudinal Study (Understanding Society) data from adults in paid employment, who participated in at least: one pre-COVID-19 Wave (9 or 10/11) and one COVID-19 wave. Primary outcome was probable psychological distress, defined by â€˜casenessâ€™ (score=4) in the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). In model 1, exposure was trade union presence in workplaces, interacting with a variable splitting time between the pre and pandemic periods. In model 2, industry was added to the exposure in model 1 (3-way interaction). We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models, adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, UK country of residence and dummy variables for Understanding Society waves.ResultsOur final sample included 69,348 observations across 9,075 individuals. Pre-pandemic, odds of GHQ-12 caseness were almost 11% (OR:1.11 95%CI:0.98,1.26) higher for workers in unionised compared to non-unionised workplaces;however post-pandemic there was no difference between the two groups. Examining changes over the pre- to pandemic period, showed that odds of GHQ-12 caseness for those in non-unionised workplaces increased by 42% (OR:1.42 95%CI:1.23,1.64), whereas for those in unionised workplaces odds increased by 28% (OR:1.28 95%CI:1.11,1.47). Overall, industrial classification did not modify the relationship between trade union presence and GHQ-12 caseness, except for workers in Manufacturing (OR:0.61 95%CI:0.40,0.95) where we found a protective effect but the opposite stands for those in Transportation and Storage (OR:1.89 95%CI:1.18,3.03). Pre-pandemic, odds of GHQ-12 caseness for education sector workers were considerably higher in unionised workplaces (OR:1.70 95%CI:1.15,2.53) but declined during the pandemic period (OR:0.62 95%CI:1.05,2.47).ConclusionTrade union presence appears to have a protective effect for worker mental health during the pandemic. However, apart from Manufacturing, Transportation and Storage and Education, there is no evidence that type of industry modifies this effect. Therefore, policies should be designed to encourage and facilitate trade union presence across industries as they are likely to mitigate adverse mental health effects in times of extreme uncertainty.","Theocharis, Kromydas, Demou, Evangelia, Wels, Jacques","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2022-SSMabstracts.33","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 76(Suppl 1):A16-A17, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37937,""
"Longitudinal changes in home confinement and mental health implications: A 17-month follow-up study in England during the COVID-19 pandemic","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant behavioural changes, one of which is increased time spent at home. Although lockdowns were typically short-term and allowed people to leave their homes for exercise and essential activities, some individuals might not leave their home for prolonged periods due to, for example clinical vulnerability or shielding. This study aimed to explore longitudinal patterns of such â€˜home confinementâ€™ (defined as not leaving the house/garden) during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, and their associated predictors and mental health outcomes.MethodsData were from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a large panel study of the psychological and social experiences of over 75,000 adults (aged 18+) in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analytical sample consisted of 25,390 adults in England who were followed up for 17 months (March 2020-July 2021). Data were weighted by core demographic characteristics and analysed using growth mixture models.ResultsOur analyses identified three classes of growth trajectories, including one class showing a high level of persistent home confinement (the home-confined, 24.8%), one changing class with clear alignment with national containment measures (the adaptive, 32.0%), and one class with a persistently low level of confinement (the unconfined, 43.1%). A range of factors were associated with the class membership of home-confinement trajectories, such as age, gender, income, employment status, social relationships and health. The home-confined class had the highest number of depressive (diff=1.34â€“1.68, p&lt;0.001) and anxiety symptoms (diff=0.84â€“1.05, p&lt;0.001) at the end of the follow-up than the other two classes.ConclusionThere was substantial heterogeneity in longitudinal patterns of home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the weighted sample, nearly one in four adults maintained a high level of home confinement over the course of 17 months, even during periods when containment measures were eased or removed and when infection rates were low. People with a persistent high level of confinement had the worst mental health outcomes, calling for special attention in mental health action plans, in particular targeted interventions for at-risk groups.","Bu, Feifei, Steptoe, Andrew, Fancourt, Daisy","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2022-SSMabstracts.31","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 76(Suppl 1):A15-A16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37938,""
"Inequalities in mental health among children aged 5â€“11 before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: findings from the UK Household Longitudinal Study*","BackgroundThere are concerns that social mitigation measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have led to declines in child mental health and widened mental health inequalities, because affluent families had greater access to resources to cope with restrictions. We investigated how existing inequalities in child mental health changed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, using population-representative longitudinal data.MethodsData were from 14,854 observations of 7,929 children in the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Child mental health measures using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were taken at ages 5 and 8 during annual surveys between 2011 and 2019 and from children aged 5â€“11 over three waves of data collection between April 2020 and March 2021. In order to estimate the impact of the pandemic on inequalities, we modelled mental health using a mixed effects generalised linear model with an indicator for surveys taken during the pandemic, and interactions between the pandemic and sex, ethnicity, family structure, parent education, employment, household income and area deprivation on mental health. Models were weighted for survey design and non-response, and adjusted for age, year (linear trend), and sex.ResultsChildhood mental health declined between 2011 and 2021. In most cases advantaged groups (including children with coupled parents, highly educated parents, employed parents and higher income households) experienced a more rapid decline in mental health during COVID-19 than less advantaged groups, leading to narrowing of inequalities. Before the pandemic, for example, not having an employed parent was associated with a 1.63 point higher SDQ score (95% confidence intervals: 0.90 to 2.35), while during the pandemic this gap reduced to -0.50 points (95% CI: -1.70 to 0.69). Disadvantages related to male sex and living in deprived areas were maintained during COVID-19, while the mental health advantage of ethnic minorities increased. These patterns were apparent for both internalising and externalising mental health symptoms, and when SDQ scores were treated as a binary outcome indicating mental health difficulties.ConclusionUK children have experienced a â€˜levelling downâ€™ of mental health during COVID-19, with mental health becoming worse overall, and children from more advantaged groups experiencing the most rapid declines. Understanding what has created this pattern will be important for developing interventions and policies to improve child mental health in all sociodemographic groups, and prevent inequalities becoming re-established during the pandemic recovery.","Miall, Naomi, Pearce, Anna, Benzeval, Michaela, Green, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2022-SSMabstracts.29","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health; 76(Suppl 1):A14-A15, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37939,""
"Perceptions and experiences of wellbeing provision for NHS ambulance staff: a qualitative interview study of wellbeing leads and frontline staff","BackgroundThe wellbeing of ambulance staff is critical to their safety and safe care delivery. This study examined the perceptions of English NHS ambulance Trust health and wellbeing leads, and the experiences of UK ambulance staff of workplace wellbeing culture and provision.MethodsSemi-structured telephone interviews were undertaken with staff wellbeing leads for eight NHS ambulance trusts in England and with ambulance staff from three NHS ambulance trusts in England, selected to represent services with high, medium or low relative sickness absence rates. Interviews were subsequently transcribed, coded and analysed using Framework Analysis (FA).ResultsWe interviewed eight wellbeing leads and 25 frontline ambulance staff from April-November 2020. Decisions around what was included in or omitted from wellbeing policies sometimes led to conflict between wellbeing leads and their superiors. Ambulance work was perceived as inherently unhealthy because of work stress and the risk of encountering traumatic incidents. Well-being leads understood the adverse impacts of work on mental health for some staff. Ambulance staff wanted empathy, understanding and practical support from managers, but the reality did not always match these needs, because of variability in provision and experiences of health and wellbeing services, poor behaviours or attitudes from line managers, and a stigmatising rather than open organisational culture. COVID-19 not only impacted significantly on staff health and wellbeing, but also challenged how ambulance trusts support them.ConclusionsThe importance of an open organisational culture and the variable availability and experiences of interventions to support staff to stay well at work means that improvements are needed in both to ensure positive staff mental health and wellbeing. Early interventions, improved training for line managers to support staff at work, bespoke wellbeing services and an open culture are key to delivering effective support to ambulance staff, especially in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Viet-Hai, Phung, Pritchard, Gary, Sanderson, Kristy, Bell, Fiona, Hird, Kelly, Wankhade, Paresh, Asghar, Zahid, Niro, Siriwardena","https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2022-999.42","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ; 39(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37940,""
"Emergency service provider perspectives of feasibility and acceptability of emergency services distribution of take home naloxone","IntroductionNaloxone is an effective emergency antidote to opioid overdose. Increasing availability of take-home naloxone (THN) may reduce overdose deaths from heroin and other opiate drugs. We explored stakeholder perspectives of the processes, feasibility and acceptability of THN distributed in emergency settings as part of a feasibility study for a randomised controlled trial (RCT).MethodsWe conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews (12 participants) and a focus group (8 participants) with Emergency Department staff and paramedics. We transcribed interviews verbatim and used Normalisation Process Theory to guide data collection and analysis.ResultsParticipants perceived emergency service provision of THN as a low cost, low risk intervention and demonstrated coherence in understanding the aims of the trial and how it related to their work practices. Paramedics in particular recognised benefits of THN as distinct from naloxone alone and valued the additional provision of training and education, compatible with â€˜making every contact countâ€™. Participants reported limited opportunities for THN provision to this cohort due to low engagement from eligible patients, but perceived there to be high potential benefit for a subset of emergency service users who would not otherwise access THN. Provision of THN to patients during the trial was low due to limited numbers of eligible patients, high turnover of trained staff and recruitment pauses due to protocol changes and Covid-19. Determination of effectiveness was perceived to be challenging within a trial due to high levels of community provision of THN. There was overall support from ED and paramedic staff for the roll out of emergency setting provision of THN as standard practice, outside the confines of a trial.ConclusionsDistribution of THN in emergency settings appears to be feasible and acceptable for stakeholders and may widen access to THN for users not engaging with wider community drug services. Further RCTs of THN in emergency settings may be limited by difficulties in recruitment and limited opportunity to recruit new patients, where THN provision from other settings is widespread.","Sampson, Fiona C.; Hughes, Jane, Long, Jaqui, Buykx, Penny, Snooks, Helen","https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2022-999.39","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ; 39(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37941,""
"Impact of working through COVID-19 on ambulance staff resilience and intention to leave the NHS: a mixed methods study","BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic has imposed unprecedented demands on NHS staff and resources, during which time ambulance staff have been working at consistently high levels of operational pressure. This study explores the impact of prevailing conditions on NHS staff experiences, future employment intentions and key factors in decisions to remain in the NHS or leave.MethodsThe study was undertaken in two ambulance trusts using an online survey (n=500) and qualitative interviews (n=20) between April 2021 â€“ December 2021. Two rounds of survey data collection captured information at different time points in the pandemic. Interview participants were sampled purposively to include frontline staff, line managers and senior managers. Survey analysis was undertaken in SPSS and interviews were analysed thematically.ResultsThe majority of survey respondents were frontline staff: Paramedics (44%);Emergency Medical Technicians (25%) and call-handlers (10%). Mean length of service was 13 years. Compared with prior to the pandemic, staff perceived things were worse in terms of staffing levels (80%), stress (77%), workloads (76%), morale (73%) and their mental health (66%). Key concerns related to abnormally high levels of staff absence, the impact of work on mental and physical health, inadequate time to do the job and making mistakes because of workloads. Almost one-in-five respondents had applied for a non-NHS job in the last six months, including 25% paramedics, and 27% wished to be working elsewhere in 5 years time. The interviews provided complementary detail on experiences and employment intentions, with key issues relating to staffing pressures, work demands and conditions, and burnout.ConclusionThe Covid-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a detrimental effect on workload, morale and both mental and physical health, with implications for staff retention and NHS care delivery.

"The COVID-19 ambulance response assessment (CARA): measuring the psychological stress and preparedness of ambulance staff to deliver care during the first wave of the SARS-COVâ€“2 pandemic in the UK in 2020","BackgroundThe coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) places significant demand on the NHS. This study aimed to measure the preparedness of healthcare professionals working for ambulance services, in both direct-contact patient facing and remote roles, and the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on their psychological stress and perceived ability to deliver care.MethodsClinicians working for NHS ambulance services were invited to participate in a three-phase sequential online survey during the acceleration phase of the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK. Participants who participated in the first survey and who consented to be re-contacted were asked to complete two further surveys during the peak and deceleration phases of the pandemic. Open and closed-ended questions were used to assess participantsâ€™ perceived preparedness in undertaking their clinical duties. In addition, the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) was utilised to measure participantsâ€™ anxiety, mood and general health through each phase of the study. A score greater than 12 indicates the participant may be experiencing psychological distress.ResultsPhase one recruited 3717 participants, reducing to 2709 (73%) by phase two and 2159 (58%) by phase three. Overall, mean GHQ-12 scores were 16.5 (Â± 5.2) during phase one, reducing to 15.2(Â±6.7) by phase three. Most participants were found to have a GHQ-12 score great than 12 during the first phase (n = 3112, 84%). Factors leading to higher mean GHQ-12 scores were feeling unprepared for the pandemic, a lack of confidence in both using personal protective equipment and managing out of hospital cardiac arrests in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.ConclusionsA significant number of participants reported psychological distress, the reasons for which are multifactorial. Ambulance managers need to be aware of the risks to staff mental health and take action to mitigate these, to support staff in delivery of unscheduled, emergency and urgent care under these additional pressures.","Barrett, Jack, Williams, Julia, Bennett-Eastley, Kate, Owen, Paul, Salman, Naeem, Herbland, Anthony, King, James, Mortimer, Craig","https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2022-999.9","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ; 39(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37944,""

The Ngalaiya Boorai Gabara Budbut implementation project seeks to pursue these opportunities by developing and validating a psychosocial assessment tool, understanding what services need to better care for your people and developing resources that address those needs.Methods and analysisThe project will be governed by a research governance group comprising Aboriginal service providers, young people, and researchers. It will be implemented in an urban health service in Canberra, and regional services in Moree, Wollongong, and the Illawarra regions of New South Wales Australia. The validation study will follow an argument-based approach, assessing cultural appropriateness and ease of use;testâ€“retest validity;internal consistency, construct validity and the quality of decisions made based on the assessment. Following piloting with a small group of young people and their caregivers (n=10), participants (n=200) will be young people and/or their caregivers, attending one of the partner services. The needs assessment will involve an in-depth exploration of service via an online survey (n=60) and in-depth interviews with service providers (n=16) and young people (n=16). These activities will run concurrently. Service providers, researchers and the governance group will codesign resources that respond to the needs identified and pilot them through the participating services.Ethics and disseminationThe Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW Human Research Ethics committee (#1769/21) has approved this project. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants and/or their caregivers (with assent from those aged &lt;16 years) prior to participating in all aspects of the study. Research dissemination will occur through participating health services, academic journal articles and conference presentations.","Reilly, Rachel, Azzopardi, Peter S.; Brown, Alex, Fisher, Jane, Patton, George, Rickwood, Debra J.; Choong-Siew, Yong, Pearson, Odette, Brown, Ngiare","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063154","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37945,""
"Systematic review of the effectiveness of the health inequalities strategy in England between 1999 and 2010","ObjectivesThe purpose of this systematic review is to explore the effectiveness of the National Health Inequality Strategy, which was conducted in England between 1999 and 2010.DesignThree databases (Ovid Medline, Embase and PsycINFO) and grey literature were searched for articles published that reported on changes in inequalities in health outcomes in England over the implementation period. Articles published between January 1999 and November 2021 were included. Title and s were screened according to an eligibility criteria. Data were extracted from eligible studies, and risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool.ResultsThe search strategy identified 10 311 unique studies, which were screened. 42 were reviewed in full text and 11 were included in the final review. Six studies contained data on inequalities of life expectancy or mortality, four on disease-specific mortality, three on infant mortality and three on morbidities. Early government reports suggested that inequalities in life expectancy and infant mortality had increased. However, later publications using more accurate data and more appropriate measures found that absolute and relative inequalities had decreased throughout the strategy period for both measures. Three of four studies found a narrowing of inequalities in all-cause mortality. Absolute inequalities in mortality due to cancer and cardiovascular disease decreased, but relative inequalities increased. There was a lack of change, or widening of inequalities in mental health, self-reported health, health-related quality of life and long-term conditions.ConclusionsWith respect to its aims, the strategy was broadly successful. Policymakers should take courage that progress on health inequalities is achievable with long-term, multiagency, cross-government action.Trial registration numberThis study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021285770).","Holdroyd, Ian, Vodden, Alice, Srinivasan, Akash, Kuhn, Isla, Bambra, Clare, Ford, John Alexander","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063137","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37946,""
"Use of technology to provide mental health services to youth experiencing homelessness: a scoping review protocol","IntroductionDespite the importance to address mental health issues as early as possible, youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) often lack prompt and easy access to health services. Recently, there has been a surge of studies focusing on leveraging technology to improve access to mental health services for YEH;however, limited efforts have been made to synthesise this literature, which can have important implications for the planning of mental health service delivery. Thus, this scoping review aims to map and synthesise research on the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide mental health services and interventions to YEH.Methods and analysisA scoping review of the literature will be conducted, following Arksey and Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s proposed methodology, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews and recent guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute. All peer-reviewed papers using ICTs as a means of intervention will be considered, as well as grey literature. Only documents in English or French will be included in the analysis. First, 10 electronic databases will be consulted. Next, all data will be extracted into Covidence. Then, two reviewers will independently conduct the screening and data extraction process, in the case of discrepancies, a third reviewer will be included. Finally, data will be synthesised according to our objectives.Ethics and disseminationEthics approval is not required, as data will be collected from published literature.

"Healthcare professionalsâ€™ perceptions and experiences of physiotherapy for people with mental illness: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-ethnography","IntroductionThere is a high global prevalence of patients presenting with physical and mental health comorbidities. Physiotherapeutic interventions, such as exercise, can have positive benefits for physical and mental health. However, poor accessibility and negative experiences of healthcare services for those with mental illness (MI) have been consistently observed within literature with recent research identifying poor experiences of physiotherapeutic interactions and processes such as referrals and discharges. One way to help improve physiotherapy services for this population is to understand the personal experiences and perceptions of healthcare professionals (HCPs) toward physiotherapy for patients with MI. Qualitative-based evidence syntheses are suited to bring this data together with the aim of improving physiotherapy services for patients with MI. This review will systematically search and synthesise existing evidence around HCP experiences and perceptions of physiotherapy for people with MI.Methods and analysisA systematic search and seven-phase meta-ethnography will be undertaken. A comprehensive search of electronic databases (CINAHL plus, MEDLINE, Pubmed, Embase and Psycinfo) and search engines as well as grey literature (unpublished primary research such as theses) will be completed. Searches are planned to take place in July 2022. Eligibility criteria include: (a) qualitative data, (b) perceptions identified from HCP, including physiotherapists, assistants and HCP referring into physiotherapy, about physiotherapy for patients with MI and (c) are primary studies.Ethics and disseminationThis work is exempt from requiring ethical approval due to review methodology with data accessed from published works. This systematic review is expected to provide insight into experiences and perceptions of HCP around benefits and barriers to accessing physiotherapy for patients with mental health illness. Findings will be used to inform further research and co-develop recommendations to overcome barriers and optimise facilitators to care for this population.

"Effects of combining electrical stimulation of the calf and thigh muscles in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: protocol for a double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial","IntroductionKnee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a leading cause of disability and is characterised by degenerative changes causing pain and loss of function. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been shown to influence muscle size and strength in healthy subjects. A novel self-administered NMES device has been developed to help manage the symptoms of KOA. This study aims to investigate the effects of combining NMES of the calf and quadriceps on individuals with KOA.Methods and analysis193 individuals with KOA will be recruited to a single-centre, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial at the Respiratory Biomedical Research Centre, Leicester, UK. Participants will be randomised (1:1) to follow an 8-week home-based intervention using a NMES device or sham device. The NMES device consists of footplate electrodes and two quadriceps electrodes. Footplate stimulation will be completed daily for 30 min and quadriceps stimulation for 20 min, five times a week (compliance is recorded in a self-reported participant diary). The primary outcome is the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index pain domain, taken at 8 weeks follow-up. Secondary outcomes will explore quadriceps muscle strength, swelling, health-related quality of life, exercise capacity, anxiety and depression, sleep, physical activity and self-reported compliance. A powered subgroup analysis for compliance to the active device will be complete for the primary outcome. Participant focus groups will be completed following recruitment of half of the participants and after all participants have been recruited.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval has been obtained from the North-West Preston ethics committee (17/NW/0081). Participants are required to provide informed consent following review of the participant information sheet and discussion regarding study procedures with a member of the research team.

"Association of intranasal esketamine, a novel â€˜standard of careâ€™ treatment and outcomes in the management of patients with treatment-resistant depression: protocol of a prospective cohort observational study of naturalistic clinical practice","IntroductionEsketamine is the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the management of treatment resistant depression, demonstrating effective and long-lasting benefits. The objective of this observational study is to elucidate the association of intranasal (IN) esketamine with beneficial and negative outcomes in the management of treatment resistant major depressive disorder.Methods and analysisThis is a multicentre prospective cohort observational study of naturalistic clinical practice. We expect to recruit 10 patients per research centre (6 centres, total 60 subjects). After approval to receive IN esketamine as part of their standard of care management of moderate to severe treatment resistant depression, patients will be invited to participate in this study. Association of esketamine treatment with outcomes in the management of depression will be assessed by measuring the severity of depression symptoms using the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and tolerability by systematically tracking common side effects of ketamine treatment, dissociation using the simplified 6-Item Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptom Scale and potential for abuse using the Likeability and Craving Questionnaire (LCQ). Change in depressive symptoms (MADRS total scores) over time will be evaluated by within-subject repeated measures analysis of variance. We will calculate the relative risk associated with the beneficial (reduction in total scores for depression) outcomes, and the side effect and dropout rates (tolerability) of adding IN esketamine to patientsâ€™ current pharmacological treatments. Covariate analysis will assess the impact of site and demographic variables on treatment outcomes.Ethics and disseminationApproval to perform this study was obtained through the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board at Queenâ€™s University.

"Safer Baby Bundle: study protocol for the economic evaluation of a quality improvement initiative to reduce stillbirths","IntroductionStillbirth continues to be a public health concern in high-income countries, and with mixed results from several stillbirth prevention interventions worldwide the need for an effective prevention method is ever present. The Safer Baby Bundle (SBB) proposes five evidence-based care packages shown to reduce stillbirth when implemented individually, and therefore are anticipated to produce significantly better outcomes if grouped together. This protocol describes the planned economic evaluation of the SBB quality improvement initiative in Australia.Methods and analysisThe implementation of the SBB will occur over three state-based health jurisdictions in Australiaâ€”New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, from July 2019 onwards. The intervention is being applied at the state level, with sites opting to participate or not, and no individual woman recruitment. The economic evaluation will be based on a whole-of-population linked administrative dataset, which will include the data of all mothers, and their resultant children, who gave birth between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2023 in these states, covering the preimplementation and postimplementation time period. The primary health outcome for this economic evaluation is late gestation stillbirths, with the secondary outcomes including but not limited to neonatal death, gestation at birth, mode of birth, admission to special care nursery and neonatal intensive care unit, and physical and mental health conditions for mother and child. Costs associated with all healthcare use from birth to 5 years post partum will be included for all women and children. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken using a difference-in-difference analysis approach to compare the primary outcome (late gestation stillbirth) and total costs for women before and after the implementation of the bundle.Ethics and disseminationEthics approval for the SBB project was provided by the Royal Brisbane & Womenâ€™s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number: HREC/2019/QRBW/47709). Approval for the extraction of data to be used for the economic evaluation was granted by the New South Wales Population and Health Services Research Ethics Committee (approval number: 2020/ETH00684/2020.11), Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number: EO2020/4/1167), and Public Health Approval (approval number: PHA 20.00684) was also granted. Dissemination will occur via publication in peer reviewed journals, presentation at clinical and policy-focused conferences and meetings, and through the authorsâ€™ clinical and policy networks.This study will provide evidence around the cost effectiveness of a quality improvement initiative to prevent stillbirth, identifying the impact on health service use during pregnancy and long-term health service use of children.","Callander, Emily Joy, Andrews, Christine, Sketcher-Baker, Kirstine, Nicholl, Michael Christopher, Farrell, Tanya, Karger, Shae, Flenady, Vicki","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058988","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(8), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37951,""
"Feasibility of online mindfulness-based interventions for families affected with postpartum depression and anxiety: study protocol","IntroductionPostpartum depression and anxiety (PPDA) is experienced by up to 20% of families in the first year. The condition impacts not only parents but also their developing child. While mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have shown to be beneficial for this population, many parents do not have access to treatment or find it challenging to commit or complete the treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened some of the challenges that parents face. The ability to find time for needed self-care and health interventions is also affected by limited childcare support. The opportunity to attend a group online may significantly improve the accessibility to group MBI but may also bring challenges. This study aims to examine the feasibility and acceptability of online MBI groups for parents in families affected with PPDA.Methods and analysisIn this feasibility study, participants will include mothers diagnosed with PPDA and their partners. Two online MBI groups will run simultaneously for 8 weeks: one for mothers with PPDA and another one for their partners. The primary outcome will be feasibility of conducting the online groups, assessed from the facilitatorsâ€™ perspective, participantsâ€™ perspective and attrition throughout the study. The participantsâ€™ perspectives on feasibility will be assessed by questions including how difficult it was for them to make it to the sessions, specific obstacles encountered and their scheduling preferences. The facilitatorsâ€™ perspective will be assessed by frequency of technical difficulties encountered, of disruptions in the online sessions and of episodes where parents leave the screen (eg, to calm their child). Secondary outcomes will include mental health, couple relationship, satisfaction and acceptability which will also be evaluated through participant questionnaires.Ethics and disseminationThe study has received ethics approval from the University of British Columbia Childrenâ€™s and Womenâ€™s Research Ethics Board.

"Representation and reconciliationâ€”Indigenous leadership for health in Canada","1 Indigenous peoples in Canada and worldwide continue to experience worse health outcomes than non-Indigenous people, resulting from the ongoing legacy of colonialism that includes higher rates of poverty, inadequate housing, infant mortality, non-communicable diseases, mental health problems, and nutritional disorders related to food insecurity.2 Physicians and medical organisations play an important role in tackling these inequities through advocacy for Indigenous peopleâ€™s health and rights, policy implementation to support culturally appropriate and accessible healthcare, and medical education and curriculum development that considers the unique needs of Indigenous patients as well as Indigenous perspectives. In our roles as physicians of Anishinaabe ancestry (LR) and MÃ©tis ancestry (JS), we co-chair a national working group focused on the recruitment and retention of Indigenous physicians in healthcare and academic institutions, working to outline pathways to support their careers and leadership development.5 Observations from this initiative and our personal experiences show that representation of Indigenous leaders in medical schools and other organisations is a key factor in recruitment and retention of future students and practitioners. In the face of unprecedented levels of burnout among health providers, a holistic understanding of health and its physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions, which is foundational in many Indigenous approaches to wellness, urges us to think broadly about our needs and those of our colleagues, learners, and patients.9 As organisations strive to be fairer and more inclusive, learning from leadership and governance practices of local Indigenous nations can inform leaders and organisations on how to build networks of collaboration, working in non-hierarchical ways and valuing the contributions of everyone equally;build consensus and enact meaningful action;learn from others whose expertise often is not recognised within institutions;and consider the impact of current initiatives on the next seven generations and on the land.10 As medicine comes to rely more and more on large datasets and algorithms, Indigenous data sovereignty frameworks can guide responsible use of data for all families and patients by upholding guidelines and codes of conduct to ensure that Indigenous peoples and communities retain control of their dataâ€™s use in formal partnership agreements.11 As the health effects of climate change become more prominent, the teachings of diverse elders about the interconnectedness of all living beings with the land and the water can influence current and future generations of physicians in how to care for our communities and our planet.12 By electing Alika Lafontaine as CMA president, Canadian physicians have made the decision to uphold and amplify Indigenous voices.","Richardson, Lisa, Syring, Janelle","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o2140","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online); 378, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37953,""

"Improved resilience starts at system level","@MattPalethorpe The long term effects of the covid-19 pandemic on healthcare staff have been considerable, with at least one third of critical care staff experiencing burnout and two fifths showing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.1 But has resilience, a term that has gained much traction in recent years, made any difference? Over time, repeated exposure to such intense conditions can lead to a reduced ability to deal with both stress and negative elements of work.3 HCPs can experience depersonalisation, loss of self-accomplishment, and emotional fatigueâ€”in other words, burnout.4 In 2020, an NHS Providers survey found that 99% of trust leaders were extremely or moderately concerned about the resilience and wellbeing of their staff.5 Since 2020, increased stress from the covid-19 pandemic and ongoing clinical commitments have put even more pressure on HCPs. The negative effect of burnout is seen not only in HCPsâ€™ wellbeing but also in clinical outcomes.6 A cultural and leadership change is needed to enable HCPs to continue to provide good quality care.7 Improvements in staffing ratios, release of HCPs to other important roles, and investment in the infrastructure of healthcare systems are required.8 The NHS is at risk of being overwhelmed, with the sustained high demand on acute services outstripping the capabilities of the system.9 Until changes are made at a systems level, the individual work that is being done for HCPsâ€™ resilience will only stem the increasing rate of professional burnout, poor mental health, and potential decrease in quality of care.","Palethorpe, Matthew K.","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o1832","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online); 378, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37956,""
"The double impact of the pandemic on BAME young peopleâ€™s mental and emotional wellbeing: the effects of racial inequality and COVID-19","AimsThe combined impact of race discrimination and COVID-19 on the everyday lives of Black Asian and minority ethnic families and communities has drawn to the fore the glaring inequalities that exist in British society today. Drawing from a socioecological framework this ongoing research focuses on the emotional and mental wellbeing and resilience of Black and South Asian young people and how they have been differently impacted by the pandemic. With Black and Asian families already disproportionately impacted by the health and economic disparities, children and young people have been doubly exposed to emotional and psycho-social trauma. The aim of the research has been to examine the factors that impact the health, well-being and resilience of Black and Asian minority ethnic families and children during the pandemic.MethodsStarting from a critical race theory perspective, the qualitative research design uses a wellbeing and resilience framework and socioecological approach, to connect micro-meso-macro social processes. Semi-structured interviews, focus groups and creative workshops have provided insight into the combined impact of COVID-19 and racial discrimination on Black and South Asian young peoplesâ€™ everyday life, and how they navigated change. Data was collated in 2021 through purposive and snowballing techniques including from a community groups and schools, with a total of 53 participants, aged between 12â€“19 who identified as Black, Asian or mixed Black/Asian heritage. A youth engagement panel was also set up to aid meaningful engagement and involvement with youth participants.ResultsFindings based on a thematic analysis, provide insight into the interconnectedness of young peopleâ€™s relationships with family, peers, teachers, and community support workers for maintaining mental wellbeing. Isolation, anxiety, experiences of bereavement, separation from school and friends, conducting their lives online and the impact of social media, influenced their concerns about inconsistencies in the policing of â€˜lockdownâ€™ rules, education, health, mental health support, within the context of being young and from Black or Asian backgrounds. The prominence of BLM movement and amplification of racial injustices during the pandemic, encouraged participants to speak candidly about identity, racialization, belonging, friendships and highlight local, national and global processes of change necessary for tackling systemic racial discrimination.Although many communicated through social media, being at home and separated from peers/friends made them more introspective and reflective on their relationships and friendships.ConclusionFor Black and Asian young people already experiencing the adverse effects of structural inequalities, the pandemic has added some extra challenges in relation to maintaining their wellbeing. Their perspectives provide important insights into the complex multiplicity of factors that must be understood to build resilience post-COVID-19 - from new coping strategies, family connections, accessing support services, the importance and reliance on peer support and peer power, and the need for more culturally-responsive policies for young people;changes that respond sensitively to the emotional and mental wellbeing of Black and Asian young people.","Lakhanpaul, Monica, Sharma, Anita, Gupta, Anna, Bernard, Claudia, Peres, Teresa","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.841","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Suppl 2):A522-A523, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37957,""

"Improving Care for Young People who Self Harm","AimsOur aim was to improve the quality and consistency of care given to young people who presented to our urban Emergency Department (ED) with self-harm.MethodsWe evaluated Hospital Episode Statistics to assess the number of young people presenting to our ED with self-harm over a 6 month period from 2020-2021. We distributed a questionnaire to all staff members working with young people in ED, in order to understand our current practice of support measures offered. This received 26 responses. Following this, we introduced an information pack collating relevant resources and created a website to signpost young people and their families to appropriate local and national support. We liaised closely with CAMHS and Paediatric staff to raise awareness of the information pack and ensure consistent implementation.ResultsHospital statistics showed that the number of young people presenting with self-harm increased by 30% in late 2020 and early 2021, following the initial COVID-19 lockdown. Our initial staff questionnaire highlighted that there was significant variation in practice, and that ED doctors wanted information and resources to give to young people and their carers. People were signposting to 20 different resources although 4 respondents denied signposting. We produced a paper information pack and collated resources on an easy-to-access website. CAMHS practitioners working with young people who self-harm valued the information packs and fed back that families appreciated having a guide of helpful resources to take away. This work led to the development of a guideline to provide a clear pathway of care of young people who self-harm for all health professionals to follow.ConclusionSelf harm commonly presents to the Emergency Department and cases have increased locally and nationally during the pandemic. A readily available information pack and website providing easy access to local and national resources can improve the quality and consistency of care given to young people presenting with self-harm. This project highlighted the importance of integrated care, bringing paediatric and CAMHS colleagues together to improve the care and support for young people and their families at a very vulnerable and stressful time.","Reed, Johanna, Kleine, Ira, Cryer, Jo, Hemeson, Anthony, Panjwani, Sarah","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.668","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Suppl 2):A412, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37960,""

"An outbreak of Covid 19 infection at the Massey Street Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Lagos-Island, Nigeria","1333 Figure 1Pneumonia like admissions between Oct 2020-Jan 2021[Figure omitted. See PDF]ConclusionThere was a high number of admission of pneumonia cases into the emergency unit in December 2020 and some children with uncommon symptoms of Covid. The testing rate in children was almost zero. The belief was, these contributed significantly to the source of outbreak in the hospital as Lagos state is also the epicenter of the disease. With more than 60% of the workforce testing positive to the virus, the morale of staffs was low, mortality worsened during this period as there were fewer staff available to work. Leadership instituted alternate day shifts for staffs, and resolved to strengthen the adherence to Covid protocols by providing more PPEs, continued to train and retrain staff in management of Covid infection and IPC. No crowding allowed in call rooms, lounge and library, restriction of visitors to the hospital and regular cleaning of surfaces. Virtual meetings replaced physical meetings. Staffs who tested positive but not needing admission received a home based treatment pack for free and self-isolated at home for 14days. 3 staffs were admitted in the central isolation unit in the state. Thankfully, no death was recorded among the staff and by March the infection had reduced drastically. The staffsâ€™ mental health issues were addressed, there were zoom sessions with mental health experts. Today, we have a workforce that is fully vaccinated against Covid 19 (received booster dose).","Olutekunbi, Olanike, Oshinowo, Opeyemi, Oladeji, Abimbola, Ogunlaja, Oluwaseun, Omo, Feyisayo","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.576","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Suppl 2):A357, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37962,""
"The impact of the pandemic on children under 11 with Down Syndrome","AimsThe UK has faced 3 major lockdowns since March 2020 due to the pandemic, affecting access to education, healthcare provision and social activities. Children with Down Syndrome are more likely to have chronic health conditions and require developmental support, therefore are more likely to be impacted by healthcare delays and the move to remote services. Childhood is a crucial time for social, physical, and emotional development so 2 years of disrupted support will have had life-long consequences. This survey aimed to determine the impact of the pandemic on children under 11 with DS in the UK.MethodsThe survey was split into 6 categories: Demographics, Education, Healthcare provision, Physical health, Mental health, and Behaviour. Parents/carers gave feedback during the survey development. The questions were inputted into REDCap survey software on a secure server and all data was anonymously submitted. The survey was circulated using a digital snowballing technique through social media and email. Charities and support groups were contacted and asked to share the survey. Valid response percentages for each item were calculated and presented below.ResultsThere were 241 responses from caregivers across the UK between 25thOctober 2021 and 14th February 2022 (England 79.5%;Scotland 18.5%;Wales 2.9%;NI 2.1%). The children were primarily White (n=215) and male (Male: n=124;Female: n=117).Parents believed that remote learning had a negative impact on children with DS. 51% (n=53) of parents of children who continued school online felt that their child did not progress with their learning and 83.8% (n=88) felt they were missing out on key learning activities. 84.3% (n=129) believed that missing out on after-school activities had a moderate-large impact on their child and 59.8% (n=143) of parents believe that the lockdown has caused their childâ€™s social skills to deteriorate.Healthcare/therapy provision was a large concern;89.8% (n=211) had appointments delayed and/or cancelled, while 43.6% (n=17) of those awaiting surgeries had them cancelled due to COVID and another 43.6% (n=17) were delayed. 57.1% (n=20) of those parents were worried about their childâ€™s health as a result and 34.2% (n=78) of parents saw a direct increase in health issues.Parents saw a change in their childâ€™s mental health and behaviour. 68.7% (n=161) of parents believe that their childâ€™s emotional wellbeing had deteriorated, with the number of children presenting with signs of aggression often/almost always increasing from 4.3% (n=10) to 20.9% (n=48) and those crying often/almost always increasing from 2.5% (n=6) to 19.9% (n=47). As such, 77.8% (n=159) said the pandemic made the family dynamic more strained/stressful.ConclusionDespite parents reporting that 58.2% (n=139) of their children were â€˜seemingly unawareâ€™ of the pandemic, it has nonetheless had a clear negative impact on their health, development and quality of life. Conducting qualitative interviews with families would provide a deeper insight into the lived experiences of the children during the pandemic and help to develop a tailored and targeted approach to support parents/carers and their children moving forward.","Nixon, Laura, Gema Milla de la, Fuente, Costanzo, Floriana, Sideropoulos, Vassilis, Jo Van, Herwegen, Lakhanpaul, Monica","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.515","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Suppl 2):A318-A319, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37963,""
"Barriers to healthcare for unaccompanied asylum seekers","971 Table 1ConclusionBarriers to treatment persist, with new covid related issues. Of note we saw a significant fall in patients seen by dentists. Carers report difficulty accessing NHS dentistry. Locally a pilot dental referral service for LAC has been initiated. Patients can be referred by their SW or the named doctor. Interestingly, access to opticians did not appear to be influenced by covid.We found a fall in availability of interpreters face-to-face as well as in general. This appeared secondary to covid concerns and infections.Direct (within Trust) TB referrals fell although this appeared due to local factors. 100% patients were referred via GP or directly.We found good practice regarding mental health screening & catch-up immunisations. It is notable that in 2021 one UASC refused immunisations. Our IHA doctors report increasing frequency of reluctance regarding immunisations. It is possible this is secondary to covid vaccination misinformation on social media.Routine blood and haemoglobinopathy screening markedly improved, however communication of results was consistently lower than expected. We noted in 2019 that results not communicated appeared to where bloods werenâ€™t sent on the day and recommended all bloods be sent on day of assessment. However due to covid-19 the phlebotomy service is no longer walk-in, affecting our ability to achieve this.There are insufficient CAMHS resources to see all UASC despite high incidences of PTSD and anxiety. A joint or contemporaneous assessment with mental or emotional health professionals might be a solution. The London Asylum seekers consortium is running a health and welfare check pilot project. It will be interesting to see its impact as the focus is more emotional than the IHA.","Durrant, Niall, Johnston, Chloe, Stephenson, William","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.128","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Suppl 2):A80-A81, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37964,""

See PDF]22.9% and 20.0% of TA parents/caregivers had severe anxiety and moderate anxiety compared to 4.0% and 25.0% of non-TA parents/caregivers, respectively. For parents/caregivers living in TA, the odds of a more severe anxiety rank were 2.46 times higher (95%CI:1.27â€“4.75). Other significant factors for anxiety were: Very Low Food Security (OR 4.45, 95%CI:3.26â€“6.08);families â€˜finding it very difficultâ€™ financially (OR 1.62, 95%CI:0.96â€“2.73). [Figure 2]ConclusionFamilies living in TA had a greater odds of poor parental mental health outcomes, which was further compounded by factors including NRPF status, financial insecurity, food insecurity and poor housing environments. Poor parental mental health is an adverse childhood experience (ACE) directly impacting both the health and wellbeing of the parent and child throughout the life course. Targeted policies and tailored community-based mental health strategies, including the co-location of mental health and housing support within settings already accessed by TA families with under 5s, are vitally needed, since this vulnerable group is at higher risk of poorer parental mental health and a higher ACE count, which is exacerbated by the unsuit ble and unsafe TA environment.","Diana Margot, Rosenthal, Hayward, Andrew, Ucci, Marcella, Teakle, Ashlee, Sarah, Oâ€™Toole, Whitaker, Lydia, Hauari, Hanan, Hollingworth, Katie, Cameron, Claire, Schoenthaler, Antoinette, Lakhanpaul, Monica, Lewis, Celine, Heys, Michelle","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.117","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Suppl 2):A71-A72, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37965,""
"Support needs of Children and Young People with Autism (ASD) during the Covid-19 Pandemic- Learning from a local picture","AimsChildren with ASD are known to find alterations within their routines particularly distressing.[1 2 3] Children with Special Educational Needs (SEND) may be especially vulnerable to the negative effects of abrupt changes and prolonged periods of isolation.[4]Aim: To identify the reasons carers of children with ASD accessed our service during the covid-19 pandemic and glean how best to serve their needs should there be further lock-downs.Methodsâ€¢ We identified clients that contacted the Autism Service between March and November 2020 (N=26)â€¢ A consent protocol, telephone interview template and risk management protocol was developed and administered by a trained interviewer.â€¢ Up to 3 attempts were made to reach the service userâ€¢ Clients were informed that â€˜There will be no direct risks or negative impact on your child, or on the service that you will receive from us, now or in the future if you choose not to participate or if you give us negative feedback.â€™â€¢ The Interviewer collected information about the reason for making contact, whether it was covid specific, how helpful the response was and suggestions for future lockdowns.â€¢ Qualitative methodology was used to collate and analyze the data.Resultsâ€¢ Of 26 clients identified, 2were siblings. Telephone interviews were conducted with 16/25 (64%) parents/carers.â€¢ 11/16 (69%) attributed the reason for making contact to Covid-19 impact on their child or services they hoped to receive. These were as follows: Concern about language regression and therapy provision, deterioration in behaviour, sleep problems, increasing anxiety, need for respite and enquiry about post diagnosis support.â€¢ 50% (8/16) felt the response received was helpful for the reason they made contact. (Contact was made for some needs that would not be dealt with by the Paediatric service.)â€¢ Respondents made suggestions about how we could improve: communication, response time to queries and overall support e.g. access to on line resources, sleep course and virtual support groups whilst also acknowledging that some suggestions were unrealistic in the face of a killer pandemic. What was most valued was someone to talk to/listen.ConclusionParents of children with SEND reported larger increases in stress and anxiety than their counterpartâ€™s children during the COVID-19 lockdown.[2] In our busy service, a very small proportion of parents made contact for help. The reason for contact was anxiety in 3/16 (19%).Respondentsâ€™ suggestions have since been addressed through offer of virtual workshops and a National Autistic Society Family support Worker to address post diagnosis queries releasing clinicians time for where their expertise is most required.ReferencesThe Lancet Psychiatry.

"Estimating the impact of weight management treatments on childhood obesity in England","AimsTrials demonstrate that childhood obesity treatments are effective but to varying degrees. Some treatment programmes are less effective (e.g., lifestyle programmes), while others are deemed more effective but invasive (e.g. bariatric surgery). Yet, we know relatively little about the most effective way to implement childhood obesity treatments at a population level. That is: which children would benefit most from treatment and at what age;and at which management tier (e.g., lower tiers are low cost with greater reach, but less effective, while higher tiers are high cost with low reach, but more effective). The main aim of this work was to estimate the potential impact of weight management treatments and interventions on population prevalence and inequalities in childhood obesity in England.MethodsUsing Health Survey for England data, we created a â€˜digital twinâ€™ of the English population and identified children with a range of weight status categories (e.g., obesity and extreme obesity), obesity comorbidities (e.g., physical and mental health conditions), and indicators of heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (e.g., blood pressure and cholesterol). Other risk factors for obesity were also identified using sociodemographic data (e.g., level of deprivation, ethnicity, income and region). Using NICE guidelines for treatment eligibility, we estimated the number of children who would be eligible for each management tier of treatment in England;where tier 1 represents interventions in primary care, tier 2 represents community interventions, tier 3 represents pharmaceutical interventions, and tier 4 represents surgical interventions. In Phase 1 of our analysis, in addition to a universal preventative intervention, we modelled a number of scenarios that represented each management tier of treatment with a range of effect sizes (based on the best available evidence) and for varying levels of uptake. We applied these scenarios individually and in combination, before comparing stepped and staged approaches. We presented Phase 1 of our analyses to a stakeholder group consisting of multi-disciplinary academics, practitioners and experts in childhood obesity treatment. Stakeholders were consulted on reasonable treatment effect sizes, levels of uptake and other model parameters in order that we could better inform our scenarios, and where there were gaps in the evidence base. Following this modified Delphi approach, we revised our assumptions and model parameters and are currently undertaking Phase 2 of our analyses.ResultsAnalyses from Phase 1 showed substantially higher prevalences of obesity and severe obesity, compared to other estimates across all age groups and levels of deprivation. Recent data from the National Child Measurement Programme in England suggest that these prevalences have increased following the Covid-19 pandemic. We have not reported summary findings from Phase 1 of this work here as these findings will be superseded upon completion of Phase 2.ConclusionIn this presentation, I plan to present the latest findings from Phase 2 of this work.","Russell, Simon, Viner, Russell","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.86","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Suppl 2):A52, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37967,""
"The invisible issue, children, and families in substandard accommodation: how can paediatric interdisciplinary teams help?","AimsIn the UK the number of children living in temporary accommodation has risen by 80% since COVID-19 [1]. One fifth of Australian children aged 0 to 5 years lived in homelessness/housing instability prior to COVID-19 [2,3]. Little is known regarding the impact of homelessness on the health of children living with homeless families. Moreover, the types of services and interprofessional collaborations needed to address childrenâ€™s needs remains unknown [3,4]. This presentation outlines an innovative model of interdisciplinary collaborative health delivery that addresses these gaps [5]. The model used an embedded Nurse Practitioner â€˜health hubâ€™ to assess children and help parents meet their childâ€™s needs.Objectives: This project captured the:1. Health of homeless children presenting to homelessness and community services in South Australia.2. Referral rates and uptake of the children3. Interdisciplinary health needs of the children living with homeless familiesMethodsA mixed methods study design was conducted. Health severity scales, extended health assessments, case note reviews, and interviews with parents and staff, to determine the health impacts of homelessness on children and the childrenâ€™s interdisciplinary health needs. The conditions identified were coded using a severity scale of 1 to 3;3= severe, the child needing immediate care/intervention, 2= moderate, the child needs a referral but can wait for public hospital/clinic, 1= minor, the child does not need immediate referral). Referrals were made to: Paediatricians, dentists, physiotherapists, immunisation nurses, General Practitioners and other allied health professionals.ResultsOverall interim results show 62% of children presenting had health conditions (e.g. chronic dental caries, craniosynostosis with developmental delay) requiring interventions, while 38% were assessed as having good health requiring no intervention.Table 1 above illustrates the presenting conditions of the children attending the Nurse Practitioner led clinic. A consultation with the NP for an in-depth health assessment and often were the first comprehensive health assessment the children had received since birth.We found 18% children had a developmental delay (6 times the national average), 17% had behavioural and/or mental health issues, 17% required an ENT intervention, 24% had dental issues and 24% had a variety of presenting conditions. The correlational analysis and odds ratio results along with the interdisciplinary model of care and the case note analysis will be presented at the RCPCH conference. The intervention/evaluation reflects the complexity and depth of the unmet need in these children.ConclusionOverall the children are disconnected from health. This research identified that:â€¢ A significant number of children required medical interventions.â€¢ Children living in housing insecurity are at risk of missing out on care that is essential to their development and healthâ€¢ These children lack access to mainstream servicesâ€¢ Health care costs act as a barrier to servicesâ€¢ There is a poor referral uptake by children living in housing insecurityâ€¢ There is a lack of information on the number of homeless children, particularly Aboriginal childrenIt is imperative that the health needs of children living with housing instability are measured and the responses of health professional interventions are tracked.","Parry, Yvonne, Ullah, Shahid, Willis, Eileen, Sivertsen, Nina, Kendall, Sally, Marriott, Rhonda, Ankers, Matthew","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.83","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Disease in Childhood; 107(Suppl 2):A50, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37968,""
"Pushing or clicking the grocery cart? Health and economic concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic","Online Grocery Shopping (OGS) has grown dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unknown, however, how consumers weighed pandemic situational factors versus household production considerations of timesaving and cost. We collect and analyze survey data from a nationally representative sample to examine how consumers with different health and socio-demographic profiles consider these factors for OGS choices and how their choices changed in the first seven months of the pandemic. We find that consumers with moderate-to-high income, white, having insurance, and not in the labor force value the timesaving and convenience of OGS more than pandemic situational factors. Still, some consumers with health risks choose to shop in person because of the cost of OGS. Lung disease, diabetes, mental health conditions, age, income, and college degree explain the dynamics of OGS choice as the pandemic evolved. Our findings shed light on the development of technology-assisted adaptation to future public health emergencies.

"Circular textiles innovation during COVID-19: not the silver lining some had hoped for","Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has caused irrefutable devastation globally. Yet, academic and trade commentators have claimed that this disruption could have had a silver lining by presenting the fashion industry with the opportunity to reassess and rebuild in a slower, more considered way. Part of this reassessment, some have argued, may have been allowing the industry's pre-COVID sustainability buzz to come to fruition by nudging the fashion industry to go circular. This paper explores if, and how, the COVID-19 pandemic was (not) nudging the industry towards circularity using the case study of circular textiles. Design/methodology/approach Serial, semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with three buyers and sourcers working for three UK-based fashion retailers. Each participant was involved in three interviews in June 2020 following the UK's first national lockdown. Findings The research findings suggest that, at the time this research was undertaken, these retailers were focussed on regaining profit, protecting their supply chains and producing ""safe"" designs whilst cutting back and becoming more risk averse. These actors suggested that, in contrast to the suppositions made by academic and media commentators, the COVID-19 pandemic was acting as a hindrance to circularity, not a helping hand, as retailers were less willing to invest in circular textiles at that time than they were pre-pandemic. Originality/value This paper offers valuable insight into the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on circular innovation within fashion retail whilst contributing to broader understandings of the principles of the circular economy within textiles and design.","Sugg, Bethany","https://doi.org/10.1108/jfmm-07-2021-0180","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal;: 1-16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37974,""
"The need for attention to mental health of nursing staff during COVID-19 pandemic as their basic human right","Purpose This purpose of this study was to investigate the role of nurses' resilience as an indicator of their mental health on sick leave absenteeism during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach This descriptive-analytical study was conducted in 2020 to identify the predictors of absenteeism among 260 nurses working in two training hospitals delivering specialized services in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Data was collected through the use of standard questionnaires including demographic information, nurses' resilience, intention for job turnover and absenteeism from the workplace. To predict sick leave absenteeism, regression analyses were implemented. Findings Study results revealed that the most influencing features for predicting the probability of taking sick leave among nurses were marital status, tenacity, age, work experience and optimism. Logistic regression also depicted that nurses who had less faith in God or less self-control were more likely to take sick leave. Practical implications The resilience of nurses working in the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively low, which needs careful consideration to apply for organizational support. Main challenge that most of the health systems face include an inadequate supply of nurses which consequently lead to reduced efficiency, poor quality of care and decreased job performance. Thus, hospital managers need to put appropriate managerial interventions into practice, such as building a pleasant and healthy work environment, to improve nurses' resilience in response to heavy workloads and stressful conditions. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine such a relationship, thus contributing findings will provide a clear contribution to nursing management and decision-making processes. Resilience is an important factor for nurses who constantly face challenging situations in a multifaceted health-care system.","Abdollahzade, Sina, Rafiei, Sima, Souri, Saber","https://doi.org/10.1108/ijhrh-04-2022-0031","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Human Rights in Healthcare;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37975,""

"Do what matters, no matter what! Factorizing positive activities during COVID-19 lockdown","Behavioral activation (BA) interventions systematically encourage positive and value-based activities. Engaging in them is an effective way to counteract negative affect, but it is unknown whether there are subtypes of activities that may have differential effects on mood. This study investigated the factorial structure of 99 potentially rewarding activities used in an online BA intervention during the COVID-19 lockdown. About 3624 German-speaking participants evaluated a list of 99 activities that were easy to apply. We analyzed the initially 99 activities by means of confirmatory factor analysis. Since activities can either be seen as reflective or formative indicators, a reflective as well as a formative model was analyzed. Although the range of chosen activities differed clearly between respondents, a one-factor model provided the best fit. It seems that a general ""activity"" factor is more important for explaining whether people choose a certain activity or not, than specific characteristics of the activity itself.","Herzberg, Stender, Dechmann, Ã„Å’oliÃ„â€¡, Hoyer","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591053221120967","20220920","behavioral activation; mental health; ordinal factor analysis; positive activities; reflective vs formative measurement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37979,""

"COVID-19's effects and adaptation strategies in fisheries and aquaculture sector: An empirical evidence from Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the aquaculture and fisheries sector all around the world, with the impact being exacerbated in developing countries. This study is an endeavor to identify consequences of the COVID-19 on fisheries and aquaculture sectors based on primary data collected from Bangladesh as an empirical case study. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews with different supply chain actors while analyzed using descriptive statistics and a problem confrontation index. As results depicted, income and employment across fish farmers, fishers, and traders were severely hurt, with a drastic fall in the market demand, coupled with a severe drop in their fish consumption. As market demand declined, fish farmers must be stocked mature fish for an extra period, and feed costs raised, eventually increasing the overall production cost. Besides, inaccessibility to inputs also made fish production and catch more troublesome. The price of all the major cultured and captured species plunged, leading to a depressing return to farmers, while inputs price underwent a significant increase except for labor and fingerling. However, traders seemed to be the worst sufferers amid striking disruption in fish value chain, which ostracized the preponderance of the traders from the chain. Some of the prime obstacles that constrained the production and trading process were but not limited to higher transportation costs, labor shortage, inability to pay for the wage, and reduced consumer demand across fish farmers, fishers, and traders. Nevertheless, our article further identified a myriad of strategies that the fish farmers, fishers, and traders followed to heal the scar of the fisheries and aquaculture sector with hands-on actions.","Khan, Hossain, Rahman, Dey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738822","20220920","Adaptation strategies; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Fisheries and aquaculture; Supply chain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37981,""
"Big data analytics and the effects of government restrictions and prohibitions in the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department sustainable operations","Grounded in dynamic capabilities, this study mainly aims to model emergency departments' (EDs) sustainable operations in the current situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by using emerging big data analytics (BDA) technologies. Since government may impose some restrictions and prohibitions in coping with emergencies to protect the functioning of EDs, it also aims to investigate how such policies affect ED operations. The proposed model is designed by collecting big data from multiple sources and implementing BDA to transform it into action for providing efficient responses to emergencies. The model is validated in modeling the daily number of patients, the average daily length of stay (LOS), and daily numbers of laboratory tests and radiologic imaging tests ordered. It is applied in a case study representing a large-scale ED. The data set covers a seven-month period which collectively means the periods before COVID-19 and during COVID-19, and includes data from 238,152 patients. Comparing statistics on daily patient volumes, average LOS, and resource usage, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that patient characteristics and demographics changed in COVID-19. While 18.92% and 27.22% of the patients required laboratory and radiologic imaging tests before-COVID-19 study period, these percentages were increased to 31.52% and 39.46% during-COVID-19 study period. By analyzing the effects of policy-based variables in the model, we concluded that policies might cause sharp decreases in patient volumes. While the total number of patients arriving before-COVID-19 was 158,347, it decreased to 79,805 during-COVID-19. On the other hand, while the average daily LOS was 117.53Ã‚Â min before-COVID-19, this value was calculated to be 165,03Ã‚Â min during-COVID-19 study period. We finally showed that the model had a prediction accuracy of between 80 to 95%. While proposing an efficient model for sustainable operations management in EDs for dynamically changing environments caused by emergencies, it empirically investigates the impact of different policies on ED operations.","Sariyer, Ataman, Mangla, Kazancoglu, Dora","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-022-04955-2","20220920","Big data analytics; COVID-19; Emergency department; Machine learning; Sustainable operations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37982,""
"Loneliness and self-harm in adolescents during the first national COVID-19 lockdown: results from a survey of 10,000 secondary school pupils in England","Adolescents' loneliness and self-harm have received considerable attention during the COVID-19 pandemic with concerns that the socioecological changes taking place would contribute to an escalation of both loneliness and self-harm. However, empirical evidence is scant. We estimated the prevalence of loneliness and self-harm in adolescent school pupils and investigated the association of loneliness and change in loneliness during the UK's first lockdown with self-harm during lockdown in a cross-sectional school survey (OxWell) involving 10,460 12-18-year-olds from south England. Loneliness was measured with four items. Self-harm was ascertained through a detailed questionnaire. The prevalence of loneliness and self-harm were estimated applying post-stratification weights to account for differences between the study sample and the target population. The associations between indicators of loneliness and self-harm were examined using mixed effect models. 1,896 of 10,460 adolescents (18.1%) reported feeling lonely 'often' (weighted proportion 16.8%). 3,802/10,460 (36.4%; weighted proportion 35%) felt more lonely since lockdown. Self-harm during lockdown was reported by 787/10,460 adolescents (7.5%; weighted proportion 6.7%). Controlling for confounders, adolescents who reported feeling lonely 'often' [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.8, 95% CI 2.1-3.9, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001] or 'sometimes' (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.2, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) were more likely to self-harm during lockdown relative to adolescents who reported 'never' or 'hardly ever' feeling lonely. Exacerbation in loneliness during lockdown was associated with an increase in the odds of self-harm during lockdown. Loneliness, heightened loneliness and self-harm were common during lockdown and closely linked. It is important to support schools inÃ‚Â address loneliness and self-harm as part of efforts to improve well-being as the long tail of the pandemic continues to impact on child and adolescent mental health. Understanding how loneliness and self-harm may co-vary could be important for future self-harm reduction strategies in young persons.

"Effect of Cancer-Related Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep on Fear of Cancer Progression in the Coronavirus Pandemic","This study aimed to explore clinical correlates of fear of progression (FoP) among patients with cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and examine the mediation effect of cancer-related dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (C-DBS). Medical charts of patients with cancer who visited a psycho-oncology clinic between July and November 2021 were reviewed. Baseline socio-demographic and cancer-related variables were collected. Patients' self-report questionnaires, regarding FoP, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items; PHQ-9), viral anxiety (Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items; SAVE-6), C-DBS, and other distress, were investigated. Pearson's correlation and linear regression were performed to examine the risk factors of FoP. Mediation effect analysis with the bootstrap method with 2,000 resamples was implemented. A total of 231 patients were included in the analysis. Linear regression revealed that FoP was predicted by age (ÃŽÂ² = -0.14, <i>P</i> = 0.003), PHQ-9 (ÃŽÂ² = 0.48, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), SAVE-6 (ÃŽÂ² = 0.34, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and C-DBS (ÃŽÂ² = 0.15, <i>P</i> = 0.005). FoP was directly influenced by SAVE-6 and mediated by C-DBS, while it was directly influenced by PHQ-9 with no mediation effect. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FoP of patients with cancer was associated with younger age, depression, viral anxiety, and C-DBS. Depression and viral anxiety directly influenced FoP, while C-DBS mediated the association between viral anxiety and FoP. Therefore, oncology healthcare professionals are recommended to assess C-DBS of their patients when they are highly distressed from FoP.","Kim, Cho, Lee, Kim, Lee, Cho, Park, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e272","20220920","COVID-19 Pandemic; Mediating Factor; Psycho-Oncology; Psychological Distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37984,""
"Prevalence and risk factors of sleep disturbance in adults with underlying health conditions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic","To determine the prevalence of sleep disturbance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among US adults who are more vulnerable to complications because of age and co-morbid conditions, and to identify associated sociodemographic and psychosocial factors. Cross-sectional survey linked to 3 active clinical trials and 2 cohort studies, conducted between 11/30/2020 and 3/3/2021. Five academic internal medicine practices and 2 federally qualified health centers. A total of 715 adults ages 23 to 91 years living with one or more chronic conditions. A fifth (20%) of participants reported poor sleep. Black adults were twice as likely to report poor sleep compared to Whites. Self-reported poor physical function (51%), stress (42%), depression (28%), and anxiety (36%) were also common and all significantly associated with poor sleep. Age Ã¢â€°Â¥70 years and having been vaccinated for COVID-19 were protective against poor sleep. Sex, education, income, alcohol use, and employment status were not significantly associated with sleep quality. In this diverse sample of adults with chronic conditions, by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, disparities in sleep health amid the ongoing pandemic were apparent. Worse physical function and mental health were associated with poor sleep and should be considered targets for health system interventions to prevent the many subsequent consequences of disturbed sleep on health outcomes.

"Changes in self-harm attempts after the COVID-19 pandemic based on pre-hospital medical records","Although many concerns have been raised on increased self-harm or suicide attempts since the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the numbers of studies reported no consistent increase. This study aimed to analyze the data on the request for emergency medical service (EMS) in Daegu Metropolitan City in Korea to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence and types of suicidal patients. Data of 4480 cases requesting EMS related to self-harm or suicide 1 year before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were retrospectively comparatively analyzed (February 19, 2019-February 18, 2021). The number of EMS requests for self-harm and suicide increased after the pandemic compared to that before the pandemic (daily mean request 5.83 [Ã‚Â±2.597] vs 6.43 [Ã‚Â±2.918]). In particular, the number of female patients increased per day on average (2.61 [Ã‚Â±1.717] vs 3.17 [Ã‚Â±1.893]). With respect to the reasons for the request, committed self-harm and attempts to commit self-harm increased, whereas the presumption against suicide decreased. With respect to consciousness levels, the number of alert patients increased, whereas the number of transport cases decreased. For the method of the attempt, hanging and carbon monoxide/gas poisoning decreased, whereas jumping from a height and drowning increased. The number of patients with psychiatric history and those with other chronic illnesses increased. In multivariate regression analysis, women (OR 1.227, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦1.072-1.405, PÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦.003), patients with psychiatric diseases (OR 1.223, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦1.031-1.450, PÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦.021), patients with other chronic illnesses (OR 1.510, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦1.127-2.023, PÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦.006), and CO or gas poisoning (not attempted) (OR 1.349, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦1.038-1.753, PÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦.025) showed statistically significant differences.

"Factors that influence mental health of university and college students in the UK: a systematic review","Worsening mental health of students in higher education is a public policy concern and the impact of measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 has heightened awareness of this issue. Preventing poor mental health and supporting positive mental wellbeing needs to be based on an evidence informed understanding what factors influence the mental health of students. To identify factors associated with mental health of students in higher education. We undertook a systematic review of observational studies that measured factors associated with student mental wellbeing and poor mental health. Extensive searches were undertaken across five databases. We included studies undertaken in the UK and published within the last decade (2010-2020). Due to heterogeneity of factors, and diversity of outcomes used to measure wellbeing and poor mental health the findings were analysed and described narratively. We included 31 studies, most of which were cross sectional in design. Those factors most strongly and consistently associated with increased risk of developing poor mental health included students with experiences of trauma in childhood, those that identify as LGBTQ and students with autism. Factors that promote wellbeing include developing strong and supportive social networks. Students who are prepared and able to adjust to the changes that moving into higher education presents also experience better mental health. Some behaviours that are associated with poor mental health include lack of engagement both with learning and leisure activities and poor mental health literacy. Improved knowledge of factors associated with poor mental health and also those that increase mental wellbeing can provide a foundation for designing strategies and specific interventions that can prevent poor mental health and ensuring targeted support is available for students at increased risk.","Campbell, Blank, Cantrell, Baxter, Blackmore, Dixon, Goyder","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13943-x","20220919","Mental wellbeing; Rapid review; Risk factors; Student mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37987,""
"General psychiatric symptoms among Bangladeshi people approximately one year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic","Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has had negative physical and mental impacts on people globally. The current study examined general psychiatric symptoms (fear, anxiety, depression, and insomnia) and loneliness, and their interrelationships and correlates among Bangladeshi individuals approximately 1 year after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. An internet-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1004 Bangladeshi people (51.8% male; mean age: 25.41Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.80; age range: 18-60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years). Data were collected using a semi-structured e-questionnaire including informed consent, socio-demographics, lifestyle measures, and psychometric tools assessing loneliness, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fear of COVID-19. Sizeable participants screened positive for loneliness (63.5%), anxiety (26.3%), depression (46.4%), and insomnia (50.7%). Considerable numbers of respondents also reported fear of COVID-19. In hierarchical regression analyses, loneliness, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fear of COVID-19 were associated with socio-demographic and lifestyle factors. Loneliness, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fear of COVID-19 were positively correlated with each other (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). In exploratory path analyses, anxiety, depression, and insomnia mediated the relationship between loneliness and fear of COVID-19. The findings indicate that many people in Bangladesh have experienced psychiatric concerns approximately 1 year after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Investigation into empirically supported interventions and their implementation is needed.","Banik, Islam, Ahmed, Koly, Mubarak, Rahman, Zhai, Sikder, Potenza","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04232-3","20220919","Anxiety; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Depression; Fear; Insomnia; Loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37988,""
"Life under stay-at-home orders: a panel study of change in social interaction and emotional wellbeing among older Americans during COVID-19 pandemic","Recent research has shown the mental health consequence of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, but longitudinal data are relatively scarce. It is unclear whether the pattern of isolation and elevated stress seen at the beginning of the pandemic persists over time. This study evaluates change in social interaction over six months and its impact on emotional wellbeing among older adults. We drew data from a panel study with six repeated assessments of social interaction and emotional wellbeing conducted monthly May through October 2020. The sample included a total of 380 White, Black and Hispanic participants aged 50 and over, of whom 33% had low income, who residing in fourteen U.S. states with active stay-at-home orders in May 2020. The analysis examined how change in living arrangement, in-person interaction outside the household, quality of relationship with family and friends, and perceived social support affected trajectories of isolation stress, COVID worry and sadness. While their living arrangements (Odds Ratio [OR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.95, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.87, 1.03) and relationship quality (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.94, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.82, 1.01) remained stable, older adults experienced fluctuations in perceived social support (linear Slope bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.42, s.e.Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, quadratic slope bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.50, s.e.Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.08, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, cubic slope bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.04, s.e.Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and increases in in-person conversations outside the household (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.19, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.09, 1.29). Living with a spouse/partner stabilized isolation stress (change in linear slope bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.16, s.e.Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.48, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05, in quadratic slope bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.62, s.e.Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.26, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05, and in cubic slopeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.09, s.e.Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) and COVID worry (change in quadratic slope bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.66, s.e.Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.32, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05 and in cubic slopeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.09, s.e.Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) over time. Individuals with better relationship quality with friends had decreased sadness over time (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.90, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.82, 0.99). Changes in social support were associated with greater fluctuations in isolation stress and COVID worry. During the pandemic, social interactions are protective and lack of stability in feeling supported makes older adults vulnerable to stress. Efforts should focus on (re)building and maintaining companionship and support to mitigate the pandemic's negative impact.","Lin, Zajdel, Keller, Gilpin Macfoy, Shaw, Curtis, Ungar, Koehly","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14103-x","20220919","COVID-19; Older Adults; Social Relationships; Social Support; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37989,""
"Naloxone administration by law enforcement officers in New York State (2015-2020)","The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the need for wide deployment of effective harm reduction strategies in preventing opioid overdose mortality. Placing naloxone in the hands of key responders, including law enforcement officers who are often first on the scene of a suspected overdose, is one such strategy. New York State (NYS) was one of the first states to implement a statewide law enforcement naloxone administration program. This article provides an overview of the law enforcement administration of naloxone in NYS between 2015 and 2020 and highlights key characteristics of over 9000 opioid overdose reversal events. Data in naloxone usage report forms completed by police officers were compiled and analyzed. Data included 9133 naloxone administration reports by 5835 unique officers located in 60 counties across NYS. Descriptive statistics were used to examine attributes of the aided individuals, including differences between fatal and non-fatal incidents. Additional descriptive analyses were conducted for incidents in which law enforcement officers arrived first at the scene of suspected overdose. Comparisons were made to examine year-over-year trends in administration as naloxone formulations were changed. Quantitative analysis was supplemented by content analysis of officers' notes (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2192). In 85.9% of cases, law enforcement officers arrived at the scene of a suspected overdose prior to emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. These officers assessed the likelihood of an opioid overdose having occurred based on the aided person's breathing status and other information obtained on the scene. They administered an average of 2 doses of naloxone to aided individuals. In 36.8% of cases, they reported additional administration of naloxone by other responders including EMS, fire departments, and laypersons. Data indicated the aided survived the suspected overdose in 87.4% of cases. With appropriate training, law enforcement personnel were able to recognize opioid overdoses and prevent fatalities by administering naloxone and carrying out time-sensitive medical interventions. These officers provided life-saving services to aided individuals alongside other responders including EMS, fire departments, and bystanders. Further expansion of law enforcement naloxone administration nationally and internationally could help decrease opioid overdose mortality.","Pourtaher, Payne, Fera, Rowe, Leung, Stancliff, Hammer, Vinehout, Dailey","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00682-w","20220919","EMS; Harm reduction; Law enforcement; Naloxone; Narcan; New York; Opioid overdose; Police; Prehospital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37990,""
"Characteristics of Tenants Who Delayed Rent Payments during Eviction Moratoria in 2020","This study examined the characteristics of US tenants who reported delaying rent payments during the eviction moratoria in 2020 in respond to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A nationally representative sample of 3393 US tenants was assessed from May to June 2020 during a period that eviction moratoria were issued across the country. In the total sample, 22.9% of US tenants reported they delayed paying rent because of the eviction moratoria. Tenants who delayed paying rent were nearly 7 times as likely to be at risk of eviction, more than 3 times as likely to endorse recent suicidal ideation, and 1.6 times as likely to report recent illicit drug use compared to tenants who did not delay paying rent. These findings highlight the health and social needs of tenants in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tsai, Fish, Schick","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-022-00684-w","20220919","Behavioral economics; Eviction; Financial literacy; Homelessness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37991,""
"Frontline Physician Perspectives on Their Experiences Working During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic physicians worked on the front lines, immersed in uncertainty. Research into perspectives of frontline physicians has lagged behind clinical innovation throughout the pandemic. To inform ongoing and future efforts in the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a qualitative exploration of physician perspectives of the effects of policies and procedures as well as lessons learned while caring for patients during the height of the first wave in the spring of 2020. A confidential survey was emailed to a convenience sample. Survey questions included demographic data, participant role in the pandemic, and geographic location. Eleven open-ended questions explored their perspectives and advice they would give going forward. Broad areas covered included COVID-19-specific education, discharge planning, unintended consequences for patient care, mental health conditions to anticipate, and personal/institutional factors influencing workforce well-being amid the crisis. We received fifty-five surveys from May through July 2020. Demographic data demonstrated sampling of frontline physicians working in various epicenters in the USA, and diversity in gender, race/ethnicity, and clinical specialty. Inductive thematic analysis. Four themes emerged through data analysis: (1) Leadership can make or break morale; (2) Leadership should engage frontline workers throughout decision-making processes; (3) Novelty of COVID-19 led to unintended consequences in care delivery; and (4) Mental health sequelae will be profound and pervasive. Our participants demonstrated the benefit of engaging frontline physicians as important stakeholders in policy generation, evaluation, and revision; they highlighted challenges, successes, unintended consequences, and lessons learned from various epicenters in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is much to be learned from the early COVID-19 pandemic crisis; our participants' insights elucidate opportunities to examine institutional performance, effect policy change, and improve crisis management in order to better prepare for this and future pandemics.","Gonzalez, Hossain, Peek","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-07792-y","20220919","COVID-19; crisis management; healthcare system; physician perspectives; stakeholder engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37992,""
"Burnout, quality of life and perceived patient adverse events among paediatric nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic","This cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study aimed to measure burnout, quality of life (QOL) and perceptions of patient-related adverse events among paediatric nurses amid the COVID-19 pandemic and assess the relationships between these scores and participants' demographic and work-related characteristics. The mental health of most nurses may severely suffer due to the significant adversities that they struggle with while they care for their patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental distress negatively affects nurses' relationships and work performance, which may adversely influence the quality of care and patient safety. A convenient sample of 225 Jordanian paediatric nurses completed a test batter comprising the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, the Brief Version of the World Health Organisation's Quality of Life questionnaire and the nurse-perceived patient adverse events' questionnaire. This study was prepared and is reported according to the STROBE checklist. Paediatric nurses reported high levels of burnout, low QOL and high occurrence of hospital-acquired infections. Participants' age and hospital/unit capacity were significantly associated with burnout and QOL. Personal traits, perceived salary insufficiency and hospital/unit capacity represent factors that aggravate burnout, lower quality of life and worsen perceived patient safety among paediatric nurses. Policymakers should promote nurses' mental integrity and patient safety by addressing issues of workload and financial sufficiency and by provide interventions aimed to increase nurses' resilience. Patients or public were not involved in setting the research question, the outcome measures, the design or implementation of the study. However, paediatric nurses responded to the research questionnaires.","Khatatbeh, Al-Dwaikat, Alfatafta, Ali, Pakai","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16540","20220919","COVID-19; adverse events; burnout; paediatric nurses; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-21","",37993,""
