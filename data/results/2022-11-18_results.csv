"The COVID-19 Pandemic Disrupted Both School Bullying and Cyberbullying","One-fifth of US high school students report being bullied each year. We use internet search data for real-time tracking of bullying pat-terns as COVID-19 disrupted in-person schooling. We first show that pre-pandemic internet searches contain useful information about actual bullying behavior. We then show that searches for school bul-lying and cyberbullying dropped 30-35 percent as schools shifted to remote learning in spring 2020. The gradual return to in-person instruction starting in fall 2020 partially returned bullying searches to pre-pandemic levels. This rare positive effect may partly explain recent mixed evidence on the pandemic's impact on students' mental health and well-being.

"Psychological adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic on health service providers: an online survey","BackgroundIn the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, health service providers (HCPs) suffered from mental health consequences such as depression, anxiety, fear, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study aimed to evaluate the adverse psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on HSPs at the Tabriz University of Medical Science, North West of Iran. An online survey was conducted to assess the psychological adverse effects of COVID-19 during the pandemic of COVID-19 from May 2021 to February 2022. Psychological adverse effects including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and fear were measured using valid instruments. Overall, 298 HSPs responded to the questionnaires. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression analyses with crude and adjusted ORs were used to estimate mental health adverse effects.ResultsThe overall prevalence of depressive symptoms, major depression disorder (MDD), anxiety, and probable PTSD were 58%, 9.1%, 61.7%, and 15%, respectively. The fear of COVID-19 scale (mean) was 17.6Â± 6.2. We found mental health adverse effects were higher in HSPs who worked in the treatment and health sections than HSPs in the support section. Having a history of mental disorder, HSP type (health and treatment), and female sex had a statistically significant association with MDD and depressive symptoms.ConclusionsMental health problems were high in HSPs. The study highlights the demand for support systems and appropriate interventions for improving HSPsâ€™ mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Somi, Mohammad Hossein, Fakhari, Ali, Azizi, Hosein, Barzegar, Habibeh, Norouzi, Sanaz, Aslrahimi, Vahab, Farahbakhsh, Mostafa","https://doi.org/10.1186/s43045-022-00253-6","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Middle East Current Psychiatry; JOUR(1), 29.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","",41172,""
"A training programme for community pharmacists to support people living with severe and persistent mental illness: Intervention mapping in the context of a pandemic","Objective: The Bridging the Gap Between Physical and Mental Illness in Community Pharmacy (PharMIbridge) randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to test the effectiveness of a pharmacist-led support service in improving medication adherence, and the physical and mental health of people living with severe and persistent mental illness compared to a standard medication review service. Method: Using the six-step intervention mapping (IM) framework, this paper describes the development and content of the PharMIbridge pharmacist training programme, an integral part of the RCT implementation, and continuous adaptations made to the process to keep pace with the evolving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in Australia. A Training Working Group comprising health educators, practitioners, mental health consumers and researchers, refined the programme objectives and assisted with developing content and troubleshooting issues related to training delivery for pharmacists randomised to the RCT intervention arm. Results: A 2-day training programme was developed, which included Mental Health First Aid, simulated patient role-plays, and four pre-recorded modules using lectures, demonstration case vignettes, role-play activities and discussion. The programme, co-facilitated by project team members and mentors (pharmacist and consumer educators), aims to enhance pharmacists' mental health literacy, skills and confidence and empower them to engage with this vulnerable population using a strengths-based approach. Pre- and post-training questionnaires and interviews will be used to evaluate the impact of the PharMIbridge training programme. Conclusion: The systematic stepwise method provided by the IM framework highlights the solution-focused approach adopted by the project team and characteristics including adaptability and resilience which enabled training development and implementation across four Australian regions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","McMillan, Sara S.; El-Den, Sarira, Oâ€™Reilly, Claire L.; Roennfeldt, Helena, Theodorus, Theo, Chapman, Justin, Bailey, Kylie, Crump, Keith, Collins, Jack C.; Ng, Ricki, Stewart, Victoria, Wheeler, Amanda J.","https://doi.org/10.1177/00178969221130461","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Education Journal;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","",41173,""
"Application of Informational Big Data in Case Study and Collection of Basic Educational Psychology","In the new situation of modernization, there is an influx of diverse social thinking. At the same time, coupled with the influence of COVID-19, which has swept the world, the ideological and psychological space of college students has been greatly impacted. In this context, the ideological and psychological health of college students is an important value for the education of college students. To be specific, as an important place for cultivating college students, colleges and universities should pay attention to students' thoughts and ideas from their hearts. In addition, colleges and universities should give full play to the role of educational psychology in colleges and universities and actively promote the synergistic development of all educational sectors in schools, so as to promote the realization of the goal of education in the new era. In recent years, a series of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and interpersonal sensitivity have become frequent among college students, and some have even developed suicidal ideation. This has a very serious negative impact on individuals, families, and society. Therefore, if the mental health problems of college students can be detected early, the relevant school departments and counselors can provide timely and targeted help to such students. At the same time, these at-risk students can receive early treatment, thus reducing the harm. As a result, it is quite valuable to find an effective method to identify students with mental health problems. Traditionally, researchers have used questionnaires to survey students about their mental health. However, this approach has the disadvantage of being easily concealed and inefficient. In recent years, researchers have begun to use weblogs to identify students with mental health problems, but this approach still has shortcomings. First of all, they still use questionnaires to obtain labels. In addition, students' psychological activities may not only be reflected in their online behavior but also in their other daily behaviors. Big data in higher education plays a crucial role in analyzing and identifying students with psychological abnormalities. As a result, this research mainly extracts the behavioral characteristics of students by cleaning and transforming a large amount of disorganized student school data based on the educational data collected from school cards, academic affairs systems, access control systems, and related business systems. What is more, this study further analyzes the differences in behavioral characteristics between normal and abnormal students through hypothesis testing and finally establishes a model to identify abnormal students and evaluate the results.","Nie, J.; Mo, J.

"Patientsâ€™perspectives, fears and willingness to take preventive measures during second lockdown of COVID-19 pandemic A study of NOGGO and EnGAGe Network","Introduction/BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge to healthcare system worldwide. Since December 2020 the COVID -19 vaccine is approved and available. Jet the vaccination rate and the acceptance differs between European countries. Understanding patientsâ€™ perspective and giving voice to their fears is of great importance to meet the new challenges in heath care system.MethodologyWe performed a survey among patients with gynecological cancer in 6 European countries between March and June 2021. The questionnaire included questions related to COVID-19 and exploring patientsâ€™ attitude towards preventive measures and the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) score. The survey was promoted by national advocacy groups and was carried out online or as hard â€“ copy version.ResultsWe collected 567 forms from 6 European countries. The median age of the participants was 61.3 in Denmark, 49.8 in Greece, 56.8 in Hungary, 61.2 in Poland, 56.4 in Turkey and 51.8 in UK. For only a small number of patients a change in the therapy plan due to COVID-19-Pandemic was necessary: 11.8% in Denmark, 21.4% in Greece, 12.5% in Hungary, 14.7% in Poland, 26.1% in UK. For patients of different countries the fear of cancer was greater as the fear of COVID-19. At time of the survey 65.4% in Denmark, 66.1% in Greece, 63.5% in Hungary, 47.8% in Poland, 24.7% in Turkey and 52.2% in UK have been already vaccinated and most were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The HADS Scores were borderline abnormal or abnormal and similar between different countries.ConclusionAmong gynecological cancer patients anxiety and fear of cancer progression was stronger than fear of COVID-19.

"Wait time until surgery in gynecological oncology: patient preference and experience","Introduction/BackgroundPatient perspective on treatment and aftercare in gynecological oncology has been getting more attention. However, there are no studies on patientâ€™s experience of wait time before surgery, which is especially relevant as wait times have increased during the COVID pandemic. In this patient preference study we investigated 1)how patients experience wait time;2)what wait time is acceptable;3)how it impacts quality of life.MethodologyMixed methods study design;combining a qualitative interview study with a questionnaire among women with gynecological cancer. We performed semi-structured interviews with 20 women about their experiences with and preferences regarding wait time. Using thematic analysis we found factors that impact wait time acceptability and based on this developed a questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered to 100 women who had undergone surgery for gynecological cancer in two tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands.ResultsWait time between first appointment and surgery was more than 4 weeks for 61% of patients. Wait time was considered too long by 77% of these patients compared to 39% of patients who waited less than 4 weeks (p=0.01). 31% of patients scored above the threshold for either anxiety or depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 63% of patients had sleeping problems and 37% of patients experienced pain frequently or most of the time. Patients spent less time on working (38%) and exercise (46%) and more time on time on relaxation (38%), with friends (27%) and educating themselves on their illness (40%).ConclusionWaiting for surgery is often stressful for gynecological oncology patients. Waiting over 4 weeks for surgery is considered too long by most patients. Patients reduced time working and exercising and increased time finding information on their illness. This study provides directions on how to improve quality of care the weeks before surgery from the patientâ€™s perspective.","van den Berg, Kim, Knegt, Anne, Ploum, Michelle, Fons, Guus, Lok, Christianne, Aarts, Annemijn","https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2022-ESGO.988","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Gynecological Cancer; JOUR(Suppl 2):A457-A458, 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","",41176,""
"Imagine-Id Longitudinal Study: Mental Health and Behaviour in a National Cohort of UK Children with Intellectual Disability of Genetic Aetiology","Background: IMAGINE is a national longitudinal study of behavioural problems and psychiatric risk in children with intellectual disability of known genetic origin. Our main aim is to compare the trajectory of development of mental health and behavioural difficulties experienced by participants, and the impact on their families, with data from U.K. national studies of typical children collected by identical instruments over the same time period. Method(s): IMAGINE participants (6-16 years) were initially recruited from U.K. NHS Genetic Services between 2015 and 2020. Caregivers (n = 804) completed the SDQ in 2015-2019 (T1) and again in 2021 (T2). Age-matched typical comparisons (2602) completed SDQs in 2017 (T1) and 2021 (T2). SDQ Total Difficulties change scores were calculated in both samples and algorithmically defined as indicating significant deterioration, no change or improvement. Result(s): IMAGINE participants had significantly higher rates of mental health and behavioural difficulties than comparison children at both T1 and T2, but proportionately more of the IMAGINE cohort improved (35.4 vs. 21.8%) and fewer deteriorated (24.4 vs. 39.2%) than in the national cohort (P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion(s): IMAGINE participants are more likely to have clinically significant mental health and behavioural difficulties than neurotypical children at all ages, but a follow-up into middle childhood and adolescence indicates a trend to improvement in children with intellectual disability of genetic aetiology and greater deterioration in neurotypical comparisons. Covid-19 may have differentially impacted the mental health outcomes of IMAGINE and typical children over this period.","Wolstencroft, J.; Housby, H.; Skuse, D.","https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12962","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Intellectual Disability Research; JOUR:675, 66(8-9).","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","",41177,""
"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma transformation mimicking a recurrence of colorectal cancer in a patient with multiple malignancies attributable to BRCA1 positivity","Introduction: Our knowledge of genetic contributions to malignancy risk has increased greatly over the past two decades. It is now known that BRCA1 gene mutation is associated with a 50% lifetime risk of developing malignancy.Women who carry a BRCA1 mutation have a 47-66% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, a 63% chance of developing cancer in the contralateral breast at 25 years, and a 35-46% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer.1,2 BRCA1 mutation carriers also have increased rates of pancreatic cancer (odds ratio [OR], 2.26), leukemia, and lymphomas (OR, 2.6).3,4 There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of BRCA1 mutation on a patient's risk of developing colorectal cancer, but it may increase the risk up to 1.5 times.5,6 Independent of known genetic syndromes, cancer survivors are 14% more likely to be diagnosed with a new malignancy than those who have not had a previous cancer.1 Patients with colorectal cancer at stage two or three have a 40% recurrence rate after primary therapy, with more than 90% of recurrences occurring within the first 5 years.7 Transformation of follicular lymphoma to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs in up to 24% of cases, although it is less common in patients who have achieved clinical remission. Overall, this improved knowledge has resulted in increased surveillance for recurrence and associated malignancies. Case report: A 77-year-old woman underwent colonoscopy after lymphoma surveillance screening incidentally revealed a positron emission tomography-avid cecal lesion. This was on a background of previous colorectal cancer, managed with a left hemicolectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in 1995. The patient was overdue for colonoscopy surveillance due to delays attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. She was asymptomatic, with no weight loss, fevers, or night sweats. She denied change in bowel habit, with daily motions without the presence of tenesmus, melena, or rectal bleeding. Her past medical history was also significant for known BRCA1 positivity, which was diagnosed following bilateral breast cancer, affecting the right breast in 1981 and left breast in 1991. This was treated with bilateral mastectomy and axillary dissection. The patient received prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in 2000. She previously had stage IIIa low-grade follicular lymphoma and received six cycles of bendamustine plus rituximab in 2018 and was considered in remission, with ongoing 6-monthly surveillance imaging. The patient's other medical conditions included metabolic syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteoporosis, depression, left lacunar infarct, epilepsy, and cataracts. Examination revealed a non-tender abdomen with central adiposity. There was no palpable abdominal mass or evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. She had a normal cardiovascular and respiratory examination. Colonoscopy showed a large two-thirds circumferential non-obstructing mass in the cecum. There was no evidence of bleeding, and the mass was biopsied. Histology showed that atypical lymphoid cells were present at an ulcer base with surrounding necrotic tumor cells. These cells were strongly positive for BCL2, CD45, CD20, and CD79a within the nodular lymphoid aggregate and negative for AE1/3 and CAM5.2. This appearance was consistent with a diagnosis of high-grade DLBCL. The patient had her care transferred to her hematologist, who confirmed a diagnosis of DLBCL and instigated six cycles of modified R-CHOP regimen for chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): This is a rare case of colorectal lymphoma and illustrates the well-documented risk of progression from follicular lymphoma to the more sinister DLBCL. It highlights the complexity of cancer genetics, justifies the increased need for malignancy surveillance within these groups, and confirms the importance of biopsy for all abnormal colorectal lesions.","Prudence, A.; Nutt, H.; Lavender, J.; Liang, H.

"Participation in Leisure Through Inclusive Online Activities in the Time of a Pandemic","Background and Objective(s): Participation of children with disabilities in leisure activities is a key determinant of their physical and mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has limited participation in leisure activities for all children and in particular for children with disabilities. As a result, they may be less active while feeling more isolated and stressed. Online communities and activities are taking on growing importance. Understanding how online activities include or exclude children with disabilities can contribute to developing inclusive communities that may support participation post-pandemic. The objective of this project is to identify aspects that contribute to creating online leisure activities that are inclusive for children with disabilities. Study Design: We adopted a qualitative descriptive interpretative methodology. Study Participants & Setting: We used a purposeful maximum representation sample to recruit two distinct groups of participants: (1) service providers offering inclusive online leisure activities;(2) parents of children with disabilities who had participated in online leisure activities during the pandemic. Interested participants were contacted via email to schedule an interview according to their preference, language, time, and accessibility options. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim for qualitative analysis. Materials/Methods: We conducted semi-structured conducted interviews with two groups of participants. The questions focused on the description of the online activities offered by the service provider (age range, frequency, cost, target population, type of activity offered) and any adaptations to make the online activities accessible to children and youth with disabilities. Result(s): Fifteen interviews were conducted. The features that could prevent or facilitate children's participation in online leisure activities were categorized based on the characteristics of activities, children and their families, and organizations. Activities that had flexible schedules, recorded and live options for joining, and required less attention from the caregivers were felt to be more inclusive. Access to technology resources and caregivers able to facilitate child engagement were crucial factors that need to be considered when offering online programs. Conclusions/Significance: This study identified important characteristics of inclusive online activities for children with disabilities. Considerations about the individual characteristics of children and their family setting is fundamental to make activities inclusive. General accommodations like flexibility and access to information about the program is necessary to generate the critical mass. Stakeholders' engagement in program elaboration may help creating more meaningful online environments. Financial and technology resources, variety of accessible activities and training of the facilitators to meet children's needs should be considered in every activity. The findings of this study can inform guidelines for the development of future inclusive online leisure activities.","Movahed, M.; Rue, I.; Yoo, P.; Sogomonian, T.; Majnemer, A.; Shikako, K.","https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.15356","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology; JOUR:130-131, 64(Supplement 4).","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","",41179,""
"Psychedelic ketamine therapy for treatment-resistant depression: A model for a sustainable future National Health Service treatment","Depression will be the leading cause of disease burden by 2030, with 25% of patients in the UK having treatment-resistant depression (TRD), often treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Ketamine has been shown to be a powerful, safe and cost-effective alternative to ECT when in the appropriate setting on an inpatient or outpatient basis [1], but is currently limited in its access on private and semi-private schemes, requiring expensive individual patient funding requests (IPFRs) if referred through NHS Wales. Description Patient P was a 56-year-old male veteran psychiatric inpatient at University Hospital Llandough (UHL) referred with intractable suicidality and cardiac conduction abnormalities from a previous suicide attempt that contraindicated ECT. Consent and Health Board approval was obtained for a three-session course of intravenous ketamine therapy in the ECT recovery suite (0.5-1 mg.kg-1 over 40 min) as it is fully staffed with resuscitation and anaesthetic equipment and an on-site 24/7 resuscitation team. A comprehensive protocol was authored and approved, which included preparation sessions, medical examination, administration of ketamine, and psychedelic psychotherapy sessions in the days in between. Only an anaesthetist and psychiatrist were directly present to follow Association of Anaesthetists monitoring standards, administer the infusion and observe. Minimising disturbances, an eye mask and noise-cancelling headphones with melodic music were used for patient comfort. P had profound psychedelic experiences without complications and the patient's suicidal ideation was ameliorated. P was discharged from hospital, gained employment and moved out-of-area to independent accommodation. Symptoms did not relapse until 6 months later, where further treatment was arranged via an IPFR. Discussion We demonstrated the safety, ease and efficacy in which this treatment could be delivered within the setting of the ECT suite. Within the Health Board, a business case is currently underway to create this service without anaesthetic support due to increasing pressures and rising incidence of depression following COVID-19. Further developments will include consideration of an intramuscular route (94% bioavailability, pharmacokinetic profile favourable for psychedelia, reduce additional training and equipment, minimise drug errors) and developing research and training opportunities. If we obtain long-term evidence of safety and efficacy, this model could be transplanted to other Health Boards to improve patient access and reduce disease burden.","Byford-Brooks, A.; Hoskins, M.","https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15829","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Anaesthesia; JOUR:12, 77(Supplement 4).","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","",41180,""

"Exploring multigenerational co-residence in the United States","Purpose This paper aims to investigate the increasing trend of multigenerational co-living in the USA and to research the socioeconomic and cultural determinants of such decision. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the 2017 American Housing Survey data to run descriptive and regression analysis. Findings The authors find household income appears consistently to be the most significant factor determining multigenerational co-residence decision across all household compositions. Latino households are most likely to co-reside with multiple generations, followed by Asian and African American households. Immigrants tend to live in multigenerational co-residential housing units with smaller sizes and more impoverished neighborhoods, but show greater flexibility in making residential arrangements once they gain better education. In addition, older householders or female householders are significantly more likely to co-reside with multiple generations. Living in metropolitan areas has no impact on co-residence choice, although some evidence suggests that multigenerational co-residential families tend to live in inferior neighborhoods. Research limitations/implications This study provides updated evidence on multigenerational co-residence choice in the contemporary United States. The findings provide evidence on how households make residential choices in response to financial hardships and contribute to the theoretical understanding of the variations of such decisions among immigrants and different ethnic and aging groups. Practical implications This study on multigenerational co-residence choice imposes important practical implications. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic creates ideal research setting to study how households cope with the tremendous uncertainties in the job markets and financial markets. Although multigenerational co-living may work well for some households with lower or moderate-income for financial reasons, it is not an attractive option for every family. Social implications Sharing a home with multiple generations can be challenging. Policymakers should design policies and programs to provide households with guidance on how to live peacefully in multigenerational settings and make multigenerational co-living an appealing and cost-effective housing option for American families of all means. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature by providing new evidence on the determinants of multigenerational co-residence decision. This study's findings are fundamental to guide policymakers in carrying out policies and programs aimed at providing a more appealing and cost-effective housing arrangement for American families. The evidence on the senior and minority subsamples are especially meaningful as the vast majority of the baby boom generation in the USA is aging and substantial growth is expected in multigenerational households over the next several decades. Understanding the increasing burden of old-age depression in aging societies will help policymakers prioritize public resources in city planning to address the needs of this rapidly growing population.","He, Wei, Jia, Shaomeng","https://doi.org/10.1108/ijhma-06-2022-0089","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Housing Markets and Analysis;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","",41182,""
"Wellbeing and doctoral candidature: the background and development of the importance to doctoral wellbeing questionnaire","Poor mental health in higher education settings is a worrying issue prompting the need to investigate the organisational and personal factors that impact mental health and wellbeing. Such information is integral to building a comprehensive picture of the doctoral learner. Drawing on prior research identifying what novice researchers perceive as important to their wellbeing, the Importance to Doctoral Wellbeing Questionnaire (IDWQ) was developed. Seven dimensions were identified in a pilot phase: â€˜Work-Life Balanceâ€™, â€˜Social-Collegialâ€™, â€˜Personal Research Confidenceâ€™, â€˜Futureâ€™, â€˜Researcher Identityâ€™, â€˜Supervisorâ€™, and â€˜Universityâ€™. The questionnaire was then administered nationally to a larger more diverse cohort of research candidates prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings clarify potential candidate vulnerabilities. The IDWQ can be used to focus institutional appraisal of programmes and policies to assist novice researchers to identify key concerns and manage learning contingencies.

"The Impact of Cyberbullying Victimization on Psychosocial Behaviors among College Students during the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Indirect Effect of a Sense of Purpose in Life","By drawing from positive psychology and general strain theory, this study examined whether a sense of purpose in life has an indirect effect between college students' cyberbullying victimization and their depressive symptoms, cyberbullying perpetration, and suicidal thoughts/behaviors. Data were collected from 314 college students (69.9% female) aged 18 to 24 and older from two universities in the Midwest and South-central region of the United States. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) identified that cyberbullying victimization was positively associated with depressive symptoms and cyberbullying perpetration. Moreover, cyberbullying victimization indirectly affected depressive symptoms through a sense of purpose in life. This study will emphasize the importance of fostering cyberbullied college students' purpose in life to college staff, administrators, faculty, and practitioners, and will provide them with strategies to develop campus-wide cyberbullying interventions for college students.","Lee, Jeoung Min, Choi, Hailey Hyunjin, Lee, Heekyung, Park, Jinhee, Lee, Jaegoo","https://doi.org/10.1080/10926771.2022.2136554","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment & Trauma;JOUR: 1-17,","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","",41184,""

"Evolution of India's PM25 pollution between 1998 and 2020 using global reanalysis fields coupled with satellite observations and fuel consumption patterns","General practice is to rely on ambient monitoring data for reporting and regulatory applications in air quality management. Based on data collated for 2021, Delhi ranked the most polluted capital city, and another 62 Indian cities are in the top 100 most polluted cities list (https://www.iqair.com). This path limits the scrutiny and evaluation only to the cities with a monitoring station, neglecting a large section of non-urban areas. In this paper, we present a summary of evolution of PM2.5 pollution in India between 1998 and 2020, using reanalysed ground-level PM2.5 concentrations estimated by combining satellite AOD retrievals with chemical transport model results from a GEOS-Chem-CEDS system, and subsequently calibrated to on-ground observations. Between 1998 and 2020, India's annual average PM2.5 values steadily increased across the country, Delhi remained the most polluted state in all the years, and total population complying with the annual ambient standard of 40 mu g m(-3) dropped from 60.5% to 28.4%. According to the GBD-MAPS program, 81% of PM2.5 pollution in India is sourced to fuel (coal, petrol, diesel, gas, biomass, and waste) combustion that supports daily activities in the fields of personal transport, freight transport, electricity generation, industrial manufacturing, cooking, heating, construction, road dust resuspension, and waste burning. We overlayed the pollution trend with fuel consumption and activity patterns to further explain this evolution. While the 2 month COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020 provides evidence to argue that the only way to achieve ""clean air"" is by (a) cutting emissions at all the sources and (b) cutting emissions regionally, some hard decisions are required to enable and sustain larger reductions across sectors to reach not only the national ambient standard, but also the WHO guideline of 5 mu g m(-3).","Guttikunda, Sarath, Ka, Nishadh","https://doi.org/10.1039/d2ea00027j","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Environmental Science: Atmospheres;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","",41186,""
"Budding Medical Professionals And Covid-19: The Impact Of Covid-19 On Mental Health And Medical Students","Due to the Novel Coronavirus Disease, medical education has transformed from a physical to an online-medium. The importance of physical education in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), where online education can be challenging there is a need to explore the factors that affect online education. This study assesses the perspective and mental health of students whose medical education has been impacted by the pandemic. An online-questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms from October-to-December 2020 through Google-Forms among medical students across Pakistan. Two grading-scales were used to score anxiety and depression. Descriptive statistics and a logistic regression analysis were used to identify factors associated with anxiety and depression among medical students. p&lt;0.05 was considered as significant. Data was analyzed using STATA v.15. Total of 433 medical students participated in the study where 68.1% had some form of depression and 10.9% had anxiety. Around 65%-participants disagreed with the preference for online-classes. Seventy percent agreed on ""Has the thought of the pandemic made you worry about your academic future"" being associated with COVID-19 related-depression (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.32-3.11). Multivariate analysis showed agreeing to ""COVID affected my educational performance"" was associated with anxiety (OR:1.45, 95%CI: 1.03-2.06) and depression (OR: 1.27, 95%CI: 1.03-1.56). Being part of the Low- and-Middle-Income Countries (LMIC), online-education itself becomes a challenge. Given the continued shutdown of universities across the country and the growing anxiety and depression amongst the students, adequate measures should be taken to help in coping up with the current challenge.","Afzal, Qamar, Dhillon, Bhura, Khan, Suriya, Siddiqui, Ali Khan, Abbas","https://doi.org/10.55519/JAMC-03-9572","20221116","COVID-19; Medical education; Medical students; Mental health; Humans; COVID-19; Mental Health; Students, Medical; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Anxiety; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-17","",41187,""
