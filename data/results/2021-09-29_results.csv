"Global Burden of Covid-19 Restrictions: National, Regional and Global Estimates","Abstract A large literature has documented the high global mortality and mental health burden associated with the current Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper, we combine newly collected data on subjective reductions in the quality of life with the latest data on Covid-19 restrictions to quantify the total number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to government imposed restrictions globally. Our estimates suggest a total loss of 2980 (95% 2764, 3198) million QALYs as of September 6th 2021, with the highest burden absolute burden in lower and upper middle income countries. QALY losses appear to be particularly large for closures of schools and daycares as well as restaurants and bars, and seem relatively small for wearing masks in public and closure of fitness facilities.","Guenther Fink; Fabrizio Tediosi; Stefan Felder","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.21.21263825","20210928","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18354,""
"Three states of stromal cells-solid, liquid, and aerosol-and innovative delivery methods not previously reported","Clinical applications of stromal cells obtained mechanically from adipose tissue are quite popular methods. However, generally accepted protocols still do not exist. In this study, three new delivery methods using different protocols are presented as innovative methods in accordance with an approach called ""Indication-based protocols."" In mechanical methods, before cutting the fat tissue with ultra-sharp blades, which we define as ""Adinizing,"" mixing it with different liquids such as saline or plasma provides the stromal cells in liquid form with high number and viability as a final product. At the same time, since stromal cells and extracellular matrix are preserved by mechanical methods, it was deemed appropriate to use the term total stromal cells (TOST) instead of stromal vascular fraction for this final product, unlike the product obtained with the enzyme. TOST can be combined with plasma and used for dermal filling in ""solid"" form. In addition to this filling effect, it will also cause a change in the tissue regeneratively. Finally, the stromal cells obtained from liquid can be applied clinically in aerosol form with the help of nebulizer. We believe that three innovative delivery methods can be used successfully in the treatment of many clinical situations in the future.","Copcu","https://doi.org/10.5999/aps.2021.00311","20210928","Adipocyte; COVID-19; Fibrin; Stromal cells; Stromal vascular fraction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18355,""
"Trends in suicidal ideation in an emergency department during COVID-19","This study aims to detail changes in presentations at a United States Emergency Department for suicidality before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. A retrospective chart review was conducted of all adult patients who presented to an ED with suicidality and underwent psychiatric consultation during the study period. The cohorts consisted of patients who presented between December 2018 - May 2019 and December 2019 - May 2020. Information was collected on demographics, characteristics of suicidality, reasons for suicidality and disposition. The first wave from March - May 2020 was examined, using a difference-in-differences design to control for factors other than COVID-19 that may have influenced the outcomes' trend. Immediately following the pandemic outbreak there was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of undomiciled patients represented in visits for suicidality (40.7% vs. 57.4%; p-value &lt;0.001). In addition, the proportion of patient visits attributed to social (18.0% vs. 29.2%; p-value 0.003) and structural (14.2% vs. 26.4%; p value &lt;0.001) reasons for suicidality increased. Conversely, the proportion of visits due to psychiatric symptoms (70.5% vs 50.0%; p-value &lt;0.001) decreased. Furthermore, patient visits were more likely to result in a medical admission (2.1% vs. 8.3%; p-value 0.002) and less likely to result in a psychiatric admission (68.4% vs 48.6%; p-value &lt;0.001) during the initial phase of the pandemic. COVID-19 was associated with increased ED presentations for suicidality among undomiciled patients, as well as greater likelihood of social and structural reasons driving suicidality among all visits.","Grossman, Fry, Sorg, MacLean, Nisavic, McDowell, Masaki, Bird, Smith, Beach","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110619","20210928","COVID-19; Emergency department; Homelessness; Interrupted time series; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18356,""
"Impact of Stress on Menstrual Cyclicity During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Survey Study","<b><i>Background:</i></b> The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced acute and persistent psychosocial stressors for many individuals, with emerging gender differences that suggest women may be at greater risk for poorer mental health outcomes. This may have unintended consequences for women's overall health and well-being, including disruptions to reproductive function as elevated stress is often associated with menstrual cycle irregularities. The objective of this study was to determine if and how the Covid-19 pandemic and its related stressors have impacted women's menstrual cyclicity. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> An online survey instrument designed to capture self-reported information on menstrual cycle changes and perceived stress levels was distributed between July and August 2020. A total of 210 women between the ages of 18-45 years met stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed the survey. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of the 210 respondents, more than half (54%) reported changes in their menstrual cycles. These included changes in menstrual cycle length (50%), the duration of menses (34%), and changes in premenstrual symptoms (50%). Respondents with high perceived stress scale (PSS) scores during Covid were more likely to experience a longer duration of menses (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and heavier bleeding during menses (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.028) compared with those with moderate Covid PSS scores. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> By uncovering a trend in increased menstrual cycle irregularities during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, this study contributes to our understanding of the implications that the pandemic may have on women's reproductive health.","Ozimek, Velez, Anvari, Butler, Goldman, Woitowich","https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2021.0158","20210928","Covid-19; menstrual cycle; perceived stress scale; reproductive health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18357,""
"Persistent Health Problems beyond Pulmonary Recovery up to 6 Months after Hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2; A Longitudinal Study of Respiratory, Physical and Psychological Outcomes","Data on longitudinal recovery after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 remain currently scarce, just as outcomes beyond 3 months follow-up. The aim of the study was to evaluate the sequelae up to 6 months after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, considering 1) the recovery of pulmonary function and radiological abnormalities, physical and mental health status, and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL); and 2) the predictors of the most clinically relevant sequelae. Patients were evaluated at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months after hospitalization with pulmonary function testing, radiological evaluation, and online questionnaires on physical and mental health status and HR-QoL. Outcomes were analyzed with repeated measurements analyses. Ninety-two patients were included; mean age 58.2Ã‚Â±12.3 years, and 58 (63.0%) males. The estimated percentage of patients with impaired FVC improved from 25% at 6 weeks to 11% at 6 months; for impaired diffusion capacity this percentage improved from 63% to 46%.. Radiologically ground glass decreased, but fibrosis persisted. The majority of patients (89.1%) still reported &gt;1 symptom 6 months after discharge. Fatigue decreased significantly over time (p=0.006). Nonetheless, fatigue remained present in 51% of the patients at 6 months. HR-QoL (nearly) normalized in most domains at 6 months, except for physical role functioning, with persistent fatigue and length of hospitalization as most important predictors. During the first 6 months after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 most patients demonstrated continuing recovery across all health domains, but persistent sequelae were frequent. Fatigue was the most frequent residual and persisting symptom up to 6 months after hospitalization, importantly impacting HR-QoL.","Hellemons, Huijts, Bek, Berentschot, Nakshbandi, Schurink, Vlake, van Genderen, van Bommel, Gommers, Odink, Ciet, Shamier, GeurtsvanKessel, Baart, Ribbers, van den Berg-Emons, Heijenbrok-Kal, Aerts","https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202103-340OC","20210928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18358,""
"Psychological, physical, and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital nurses","The study aim was to explore the physical, mental, and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Austrian nurses working in hospitals. The COVID-19 pandemic required nurses to work extremely hard and over long periods, which can have physical, psychological, and social consequences. This study was carried out using a qualitative descriptive design and data was collected through individual interviews using an interview guide. A qualitative content analysis was conducted taking both deductive and inductive approaches. Eighteen nurses (average age of 34.7 years) participated in the study. Their general attitude and feelings regarding working during the COVID-19 pandemic in the hospital setting were positive. Several behavioral changes in the nurses' daily working and private daily lives were reported. Psychological impacts included the fear of infecting someone at home, insomnia, and sadness. Headaches, diarrhea, muscle tension, skin redness, and increased sweating were identified as the most common physical impacts. In terms of social impact, all nurses mentioned social isolation and the increased use of (new) media. Working with people suffering from COVID-19 had psychological and physical effects on caregivers. Caregivers felt socially isolated in their private environments; however, they often compensated for this isolation by using social media. Staff perceived the provision of sufficient information, regular team meetings, and the employer's positive reinforcement as supportive, enhancing their feelings of security. We recommend providing more psychological support and making structural adjustments in daily clinical practice to counteract the negative effects of working during a pandemic.","HÃƒÂ¤ussl, Ehmann, Pacher, KnÃƒÂ¶dl, Huber, Neundlinger, Osmanovic, Plank-Straner, Walter, SchÃƒÂ¼ssler, Schoberer","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12716","20210928","health and safety; nursing; nursing policy; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18359,""
"Prevalence and severity of secondary traumatic stress and optimism in Indian health care professionals during COVID-19 lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the lacunae in the preparedness of healthcare systems across the globe. This preparedness also includes the safety of healthcare providers (HCPs) at various levels. Sudden spread of COVID-19 infection has created threatening and vulnerable conditions for the HCPs. The current pandemic situation has not only affected physical health of HCPs but also their mental health. This study aims to understand the prevalence and severity of secondary traumatic stress, optimism parameters, along with states of mood experienced by the HCPs, viz., doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals (including Physiotherapist, Lab technicians, Phlebotomist, dieticians, administrative staff and clinical pharmacist), during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. The assessment of level of secondary traumatic stress (STS), optimism/pessimism (via Life Orientation Test-Revised) and current mood states experienced by Indian HCPs in the present COVID-19 pandemic situation was done using a primary data of 2,008 HCPs from India during the first lockdown during April-May 2020. Data was collected through snow-ball sampling technique, reaching out to various medical health care professionals through social media platforms. Amongst the study sample 88.2% of doctors, 79.2 of nurses and 58.6% of allied HCPs were found to have STS in varying severity. There was a female preponderance in the category of Severe STS. Higher optimism on the LOTR scale was observed among doctors at 39.3% followed by nurses at 26.7% and allied health care professionals 22.8%. The mood visual analogue scale which measures the ""mood"" during the survey indicated moderate mood states without any gender bias in the study sample. The current investigation sheds light on the magnitude of the STSS experienced by the HCPs in the Indian Subcontinent during the pandemic. This hitherto undiagnosed and unaddressed issue, calls for a dire need of creating better and accessible mental health programmes and facilities for the health care providers in India.","K N, Parashar, Kumar, Verma, Rao, Y, K, A, T R, B N, K, S, K, Shivam, Kumar, Judith","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257429","20210928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18360,""
"Incidence, co-occurrence, and evolution of long-COVID features: A 6-month retrospective cohort study of 273,618 survivors of COVID-19","Long-COVID refers to a variety of symptoms affecting different organs reported by people following Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To date, there have been no robust estimates of the incidence and co-occurrence of long-COVID features, their relationship to age, sex, or severity of infection, and the extent to which they are specific to COVID-19. The aim of this study is to address these issues. We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on linked electronic health records (EHRs) data from 81 million patients including 273,618 COVID-19 survivors. The incidence and co-occurrence within 6 months and in the 3 to 6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis were calculated for 9 core features of long-COVID (breathing difficulties/breathlessness, fatigue/malaise, chest/throat pain, headache, abdominal symptoms, myalgia, other pain, cognitive symptoms, and anxiety/depression). Their co-occurrence network was also analyzed. Comparison with a propensity score-matched cohort of patients diagnosed with influenza during the same time period was achieved using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model. The incidence of atopic dermatitis was used as a negative control. Among COVID-19 survivors (mean [SD] age: 46.3 [19.8], 55.6% female), 57.00% had one or more long-COVID feature recorded during the whole 6-month period (i.e., including the acute phase), and 36.55% between 3 and 6 months. The incidence of each feature was: abnormal breathing (18.71% in the 1- to 180-day period; 7.94% in the 90- to180-day period), fatigue/malaise (12.82%; 5.87%), chest/throat pain (12.60%; 5.71%), headache (8.67%; 4.63%), other pain (11.60%; 7.19%), abdominal symptoms (15.58%; 8.29%), myalgia (3.24%; 1.54%), cognitive symptoms (7.88%; 3.95%), and anxiety/depression (22.82%; 15.49%). All 9 features were more frequently reported after COVID-19 than after influenza (with an overall excess incidence of 16.60% and hazard ratios between 1.44 and 2.04, all p &lt; 0.001), co-occurred more commonly, and formed a more interconnected network. Significant differences in incidence and co-occurrence were associated with sex, age, and illness severity. Besides the limitations inherent to EHR data, limitations of this study include that (i) the findings do not generalize to patients who have had COVID-19 but were not diagnosed, nor to patients who do not seek or receive medical attention when experiencing symptoms of long-COVID; (ii) the findings say nothing about the persistence of the clinical features; and (iii) the difference between cohorts might be affected by one cohort seeking or receiving more medical attention for their symptoms. Long-COVID clinical features occurred and co-occurred frequently and showed some specificity to COVID-19, though they were also observed after influenza. Different long-COVID clinical profiles were observed based on demographics and illness severity.","Taquet, Dercon, Luciano, Geddes, Husain, Harrison","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003773","20210928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18361,""

This study was conducted with 1071 children aged 6 to 17. Results showed that 49.9% of the participants had anxiety symptoms, 29.5% had depression symptoms, and 51.4% had irritability symptoms. Low age was a potential risk factor for anxiety symptoms. Female sex was a potential risk factor for anxiety and depression symptoms. A COVID-19 death in the family or environment was a potential risk factor for depression and irritability symptoms. Exposure to COVID-19 information on television and on the internet was a potential risk factor for anxiety, depression, and irritability symptoms.

"Moral Injury and Burnout in Health Care Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is predicted to increase burnout in health professionals (HPs), but little is known about moral injury (MI) in this context. We administered the Moral Injury Symptoms Scale for Health Professionals (MISS-HP) and the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory via online survey to a global sample of 1831 HPs in April and October 2020. Mean MISS-HP increased from 27.4 (SD, 11.6) in April to 36.4 (SD, 13.8) in October (p &lt; 0.001), with an accompanying increase in personal accomplishment (April: 4.7; SD, 3.1; October: 9.3; SD, 3.1; p &lt; 0.001) and no change in other burnout subscales. In April, 26.7% of respondents reported at least moderate functional impairment from MI, increasing to 45.7% in October (p &lt; 0.001). Predictors of MISS-HP included younger age and being a nurse. Odds of functional impairment were higher in respondents who were widowed, divorced, never married, or had direct experience caring for patients with COVID-19. COVID-19 has increased MI but not burnout in HPs; younger or unmarried individuals, nurses, and frontline workers may benefit from targeted outreach to reduce downstream effects of MI, depression, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder.","Mantri, Song, Lawson, Berger, Koenig","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001367","20210928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18363,""

"Aftermath of anti-police protests in Nigeria: Burden and predictors of psychiatric morbidity among protesters and non-protesters","Anti-police (#EndSARS) protests took place in October 2020 across several Nigerian cities, resulting in deaths, injuries and loss of property, but the psychological sequelae of these protests have not been studied. In a cross-sectional online survey, we collected data on psychiatric morbidity and potential risk factors from 426 Nigerian social media users, who self-identified as participants or non-participants in a recent anti-police protest. We found elevated rates of psychiatric morbidity, with worse outcomes for protesters compared to non-protesters (psychological distress [44.2% vs 29.8%], depression [26.0% vs 14.9%], anxiety [51.0% vs 29.8%], post-traumatic stress disorder [7.4% vs 1.8%], current substance use [11.2% vs 4.5%] and suicidal ideation [7.1% vs 4.4%], respectively). After adjusting for the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and previous mental health diagnosis, the predictors of poor mental health among non-protesters were being unmarried (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.4, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and low resilience (odds ratio rangeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.1-5.4, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03) while for the protesters, the predictors were low resilience (odds ratio rangeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.9-4.7, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), being from Northern Nigeria (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.7, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) or residing in Northern Nigeria (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.8, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03), being under-/unemployed (odds ratio rangeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.1-2.5, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04), holding the view that the protest was caused by the state of the economy (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), belief that the protest had a direct negative impact on the protester (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.3, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04) and willingness to participate in future protests (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.13, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02). We conclude that participating in the #EndSARS protest was associated with significant psychiatric morbidity. There is need to recognise and address the mental health sequelae of collective actions, and invest in programmes that build resilience and address socio-political determinants of mental health, especially with a focus on youth.","Ayinde, Atere, Ibeawuchi, Bello, Ogunkoya, Asafa, Abdulmalik","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211049332","20210928","#EndSARS; Nigeria; anxiety; depression; protest; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18366,""

"Anxiety and depression among nurses in COVID and non-COVID intensive care units","Frontline nurses dealing with the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic face various mental health challenges ranging from excessive stress and anxiety to severe depression. To study the comparative prevalence of anxiety and depression, and their contributing factors, between nurses working in intensive care units (ICU) with COVID-19 patients (COVID ICU) and nurses working in ICU with patients admitted for other reasons (non-COVID ICU). Quantitative comparative cross-sectional study. All frontline nurses working in COVID and non-COVID ICUs at a tertiary care university hospital in Nepal were included. The data were collected using Google Forms. The groups were evaluated and compared in terms of various relevant variables with self-designed socio-demographic questionnaire, the validated Nepali version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12). The response rate was 100%. Of the 99 nurses who met the inclusion criteria, three were excluded. Out of the 96 nurses included, psychiatric caseness was present in 82 (85.4%). There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of psychiatric caseness, anxiety, and depression between the COVID ICU and non-COVID ICU nurses (caseness of 90.4% vs 79.5%, PÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°.134; anxiety of 36.5% vs 27.3%, PÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°.587; and depression of 21.2% vs 9.1%, PÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°.214, respectively). Among the factors that could potentially lead to psychiatric caseness, anxiety, and depression, statistically significant differences were observed only in relation to sleep disturbances, confidence in caring for patients with COVID-19 and intentions to discontinue current job, all being significantly higher in COVID ICU nurses. Anxiety and depression are common in nurses working in both the COVID and non-COVID ICUs, although the difference is not statistically significant.

In this prospective multicentre cohort study, HR-QoL was assessed in 90 patients using the SF-36 questionnaire (36-item Short Form Health Survey), which consists of 8 health domains that can be divided into a mental and physical health component. Mental health symptoms including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorders were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 (PCL-5)Ã‚Â 3 months after COVID-19. Using descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analysis, we identified factors associated with impaired HR-QoL 3Ã‚Â months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients were 55Ã‚Â years of age (IQR, 49-63; 39% women) and were classified as severe (23%), moderate (57%), or mild (20%) according to acute disease severity. HR-QoL was impaired in 28/90 patients (31%). Younger age [per year, adjOR (95%CI) 0.94 (0.88-1.00), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.049], longer hospitalization [per day, adjOR (95%CI) 1.07 (1.01-1.13), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.015], impaired sleep [adjOR (95%CI) 5.54 (1.2-25.61), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.028], and anxiety [adjOR (95%CI) 15.67 (3.03-80.99), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were independently associated with impaired HR-QoL. Twenty-nine percent (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26) scored below the normal range on the mental health componentÃ‚Â of the SF-36 and independent associations emerged for anxiety, depression, and self-reported numbness. Impairments in the physical health componentÃ‚Â of the SF-36 were reported by 12 (13%) patients and linked to hypogeusia and fatigue. Every third patient reported a reduction in HR-QoL 3Ã‚Â months after COVID-19 diagnosis and impairments were more prominent in mental than physical well-being.","Rass, Ianosi, Zamarian, Beer, Sahanic, Lindner, Kofler, Schiefecker, Mahlknecht, Heim, Limmert, Sonnweber, Pizzini, Tymoszuk, Scherfler, Djamshidian, Kiechl, Tancevski, Seppi, Pfausler, Loeffler-Ragg, Helbok","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-021-02998-9","20210928","COVID-19; Mental health; Neuro-COVID; Quality of life; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18369,""
"Mental health and social support of caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD and other developmental disorders during COVID-19 pandemic","Previous studies showed that caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disorders had higher levels of parenting stress, anxiety and depression. In the present study, the author examined the caregivers' mental health and investigated the mediating role of social support between symptoms severity and parenting stress during COVID-19. During 20 March to 8 April 2020, 1932 caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD and other developmental disorders from China were enrolled to fill in a sociodemographic questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and Social Support Rating Scale. The author also collected children's disability severity symptoms and behavioral problems. The results showed that 46.01% of the caregivers reported symptoms of depression, 44.67% showed anxiety and 44.62% showed stress during COVID-19 pandemic. Fathers were found to get more subjective support than mothers (<i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Caregivers who had the highest educational attainment had the most social support (<i>P</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01). People who had the more household income showed the significantly lower levels of depression and anxiety (<i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). The caregivers' employment status during COVID-19 was found significantly related with their depression, anxiety, stress and social support (<i>P</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). This study has some limitations, such as it did not conduct the longitudinal analysis of variables before COVID-19. The findings showed that many caregivers experienced mental health problems during COVID-19.

"Examining the relationship between physical activity and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic across five US States","The objectives of this paper are to investigate: 1) how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced both physical activity practices and mental health status, and 2) to assess the relationship between the two. Our mixed-methods study draws on 4,026 online survey responses collected between April - September 2020 across five states (Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon and West Virginia). Logistic regression models were run for two outcome variables (physical activity and mental health status (measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress scale)). Researchers controlled for race/ethnicity, household income/size, gender, urbanicity, education, employment, use of government assistance and presence of chronic health conditions. Qualitative analysis was applied to open-ended survey responses to contextualize quantitative findings. Household income was significant in predicting difficulty maintaining pre-pandemic physical activity levels; pre-pandemic physical activity levels were associated with increased psychological distress levels during COVID-19; and race/ethnicity, income status and urbanicity were significantly associated with deteriorating mental health status and physical activity levels during COVID-19. Data suggests that a bi-directional, cyclical relationship between physical activity and mental health exists. Policy implications should include physical activity promotion as a protective factor against declining mental health.","Grocke-Dewey, Hardison-Moody, Haynes-Maslow, Maras, Webber, Andress, Houghtaling, Patton-Lopez, Shanks, Byker-Shanks","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101537","20210928","COVID-19; Mental health; Physical activity; Rural health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18371,""
"Does the joint prevention and control regulation improve the air quality? A quasi-experiment in the Beijing economic belt during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aims to clarify the correlation between air pollution of cities in Beijing Economic Belt from a time-varying perspective and estimate effects of joint prevention and control regulation of air pollution. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity. Based on daily data of air quality, we used TVP-VAR model and utilize the pandemic as a quasi-experiment to assess the policies. The results show air pollution in surrounding cities does influence Beijing's air quality, but the relationship has been weakening year by year, mainly due to industrial adjustment which have achieved progress on alleviating the path of air pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to implement joint regulation in areas with serious pollution. Specifically, the relationship between the air quality of Beijing and Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Tianjin decreased as the pandemic became worse. In contrast, there was no significant decline in Langfang and Baoding. So unlike Baoding and Langfang, industrial production increased relationships between air quality of Beijing and the other three cities, which highlights the validity of restrictions. However, restrictions implemented on Baoding and Langfang affect economic development but have little effect on Beijing's air governance. Therefore, joint regulation contributes to realizing sustainable cities, but more targeted policies should be formulated.","Tao, Wheiler, Yu, Cheng, Diao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103365","20210928","Beijing economic belt; COVID-19; Industrial transfer; Regional governance; TVP-VAR","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18372,""
"Behavioral Activation (BA) in the Management of Depression in an Adolescent with Down Syndrome in Dubai","Depression has been commonly treated with psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy for several decades. Ongoing research in the field has suggested promise for behavioral activation (BA), a form of psychotherapeutic intervention, as a means of increasing engagement in adaptive activities and developing skills to counter avoidance in individuals suffering from depression. In this case report, we present the treatment course of BA for an adolescent with Down syndrome (DS), presenting with depression. A multidisciplinary approach was utilized in developing a personalized management plan for the patient since the initial presentation. Sessions at the outpatient psychiatry clinic alternated between in-person visits and virtual ones, due to circumstances associated with physical distancing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents were included as integral parts of the management plan, and education, strategic implementation of BA, and barriers to care were discussed extensively to support the adolescent through the course of her treatment. Within 6 weeks of introducing BA, positive outcomes were noted in the patient, with the resolution of her clinical depression. In this report, we discuss BA further as a potentially effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with DS and intellectual disabilities.","Shadan, Almarzooqi, Sultan","https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/7112034","20210928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18373,""
"[COVID-19 Pandemic What have we learned?]","Since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in March 2020, we have learned a lot about the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and its role in pediatric pathology.Children are infected in a rate quite similar to adults, although in most cases they suffer mild or asymptomatic symptoms. Around 1% of those infected require hospitalization, less than 0.02% require intensive care, and mortality is very low and generally in children with comorbidities. The most common clinical diagnosis are upper or lower respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infection and, more seriously, multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Most episodes do not require treatment, except for MIS-C. Remdesivir has been widely used as a compassionate treatment and its role has yet to be defined.The newborn can become infected, although vertical transmission is very low (&lt;1%) and it has been shown that the baby can safely cohabit with its mother and be breastfed. In general, neonatal infections have been mild.Primary care has supported a very important part of the management of the pandemic in pediatrics. There have been numerous collateral damage derived from the difficulty of access to care and the isolation suffered by children. The mental health of the pediatric population has been seriously affected. Although it has been shown that schooling has not led to an increase in infections, but rather the opposite. It is essential to continue maintaining the security measures that make schools a safe place, so necessary not only for children's education, but for their health in general.","Calvo, Tagarro, EchevarrÃƒÂ­a, Colomer, Rosa AlbaÃƒÂ±il Ballesteros, Bassat, JosÃƒÂ© Mellado PeÃƒÂ±as","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpedi.2021.09.006","20210928","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; neonates; schools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18374,""
"Nationwide Survey of German Outpatient Gynecologic Oncology Practices during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Reactions to the First Wave and Future Perspectives","In the spring of 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 posed a substantial challenge for countries and their healthcare systems. In Germany, over 70% of all cancer patients are treated in an outpatient setting, so gynecologic oncology practices are the guarantors of optimal patient care. We developed a survey to evaluate the management of gynecologic oncology patients. The survey consisted of 38 questions and was sent to the members of the Berufsverband Niedergelassener GynÃƒÂ¤kologischer Onkologen in Deutschland e.V. (BNGO), a professional association of gynecologic oncologists in the outpatient sector in Germany. The survey was completed by 54 out of 133 (41%) gynecologic oncologists from 14 out of 15 (93%) federal states where the BNGO is represented. Facing the pandemic, popular measures were mask requirements (100%), restriction of access to practices (94%), increased number of disinfectant dispensers (85%), installment of panes of acrylic glass (76%), or spatial alterations (67%). For most patients the pandemic had no influence on prioritization of therapies (82%) or prescribed systemic treatments (87%). Despite an increase in perceived psychological burden among the staff (72%), 85% (45/54) of the practices were not offered any additional psychological support. As most cancer patients in Germany are treated in an outpatient setting, a suitable reaction of oncology centers to the new circumstances was crucial to secure optimal treatment and patient care. Nevertheless, the low prioritization of mental health or distress of healthcare workers poses a serious threat to the maintenance of optimal medical care in further waves of the pandemic.","Vu, SchrÃƒÂ¶der, DÃƒÂ¼lk, Stelmes, Vu, Schilling, FÃƒÂ¶rster, FÃƒÂ¶rster","https://doi.org/10.1159/000518858","20210928","Coronavirus disease 2019; First wave; Gynecologic oncology; Pandemic; Patient care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18375,""
"The mediating role of individual-level social capital among worries, mental health and subjective well-being among adults in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially induced worries and affected individual mental health and subjective well-being. Nonetheless, a high level of social capital could potentially protect individuals who suffer from mental health problems and thus promote their subjective well-being, especially under the social distancing policies during the pandemic. To this end, based on a random sample of 1053 Hong Kong adults, structural equation modeling was applied to study the path relationships between the worries of COVID-19, social capital, mental health problems, and subjective well-being. The study found that worries during the pandemic were associated with mental health and subjective well-being, through social capital as a mediator. Moreover, social capital exhibited a stronger influence on mental health and subjective well-being in the economically inactive group than in the economically active group. This study highlights the important role of social capital during the COVID-19 pandemic. While Hong Kong's COVID-19 response has primarily focused on disease prevention, it must be noted that social services and mutual-help activities are also crucial for people to withstand the crisis.","Chan, Chung, Chan, Woo, Yeoh, Chung, Wong, Marmot, Lee, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02316-z","20210928","COVID-19; Hong Kong; Mental health; Social capital; Structural equation modeling; Subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18376,""

"Intersectional tension: a qualitative study of the effects of the COVID-19 response on survivors of violence against women in urban India","There is a concern worldwide that efforts to address the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have affected the frequency and intensity of domestic violence against women. Residents of urban informal settlements faced particularly stringent conditions during the response in India. Counsellors spoke with registered survivors of domestic violence in Mumbai, with two objectives: to understand how the pandemic and subsequent lockdown had changed their needs and experiences, and to recommend programmatic responses. Qualitative interviews and framework analysis. A non-government support programme for survivors of violence against women, providing services mainly for residents of informal settlements. During follow-up telephone counselling with survivors of violence against women who had previously registered for support and consented to the use of information in research, counsellors took verbal consent for additional questions about the effects of COVID-19 on their daily life, their ability to speak with someone, and their counselling preferences. Responses were recorded as written notes. The major concerns of 586 clients interviewed between April and July 2020 were meeting basic needs (financial stress, interrupted livelihoods and food insecurity), confinement in small homes (family tensions and isolation with abusers) and limited mobility (power imbalances in the home and lack of opportunity for disclosure and stress relief). A major source of stress was the increased burden of unpaid domestic care, which fell largely on women. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the burden of poverty and gendered unpaid care. Finance and food security are critical considerations for future response, which should consider inequality, financial support, prioritising continued availability of services for survivors of violence and expanding access to social networks. Decision-makers must be aware of the gendered, intersectional effects of interventions and must include residents of informal settlements who are survivors of domestic violence in the planning and implementation of public health strategies.","Huq, Das, Devakumar, Daruwalla, Osrin","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050381","20210928","COVID-19; mental health; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18378,""
"Diabetes and the Risk of Long-Term Post-COVID Symptoms","This study investigated the association of diabetes in patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection with the presence of long-term post-COVID symptoms. A case-control study including individuals hospitalised during the first wave of the pandemic was conducted. Patients with a previous diagnosis of diabetes and under medical control were considered cases. Two age- and sex-matched patients without presenting diabetes per case were recruited as controls. Hospitalisation and clinical data were collected from hospital medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview. A list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically evaluated, but participants were invited to freely report any symptom. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sleep quality, respectively. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were constructed. Overall, 145 patients with diabetes and 144 non-diabetic controls who had recovered from COVID-19 were assessed at 7.2 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. The number of post-COVID symptoms was similar between groups (IRR1.06, 95%CI 0.92-1.24, P=0.372). The most prevalent post-COVID symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and pain. No between-groups differences in any post-COVID symptom were observed. Similarly, no differences in limitations with daily living activities were either found between patients with/without diabetes.

"COVID-19 Pandemic and Exercise (COPE) trial: a multigroup pragmatic randomised controlled trial examining effects of app-based at-home exercise programs on depressive symptoms","The number of adults across the globe with significant depressive symptoms has grown substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The extant literature supports exercise as a potent behaviour that can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in clinical and non-clinical populations. Using a suite of mobile applications, at-home exercise, including high intensity interval training (HIIT) and/or yoga, was completed to reduce depressive symptoms in the general population in the early months of the pandemic. A 6-week, parallel, multiarm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial was completed with four groups: (1) HIIT, (2) Yoga, (3) HIIT+yoga, and (4) waitlist control (WLC). Low active, English-speaking, non-retired Canadians aged 18-64 years were included. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and weekly following randomisation. A total of 334 participants were randomised to one of four groups. No differences in depressive symptoms were evident at baseline. The results of latent growth modelling showed significant treatment effects in depressive symptoms for each active group compared with the WLC, with small effect sizes (ESs) in the community-based sample of participants. Treatment groups were not significantly different from each other. Effect sizes were very large (eg, week 6 ES range=-2.34 to -2.52) when restricting the analysis only to participants with high depressive symptoms at baseline. At-home exercise is a potent behaviour to improve mental health in adults during the pandemic, especially in those with increased levels of depressive symptoms.

"Changes in Mental Health and Preventive Behaviors before and after COVID-19 Vaccination: A Propensity Score Matching (PSM) Study","Mass vaccination against the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing worldwide to achieve herd immunity among the general population. However, little is known about how the COVID-19 vaccination would affect mental health and preventive behaviors toward the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to address this issue among 4244 individuals at several COVID-19 vaccination sites in Guangzhou, China. Using univariate analysis and multiple linear regression models, we found that major demographic characteristics, such as biological sex, age, education level, and family per capita income, are the dominant influencing factors associated with health beliefs, mental health, and preventive behaviors. After propensity score matching (PSM) treatment, we further assessed the changes in the scores of health belief, mental health, and preventive behaviors between the pre-vaccination group and the post-vaccination group. When compared to individuals in the pre-vaccination group, a moderate but statistically significant lower score was observed in the post-vaccination group (<i>p</i> = 0.010), implying possibly improved psychological conditions after COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, there was also a moderate but statistically higher score of preventive behaviors in the post-vaccination group than in the pre-vaccination group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), suggesting a higher probability to take preventive measures after COVID-19 vaccination.

HLS-COVID-Q22 and Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy were found with satisfactory construct validity (items loaded on one component with factor loading values range 0.57 to 0.81, and 0.51 to 0.78), satisfactory convergent validity (item-scale correlations range 0.60 to 0.79, and 0.65 to 0.74), high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96 and 0.90), and without floor or ceiling effects (percentages of possibly lowest score and highest score &lt;15%), respectively. Low scores of vaccine hesitancy were found in male principals (regression coefficient, B, -0.69; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI, -1.29, -0.10; <i>p</i> = 0.023), principals with better well-being (B, -0.25; 95%CI, -0.47, -0.03; <i>p</i> = 0.029), and higher HLS-COVID-Q22 (B, -1.22; 95%CI, -1.89, -0.54; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). HLS-COVID-Q22 and Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy were valid and reliable tools. Male principals and those with better well-being, and higher health literacy had a lower level of vaccine hesitancy. Improving principals' health literacy and well-being is suggested to be a strategic approach to increase vaccine acceptance for themselves, their staff, and students.","Duong, Lin, Chen, Huang, Okan, Dadaczynski, Lai","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9090985","20210928","COVID-19; Oxford COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy; Taiwan; coronavirus-related health literacy; depression; employer; gender; school principal; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18384,""
"Recovery Focused Nutritional Therapy across the Continuum of Care: Learning from COVID-19","Targeted nutritional therapy should be started early in severe illness and sustained through to recovery if clinical and patient-centred outcomes are to be optimised. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shone a light on this need. The literature on nutrition and COVID-19 mainly focuses on the importance of nutrition to preserve life and prevent clinical deterioration during the acute phase of illness. However, there is a lack of information guiding practice across the whole patient journey (e.g., hospital to home) with a focus on targeting recovery (e.g., long COVID). This review paper is of relevance to doctors and other healthcare professionals in acute care and primary care worldwide, since it addresses early, multi-modal individualised nutrition interventions across the continuum of care to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes. It is of relevance to nutrition experts and non-nutrition experts and can be used to promote inter-professional and inter-organisational knowledge transfer on the topic. The primary goal is to prevent complications and support recovery to enable COVID-19 patients to achieve the best possible nutritional, physical, functional and mental health status and to apply the learning to date from the COVID-19 pandemic to other patient groups experiencing acute severe illness.","Cereda, ClavÃƒÂ©, Collins, Holdoway, Wischmeyer","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13093293","20210928","COVID-19; enteral nutrition; individualised care; malnutrition; muscle loss; oral nutritional supplement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18385,""
"Vertical Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: A Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews","The COVID-19 pandemic has hugely impacted global public health and economy. The COVID-19 has also shown potential impacts on maternal perinatal and neonatal outcomes. This systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence from existing systematic reviews about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections on maternal perinatal and neonatal outcomes. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, from 1 December 2019 to 7 July 2021, for published review studies that included case reports, primary studies, clinical practice guidelines, overviews, case-control studies, and observational studies. Systematic reviews that reported the plausibility of mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 (also known as vertical transmission), maternal perinatal and neonatal outcomes, and review studies that addressed the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy were also included. We identified 947 citations, of which 69 studies were included for further analysis. Most (&gt;70%) of the mother-to-child infection was likely due to environmental exposure, although a significant proportion (about 20%) was attributable to potential vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Further results of the review indicated that the mode of delivery of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not increase or decrease the risk of infection for the newborns (outcomes), thereby emphasizing the significance of breastfeeding. The issue of maternal perinatal and neonatal outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to worsen during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, increasing maternal and neonatal mortality, stillbirth, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and maternal depression. Based on this study, we observed increasing rates of cesarean delivery from mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 could be potentially transmitted vertically during the gestation period. However, more data are needed to further investigate and follow-up, especially with reports of newborns infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to examine a possible long-term adverse effect.","Musa, Bello, Zhao, Abdullahi, Lawan, He","https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091877","20210928","COVID-19; pandemic; pregnancy; systematic review; vertical transmission","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18386,""
"Relationship between the Severity of Anxiety Symptoms, Aggression and Alcohol Consumption during the COVID-19 Pandemic Period","<i>Background and objectives</i>: There have been many reports of mental health in the pandemic period. The research conducted so far has indicated an increase in the severity of anxiety and aggression and an escalation of alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the severity of anxiety, the amount of alcohol consumed and the severity of aggression. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A total of 538 Polish residents-413 women (76.77%) and 125 men (23.23%)-participated in the study via an online survey. It included socio-demographic parameters and psychological scales: AUDIT-to determine the model of alcohol consumption, GAD-7-to measure the severity of anxiety and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. <i>Results</i>: There was a correlation between the severity of anxiety and generalized aggression, and its two components-anger and hostility-in the entire study group. Moreover, relations were found between the intensity of alcohol consumption and generalized aggression and its components-anger and verbal and physical aggression. Those relationships turned out to be gender specific. The increased anxiety intensity affected the pattern of alcohol consumption and the severity of aggression. <i>Conclusions</i>: Psychotherapeutic and psychoeducational interactions and some elements of psychiatric treatment should aim at reducing the severity of anxiety in society, and thus minimizing the health and social consequences-aggressive behaviour and excessive alcohol consumption.","Florek, DÃ„â„¢bski, Piegza, Gorczyca, Pudlo","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57090959","20210928","COVID-19; aggression; alcohol drinking; anxiety; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18387,""
"Changes in Health Perception among Patients with Aortic Diseases in a Severe COVID-19 Area in the West of Germany: A Longitudinal Study between the First and Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<i>Background and Objectives:</i> The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become the most challenging global health pandemic since the 1918 flu. In Germany, more than 3.4 million cases are confirmed so far, including 83,000 deaths. Increased fatality rates among patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent this group at particular risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in health perception among patients with aortic diseases during the first (w1) and second wave (w2) of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. <i>Material and Methods:</i> Patients (<i>n</i> = 262) diagnosed with aortic disease participated in telephone interviews during w1 and w2. The perception of COVID-19 as a threat was examined using relevant items of the Brief Illness Perception (BIP) questionnaire. <i>Results:</i> The BIP score increased from 9.18 (SD = 7.132) to 14.58 (SD = 6.956) between w1 and w2 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Although this population is at high risk their overall perception of COVID-19 as a threat was low in the beginning, but surged during w2.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Emergency on Life Activities and Delivery of Healthcare Services in the Elderly Population","Due to the prevailing pandemic of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, we are experiencing emotional and social isolation, which negatively affects mental and physical health, particularly among the elderly population. In this study, we performed a cross-sectional analysis based on computer-assisted telephone interviews of 500 Polish adults aged 60 years or older in order to determine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the older population's behavior, life activity, and delivery of healthcare services. According to our study, COVID-19 infection entailed a substantial change in older people's behavior. Over 50%, nearly 80%, and more than 25% of the surveyed participants reduced their social, recreational, and professional activities, respectively. The most significant change in senior's behavior due to the fear of COVID-19 infection was observed in patients (1) with cardiac and pulmonary problems, (2) being on multi-drug therapy, (3) vaccinated against influenza, and (4) with several mental difficulties including loneliness, social isolation, and depression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 10% of participants canceled planned hospitalization due to the fear of COVID-19 infection. This was observed primarily in patients suffering from chronic heart and lung diseases, vaccinated against influenza, exhibiting the reluctance to carry out more complex daily activities, and with a higher level of anxiety, social loneliness, and malnutrition. Thus, these groups of seniors require more attention; hence, we propose telemedicine as a strategy directed to them that provides clinical healthcare and information regarding measurements, control, and protection against SARS-CoV-2 during the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. We believe this strategy may improve treatment outcomes, reduce comorbidities-related complications and unnecessary hospitalizations.","Agrawal, Makuch, DrÃƒÂ³Ã…Â¼dÃ…Â¼, Strzelec, SobieszczaÃ…â€žska, Mazur","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10184089","20210928","elderly population; fear of COVID-19; quality of life; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18389,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Eye Care in Spain during the First Phase of the Pandemic","The declaration of the first state of alarm for COVID-19 in March 2020 provoked changes in ophthalmological care. The objective of this study was to assess its impact on reorganising care activities, the mental health of ophthalmologists and the training of residents. We sent an anonymous online questionnaire between August and October 2020 to consultant ophthalmologists and residents who were active during the state of alarm in Spain. We used Google Forms<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> software for data collection. We analysed responses according to the degree of regional impact. We received a total of 328 responses from the 17 Autonomous Communities. We saw that 99.4% of respondents changed their work activities with 50% reductions in surgery (94.5%) and consultations (93.0%). Furthermore, 58.8% of respondents reported increased anxiety, and 29.9% transferred to support other services, with this number reaching 49.6% in the hardest-hit regions. Training programs were greatly reduced in external consultations (90.7%), and surgical training was completely cancelled (100%). Additionally, 56.5% of trainees wanted to prolong their residence periods. The first wave of the pandemic produced significant changes in ophthalmology services, and these changes were more pronounced in the most affected regions. It caused a negative psychological impact on a high rate of respondents and an interruption of the training of ophthalmology residents. Predictably, the negative consequences of this delay in ophthalmological care on patients will be uneven between regions.","RodrÃƒÂ­guez-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Varela-Agra, PÃƒÂ©rez-RoldÃƒÂ¡n, ÃƒÂlvarez-Reguera, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Reglero, Campo-Gesto","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10184087","20210928","COVID-19; Spain; coronavirus; mental health; ophthalmology; residency program","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18390,""
"The Effect of Primary and Middle School Teachers' Problematic Internet Use and Fear of COVID-19 on Psychological Need Thwarting of Online Teaching and Psychological Distress","Problematic Internet use (PIU) is a risk factor for psychological distress during COVID-19, as teachers are a psychologically vulnerable population. We explored the role of PIU in terms of primary and middle school teachers' fear of COVID-19 and psychological need thwarting (PNT) of online teaching. We empirically evaluated the relationships among these research variables in explaining teachers' psychological distress during COVID-19. Online survey data were collected from 9030 teachers. A high proportion of participants demonstrated psychological distress: depression (20.4%), anxiety (26.4%), and stress (10.2%). Structural equation modeling was used to test our proposed conceptual model, wherein PIU behaviors served as predictors, mediated by fear of COVID-19 and PNT of online teaching, for teachers' psychological distress. With ideal model fit, the results of the path coefficients indicated that PIU behaviors were associated with fear of COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); fear of COVID-19 and PNT of online teaching were associated with psychological distress (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); and fear of COVID-19 was also positively associated with PNT of online teaching (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). PSU and PSMU had an indirect positive effect on psychological distress through the mediator of fear of COVID-19 and PNT of online teaching. As such, we suggest that school administrators pay greater attention to teachers' psychological needs through efforts to enhance teachers' autonomy and relatedness from interpersonal relationships, alleviating PNT of online teaching. Our PNT of online teaching scale may also serve as a contribution for further research and practice.","Yi, Chen, Lin, Li, Liao, Wei, Gamble","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091199","20210928","COVID-19; online survey; online teaching; primary and middle school teachers; problematic internet use; psychological distress; psychological need thwarting; structural equation modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18391,""
"Resilience, Psychological Well-Being and Daily Functioning Following Hospitalization for Respiratory Distress Due to SARS-CoV-2 Infection","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's psychological well-being, and hospitalized patients could face an even greater risk of psychological distress. We aimed to study resilience in recovered COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge. We recruited 50 patients (38 males, aged 28-77) who were hospitalized for COVID-19 between March and April 2020. Participants underwent a psychological assessment 5 months after hospital discharge. We administered the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-25), Beck's Depression inventory-II (BDI-II), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Y-form (STAI). We also evaluated the impact of persisting physical, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms on resilience. Patients reported low resilience in the months following hospital discharge (CD-RISC-25 score [mean Ã‚Â± SD] = 55.82 Ã‚Â± 20.76), compared to data from studies on the general population. Lower resilience was associated with mood disturbances in the months following clinical recovery (<i>p</i> = 0.005), persisting fatigue (<i>p</i> = 0.015), sleep changes (<i>p</i> = 0.046), and subjective cognitive complaints (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Recovered COVID-19 patients exhibit low resilience following hospital discharge, which affects psychological well-being. The presence of persisting symptoms following hospital discharge affects psychological resilience. Interventions tailored to increase resilience should be considered to improve quality of life for recovered COVID-19 patients.","Dini, Poletti, Tagini, Reitano, Allocco, Mazzocco, Pravettoni, Dell'Osso, Monforte, Centanni, Priori, Ferrucci","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091161","20210928","COVID-19; persisting symptoms; psychological well-being; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18392,""
"The Economic and Psychological Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on Indian Migrant Workers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the working environment, occupation, and living style of billions of people around the world. The severest impact of the coronavirus is on migrant communities; hence, it is relevant to assess the economic impact and mental status of the Indian migrants. This study is quantitative in nature and based on a sample survey of 180 migrant workers. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, dependent sample <i>t</i>-test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient were utilized to analyze the surveyed data. The findings of the study reveal, through the working experience of the migrants, that new international migration has reduced due to lockdown and international travel restrictions. It was also reported that the majority of the migrants worked less than the normal working hours during the lockdown, causing a reduction of salary and remittances. Chi-square test confirms that the perceptions of migrants towards the COVID-19 management by the government were significantly different in opinion by different occupation/profession. Majority of the sampled migrants reported the problem of nervousness, anxiety, and depression; however, they were also hopeful about the future. The psychological problem was severe for the migrants above the age of 40, not educated, and with a higher number of family members. Subsequently, the policy implications from the findings of the research can draw attention of the policy makers towards protective measures which need to be implemented to support migrants during the ongoing pandemic. The government should take some necessary steps, such as a financial benefit scheme, to overcome the problems in the reduction of migrant earnings and remittances. The government should not focus only on vaccination and physical fitness of the migrants but also need to find out the cure of the psychological impact arising during the pandemic.","Khan, Khan, Illiyan, Khojah","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091152","20210928","COVID-19; economic and psychological impacts; employment status; migrants; migrantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perception; pandemic; remittances; sample survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18393,""

For this proposal, an interview was carried out in a sample of 245 participants who volunteered to participate in the study. The sample was divided into Spanish non-migrants, Spanish migrants, non-Spanish migrants and refugees. Attitudes towards COVID-19, resilience (based on BRCS) and mental health (based on DASS-21) were measured. The results obtained can be described as follows: (i) Migrant participants indicated worse mental health than non-migrants, and within the migrant group, refugees presented worse scores; (ii) No differences were found in attitudes towards COVID-19 in any of the subgroups; (iii) A moderating effect of group was found for the relationship between resilience and mental health but not between resilience and fear of COVID-19.

"Putting into Words the COVID-19 Lockdown Experience: Psychological Symptoms and the Referential Process","The coronavirus pandemic is a unique collective event which has affected the physical and psychological health of all individuals. Restrictions imposed by governments to counteract this situation have represented risk factors for developing psychopathological symptoms. This study aims to explore the relationship between psychological symptoms and the referential process (RP).

Different linguistic measures of the RP were applied to the narratives. The logical functions expressed through written narratives (The Italian Reflection Dictionary score, IREF) showed significant positive correlations with the SCL-90-R General Score Index (GSI) and different SCL-90-R subscales (depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsiveness, interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and paranoid ideation). On the contrary, the reorganization and reflection function related to emotional events (The Italian Weighted Reflection and Reorganization List score, IWRRL) showed significant negative correlations with the SCL-90-R's GSI and different subscales (obsessive-compulsiveness, depression, anxiety). The results highlight the relationship between psychological symptoms and complex defense mechanisms based on the intellectualization of negative emotions and a positive strategy of reorganization based on emotional elaboration.

"The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study on the Emotional-Behavioral Sequelae for Children and Adolescents with Neuropsychiatric Disorders and Their Families","This study aimed to investigate the immediate and short-term impact of the pandemic on the psychological well-being of Italian children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders and their families. Overall, 56 patients aged 6-18 (M = 13.4 years, SD = 2.77) and their parents were evaluated during the COVID-19 lockdown (T0) and after 4 months (T1). An ad hoc data sheet, Youth Self-Report 11-18 (YSR), Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 (CBCL), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were administered. Patients, mainly suffering from internalizing disorders, overall demonstrated a good adaptation to the pandemic context. Moreover, patients with behavioral disorders showed a greater psychological discomfort at both T0 and T1 compared to patients with internalizing disorders. Over time, patients presented an improvement on the emotional side, as proven by a significant decrease in internalizing and post-traumatic stress problems. Finally, no significant differences were found in the emotional-behavioral profile of patients according to the means of conducting neuropsychiatric interventions during the lockdown (i.e., in person/remotely/interrupted), thus allowing us to exclude important negative effects caused by the transition to remote therapy. Concerning parents, an inverse relationship emerged between the DASS-21 scores and the level of resilience, which therefore represents a protective factor against psychological maladjustment. Over time, an improvement in the psychological well-being of parents was observed, as shown by a significant decrease in mothers' anxiety and fathers' stress.","Raffagnato, Iannattone, Tascini, Venchiarutti, Broggio, Zanato, Traverso, Mascoli, Manganiello, Miscioscia, Gatta","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189880","20210928","COVID-19; children and adolescents; mental health disease; parenting; psychiatric outpatients; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18397,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 Mitigation Measures on Alcohol Consumption and Binge Drinking in College Students: A Longitudinal Survey","To ""flatten the curve"" of COVID-19 contagion, several countries ordered lockdowns amid the pandemic along with indications on social distancing. These social isolation measures could potentially bring alterations to healthy behavior, including to alcohol consumption. However, there is hardly any scientific evidence of the impact of such measures on alcohol consumption and binge drinking (BD) among young adults, and how they relate to alcohol craving, stress, anxiety, and depression levels. We addressed these questions by conducting a longitudinal study with 146 Portuguese college students-regular binge drinkers (regular BDs), infrequent binge drinkers (infrequent BDs) and non-binge drinkers (non-BDs)-in three moments: before the pandemic (Pre-Lockdown), during lockdown (Lockdown) and 6 months after (Post-Lockdown). Results revealed that regular BDs decreased alcohol use during Lockdown, a change in behavior that was even greater during Post-Lockdown, when regular BDs displayed similar levels of consumption to infrequent/non-BDs. Additionally, alcohol craving and living with friends were predictive of alcohol use during Lockdown, whereas stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms did not contribute to explain changes in drinking behavior. Collectively, the results suggest that BD in young Portuguese college students can be stopped when the contexts in which alcohol intake usually takes place are suppressed, which may have important implications for future prevention and intervention strategies.","Vasconcelos, Crego, Rodrigues, Almeida-Antunes, LÃƒÂ³pez-Caneda","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189822","20210928","COVID-19; alcohol; alcohol craving; anxiety; binge drinking; college students; depression; pandemic; stress; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18398,""

The present study examined the factors related to the poor general mental health state of the caregivers of children with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) difficulties of caregivers in asking their child to adopt protective behaviors against COVID-19, (2) difficulties of caregivers in managing the child's daily performance, and (3) worsened psychological symptoms in children. In total, 161 caregivers completed an online questionnaire to provide data regarding their general mental health state and difficulties in asking their child with ADHD to adopt protective behaviors against COVID-19 and in managing the child's after-school learning, sleep routine, and internet use, as well as worsened psychological symptoms. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that caregivers' difficulties in managing ADHD children's self-protective behaviors and after-school learning and the children's worsened emotional symptoms were significantly associated with poor caregiver general mental health state. An intervention that enhances the mental health of caregivers of children with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic by addressing their difficulties in managing the children's behaviors and psychological problems is warranted.","Tseng, Tsai, Chen, Hsiao, Chou, Yen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189745","20210928","COVID-19; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; caregiver; infectious disease; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18399,""
"Psychological Vulnerability of French University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Four-Wave Longitudinal Survey","Many studies have highlighted the negative mental health consequences of lockdowns. However, to date, we do not know how these consequences change over time. The first objective of the present study was to track changes in adjustment strategies and clinical issues among French university students at different times of the pandemic. The second objective was to investigate the psychological and situational factors contributing to students' anxiety and depressive symptoms. This cohort study was conducted between 23 April and 11 December 2020. Measurements were performed four times: during France's first national lockdown, during the period after lockdown, when universities were open, and finally during the second national lockdown. A total of 1294 university students were initially included, and 91 students completed the four measurement points over a 7-month period. Coping strategies (with the Brief-COPE), health concerns (with two questions), anxiety and depressive symptoms (with the HADS) were measured. Results showed an evolution over time of anxiety (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 21.59 ***) and depressive (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 29.73 ***) symptoms. Depressive symptoms are significantly higher during lockdown periods compared to unlockdown periods. Anxiety symptoms are likewise particularly high during the two lockdowns, but also when the universities reopen. At different times, anxiety and depressive symptoms were positively associated with maladaptive strategies, such as the self-blame (rho between 0.33 and 0.51) and negatively with adaptive strategies, such as the positive reframing (rho between -0.23 and -0.44). The trajectory of anxiety, which is elevated even in the absence of lockdown, raises concerns about the long-term effects of the pandemic on these symptoms.","Charbonnier, Le Vigouroux, Goncalves","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189699","20210928","COVID; anxiety; coping; depression; lockdowns; university","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18400,""
"The Association between Lifestyle Changes and Psychological Distress during COVID-19 Lockdown: The Moderating Role of COVID-Related Stressors","The COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying circumstances (lockdown and social distancing) have been found to cause lifestyle habit changes. While negative changes (adopting risky behaviors) are known to be associated with high psychological distress, the effect of positive changes (adopting health-enhancing behaviors) has yet to be investigated. This study examined the association between the nature of changes and psychological distress, in addition to the moderating effect of ""COVID-related stressors"". Online questionnaires, completed by 1969 participants, assessed the following: lifestyle changes due to COVID-19 with regard to cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, sleep quality, and eating habits; COVID-related stressors; Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. Positive and negative changes were associated with higher psychological distress compared to no lifestyle change, and there was a moderating effect of COVID-related stressors in the association between COVID-related lifestyle changes and distress. In conclusion, to reduce psychological distress in overwhelming circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people should carefully consider whether to make changes in their lifestyle habits before doing so, even if these changes are perceived as positive and health-enhancing. Furthermore, efforts should be focused on reducing the perception of stress from COVID-19 by working on personal and mental perceptions of the situation.","Alon-Tirosh, Hadar-Shoval, Asraf, Tannous-Haddad, Tzischinsky","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189695","20210928","alcohol consumption; anxiety; cigarette smoking; depression; eating habits; health behavior; nature of change; physical activity; sleep quality; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18401,""

"Relationships between Psychopathology, Psychological Process Variables, and Sociodemographic Variables and Comparison of Quarantined and Non-Quarantined Groups of Malaysian University Students in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable psychological health impacts across the globe. This study aimed to establish the psychological process variables underlying psychopathology in Malaysian public university students during the national Movement Control Order (MCO). The aim was to craft structured and sustainable psychological support programs with these students. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving Malaysian university students subjected to the Malaysian MCO. Structured questionnaires measuring sociodemographic factors, measures of depression, anxiety, stress, psychological mindedness, psychological flexibility and state mindfulness were employed. A total of 515 students participated in this study with 12 students (2.3%) being quarantined at the time. Many of them scored 'moderate' or above on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) with 20.2%, 25.0% and 14.2%, respectively. Quarantined students had higher depressive symptoms, with female students scoring significantly higher for depression, anxiety, and stress. Multiple regressions suggested gender and quarantine status predicted depression scores. However, only gender significantly predicted anxiety and stress. Psychological flexibility and psychological mindedness (Insight subscale) are significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and stress, with psychological mindedness predicting all three psychopathologies. This study demonstrates that gender, psychological flexibility, and psychological mindedness are key demographic and psychological factors impacting students. Targeting psychological flexibility and psychological mindedness may enable timely prevention and intervention programs for our students to support their mental and physical health as we move through, and out of, the pandemic.","Pang, James, Giloi, Rahim, Omar, Jeffree, Hayati, Lim, Kassim, Ng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189656","20210928","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; psychological mindedness; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18403,""

The COVID-19 pandemic also created numerous&amp;nbsp;challenges and opportunities to implement health care policies and&amp;nbsp;programs under conditions that are fundamentally different from what&amp;nbsp;has been considered to be usual care.&amp;nbsp;Methods: We conducted a qualitative study to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on implementation of evidence-based policy and&amp;nbsp;practice by State Mental Health Authorities (SMHA) for prevention and treatment of mental health problems in children and adolescents.&amp;nbsp;Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 SMHA&amp;nbsp;representatives of 21 randomly selected states stratified by&amp;nbsp;coronavirus positivity rate and rate of unmet services need. Data&amp;nbsp;analysis with SMHA stakeholders used procedures embedded in the Rapid&amp;nbsp;Assessment Procedure-Informed Community Ethnography methodology.&amp;nbsp;Results: The need for services increased during the pandemic due&amp;nbsp;primarily to family stress and separation from peers. States&amp;nbsp;reporting an increase in demand had high coronavirus positivity and&amp;nbsp;high unmet services need. The greatest impacts were reduced&amp;nbsp;out-of-home services and increased use of telehealth. Barriers to&amp;nbsp;telehealth services included limited access to internet and&amp;nbsp;technology, family preference for face-to-face services, lack of&amp;nbsp;privacy, difficulty using with young children and youth in need of&amp;nbsp;substance use treatment, finding a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant platform, training&amp;nbsp;providers and clients, and reimbursement challenges.

"The Influence of Technology on Mental Well-Being of STEM Teachers at University Level: COVID-19 as a Stressor","Stress can result in psychopathologies, such as anxiety or depression, when this risk factor continues in time. One major stressor was the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered considerable emotional distress and mental health issues among different workers, including teachers, with another stressor: technology and online education. A mixed-method approach is presented in this research, combining a cross-sectional study of university teachers from Ecuador and Spain with a medium of twenty years of working experience (<i>N</i> = 55) and a bibliometric analysis carried out in three databases (161 documents). The levels of anxiety and depression, and therefore the risk of developing them as mental disorders, were high.

"Lifestyle Changes among Polish University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Students worldwide have been impacted by nationwide safety closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, creating an environment with loss of interaction with colleagues, social isolation, boredom, and economic uncertainty. Since university students were considered uniquely vulnerable to mental health problems even before the pandemic, this study aimed to investigate lifestyle and behavioral changes experienced by this population due to the epidemiological situation and their effect on their mental health. Data were collected via an online survey conducted among university students across Poland. The survey addressed recent lifestyle changes that were a result of the pandemic as well as psychological distress, symptoms of insomnia and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. The results indicate that protective factors include maintaining a daily routine, staying physically active, following a usual eating pattern and taking care of sleep hygiene. Changes in behavior contributing to poorer mental health included giving up a daily routine, neglecting meals, tidiness, hygiene as well as social relationships, changes in food intake, sleeping schedule, a decrease in physical activity and the onset of sexual dysfunctions. A history of psychiatric treatment and an increase in self-harm as well as an increase in alcohol and tobacco consumption were also found to be associated with psychological distress. Experienced lifestyle and behavioral changes and their impact on mental health were apparent throughout the obtained data, highlighting the need for psychological support in the studied population. Based on the results we were able to establish a list of protective and risk factors influencing the everyday life and psychological wellbeing of students amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which could also be translated into life skills.","Fila-Witecka, Senczyszyn, KoÃ…â€šodziejczyk, CiuÃ…â€škowicz, Maciaszek, Misiak, SzczeÃ…â€ºniak, Rymaszewska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189571","20210928","COVID-19; coronavirus; life skills; lifestyle; mental health; online survey; university student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18407,""
"""Where-There-Is-No-Psychiatrist Integrated Personal Therapy"" among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Randomized Pilot Study","In Singapore, many older adults suffer from subsyndromal depression and/or subsyndromal anxiety, which can negatively impact their physical and mental well-being if left untreated. Due to the general public's reluctance to seek psychological help and the low psychiatrist-to-population ratio in Singapore, this study aims to examine the preliminary efficacy, perceptions, and acceptability of a trained volunteer-led community-based intervention on community-dwelling older adults. Twenty-one participants (control: <i>n</i> = 11; intervention: <i>n</i> = 10) completed the randomized pilot study. A mixed-methods approach (questionnaires, semistructured interviews, examining blood samples, intervention fidelity) was adopted. No significant differences were found between the intervention and the control groups in depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, friendship, and quality of life. However, there was a positive change in quality-of-life scores from baseline to 6 months in the intervention group. The control group had significantly higher cortisol levels and lower annexin-A1 levels at 6 months, while the intervention group did not. Three themes emerged from the interviews: (1) impact of the intervention on older adults' well-being, (2) attitudes toward intervention, and (3) a way forward. However, intervention efficacy could not be established due to small sample size caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Future randomized controlled trials should evaluate volunteer-led, technology-based psychosocial interventions to support these older adults.","Shorey, Kua, Tam, Chan, Goh, Lim, Lim, Tian, Mahendran","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189514","20210928","mental health; mindfulness; older adults; solution-focused brief therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18408,""
"Associations of the Initial COVID-19 Lockdown on Self-Reported Happiness and Worry about Developing Loneliness: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Rural, Regional, and Urban Australian Communities","Australia adopted hard lockdown measures to eliminate community transmission of COVID-19. Lockdown imposes periods of social isolation that contributes to increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and worry. We examined whether lockdowns have similar psychosocial associations across rural and urban areas and whether associations existed between happiness and worry of loneliness in the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Data were collected using the ""COVID-19 Living Survey"" between 13 and 20 May 2020 by BehaviourWorks Australia at the Monash Sustainable Development Institute. The mean self-reported feeling of happiness and anxiousness (N = 1593), on a 10-point Likert scale with 0 being least happy or highly anxious, was 6.5 (SD = 2.4) and 3.9 (2.9), respectively. Factors associated with happiness were older age and having a postgraduate education. Participants worried about becoming lonely also exhibited reduced happiness (estimate = -1.58, 95%CI = -1.84--1.32) and higher anxiousness (2.22, 1.93-2.51) scores, and these conditions remained associated after adjusting for demographics. Interestingly, worry about loneliness was greater in rural areas than in urban communities. The negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on rural youth and those less-educated was evident. Participants in rural Australia who were worried about becoming lonely were reportedly less happy than participants in major cities. This dataset provides a better understanding of factors that influence psychological well-being and quality of life in the Australian population and helps to determine whether happiness may be an associative factor that could mitigate self-feelings of anxiety and worry about loneliness.","Isaac, Cheng, Townsin, Assareh, Li, McLachlan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189501","20210928","COVID-19 lockdown; anxiousness; general population; happiness; loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18409,""
"Resilience, Coping Strategies and Posttraumatic Growth in the Workplace Following COVID-19: A Narrative Review on the Positive Aspects of Trauma","The COVID-19 pandemic represents a traumatic event that has profoundly changed working conditions with detrimental consequences for workers' health, in particular for the healthcare population directly involved in addressing the emergency. Nevertheless, previous research has demonstrated that traumatic experiences can also lead to positive reactions, stimulating resilience and feelings of growth. The aim of this narrative review is to investigate the positive aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible health prevention and promotion strategies by analyzing the available scientific evidence. In particular, we focus on the constructs of resilience, coping strategies and posttraumatic growth (PTG). A literature search was performed on the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Psycinfo databases. Forty-six articles were included in the literature synthesis. Psychological resilience is a fundamental variable for reducing and preventing the negative psychological effects of the pandemic and is associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and burnout. At the individual and organizational level, resilience plays a crucial role in enhancing wellbeing in healthcare and non-healthcare workers. Connected to resilience, adaptive coping strategies are essential for managing the emergency and work-related stress. Several positive factors influencing resilience have been highlighted in the development of PTG. At the same time, high levels of resilience and positive coping strategies can enhance personal growth. Considering the possible long-term coexistence and consequences of COVID-19, organizational interventions should aim to improve workers' adaptive coping skills, resilience and PTG in order to promote wellbeing.","Finstad, Giorgi, Lulli, Pandolfi, Foti, LeÃƒÂ³n-Perez, Cantero-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Mucci","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189453","20210928","COVID-19 pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; growth; occupational health and safety; psychological health; trauma; workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18410,""
"Physical Activity, Physical Well-Being, and Psychological Well-Being: Associations with Life Satisfaction during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Early Childhood Educators","Seeking personal well-being and life satisfaction during a global pandemic can be daunting, such is the case for early care and education teachers who were considered non-health care essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The potential changes in their physical activity, along with their overall physical and psychological well-being, may have ultimately influenced their life satisfaction. These changes included the potential for increased sedentary behaviors. Despite the high health risks associated with these factors during the pandemic, the role of physical activity in early care and education teachers' well-being and life satisfaction remains largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the associations of physical activity and sedentary behaviors with teacher well-being and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, we explored two competing models of the relationship between the teachers' physical activity, well-being, and life satisfaction, one with physical activity as a mediator and the other with teachers' well-being as a mediator. An online survey, that collected information on physical, psychological, and professional well-being, job demands, and life satisfaction, was completed by 1434 US ECE teachers in 46 states. To test our hypothesized models, we conducted confirmatory factor analyses, followed by structural equation modeling. Of the respondents, 77% were overweight or obese and only 39% met the recommended 150 min of moderate physical activity per week. They had a mean life satisfaction score that qualifies as slight satisfaction, they experience moderate stress, and, collectively, are approaching the threshold for depression yet still reflect moderate-to-high work commitment. The empirical test of our competing mediation models found the model where teacher well-being mediated the association between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and life satisfaction was the superior model. The relationships between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and overall well-being suggest that these modifiable risk factors can be addressed such that early care and education teachers can improve their overall physical and psychological well-being, along with their life satisfaction.","Randall, Ford, Kwon, Sisson, Bice, Dinkel, Tsotsoros","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189430","20210928","COVID-19 pandemic; early childhood educators; life satisfaction; physical activity; physical well-being; psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18411,""
"Eating Competence among Brazilian Adults: A Comparison between before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus pandemic started a worldwide emergency, and tight preventive actions were necessary to protect the population, changing individuals' daily habits.

However, this has been less explored in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and the present study examined the effect of pets on the mental health and wellbeing of Malaysians during the lockdown, or movement control order (MCO), due to COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was carried out, with 448 Malaysian participants, who completed online assessments for psychological outcomes, psychological wellbeing, positive-negative emotions, resilience, and coping self-efficacy. Results indicate that pet owners reported significantly better coping self-efficacy, significantly more positive emotions, and better psychological wellbeing, but contrary to expectations, there was no differences on other measures. Among pet owners, cat owners reported more positive emotions and greater wellbeing than dog owners. The results show that that pets have some impact on improved psychological health of their owners and could be integrated into recovery frameworks for promoting mental health and wellbeing.","Grajfoner, Ke, Wong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11092689","20210928","COVID-19; humanÃ¢â‚¬â€œanimal interactions; lockdown; mental health and wellbeing; pets in Malaysia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18413,""

Both psychological constructs are interrelated in life-threatening diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The Teruel Study retrospectively evaluated the impact of strict confinement on the 44 people with MS of this Spanish province and 24 caregivers, specifically assessing (1) fears and perceptions; (2) self-compassion (people with MS) and compassion (caregivers); (3) physical and mental health, and fatigue. Despite better housing conditions, people with MS considered confinement very difficult to handle, more than their caregivers, but they were less afraid of COVID-19 and worsening of MS. Still, they recognized worse health than before confinement. Reclusion and lack of walks were the worst of confinement. Caregivers also referred to lack of leisure and uncertainty-fear. All agreed the best was staying with the family, but some found 'nothing' positive. Self-compassion remained moderate-high and strongly correlated with their moderate levels of social function, vitality, physical role, and global health. Physical and cognitive fatigue scores were high, and self-compassion negatively correlated with them, explaining a 19% variance in global health. The high compassion of the caregivers did not correlate with any variable.","GimÃƒÂ©nez-Llort, MartÃƒÂ­n-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Maurel","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091233","20210928","COVID-19; HRQoL; caregivers; compassion; fatigue; fears; health; multiple sclerosis; secondary impact; self-compassion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18414,""
"What Is the Role of Resilience and Coping Strategies on the Mental Health of the General Population during the COVID-19 Pandemic? Results from the Italian Multicentric COMET Study","The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health are now well documented, however, few studies have been focused on the role of coping strategies and resilience in counterbalancing these detrimental effects. Data are derived from the COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET), a national multicentric trial carried out in the Italian general population. The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants, 53.1% (<i>n</i> = 11,000) of the sample reported low levels of resilience. Adaptive coping strategies and resilience levels did not have any significant protective impact on the levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Only self-distraction was a risk factor for poor mental health (Beta Coefficient, B = 0.1, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.003 to 0.267 for stress symptoms; B = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.077 to 0.324 for anxiety symptoms and B = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.105 to 0.382 for depressive symptoms). High levels of resilience were predicted by adaptive coping strategies, such as acceptance (B = 1.8, CI 95% = 1.4-2.7). Exposure to the different weeks of lockdown, being infected by COVID-19, and being a healthcare professional did not influence the levels of resilience. Our findings should be carefully considered, since the low levels of resilience may represent the missing link between the pandemic and the current increase in mental health problems.","Sampogna, Del Vecchio, Giallonardo, Luciano, Albert, Carmassi, CarrÃƒÂ , Cirulli, Dell'Osso, Menculini, Nanni, Pompili, Sani, Volpe, Bianchini, Fiorillo","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091231","20210928","coping strategies; mental health; pandemic; resilience; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18415,""
"Are There Any Cognitive and Behavioral Changes Potentially Related to Quarantine Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic in People with Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD Dementia? A Longitudinal Study","The aim of the study was to examine potential cognitive, mood (depression and anxiety) and behavioral changes that may be related to the quarantine and the lockdown applied during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greek older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia in mild and moderate stages. 407 older adults, diagnosed either with MCI or AD dementia (ADD), were recruited from the Day Centers of the Greek Association of Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders (GAADRD). Neuropsychological assessment was performed at baseline (at the time of diagnosis) between May and July of 2018, as well as for two consecutive follow-up assessments, identical in period, in 2019 and 2020. The majority of participants had participated in non-pharmacological interventions during 2018 as well as 2019, whereas all of them continued their participation online in 2020. Mixed measures analysis of variance showed that participants' 'deterioration difference-D' by means of their performance difference in neuropsychological assessments between 2018-2019 (D1) and 2019-2020 (D2) did not change, except for the FUCAS, RAVLT, and phonemic fluency tests, since both groups resulted in a larger deterioration difference (D2) in these tests. Additionally, three path models examining the direct relationships between performance in tests measuring mood, as well as everyday functioning and cognitive measures, showed that participants' worsened performance in the 2019 and 2020 assessments was strongly affected by NPI performance, in sharp contrast to the 2018 assessment. During the lockdown period, MCI and ADD patients' neuropsychological performance did not change, except from the tests measuring verbal memory, learning, and phonemic fluency, as well as everyday functioning. However, the natural progression of the MCI as well as ADD condition is the main reason for participants' deterioration. Mood performance became increasingly closely related to cognition and everyday functioning. Hence, the role of quarantine and AD progression are discussed as potential factors associated with impairments.","Tsatali, Moraitou, Poptsi, Sia, Agogiatou, Gialaouzidis, Tabakis, Avdikou, Bakoglidou, Batsila, Bekiaridis-Moschou, Chatziroumpi, Diamantidou, Gavra, Kouroundi, Liapi, Markou, Ouzouni, Papasozomenou, Soumpourou, Tsolaki","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091165","20210928","cognitive status; coronavirus-19 pandemic; effect of quarantine in older adults; everyday functioning; mood status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18416,""
"Clinical Spectrum and Neuroimagistic Features in Hospitalized Patients with Neurological Disorders and Concomitant Coronavirus-19 Infection","In the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, several research studies focused on understanding the damage to the respiratory and circulatory systems. However, the evidence of neurological manifestations as part of the clinical spectrum of the disease has increased. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the potential association of neurological disorders with concomitant COVID-19 infection. We reviewed 101 patients (mean age, 70.05 years; 62.37% men) diagnosed with different neurological disorders and COVID-19 who were referred to the Department of Neurology between March 2020 and May 2021. The protocol included demographic, clinical, and neuroimagistic features, biochemical evaluation data, and prognosis. In the first group of patients with non-severe COVID-19 infection (&lt;50% lung damage), we enrolled 75 cases (mean age, 69.13 years; 65.33% men), and the second group, with 26 patients (mean age, 72.69 years; 53.84% men), developed severe COVID-19 infection (&gt;50% lung damage). Severe COVID-19 infection was significantly correlated with an increased highly sensitive C-reactive protein level (hsCRP) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), D-dimer (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), fibrinogen level (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and blood glucose (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) when compared to the first group. These biochemical parameters were increased in both groups, but the levels were much higher in the second group. Headaches (72.27%) and dizziness (14.85%) were present in the early stage of infection. Cerebrovascular events were also reported: ischemic stroke (48% vs. 57.69%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), cerebral hemorrhage (4.95%), and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (1.98%). Encephalitis (1.98%) and Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© Syndrome (1.98%) were found but less frequently. Cranial nerve abnormalities were statistically more common in the non-severe group: anosmia (32% vs. 26.92%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), dysgeusia/ageusia (48% vs. 42.30%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), impaired eye movement (1.33% vs. 0%), and facial nerve palsy (2.66% vs. 0%). Seizures (13.33% vs. 11.53%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and a depressed level of consciousness (31.68%) occurred commonly. We detected the neuropsychiatric symptoms of anxiety (23.76%) and depression (14.85%). Mortality was increased in both groups but was much higher in the second group (46.15% vs. 21.33%). Neurological complications during COVID-19 infection are common in hospitalized patients, but the mechanism of these complications is not fully understood, representing a continuous challenge for neurologists.","Gogu, Motoc, Stroe, Docu Axelerad, Docu Axelerad, PÃƒÂ¢rv, Munteanu, Dan, Jianu","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091138","20210928","COVID-19 infection; neurological disorders; stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18417,""
"Opposing Association of Situational and Chronic Loneliness with Interpersonal Distance","Loneliness is a prevalent condition with adverse effects on physical and mental health. Evolutionary theories suggest it evolved to drive people to reconnect. However, chronic loneliness may result in a negative social bias and self-preservation behaviors, paradoxically driving individuals away from social interactions. Lonely people often feel they are not close to anyone; however, little is known about their interpersonal distance preferences. During COVID-19, many experienced situational loneliness related to actual social isolation. Therefore, there was a unique opportunity to examine both chronic and situational (COVID-19-related) loneliness. In the present study, 479 participants completed an online task that experimentally assessed interpersonal distance preferences in four conditions-passively being approached by a friend or a stranger, and actively approaching a friend or a stranger. Results show that high chronic loneliness was related to a greater preferred distance across conditions. Intriguingly, by contrast, high COVID-19-related loneliness was related to a smaller preferred distance across conditions. These findings provide further support for the evolutionary theory of loneliness: situational loneliness indeed seems to drive people towards reconnection, while chronic loneliness seems to drive people away from it. Implications for the amelioration of chronic loneliness are discussed based on these findings.","Saporta, Scheele, Lieberz, Stuhr-Wulff, Hurlemann, Shamay-Tsoory","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091135","20210928","COVID-19; chronic loneliness; interpersonal distance; loneliness; situational loneliness; social interaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18418,""
"Psychological and Emotional Effects of Digital Technology on Children in COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has caused obstacles in continuing normal life almost everywhere in the world by causing the implementation of social distancing and eventually imposing the lockdown. This has become the reason for the increase in technology usage in daily life for professional work as well as for entertainment purposes. There has been an increased prevalence of technology usage in adolescents and children during lockdown leaving its impact on their lives either in a positive or negative aspect. The overall documented percentage increase of technology usage in children was about 15%, of which smartphone usage has 61.7% of prevalence. Disturbance in brain functioning is suggested to be originated by compromise of neuroplasticity of the nerves. The radiofrequency (RF) radiations emitting from the smartphone are of doubtful concern as a brain tumor risk factor in children. The increased usage can have effects on brain functioning that will compromise sleep and cognitive abilities and develop risk for certain mental illnesses including, but not limited to, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD). Despite being a threat for developing mental illness, video games are proven to reduce depression and anxiety, and increase creativity, skills, and cognition in children. The increased usage of technology can have a positive and negative impact on the mental development of adolescents and children depending on the trends in the usage. However, parents should be monitoring their children's mental health and behavior in these difficult times of pandemic.","Limone, Toto","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091126","20210928","COVID-19; brain condition; digital technology; neuropsychological effects","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18419,""
"Differential Redox State and Iron Regulation in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Coronavirus Disease 2019","In patients affected by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), unclear mechanisms negatively interfere with the hematopoietic response to hypoxia. Although stimulated by physiological hypoxia, pulmonary hypoxic patients usually develop anemia, which may ultimately complicate the outcome. To characterize this non-adaptive response, we dissected the interplay among the redox state, iron regulation, and inflammation in patients challenged by either acute (ARDS and COVID-19) or chronic (COPD) hypoxia. To this purpose, we evaluated a panel of redox state biomarkers that may integrate the routine iron metabolism assays to monitor the patients' inflammatory and oxidative state. We measured redox and hematopoietic regulators in 20 ARDS patients, 20 ambulatory COPD patients, 9 COVID-19 ARDS-like patients, and 10 age-matched non-hypoxic healthy volunteers (controls). All the examined pathological conditions induced hypoxia, with ARDS and COVID-19 depressing the hematopoietic response without remarkable effects on erythropoietin. Free iron was higher than the controls in all patients, with higher levels of hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor in ARDS and COVID-19. All markers of the redox state and antioxidant barrier were overexpressed in ARDS and COVID-19. However, glutathionyl hemoglobin, a candidate marker for the redox imbalance, was especially low in ARDS, despite depressed levels of glutathione being present in all patients. Although iron regulation was dysfunctional in all groups, the depressed antioxidant barrier in ARDS, and to a lesser extent in COVID-19, might induce greater inflammatory responses with consequent anemia.","Duca, Ottolenghi, Coppola, Rinaldo, Dei Cas, Rubino, Paroni, Samaja, Chiumello, Motta","https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10091460","20210928","acute hypoxia; antioxidant barrier; chronic hypoxia; erythropoiesis; hepcidin; iron; redox imbalance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18420,""
"Psychological Wellbeing of Parents with Infants Admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","The current SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a sudden major stressor superimposed on pre-existing high distress in parents of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This study aimed to investigate the psychological wellbeing of NICU parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Forty-four parents of 25 inpatients of the Padua University Hospital NICU were included from June 2020 to February 2021. At 7-14 days postpartum parents completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Parental Stressor Scale: NICU (PSS:NICU) and an ad-hoc questionnaire measuring parental COVID-19 related stress. About one third of parents reported extreme/high stress and a relevant negative impact on parenthood experience. Less time (82%) and less physical contact (73%) with infants due to COVID-19 preventive measures were the most frequent negative factors. Higher COVID-19 related parental stress was positively associated with anxiety, depression, NICU parental stress, stress related to NICU environment, and parental role alterations. Depression symptoms, stress related to infant condition and parental role alterations were higher in mothers. The pandemic affected parental emotional and relational wellbeing directly through additional stress due to COVID-19 concerns and indirectly through the impact of restrictions on the experience of becoming parents.","Polloni, Cavallin, Lolli, Schiavo, Bua, Volpe, Meneghelli, Baraldi, Trevisanuto","https://doi.org/10.3390/children8090755","20210928","anxiety; depression; fathers; mothers; preterm child; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18421,""
"Results of COVID-19 Surveillance in a Large United States Pediatric Healthcare System over One Year","The lack of SARS-CoV-2 antigen surveillance testing in the pediatric population has inhibited accurate infection and hospitalization prevalence estimates. We aim to report the estimated prevalence of and risk factors for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission across the three United States (US) waves in one of the largest pediatric healthcare systems in the nation. Retrospective electronic health record (EHR) review of all COVID-19 surveillance data among children aged 0-19 years seeking healthcare at one pediatric healthcare system that serves predominantly Medicaid-dependent families from 1 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. COVID-19 infection status (Y/N), hospital admission (Y/N), and ICU admission (Y/N) are the main outcomes. Of 22,377 children aged Ã¢â€°Â¤ 19 years tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 2020-March 2021, 3126 were positive (14.0%), and out of those positive, 53.7% were hospitalized and 2.9% were admitted to the ICU. Compared to Wave 1 (1 March 2020-31 May 2020), the risk of a positive test increased from 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI, 1.07-1.26) in Wave 2 (1 June 2020-31 October 2020) to 33% (RR 1.33, 95% CI, 1.23-1.44) in Wave 3 (1 November 2020-31 March 2021). Similarly, compared to Wave 1, the risk for hospitalization increased 86% (RR 1.86, 95% CI, 1.86-2.06) in Wave 2 and 89% in Wave 3 (RR 1.89, 95% CI, 1.70-2.08), and the risk for ICU admission increased from 10% in Wave 2 (RR 1.10, 95% CI, 0.39-3.01) to 310% in Wave 3 (RR 3.10, 95% CI, 1.21-7.80). Children with asthma, depressive disorders, type 1 or 2 diabetes, and anemia were more likely to be hospitalized while children with diabetes, obesity, cardiac malformations, and hypertension were more likely to be admitted to the ICU versus children without these conditions. Children were cumulatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic through the three US waves with more than a third hospitalized in Wave 3. Children with underlying health conditions were particularly at risk for severe illness and should be monitored for any long-term impacts.","Messiah, Xie, Mathew, Delclos, Kohl, Kahn","https://doi.org/10.3390/children8090752","20210928","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; health disparities; risk factors; surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18422,""
"COVID-19 Associated Contact Restrictions in Germany: Marked Decline in Children's Outpatient Visits for Infectious Diseases without Increasing Visits for Mental Health Disorders","Children have a low risk for severe COVID-19 infections, but indirect consequences of the pandemic may affect their health. We evaluated nationwide data on children's outpatient visits before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Data from the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians for all children with statutory health insurance and at least one physician's office visit between January 2019 and June 2020 were evaluated for total visits and selected diagnoses for the 2nd quarter of 2019 (8.29 million children, controls) and the 2nd quarter of 2020 (8.5 million, pandemic). Outpatient visits per child fell by 18% during the first wave of the pandemic. Outpatient visits associated with diagnosed infections fell markedly by 51%, particularly for children up to age 5 years for gastroenteritis (73%), otitis media (71%), and streptococcal angina (78%). Outpatient visits for diagnosed chronic physical disorders (diabetes, celiac disease, and hay fever) and mental and behavioral disorders showed little change. Reduced contact between children appears to markedly reduce infection transmission. Infection risks in educational settings should be attenuated after the pandemic through targeted education and counseling and appropriate relationship prevention measures to improve quality of life and opportunities for children and to reduce stress and lost work time for parents.","Barschkett, Koletzko, Spiess","https://doi.org/10.3390/children8090728","20210928","COVID-19; day care center closures; infectious disease transmission; mental health; school closures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18423,""
"Kawasaki Disease and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: An Overview and Comparison","Kawasaki disease (KD) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are inflammatory conditions that present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to the physician. Although many of their features overlap, they are two distinct conditions. KD is a febrile illness most commonly affecting children younger than five years. It manifests with prolonged fever and at least four of the following features: bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis, mucositis, diffuse maculopapular rash, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy of 1.5 cm or more in diameter. Patients with MIS-C may have many of the same manifestations but tend to have higher rates of gastrointestinal and neurocognitive symptoms and signs of shock on presentation. Both conditions are associated with cardiac sequelae, including coronary artery aneurysms, although children with MIS-C are at high risk of developing ventricular dysfunction and depressed cardiac output. Lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated troponin, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide are key laboratory findings of MIS-C that can help distinguish it from KD. The use of intravenous immune globulin is well established in KD and also appears to have a role in the treatment of MIS-C. Aspirin has been used in KD for an anti-inflammatory effect, and low-dose aspirin is recommended for MIS-C to reduce the risk of thrombosis. In addition to supportive care, patients with MIS-C may benefit from immunomodulatory medications, although data on this topic are evolving.","Darby, Jackson","https://www.google.com/search?q=Kawasaki+Disease+and+Multisystem+Inflammatory+Syndrome+in+Children:+An+Overview+and+Comparison.","20210928","COVID-19; Correlation of Data; Humans; Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome; Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-29","",18424,""
