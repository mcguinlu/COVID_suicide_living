"Mental Health of HBCU College Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: This study investigated rates and predictors of mental health issues (e.g., depression and anxiety) in a sample of college students currently attending a historically Black college/university (HBCU) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants/Methods: 98 undergraduate students (81 female and 17 male) completed an online survey containing questions about demographics, socioeconomic status, academic characteristics, and pandemic-related concerns. The survey also included PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires to evaluate depression and anxiety, respectively. Results: 49% of students met the clinical cutoff for depression, 39% for anxiety, and 52% for depression and/or anxiety. Significant predictors of meeting the cutoffs included parental job loss/hour reduction, being a senior, and feeling that the pandemic negatively impacted daily life, among other factors. Demographic variables (age, gender, etc.) had no effect. Conclusion: HBCU students show high rates of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be predicted based on the student's academic, socioeconomic, and pandemic-related concerns.","Sharron Xuanren Wang; Jarid Goodman","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.22.21260878","20210725","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-26","",16469,""
"Challenges to self-isolation among contacts of cases of COVID-19: a national telephone survey in Wales","Objectives: To identify the specific challenges of self-isolation experienced by population sub-groups to better target and tailor support. Design: The Contact Adherence Behavioural Insights Study (CABINS) was a 15-minute telephone survey of confirmed contacts of cases of COVID-19 identified through the national NHS Wales Test Trace Protect (TTP) database. Methods: Confirmed contacts of cases of COVID-19 reached by TTP completed a 15-minute telephone survey (N = 2,027). Binary logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, living alone, survey round, deprivation quintile (defined by the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation) and income precarity (financial security) determined which population sub-groups were more likely to experience challenges during self-isolation. Results: Younger people (aged 18-29 years) were 3 times more likely to report mental health concerns (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]: 3.16, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 2.05-4.86) and 2 times more likely to report loneliness (aOR: 1.96, CI: 1.37-2.81) compared to people aged over 60 years. Women were 1.5 times more likely to experience mental health concerns (aOR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.20-1.92) compared to men. People with high/very high levels of income precarity were 8 times more likely to report financial challenges (aOR: 7.73, CI: 5.10-11.74) and 3 times more likely to report mental health concerns than their more financially secure counterparts (aOR: 3.08, CI: 2.22-4.28). Conclusions: Self-isolation is particularly challenging for those with younger people, women and precarious incomes. Providing enhanced emotional, financial and social support and signposting to these groups is required to minimise the harms of self-isolation.","Kate Rebecca Isherwood; Richard G Kyle; Benjamin R Gray; Alisha R Davies","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.21261020","20210725","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-26","",16470,""
"Shocked-relaxed-tired: Mental health during the three waves of the Covid-19","Background: Several recent studies reported that Covid-19 pandemic induces significant mental distress. It remains unknown, however, whether mental distress persists or undergoes extinction in response to consecutive Covid-19 waves. We here examine mental distress prior to and across the three Covid-19 waves. Methods: We measured stress and depressive symptoms prior to and across the three Covid-19 waves in a well-established population-based sample. A total of 330 participants completed e-questionnaires prior to and during the Covid-19 waves. Friedman's repeated-measures and Wilcoxon rank sum pairwise test with Bonferroni correction were used to investigate repeated-measure differences, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the effect of behavioral and physiological parameters on mental health. Results: We found significantly increased mental distress during each of the Covid-19 waves compared with the pre-Covid-19 period. Increased mental distress was more common in women and most pronounced during the 1st and in particular, the 3rd Covid-19 wave. The stress and depressive symptoms increased during pandemic compared with the pre-Covid-19 period by a maximum of 1.58 and 3.63 times, respectively. Negative emotions and loneliness were identified as the most significant risk factors of Covid-19-induced mental distress, while resilience was found to be protective. Conclusions: Mental distress surged during all the Covid-19 waves without showing extinction. This pattern is mechanistically reminiscent of the post-traumatic stress disorder. Our results suggest that the Covid-19 pandemic underlies development of a novel chronic mental health disorder and do not exclude possible further deterioration of mental health in case of future Covid-19 waves.","Jan Sebastian Novotny; Juan Pablo Gonzalez Rivas; Sarka Kunzova; Maria Skladana; Anna Pospisilova; Anna Polcrova; Maria Vassilaki; Jose Ramon Medina Inojosa; Francisco Lopez-Jimenez; Yonas Endale Geda; Gorazd Bernard Stokin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.25.21261094","20210725","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-26","",16471,""
