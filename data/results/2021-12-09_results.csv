"Factors influencing COVID-19 infection in older individuals: History of Alcohol Use Disorder; Major Depressive illness, genetic variation and current use of alcohol","Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a major public health problem. Vulnerable populations include older individuals with presumed weakening of the immune response. Identification of factors influencing COVID-19 infection could provide an additional means for protecting such individuals. Methods: Members of a family study previously interviewed as middle aged individuals were re-contacted and asked to participate in extended phone interview (2-3 hours) covering past and current mental health issues, physical health diagnoses, use of alcohol and drugs, and exposure to anyone with COVID-19. The average follow-up period was 32 years. Detailed medication use was collected to confirm medical diagnoses and to reveal possible protective effects of particular drug classes currently prescribed for the participant by their physician. Serology was available for red cell antigens (ABO, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, Rhesus) and HLA subtypes. Analyses were conducted to contrast COVID-19 + and COVID-19 - individuals for physical and mental health diagnoses, use of alcohol and drugs, and red cell and HLA serology. Additionally, analyses were conducted to contrast these groups with a group reporting known exposure but absence of COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis by a health professional. Results: Interviews were completed between September 2020 and November 2021. A total of 42 of the 90 individuals interviewed had been vaccinated at the time of interview. At the time of interview, 11.1% reported having developed COVID-19. Using quantity per occasion (QPO) and quantity by frequency (QXF) totals in the past month by type of alcohol consumed, we found a significant association between QPO for liquor (p=0.017) and marginal effects for QXF for liquor consumption (p=0.06). Exposed individuals who were COVID-19 negative tended to drink more liquor than those who were positive, an average of about one drink per day. Beer and wine consumption were not statistically significant. A diagnosis of alcohol use disorder at baseline evaluation was not a significant predictor of being COVID positive or negative. Self-reported current depression or depression in the past only was not a predictor of COVID-19 status based on a single question ""Are you depressed currently or only in the past?"". In contrast, completion of a clinical interview designed to elicit depressed mood and concurrent symptoms for determination of the lifetime presence or absence of a depressive episode did reveal a significant effect. Comparison of responses at baseline to follow-up showed those most resilient to developing COVID-19 were those without evidence of a depressive episode by lifetime history at both points in time. Physical health issues were analyzed for those that were frequently occurring in our sample such as hypertension but not found to be significant. BMI was analyzed and found to be statistically non-significant. Analysis of HLA variation across the whole sample did not reveal a significant association but among males two variants, A1 and B8, did show significant variation associated with COVID-19+ and COVID-19- status. Analyses of the red cell antigens revealed one significant red cell effect; Kidd genotypic variation was associated with COVID-19 status. Interpretation: We tentatively conclude that use of specific types of alcohol, namely liquor, is associated with reduced frequency of COVID-19. However, the amount is low, averaging about 1 drink per day. Enlarged samples are needed to confirm these results. The finding that past history of alcohol use disorder does not increase likelihood of developing COVID-19 is important. It should be noted that the 34 individuals diagnosed with AUD at baseline had survived an average of 32 years in order to participate in the current interview suggesting they may be especially resilient to adverse health conditions. The finding that a single question designed to elicit the presence or absence of depressed mood either currently or in the past was not a risk factor for COVID-19 in contrast to report of a clinically significant past history of a depressive episode based on more extensive examination using DSM criteria is important. Results for the KIDD blood group are novel and warrant further investigation.","Shirley Y. Hill; Brian J.

"Psychological interventions on the front lines: A roadmap for the development of a behavioral treatment program to mitigate the mental health burden faced by COVID-19 survivors","Survivors of prolonged hospitalization due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at risk for psychiatric symptoms that can interfere with rehabilitation and functional outcomes. We developed an inpatient and outpatient behavioral treatment program for COVID-19 patients. We describe the constellation of emotional symptoms we observed, the evolution of symptom presentation from the inpatient to the outpatient setting, and outline the challenges we faced and lessons we learned as we implemented cognitive-behavioral interventions to enhance functioning and decrease symptom burden. We highlight modifications to therapeutic techniques that we made for this population and discuss cultural considerations in our diverse patient population. Initial outcome data indicate that approximately two thirds of patients (66% in the inpatient setting, 65% in the outpatient setting) are discharged from our program without further psychiatric care. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to intensify and reports of ""long-haul"" symptoms accumulate among survivors, behavioral interventions to address psychiatric sequelae are paramount. Our approach and experience from the first wave of the pandemic has the potential to inform the development of behavioral treatment programs to mitigate psychiatric symptoms in this vulnerable population, as well as the response of mental health providers to future pandemics and public health emergencies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors are at high risk of psychiatric illness and often experience anxiety, isolation, demoralization, and guilt in the context of a sudden change in physical functioning and social/occupational roles, medical complications, and environmental stressors. We developed an inpatient and outpatient behavioral treatment program after which approximately two thirds of COVID-19 survivors did not require further psychiatric care. By noting some of the challenges we faced and by implementing cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness interventions, clinicians may be able to address the emotional needs of individuals recovering from COVID-19. Our approach may also inform how psychologists respond to future pandemics and public health emergencies.

"Are we dreaming or are we awake? A quali-quantitative analysis of dream narratives and dreaming process during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictive measures taken against the spread of the contagion can be considered as traumatic events having a major impact on mental health. Dreams after undergoing traumatic experiences could ""replay"" traumatic scenes or have a para-therapeutic role that facilitates connections between a traumatic event and associated emotions. However, the studies carried out thus far in the field of sleep and dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic have mostly focused on sleep disorders, emotional tones, and contents of dreams. The aim of the present study was to explore, from a qualitative-quantitative perspective, the contents of dreams and the functions of dreaming during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 1,095 subjects who decide to recount their dreams, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, was involved. A part of the Mannheim Dream questionnaire was also examined, considering both dream recall and the attitudes toward the dreams-both meaningful and transformative-as indicators of the dreaming process. A cluster analysis was performed on dream narratives through the T-Lab software. In all, 4 thematic clusters emerged: Escape From the Threat;The Work of Mourning, Unrecalled Dreams;COVID-19: As Manifest Content. The factorial mapping organized 3 vectors of meaning, representative of the function of dreaming: Remembering, Repeating, and Working Through;From Traumatic Content to Problem-Solving Strategy;From the Safe-Guardian of Sleep to the Safe-Guardian of Dream Waking continuity. The dreaming process shows functions of integration and processing of memories but also that a decrease in dream recall can act as a defense and have a crucial role in mental life. Clinical implications are discussed.

"Exploring The Value Of Soft-Intelligence: A Case Study Using Twitter To Track Mental Health During The COVID-19 Pandemic","IntroductionThere is increasing pressure to rapidly shape policies and inform decision-making where robust evidence is lacking. This work aimed to explore the value of soft-intelligence as a novel source of evidence. We deployed an artificial intelligence based natural language platform to identify and analyze a large collection of UK tweets relating to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsA search strategy comprising a list of terms relating to mental health, COVID-19 and the lockdown was developed to prospectively identify relevant tweets via Twitter's advanced search application programming interface. We used a specialist text analytics platform to explore tweet frequency and sentiment across the UK and identify key topics of discussion for qualitative analysis. All collated tweets were anonymized.ResultsWe identified 380,728 tweets from 184,289 unique users in the UK from 30 April to 4 July 2020. The average sentiment score was fifty-two percent, suggesting overall positive sentiment. Tweets around mental health were polarizing, discussed with both positive and negative sentiment. For example, some people described how they were using the lockdown as a positive opportunity to work on their mental health, sharing helpful strategies to support others. However, many people expressed the damaging impact the pandemic (and resulting lockdown) was having on their mental health, including worsening anxiety, stress, depression, and loneliness.ConclusionsThe results suggest that soft-intelligence is potentially a useful source of evidence. The approach taken to identify and analyze this data may offer an efficient means of establishing key insights from the â€˜public voiceâ€™ relating to critical health issues. However, there are still various limitations to consider concerning the technology and representativeness of the data. Future work to explore this type of evidence further, and how it might formally support decision-making processes, is recommended.This project is funded by the NIHR [(HSRIC-2016-10009)/Innovation Observatory].

"Did the COVID-19 Pandemic Impact Help-seeking Behavior for Seizure Management? A Google Trendsâ„¢ Study","Google Trendsâ„¢ is a popular tool for analyzing healthcare-seeking patterns based on observed changes in the relative search volume (RSV) of the queries made on the Googleâ„¢ search engine. Google Trendsâ„¢ was increasingly utilized during the pandemic to assess the impact on mental health, risk communication, the impact of media coverage, and preparedness prediction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on help-seeking behaviors for seizures and/or epilepsy by assessing the changes in seizure-related online queries in periods before and since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic on Google Trendsâ„¢. We compared the RSV volumes in the year prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic against weekly COVID-19 positive cases for each state and US census regions Search terms were categorized according to seizure symptoms or seizure treatment.

"Willingness to Vaccinate Against SARS-CoV-2: The Role of Reasoning Biases and Conspiracist Ideation","Background Widespread vaccine hesitancy and refusal complicate containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Extant research indicates that biased reasoning and conspiracist ideation discourage vaccination. However, causal pathways from these constructs to vaccine hesitancy and refusal remain underspecified, impeding efforts to intervene and increase vaccine uptake. Method 554 participants who denied prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination completed self-report measures of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions, conspiracist ideation, and constructs from the Health Belief Model of medical decision-making (such as perceived vaccine dangerousness) along with tasks measuring reasoning biases (such as those concerning data gathering behavior). Cutting-edge machine learning algorithms (Greedy Fast Causal Inference) and psychometric network analysis were used to elucidate causal pathways to (and from) vaccine intentions. Results Results indicated that a bias toward reduced data gathering during reasoning may cause paranoia, increasing the perceived dangerousness of vaccines and thereby reducing willingness to vaccinate. Existing interventions that target data gathering and paranoia therefore hold promise for encouraging vaccination. Additionally, reduced willingness to vaccinate was identified as a likely cause of belief in conspiracy theories, subverting the common assumption that the opposite causal relation exists. Finally, perceived severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and perceived vaccine dangerousness (but not effectiveness) were potential direct causes of willingness to vaccinate, providing partial support for the Health Belief Modelâ€™s applicability to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine decisions. Conclusions These insights significantly advance our understanding of the underpinnings of vaccine intentions and should scaffold efforts to prepare more effective interventions on hesitancy for deployment during future pandemics.","Bronstein, Michael V.; Kummerfeld, Erich, MacDonald, Angus, Vinogradov, Sophia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.11.079","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Vaccine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-09","",23386,""
"Analyzing the impact of Machine learning and Artificial intelligence and its Effect on Management of lung cancer detection in covid-19 pandemic","Cancer victims, particularly those with lung cancer, are more susceptible and at higher danger of COVID-19 and associated consequences as a result of their compromised immune systems, which makes them particularly sensitive. Because of a variety of circumstances, cancer patients' diagnosis, treatment, and aftercare are very complicated and time-consuming during an epidemic. In such circumstances, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms (ML) offer the capacity to boost cancer sufferer diagnosis, therapy, and care via the use of cutting technologies. For example, using clinical and imaging data combined with machine learning methods, the researchers may be able to distinguish among lung alterations induced by corona virus and those produced by immunotherapy and radiation. During this epidemic, artificial intelligence (AI) may be utilized to guarantee that the appropriate individuals are recruited in cancer clinical trials more quickly and effectively than in the past, which was done in a conventional and complicated manner. In order to better care for cancer patients and find novel and more effective therapies, It is critical that we move beyond traditional research methods and use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to update our research (ML). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being utilised to help with several aspects of the COVID-19 epidemic, such as epidemiology, molecular research and medication development, medical diagnosis and treatment, and socioeconomics. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients is also being investigated. The combination of artificial intelligence and machine learning in COVID-19 may help to identify positive patients more quickly. In order to understand the dynamics of an epidemic that is relevant to artificial intelligence, when used in different patient groups, AI-based algorithms can quickly detect CT scans with COVID-19 linked pneumonia, as well as discriminate non-COVID connected pneumonia with high specificity and accuracy. It is possible to utilize the existing difficulties and future views presented in this study to guide an optimal implementation of AI and machine learning technologies in an epidemic.","Sarath Kumar Boddu, Raja, Karmakar, Partha, Bhaumik, Ankan, Kumar Nassa, Vinay, Vandana, Bhattacharya, Sumanta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.11.549","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Materials Today: Proceedings;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-09","",23387,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychosexual functions of healthcare workers","Background A novel infection, COVID-19, emerged in China and soon became a global pandemic. Pandemic conditions have resulted in stress in the workplace and led to anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs), having negative impacts on different aspects of their lives, including their sexual function. Aim To evaluate the changes in the anxiety status of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of anxiety on their sexual functions. Methods This is a longitudinal study based on an online survey conducted from April 2020 to February 2021 in hospitals designated as pandemic healthcare centers. An online survey link was sent to HCWs that provided consent for participation in the study. The anxiety status of the participants was assessed using the State Anxiety Inventory, and sexual function was evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Functionâ€“15 for men and Female Sexual Function Index for women. Outcomes Scores obtained at the beginning of the pandemic were compared with those obtained at six months into the pandemic to determine the changes in the anxiety levels and sexual functions of the HCWs. Results A total of 399 HCWs participated in the survey, and the median age was 32 (20â€“60) years. Compared to the beginning of the pandemic, there was a significant increase in the State Anxiety Inventory score of the female and male HCWs at the sixth month of the pandemic. Among the women, the mean total Female Sexual Function Index score was 23.55 Â± 8.69 at the beginning of the pandemic and 21.42Â±8.91 at the sixth month, and there was a significant decrease in all parameters except pain. Among the men, the International Index of Erectile Functionâ€“15 total score was 62.75 Â± 12.51 at the beginning of the pandemic and 55.1 Â± 12.87 at the sixth month, indicating a significant decrease in all parameters. Clinical implications Considering that the pandemic will continue for a long time, more psychological support should be provided, and interventions should be made to protect the mental health of HCWs. Strengths & Limitations The strength of the study is that it had a fairly high number of participants across several institutions. However, being conducted in one country and the sample not being randomly selected and being based on voluntariness can be considered as limitations. Conclusion Our results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the anxiety levels of both female and male HCWs, and this situation has negatively affected their sexual functions.","Eroglu, Unsal, Balci, Melih, Coser, Seref, Basboga, Serdar, Ozercan, Ali Yasin, Kizilkan, Yalcin, Guzel, Ozer, Aslan, Yilmaz, Tuncel, Altug","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2021.11.013","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: The Journal of Sexual Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-09","",23388,""
"A Cross-sectional Study of the Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Undergraduate and Graduate Students in Japan","Background Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a state of emergency was declared in Japan and university classes were suspended, causing concern about the deterioration of the mental health of isolated students. This study aimed to understand studentsâ€™ mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest measures to prevent depressive anxiety among them. Method Undergraduate and graduate students at one national and two private universities in the Kansai region were surveyed. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6 was used to assess the studentsâ€™ mental health. Questions were included to assess studentsâ€™ awareness of COVID-19 and changes in lifestyle habits, including drinking, smoking, gaming, and other addictive habits. The University of Tokyo Health Sociology's version of the Sense of Coherence Scale was used to assess the ability to cope with stressors. Results More than 50% of undergraduate and graduate students felt more than mild depressive anxiety and approximately 11% felt severe depressive anxiety, indicating that anxiety about the future worsened the levels of depressive anxiety. Life with reversed day and night schedules was associated with the worsening of depressive anxiety levels, but a high sense of coherence was associated with decreased levels of depressive anxiety. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic triggered isolation which led to worsening the mental health of undergraduate and graduate students.

"Adapting behavioral activation for perinatal depression and anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and racial injustice","Background We examined the implementation of a behavioural activation (BA) model, via telemedicine, for perinatal populations during a confluence of significant global events in 2020. We conducted a rigorous qualitative study to identify relevant barriers and facilitators from the perspectives of both perinatal participants and treatment providers, We also present two case studies where BA was used and adapted to provide patient-centered care. Methods Within the ongoing SUMMIT non-inferiority randomized controlled trial in Canada and US, we interviewed a random selection of perinatal participants (n=23) and all treatment providers (n=28). A content analysis framework was developed to identify relevant barriers and facilitators and frequencies were calculated for each emergent theme within and across respondent groups. Results Key facilitators reported by participants receiving BA were that BA helped with support and social connection (73.9%), creative problem solving (26.1%) and attending to pandemic-related symptoms (21.7%). Key facilitators endorsed by providers to deliver BA were the use of telemedicine (35.7%) and loosening of government restrictions (21.4%). Both participant groups reported similar barriers to BA during the pandemic such as a lack of privacy and limited activities due to pandemic restrictions. However, providers were more likely to endorse pandemic-related life stressors as a barrier to treatment delivery compared to participants (64.3% vs. 34.8%). Both participant groups experienced explicit discussion of race and the racial justice movements during sessions as beneficial and reported harms of not doing so to the therapeutic alliance.

"Drawing light from the pandemic: Rethinking strategies for health policy and beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophe. It was also preventable. The potential impacts of a novel pathogen were foreseen and for decades scientists and commentators around the world warned of the threat. Most governments and global institutions failed to heed the warnings or to pay enough attention to risks emerging at the interface of human, animal, and environmental health. We were not ready for COVID-19, and people, economies, and governments around the world have suffered as a result. We must learn from these experiences now and implement transformational changes so that we can prevent future crises, and if and when emergencies do emerge, we can respond in more timely, robust and equitable ways, and minimize immediate and longer-term impacts. In 2020-21 the Pan-European Commission on Health and Sustainable Development assessed the challenges posed by COVID-19 in the WHO European region and the lessons from the response. The Commissioners have addressed health in its entirety, analyzing the interactions between health and sustainable development and considering how other policy priorities can contribute to achieving both.

"Videoconsulta en atenciÃ³n primaria: una ventana a la realidad A propÃ³sito de 3 casos clÃ­nicos","Resumen Objetivo DiscusiÃ³n a partir de 3 casos clÃ­nicos de la aplicabilidad de la videoconsulta en AtenciÃ³n Primaria. DescripciÃ³n La videoconsulta es una modalidad de telemedicina sÃ­ncrona, que permite mayor interacciÃ³n mÃ©dico-paciente y se asemeja a la consulta presencial. A pesar de disponer de evidencias de largo recorrido a nivel internacional, no ha sido hasta la llegada de la pandemia por la COVID-19 que se ha iniciado esta modalidad en nuestro paÃ­s. En la evaluaciÃ³n y el seguimiento de los problemas de salud mental, confiere un clima de seguridad que facilita la expresiÃ³n emocional, con un mayor contacto facial que en la actual consulta presencial y se convierte en un mÃ©todo de exploraciÃ³n que complementa y amplÃ­a la informaciÃ³n necesaria. En el seguimiento de las enfermedades respiratorias, la videoconsulta permite mejorar la educaciÃ³n en el manejo de la terapia inhalada con la visualizaciÃ³n y la grabaciÃ³n de la tÃ©cnica inhalada en un entorno seguro. En el manejo de la COVID-19 puede ser la modalidad de consulta de elecciÃ³n para discriminar a los pacientes con afecciÃ³n moderada y la indicaciÃ³n de exÃ¡menes complementarios. ConclusiÃ³n Las principales ventajas de la videoconsulta son la evitaciÃ³n de desplazamientos innecesarios y una mayor interacciÃ³n. Es necesario resolver aspectos tÃ©cnicos, favorecer la formaciÃ³n en su uso y crear una cultura que favorezca su implantaciÃ³n progresiva. Objectives Discussion based on three clinical cases of the applicability of videoconsultation in the Primary Care practice. Description Videoconsults are a modality of telemedicine that allows for an improved doctor-patient interaction and resembles in-person consultations. Despite overwhelming evidence at an international level, it is not until the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic that it has found a place in our country. In the evaluation and follow-up of patients with mental health problems, it grants a climate of trust that enables the demonstration of emotions with more facial contact than in on-site consults and translates into a method that complements and expands the necessary clinical information. In the monitoring of respiratory diseases, videoconsults permit an improved education in management of inhaled therapy and the recording of the inhaling technique in a safe environment.

"A preliminary study of body image and depression among adults during COVID-19: A moderation model","Background Since many aspects of functioning can affect body image, the aim of our study was to assess whether the relationship between body image-related negative emotions or depression and body dissatisfaction was moderated by body image-related quality of life and to compare these analyses among participants with various body mass index during COVID-19. Subjects and methods One hundred and thirty-one adults participated in the study. Measurement tools included the Body Image Quality of Life Inventory, the short form of the Situational Inventory of Body-Image Dysphoria, the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Contour Drawing Scale. Results The effects of body image-related negative emotions or depression on body dissatisfaction is moderated by body image-related quality of life, but only among obese participants. Conclusion Treatment of obese patients should focus on improving quality of life related to body image, while managing negative emotions and body dissatisfaction.","Czepczor-Bernat, Kamila, Modrzejewska, Adriana, Modrzejewska, Justyna, Pekala, Martyna","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.11.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing; 36:55-61, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-09","",23393,""

"Secondary traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression among emergency healthcare workers in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak: A cross-sectional study","Background This study aims to determine the secondary traumatic stress (STS), anxiety, and depression levels of the emergency healthcare workers (HCWs) and to identify the factors associated with the mental health of the emergency HCWs. Methods This prospective cross-sectional study was performed between April 1 and May 1, 2021. Emergency nurses and auxiliary staff who gave informed consent were included in the study. Participants who answered the questions incompletely were excluded from the study. Demographic information, working and living conditions, STS, anxiety, depression scores, and coping strategies were recorded. Results A total of 363 HCWs were included in the study. STS was detected in 261 (71.9%) of the participants, anxiety in 148 (40.8%), and depression in 203 (55.9%) participants. Vaccination against COVID-19 was not associated with STS, anxiety, and depression among emergency HCWs (pÂ &gt;Â 0.05). Having financial difficulties was the most important factor in the development of anxiety, depression, and STS (OR: 3.68 (95% CI 1.96â€“6.90), pÂ &lt;Â 0.001;OR: 4.36 (95% CI 2.52â€“7.53), pÂ &lt;Â 0.001;OR: 5.35 (95% CI 3.06â€“9.37), pÂ &lt;Â 0.001, respectively). We found significantly reduced levels of STS, anxiety, and depression among participants reporting coping strategies that engaging in hobbies, healthy nutrition, and reading books. Conclusion High levels of STS, anxiety, and depression were determined among emergency nurses and auxiliary staff during the pandemic. Poor job satisfaction and financial difficulties were associated with the mental health of emergency HCWs. The mental health of the emergency HCWs should be evaluated regularly. In addition to professional psychological support, social and financial support should be provided as well.","&Iacute;lhan, Bugra, KÃ¼peli, &Iacute;lke","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.11.051","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: The American Journal of Emergency Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-09","",23395,""
"Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan: Applying Topic Modeling in Daily Life Descriptions","The novel coronavirus disease pandemic is threatening not only physical but also mental health. Although some recent quantitative studies have been conducted and revealed the influence of the pandemic on mental health and its relevant factors, it is impossible to obtain and explore all possible variables strongly related to mental health. Therefore, we attempted to adopt a bottom-up approach using text mining of participants' narratives. We examined how participants' descriptions of daily life during the pandemic were categorized into various topics, and which topics were related to their mental health in a sample of 776 Japanese citizens in the general population over 18 years old. Results of a topic modeling with 2,594 unique words provided nine topics (mask, physical symptoms, children, infection anxiety, disinfection items, economic influence, remote work, going out, and change of lifestyle). Those who wrote about economic influence, physical symptoms, and disinfection items experienced lower life satisfaction and higher depression and negative affect, whereas those who mentioned their children were likely to have higher life satisfaction. This study highlighted that monitoring the mental health of individuals with economic impacts and physical symptoms may reduce the damage of COVID-19.","Chishima, Y.; Liu, Ithc","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00587-y","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction;: 20, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-09","",23396,""
"Socioeconomic Impacts of the COVID-19 Lockdown on the Mental Health and Life Satisfaction of the Japanese Population","COVID-19 has been a global challenge ever since its emergence, with reports suggesting negative effects on the mental health and well-being of people. We investigated the associations of the socioeconomic changes driven by the pandemic, illness, well-being, and fear of COVID-19 in Japan. Totally, 565 Japanese individuals completed an online survey, including questions on their self-restraint and changing incomes, and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale;Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale;and present, past, and future life satisfaction scale. Analysis using structural equation models revealed that refraining from going out was a predictor of illness due to the fear of COVID-19. Decreased income predicted increased illness, but was not due to fear of COVID-19. These results suggested that the interaction between decreased time outside and increased fear of COVID-19 could affect illness. Our study suggests the role of fear of COVID-19 during pandemic and the socioeconomic impacts on mental health.

"Moderation of attachment on association between relationship status and depression","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increasingly high rates of depression which may have deleterious effects on relationships. Given the mixed results regarding the protective nature of relationship status as married and secure adult attachment styles on depression, the current study examined the associations between relationship status and adult attachment styles on depression among US adults (N = 747) during the COVID-19 shelter in place orders. The results of our simultaneous regression analysis yielded a statistically significant model wherein secure attachment was negatively associated with depression. Although the results of our analysis of covariance determined that relationship status as married was a protective factor, this effect became significantly reduced after controlling for attachment characteristics. Married participants in our study reported greater severity of depressive symptoms compared to those who were single and partnered, even after controlling for attachment styles. Implications for counseling professionals, limitations, and future areas of research are additionally provided.","Litam, S. D. A.; Lenz, A.

"ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO COVID-19","The health contingency caused by COVID 19 has represented important challenges and challenges for health professionals in the performance of their work due to the complex situations, levels of exhaustion and emotional reactions they experience in the face of this disease, circumstances under which Work commitment and duty take precedence over their own personal safety. In this sense, the present research aims to analyze the organizational commitment of health professionals in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, since it is the personnel assigned to these work centers who present the highest degree of vulnerability, impacting their psychological state and mental health. The study is approached under a quantitative approach, descriptive in scope, by applying the questionnaire proposed by Allen and Meyer. The participation sample is made up of 235 workers from the medical, paramedical, and administrative areas of a public health institution located in Tamaulipas, Mexico. The main results are a high organizational commitment on the part of the surveyed personnel, which motivates the management of good labor practices to correspond to their commitment to the organization in the current conditions in which they perform their function.","Gonzalez, I.
