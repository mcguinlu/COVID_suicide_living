"An Investigation of the Effects of Anxiety and Early Depression on the Chances of Contracting the COVID-19 Infection among the Personnel of Outpatient Hospitals","Anxiety and depression are among the most prevalent psychiatric problems that can be associated with patients . physical issues and illnesses. Consequently, the current study aimed to investigate the effect of anxiety and early depression on the chances of contracting the covrD-19 infection among the personnel of outpatient hospitals. Thus, 241 members (136 male and 105 female employees) of the personnel in Moharrari Hospital, Iran, took part in the study and returned the DHSS-21 questionnaire. Moreover, follow-up procedures lasted for a year. Out of the overall sample, 62 members contracted the COVID-19 in that year, and 6 members were hospitalized. The findings indicated that the contraction rate of the people who had scored higher in terms of depression and anxiety was significantly higher than that of the people with no symptoms of depression and anxiety. Moreover, the findings showed that having a history of physical illnesses had a significant relationship with anxiety and depression. Finally, no significant difference was observed between men and women in terms of suffering from depression and anxiety. The findings implied that psychiatric and physical problems can have mutual relationships with each other, and considering it can help select and develop more effective and optimal interventions.","Jahromi, L.

"A Review of Artificial Intelligence in Treatment of Covid-19","Drug repurposing, also known as repositioning, is a technique in which existing drugs are repurposed to treat emerging and complex diseases like COVID-19. Because of the potential for shorter development timelines and lower overall costs, drug repurposing has emerged as a promising strategy. In the significant data era, artificial intelligence (AI) and network medicine provide cutting-edge information science applications to define disease, medicine, therapeutics, and identify targets with the smallest error. We present guidelines for using AI to accelerate drug repurposing or repositioning, for which AI approaches are formidable and required in this Review. We discuss how to use AI models in precision medicine, such as how AI models can accelerate COVID-19 drug repurposing. Rapidly developing, powerful, and innovative AI and network medicine technologies can help to accelerate therapeutic development. This Review makes a strong case for using artificial intelligence-powered assistive tools to reptupose medications for human disease, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gandla, K.; Reddy, K.

"The Relationship of Covid-19 Related Anxiety with Positive and Negative Emotions of Individuals","Covid-19 has emerged as a pandemic that has affected all humanity since the end of 2019 and has affected the mental health of individuals, causing anxiety, fear, uncertainty, and hopelessness. This study aimed to examine the relationship between anxiety caused by Covid-19 and positive and negative emotions. 3121 people with an average age of 31.3 (SD=10.20) were included in this cross-sectional study conducted online. Data were collected via Sociodemographic Information Form, Epidemic Anxiety Scale (EAS), and Positive and Negative Emotion Scale (PNES). In this study, a significant negative correlation was found between epidemic anxiety and positive emotions (r=-0.057;p&lt;.001);A positive and significant relationship was found between epidemic anxiety and negative emotions (r=0.571;p&lt;.001). A significant positive correlation was found between economic anxiety and negative emotions (r=-0.335;p&lt;.001). A significant negative correlation was found between quarantine anxiety and positive emotions (r=-0.044;p&lt;.05). A significant positive correlation was found between quarantine anxiety and negative emotions (r=0.534;p&lt;.001). A significant positive correlation was found between social life anxiety and negative emotions (r=0.489;p&lt;.001). The results of this research point out the relationship between positive and negative emotions and epidemic anxiety, economic anxiety, quarantine anxiety, and social life anxiety. This relationship can be in the form of anxieties affecting emotions, or it can be in the form of emotions affecting the level of anxiety. For this reason, while taking measures to calm anxiety in epidemic disease processes such as Covid-19, positive and negative emotions should be examined, and reparative measures should be taken.","Ozdogan, B.; Sayar, G.

"Mental Health, Loneliness and Social Support during COVID-19 Pandemic among International University Students in North Cyprus","The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the mental health of various populations. It is thought that international students are more affected by this situation among university students who are prone to mental disorders. For this reason, the aim of the current study was to investigate depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and perceived social support among international students in North Cyprus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and perceived social support scores were compared between international students who stayed in Cyprus during the quarantine period and students who returned to their home countries and also the factors predicting depression, anxiety and stress scores among international students staying in Cyprus during the quarantine period were examined. The sample of the study included 262 students who were recruited using convenience sampling. A socio-demographic form, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-Short Form, Revised University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale were used for data collection. The results revealed that during the lockdown the students mostly worried about their health, their families' health and their academic performance. International students who stayed in Cyprus during the lockdown had higher depression and lower perceived family support scores than the international students who travelled back to their home countries and were there during the lockdown. The result of hierarchical linear regression indicated that length of stay in Cyprus, perceived support of significant other and stress were predictors which explained 73% of variance in depression scores. Gender, monthly income and stress were significant predictors of anxiety which explained 63% of variance and grade, significant other support, depression and anxiety were predictors of stress which explained 78% of the variance. The current study result highlight that universities and states should consider social support and protective mental health programs for international students.","Manyeruke, G.; Ergun, D.","https://doi.org/10.35365/ctjpp.22.3.01","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cyprus Turkish Journal of Psychiatry and Psychology; 4(3):211-221, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40240,""
"Queer Necropolitics: Experiences of LGBTQI+ Asylum Claimants During Covid-19 in the UK","This article discusses how the Covid-19 pandemic has the potential to exacerbate inequalities and social isolation through the analytical lens of Mbembe's necropolitics. To this end, the article examines the UK Government approach to providing LGBTQI+ asylum claimants' access to safe accommodation and health service. The analysis shows that the Home Office's policies around housing and health during the Covid-19 pandemic is closely linked to 'hostile environment' policies -amplifying housing and food precarity, isolation, exposure to violence, economic insecurity as well as physical and mental health problems for LGBTQI+ asylum claimants. The claim is made that there is a lack of intersectionality in the governmental approach to refugees and Covid-19 which creates a support gap for particularly LGBTQI+ asylum claimants. The data used for the writing of this article is based on 14 semi-structured interviews conducted between August 2020 and April 2021 with social/charity workers, asylum claimants and refugees affiliated with NGO help organisations in Glasgow, Birmingham, Cardiff, Brighton, Belfast, and London.","Tschalaer, M.","https://doi.org/10.30950/jcer.v18i1.1262","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Contemporary European Research; 18(1):115-132, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40241,""
"Intensive Care Unit, Cardiac Care Unit, and Emergency Department Nurses? Perceptions of Medical Device-Related Pressure Injuries: A Cross-Sectional Study br","BACKGROUND: Nurses' perception of medical device-related pressure injuries (MDRPIs) may affect their performance, but there is a lack of studies in this area.PURPOSE: The current study aimed to examine intensive care unit (ICU), cardiac care unit (CCU) and emergency department nurses' perception of proper prevention of MDRPIs and care for individuals with such injuries.METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted in 4 general hospitals in Iran in 2021. All nurses (N = 310) working in ICUs, CCUs and emergency departments of these facilities were invited to complete a researcher-made demographic check-list and an 11-item questionnaire to assess attitudes toward MDRPIs. The questionnaire item responses were scored from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) with the total score for the 11 items ranging from 11 to 55. A score of 11 to 25 was categorized as indicating a negative attitude toward proper prevention of MDRPIs and care for such patients;a score of 26 to 40 indicated a neutral attitude, and a score &gt;40 indicated a positive attitude.RESULTS: A total of 260 nurses fulfilled the data col-lection tool. The response rate was 83.8%. The mean total score of attitude toward MDRPIs was 41.7. No significant relationship was observed between the total score of nurses' attitudes and their demographic variables. Of the 260 participants, 159 stated they had not received any trainings on MDRPIs at nursing schools during their education, 212 stated they had not participated in any scientific workshops on MDRPIs, and 167 described their knowledge about the prevention and care of MDRPIs as insuf-ficient.CONCLUSION: Among ICU, CCU, and emergency nurses in Iran, most had a positive attitude toward the prevention and care of MDRPIs, but steps should be taken to offer more opportunities for nurses to increase their knowledge in this area","Nassehi, A.; Jafari, M.; Rashvand, F.; Rafiei, H.; Hosseinpour, F.; Shamekhi, L.","https://doi.org/10.25270/wmp.2022.9.2428","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Wound Management & Prevention; 68(9):24-28, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40242,""
"Socio-family aspects and mental health in Social Work students of the Fundacion Universitaria Juan de Castellanos during the confinement by Covid-19","The objective of this paper is to analyze the socio-family aspects affecting mental health in Social Work students of the Fundacion Universitaria Juan de Castellanos during the confinement caused by Covid-19. Regarding the methodology, a descriptive study was carried out with a sample of 119 students. The instruments used were a socio-family characterization questionnaire, the Suicide Risk questionnaire, the family Apgar test, and the SRQ. The results show that university students present mental health conditions due to symptoms of depression and anxiety, in addition to difficulties due to academic activities and confinement. The role of the family is highlighted as a protective factor against the pandemic. An adequate family functioning is perceived by the students when they have coping strategies against crises. However, it is necessary to strengthen the response capacity for accompanying university students and families with higher level of vulnerability.","Castro, H. L. A.; Ortiz, P. D. P.; Jimenez, J. G.

"Using the Health Belief Model to Assess Graduate Emotional Wellness: An Empirical Study from Malaysia","Graduate well-being is foundational to academic success, and they are becoming more and more vulnerable. This is as they suffer from mental health challenges like anxiety and depression at rates six times higher than the general population. When the nature of their educational experience changes, such as when they had to stay in their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the stress on their mental health increases. The number of cases of emotional wellness among university students is considered a public health problem, but these young people often do not seek appropriate treatment. This study, therefore, aims to identify the influence of health behavior factors on graduate emotional wellness. This study used a questionnaire with a cross-sectional survey design. Questionnaires were distributed online to graduates from selected Private and Public Higher Education Institutions in Malaysia. The Partial Least Square Equation Model (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the results of the study. Overall findings indicate that the health behavior factors have a significant influence on graduate emotional wellness. The findings from this study will benefit the management, academics, counselors, and other entities, including the Students' Representative Council, in identifying ways to improve services and upgrade the necessary facilities to enhance the graduate's emotional wellness.","Daud, S.; Hanafi, W.

"Direct and indirect relationships between cognitive flexibility and COVID-19 related psychological distress: The mediating role of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies","Objective: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are remarkable on individuals' mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increase in mental health problems and psychological distress in uninfected healthy people. The present study aimed to examine the mediator role of maladaptive cognitive emotion regula-tion strategies in the relationship between cognitive fle-xibility and COVID-19 related psychological distress experienced during the current pandemic. Method: The sample consisted of 351 young adults (86% female and 14% male) who were not infected with COVID-19 aged between 18 to 25 years old. Participants completed the self-report questionnaires, including the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and COVID-19 Related Psychological Distress Scale. Mediation analysis estimated total, indi-rect, and direct effects between cognitive flexibility and COVID-19 related psychological distress. Results: The correlation analyses showed that cognitive flexibility -control dimension was negatively associated with both COVID-19 related psychological distress and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Also, maladap-tive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and COVID-19 related psychological distress was found to be posi-tively correlated. In the study sample, the results of the bootstrap mediation indicated that maladaptive cogni-tive emotion regulation strategies, including self-blame, acceptance, rumination, catastrophizing, and blaming others, fully mediated the relationship between cogni-tive flexibility -control and COVID-19 related psycholog-ical distress. Discussion: Our findings would help psy-chological interventions designed for COVID-19 unin-fected healthy people who have lower-level cognitive flexibility -control dimension by highlighting the promi-nence that the fewer people use maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies, the less they feel COVID-19 related psychological distress.","Sayinta, S.; Kocak, H.

"The Mediating Role of Non-Adaptive Emotion Regulation Strategies in the Relationship between Perceived Social Support and Anxiety in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), spread all over the world in a short time and turned into a pandemic. During COVID-19, individuals' anxiety levels have increased. For this reason, determining the factors that affect anxiety during COVID-19 is crucial for the psychological health of individuals. This study aims to investigate the mediating role of non-adaptive emotion regulation in the relationship between perceived social support and anxiety in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The sample of the study consisted of 327 university students with an average age of 24.27. The data were collected from the participants between May and June 2020. Demographic Information Form, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Brief Form (DERS-16) were used. The independent-sample t-test, One-way ANOVA, Pearson moment product correlation test, and Mediation analysis were all used for statistical analysis. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants stated that they were mostly concerned about the health status of their families. There was a negative correlation between anxiety level, age and perceived social support. Anxiety level had a positive relationship with non -adaptive emotion regulation strategies. In addition, non-adaptive emotion regulation had a full mediating role in the relationship between anxiety and perceived social support. Conclusion: Our study found that the anxiety-reducing effect of perceived social support disappears when individuals use non-adaptive emotion regulation strategies. For this reason, the studies to develop adaptive emotion regulation strategies may be useful in reducing the COVID-19 anxiety.","Akdeniz, B.; Gunduz, M.","https://doi.org/10.5455/PBS.20220222125534","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences; 12(3):106-113, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40250,""

"A study on predictors of nomophobia among undergraduate medical students of a Tertiary Care Teaching Institute in Kolkata, West Bengal","Background and Objectives: Undergraduate medical students are more prone to develop stress, anxiety, and depression;and COVID-19 is an additional source of pressure for them. The present study was conducted with the objectives to estimate the proportion of nomophobia among undergraduate medical students of a tertiary care teaching institute in Kolkata and to find the factors associated with it. Materials and Methods: An observational study, cross-sectional in design, was conducted at a tertiary care teaching institute in Kolkata among 395 undergraduate medical students for a period of 8 weeks. Nomophobia Questionnaire scale was used to measure nomophobia. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 25.0. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was performed to find the predictors of moderate and severe nomophobia. Results: All the medical students had some degree of nomophobia. About 26.8% of them had severe nomophobia, 61.3% had moderate nomophobia, and 11.9% had mild nomophobia. Age up to 20 years and the presence of addiction had statistically significant higher odds of severe nomophobia. Age up to 20 years, the presence of addiction, and up to 6 h' time spent per day with smart phone had significantly higher odds of moderate nomophobia. Conclusion: There was a high proportion of nomophobia among young budding doctors. Those who have already got moderate nomophobia should use smart phones more wisely and judiciously and avoid downloading addictive applications.","Basu, M.; Shukla, V.; Maulik, S.; Kerketta, P.; Bysack, R.

"A Study on the Health and Socioeconomic Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Barriers to Self-management of Diabetes during the Lockdown among Rural Residents of South India","Aim: To study the health and socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the barriers to self-management of diabetes during the lockdown, in rural South India. Materials and Methods: Details of demographic, social, economic, migration and health status were collected using a structured questionnaire from participants aged & GE;18 years belonging to the 21 villages of Chengalpattu and Kancheepuram districts of Tamil Nadu state in south India as part of the Telemedicine pRoject for screENing Diabetes and its complications in rural Tamil Nadu (TREND) study. From the 11,249 TREND participants, a random list of 25% (n = 2812) was system-generated using random numbers and 2812 participants were contacted for the study, of whom 2511 individuals participated. Telephonic interviews were conducted during the lockdown from June to August 2020. Further, qualitative interviews(Focus group discussions) were conducted among 27 individuals with diabetes between September and December 2020. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: The mean age of the study population was 43 & PLUSMN;14 years and 50.4% were women. Diabetes was present in 14.7%, hypertension in 31.9%, generalized and abdominal obesity in 33.3% and 46.5% respectively. When the lockdown was implemented in March 2020, 37% had migrated from urban to rural areas. Lack of daily wage jobs (68%), price of essential commodities (41.7%), social distancing/curfew (34.8%), mental fatigue/depression (14.7%), and loss of job (7.1%) were some reasons stated for their adverse social and financial circumstances. People with diabetes stated that they had to avoid or cut down their regular hospital visits due to travel restrictions. Many of the patients took the same medications for almost a year. Conclusion: Unemployment, poor mental health, and reduced household income were the most significant negative impacts faced by rural residents during the lockdown due to COVID-19. People with diabetes experienced disruptions in diabetes management due to the pandemic.","Lakshmi, N.; Anjana, R.; Siddiqui, M.; Sonie, S.; Pearson, E. R.; Doney, A.; Palmer, C. N.

"COVID-19 Outbreak: Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice among Dental Students in a Tertiary Care Hospital: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background: Dental care settings have the risk of COVID-19 infection due to the aerosols generated during procedures, handling of sharps, and proximity of the dentist to the patient's oropharyngeal region. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional online survey among undergraduate and postgraduate dental students studying in a tertiary care hospital employed a convenient snowball sampling technique. The survey instrument consisted of pretested and prevalidated questionnaire comprising demographic characteristics, 14 items on knowledge domain, 6 items on attitude domain, and 4 items on practice domain modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 20.0 to perform the Chi-square test, MannWhitney, KruskalWallis, Spearman's correlation, and linear regression analysis. Results: The study population comprised 79 (28.9%) males and 194 (71.1%) females, with approximately 53% belonging to the age group of &lt; 20 years. Based on our results, the majority of the general population had inadequate (42.1%) knowledge about the disease with a mean knowledge score was 22.82 & PLUSMN;1.98.

"Resilience Development in Multiple Shocks: Lessons in Mental Health and Well-Being Deterioration during COVID-19","Resilience describes individuals' and organizations' recovery from crises and adaptation to disturbances and adversities. Emerging research shows the deterioration of the population's mental health and well-being during the multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that the resilience developed is insufficient to address the system's persistent shocks. Drawing on the findings on mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and the psychological and organizational resilience theories, we developed a system dynamics theory model exploring how the presence of multiple shocks to the system challenges the population's health and well-being. We initiated the model with three shocks with the same intensities and durations, and then experimented with scenarios in which the strength of multiple shocks (duration and intensity) was attenuated and amplified. The model showed that temporary environmental adjustments with limited long-term stabilized solutions and a lack of health service provision can increase the accumulative risks of health and well-being deterioration. We highlight the role of essential health service sectors' resilience and individuals' and organizations' tolerance of adversities and disturbances in providing sustainable resilience. We conclude by discussing critical factors in organizational and psychological resilience development in crises with multiple shocks to the system.","Zhou, Ke, Zhang, Mengru","https://doi.org/10.3390/systems10050183","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Systems; 10(5):183, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40257,""
"Human-Centered Navigation and Person-Following with Omnidirectional Robot for Indoor Assistance and Monitoring","Robot assistants and service robots are rapidly spreading out as cutting-edge automation solutions to support people in their everyday life in workplaces, health centers, and domestic environments. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic drastically increased the need for service technology to help medical personnel in critical conditions in hospitals and domestic scenarios. The first requirement for an assistive robot is to navigate and follow the user in dynamic environments in complete autonomy. However, these advanced multitask behaviors require flexible mobility of the platform to accurately avoid obstacles in cluttered spaces while tracking the user. This paper presents a novel human-centered navigation system that successfully combines a real-time visual perception system with the mobility advantages provided by an omnidirectional robotic platform to precisely adjust the robot orientation and monitor a person while navigating. Our extensive experimentation conducted in a representative indoor scenario demonstrates that our solution offers efficient and safe motion planning for person-following and, more generally, for human-centered navigation tasks.","Eirale, Andrea, Martini, Mauro, Chiaberge, Marcello","https://doi.org/10.3390/robotics11050108","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Robotics; 11(5):108, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40258,""
"Postvention as Prevention: Coping with Loss at School","Many Pre-K through grade 12 (PK-12) students have experienced traumatic events throughout the pandemic in a myriad of ways including the death of family members and peers, loss of social interaction and increased violence at home. The consequences can be traumatic and manifest themselves in fear, anxiety, anger, isolation, and loneliness. Too often this leads to depression, anxiety, grief, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation and even suicides. This study assesses the impact of an innovative virtual human role-play simulation that prepares PK-12 educators, administrators, and school staff to respond to a student death in the school community by creating communities of support to help manage traumatic loss. The simulation addresses crisis response planning, postvention plans, and provides learners with role-play practice in using evidence-based motivational interviewing communication strategies in conversations with students and colleagues after the occurrence of a death. The sample consisted of educators and staff who were recruited from geographically dispersed areas across the US between January 2021 through December 2021. Matched sample t-tests and ANOVAs were used to assess quantitative data, and a qualitative analysis software, MAXQDA, was used to assess open-ended response data. Results show statistically significant increases in school personnel's preparedness and self-efficacy to recognize signs of trauma in their students and colleagues, and to approach them to talk about concerns and, if necessary, make a referral to support services. Simulations such as this hold tremendous potential in teaching educators how address trauma due to a student death.","Khalid, N.; Zapparrata, N.; Loughlin, K.; Albright, G.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811795","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(18), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40259,""
"Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression during the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Sample of Houston-Based Middle Eastern and North African Residents","The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to anxiety and depression in many communities across the United States. Here, we have focused on a sample of Houston-based Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) residents and assessed the prevalence of anxiety and depression in this community. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaires were used to identify the prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression, respectively. A sociodemographic, general health, and COVID-19 survey was used for a multivariable logistic regression model to determine predictors of anxiety and depression. The outcome of interest was 'minimal/mild';versus 'moderate/severe';anxiety and depression. A total of 368 participants completed the survey, with 24.73% reporting 'moderate/severe';anxiety and 31.79% reporting 'moderate/severe';depression. Male participants were less likely (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.12, 0.75) to have 'moderate/severe';anxiety compared to females. Respondents with self-reported depression were more likely (OR = 3.41, 95% CI = 1.33, 8.83) to have 'moderate/severe';depression. Participants who reported having 'Excellent/Good knowledge';about the prevention of COVID-19 spread were less likely (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.15, 0.93) to have 'moderate/severe';depression, and less likely (OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.07, 0.64) to have 'moderate/severe';anxiety, compared to those who had 'average/poor/terrible';knowledge.

"Assessing the Socio-Economic Consequences of Distance Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The research analysis shows that children in mainstream schools suffered from psychological deterioration (aggressive behaviour, depressive moods, despair about academic underachievement, etc.) when governments implemented measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, and children's education took place remotely for a significant period. This was caused by the lack of social contact, which in turn contributed to the lack of knowledge in individual subjects, a deterioration in physical condition (spinal problems, visual impairment, insufficient muscle development), and the development of specific illnesses related to low physical activity. The research aims to identify the factors of distance learning that may affect student learning achievements. The research methods included an analysis of the scientific literature, and document and content analysis. A summary of the research findings found that the COVID-19 school quarantine had adverse effects on the students' knowledge, social skills, socialisation, and psychological and physical health. It also caused macro- and micro-economic problems. In summary, the research demonstrated that distance education resulted in a decline in the students' achievements and knowledge, miscommunication with their peers and conflict situations. Because of that, there are health-related concerns and additional financial challenges for parents and educational institutions organising distance education. Households also experienced additional expenditure on the infrastructure necessary for distance learning and tutoring services.","Gaidelys, Vaidas, Ciutiene, Ruta, Cibulskas, Gintautas, Miliauskas, Skaidrius, JukÅ¡taite, Jolita, Dumciuviene, Daiva","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12100685","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(10):685, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40261,""

"Historic Precepts and Analysis of Mental Health Legislation in India: Implications for Health Management during Pandemic and Beyond","Mental health has become one of the growing concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic in almost all age groups. Further, the awareness and the facilities in regard to mental health issues stays limited to the privileged class of the society. It has further raised concerns to look for ways to effectively and equitably implement mental health legislation in India, where social stigma in approaching mental health services is also very high. This article analyses the historical precepts of mental health services in India and explores the implementation status of mental health legislation 2017 across different states. It also explores some of the issues related to social stigma which acts as a challenge in utilisation of mental health services. It recommends a need for expansion in mental health professionals' numbers along with adequate infrastructure, especially in rural and remote areas, to make mental health services equitably accessible to all. Mental health awareness generation and therapeutic services for underprivileged class and for COVID-19 affected families should qualify as eligible initiative under corporate social responsibility funding. In this manner, corporates can supplement government efforts to ensure the implementation of mental health legislation in letter and spirit for the benefit of all the citizens.","Nigam, Siddhi","https://doi.org/10.1177/09720634221121360","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Health Management;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40263,""
"'I felt forced to find an alternative': a qualitative analysis of women medical educators' narratives of career transitions","Objectives While institutional and systemic attempts to increase women's participation in medical education have enabled increasing numbers to enter the field and achieve more senior positions, little is known about lived experiences of female clinical educators. Women clinicians are more likely to change careers and work less than full time. This study focuses on women medical educators' narratives of career change, with the aim of exploring the interplay between factors affecting career decision-making, career trajectory and professional development. Methods We employed narrative enquiry approaches to two data sources (55 written accounts of turning points;9 semistructured interviews reflecting on periods of career transition). Through analysing themes within each dataset before comparing and contrasting datasets simultaneously, we identified three areas of inconsistency and tension. Results Participants reported feeling both drawn and pushed into medical education. Some respondents reported that they were compelled by circumstances to enter medical education. Participants' narratives were ambiguous regarding personal and professional identities. Additionally, participants asserted their position as autonomous agents while acknowledging their powerlessness when encountering organisational, social and cultural expectations limiting the ability to make independent choices. Even where primary decisions to pursue medical education were positive and motivated by interest, subsequent disappointments and challenges led some participants to doubt their choices. Conclusions Career advancement in medical education may involve women taking significant personal or career sacrifices, partly due to the continued existence of a medical culture allowing men to dominate senior ranks. Women medical educators achieving satisfying senior roles in the field may harbour lingering regret and resentment at the personal and career costs.","Eghosa-Aimufua, O.; Boam, A.; Webb, K.

"Predicting Depression in Canada by Automatic Filling of Beck's Depression Inventory Questionnaire","The risk for depression and anxiety increased as people adjusted to a new normal after the COVID-19 pandemic. Early detection and appropriate onset treatment and support can reduce the consequences of depression. Automatic detection of depression in social media has recently become an important area of investigation. However, because of the lack of extensive annotated data, we propose a method for using a model that learns to answer a depression questionnaire and apply it to make populationlevel predictions. We used the eRisk 2021 Task 3 training dataset to build an automated model to fill the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire. We selected the best performing model for each group of questions based on predefined metrics and consolidated those models into one model (called the BDI _Multi_Model). The BDI _Multi_Model achieved better performance than the state-of-the-art for this challenging task. Then, we used this model for inference on a Canadian population dataset and compared its predictions with the statistics of the most recent mental health survey conducted by Statistics Canada. The correlation between the inference of the answered questionnaire based on our BDI _Multi_Model and the official statistics showed a strong Pearson correlation of 0:90.","Skaik, R.

"Green workers of Himalayas: evidence of transformation induced regeneration","Purpose The investigation of the relationship between the future of humanity and the future of ecology is a pertinent issue. In this context, the study aimed to explore people's travel experience in the Himalayan region of India for transformation and well-being and how transformation induces their involvement in regenerative practices. The authors investigated if transformations contribute to the well-being of all living beings and the environment and induce involvement in regenerative practices? Design/methodology/approach The authors preferred qualitative research design and selected narrative inquiry as a research approach to bring individuals' life stories to the centre stage for examination. Accordingly, diachronic data was collected, and a paradigmatic type of narrative inquiry was applied that uses paradigmatic analytical procedures to produce thematic categories and taxonomies from the database. Findings Nine themes were identified and discussed in the light of existing literature. Transformational tourism promotes well-being and reduces mental health anomalies. The study participants used words like calm, compose, stress-free, and compassion, indicating enhanced consciousness. They also reported satisfaction and induced environmentally friendly behaviour after serving the community and environment at tourist destinations situated in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and the Union territory of Ladakh of the Himalayan region of India. Originality/value The paper collates evidence to establish a correlation between transformation and regeneration. There is a suggestion that transformative travel leads to participation in regenerative activities. The paper is based on people's experiences described as green workers of the Indian Himalayas and provides empirical conclusions that support the argument of transformational induced regenerative tourism.","Bhalla, R.; Chowdhary, N.","https://doi.org/10.1108/JTF-12-2021-0273","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Tourism Futures; 8(3):380-392, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40266,""
"Delivering remote therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study with service users accessing a community personality disorder service","Purpose The purpose of this study is to qualitatively explore the views and opinions of service users accessing remote therapy through a community forensic personality disorder service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative exploratory approach was adopted. Nine community forensic service users accessing virtual/telephone therapy through a community forensic mental health service were interviewed using semi-structed interviews. Data was analysed using Braun and Clarke (2006) thematic analysis techniques. Findings Analysis resulted in three overall themes: experience of communication in the therapeutic relationship;impacts of the change to remote working and making the best of what we have. A further seven subthemes were developed. A range of advantages and disadvantages to remote therapy were highlighted. Research limitations/implications This study was based on a small sample of service users accessing one community forensic service in England, and therefore caution should be taken when generalising the findings. All interviews were conducted remotely and thus may have only supported those who are able to engage in this way. Practical implications This paper has the potential to inform future remote therapy guidelines. Health services should consider keeping some elements of remote working and offering this as a choice to all service users. Originality/value This study is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first study that attempts to explore the experiences of individuals accessing remote therapy within a forensic population who have personality disorders or traits.","White, Jasmin, Nillo, Anne-Marie, Rowsell, Kathryn, Roberts, Victoria, Dudley-Hicks, Duncan, Urbasch, Michael, Cordwell, John","https://doi.org/10.1108/jfp-11-2021-0060","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Journal of Forensic Practice;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40267,""
"Determinants of mental disorders of Afghan migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic","Purpose Afghan migrants are at an increased risk of mental disorders due to various political, economic and security-associated stressors. COVID-19 has brought extra concerns for this group of migrants around the world. Few studies have examined how the perception of the host society and perceived stress are associated with the mental health of migrants during the COVD-19 pandemic. This study aims to examine the role of perceived justice, freedom and the burden of COVID-19 on experienced stress and depression among Afghan migrants in Iran. Design/methodology/approach N = 497 participants representing the Afghan migrant community between 15 and 80 years old participated in the study. The target population was recruited from Afghan migrants residing in Kerman city in Iran, the capital of one of the provinces with the highest number of Afghan migrants in Iran. The participants answered questions on depression, positive mental health and a series of stressors such as perceived justice, freedom and the burden of COVID-19. Data was collected in November and December 2021 during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. Findings The authors found a significant effect of the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrants' perceived stress and depression. On the other hand, perceptions of justice and freedom in the host country can significantly reduce stress and depression. The results show that stress mediates the effect of justice, freedom and the burden of COVID-19 on depression. In addition, positive mental health moderates the impact of stress on depression. Originality/value The current study is one of the pioneering studies that examines the determinants of Afghan migrants' mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran.","Khozaei, F.; Carbon, C.

S-RLS is a longitudinal study that tracks a representative sample of approximately 2,500 registered Syrian refugee households in Jordan. It collects comprehensive data on sociodemographic variables, health and well-being, preferences, social capital, attitudes, and safety and crime perceptions. We use these data to document sociodemographic characteristics of Syrian refugees in Jordan and compare them to representative populations in the 2016 Jordan Labor Market Panel Survey (JLMPS). Our findings point to lags in basic service access, housing quality, and educational attainment for Syrian refugees relative to non-refugees. The impacts of the pandemic may partially explain these disparities. The data also show that most Syrian refugees have not recovered economically after Covid-19 and have larger gender disparities in income, employment, prevalence of child marriage, and gender attitudes than their non-refugee counterparts. Finally, mental health problems were common for Syrian refugees in 2020, with depression indicated among more than 45 per cent of the phone survey sample and 61 per cent of the in-person survey sample.","Stillman, S.; Rozo, S.

"How can employees break free from helplessness in critical work incidents?","Critical incidents, defined as traumatic time-limited events, often happen unexpectedly, and have largely impacted employees in many ways. In this study, we apply the conservation of resources theory as our overarching framework to examine whether and when employees involved in a critical work incident would experience helplessness at work, which may consequently spill over into the life domain and negatively impact their well-being. Taking the COVID-19 as a typical example of critical incidents, we collected multiwave data from 765 Chinese doctors. The results showed that perceived COVID-19 event strength is positively related to doctors' helplessness at work, which further negatively impacts their presence of meaning in life. Besides, meaningful work exacerbates the effect of perceived COVID-19 event strength on doctors' helplessness, while social support and psychological detachment reduce the negative impact of helplessness on their presence of meaning in life. Our study calls attention to protection of the mental health and psychological well-being of employees faced with critical incidents at work and their psychological recovery, and sheds light on the effectiveness of social support and psychological detachment as resource replenishing mechanisms, while cautions against further emphasizing work meaningfulness to employees confronted with a highly novel, disruptive, and critical work event.","Meng, Liang, Lin, Xinyue, Du, Juan, Lu, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1037/str0000264","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Stress Management;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40270,""
"Web-based intervention to reduce intimate partner violence during perinatal period: A modified protocol in response to the COVID-19 pandemic","Perinatal women are at increased risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), associated with psychiatric disorders and partner revictimization. We describe changes that were made, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to an in-person randomized controlled study of perinatal women with IPV who had sought mental health treatment in the last year. All phases of the study's in-person delivered computerized protocol were modified for remote delivery. Special attention was given to study participantsâ€™ privacy and safety, especially with regard to the use of technology. We describe study protocol and consent procedures that were made to accommodate remote delivery of the study. All phases of remote delivery of the study have been implemented successfully and safely. Compared to the first three months of in-person delivery, the first three months of remote recruitment found that more participants were screened (69% vs. 36%) and more were enrolled in the study (13% vs. 8%). To our knowledge, this is the first remote delivered study involving participants with IPV to use the 5-item Danger Assessment and a spyware and stalkerware survey as screening tools. We demonstrate that remote delivery can reduce the risk of compromising the safety and privacy of study participants with IPV.","Johnson, Elizabeth, Jenssen, Sofia, Wernette, Golfo Tzilos, Tweel, Tasneem, Johnson, Dawn, Zlotnick, Caron","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114895","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114895, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40271,""
"Effect of aerobic exercise on lung regeneration and inflammation in mice","Aerobic exercise is well recognized to be beneficial to physical and mental health. Many studies have shown that aerobic exercise can improve the human immune system, but whether it could affect lung regeneration and inflammation remained unclear. Bronchioloalveolar stem cells (BASCs) play a key role in lung regeneration and repair, but it is unclear whether aerobic exercise affects BASCs. Here, we randomly divided 8Ã‚Â weeks old male mice into three groups: the control group without any aerobic exercise; the rest group which received 2Ã‚Â weeks of aerobic exercise (running wheel training) plus 5Ã‚Â days' rest, and the exercise group which received 2Ã‚Â weeks of aerobic exercise without any rest. Our data indicated that mice in the exercise group had significantly increased BASCs compared to the control group, such difference did not exist in the rest group. Furthermore, the immune profiling suggested that lung inflammation was slightly up-regulated in the exercise group, particularly the inflammatory monocytes and IL-17A<sup>+</sup> T cells. In conclusion, we provide direct evidence showing that aerobic exercise can facilitate lung regeneration with mild inflammatory effect, this finding is of great importance in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Wu, Zhang, Zhou, Rao, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2022.152296","20221103","Aerobic exercise; Bronchioalveolar stem cells; Immune; Inflammation; Lung regeneration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40272,""
"Stable through the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a longitudinal telephone interview study in psychiatric outpatients","The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with far-reaching changes all over the world. Health care systems were and are also affected. Little is known about the impact of these changes and the duration of the pandemic on people with mental disorders. The aim of this longitudinal follow-up study was to investigate the mental health status, medical care provision, and attitudes towards the pandemic of these people at the end of the second pandemic lockdown in Germany in 2021, and to compare these findings with the results of 2020. People with mental disorders currently receiving treatment in the psychiatric outpatient department of the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany, were asked about depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), self-reported medical care provision, attitudes and social and emotional aspects of the pandemic (social support [ESSI], perceived stress [PSS-4], loneliness [UCLA-3-LS], and resilience [BRS]) using structured telephone interviews. In total, N = 75 participants who had already participated in the first survey in 2020 took part in the follow-up telephone interviews. The most frequent clinician-rated diagnoses were attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 21; 28.0%) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 16; 21.3%). In comparison to 2020, a significantly higher proportion of participants reported no problems in receiving medical care provision. Compared to the previous year, the resilience of the participants had significantly decreased. Depressive symptoms, social support, perceived stress, and loneliness remained stable. Significantly more participants felt restricted by the pandemic-related government measures in 2021 than in 2020. This study highlights the importance for continued efforts to maintain stable medical care provision for people with mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, as except for a decrease in resilience, mental health status remained stable. Nonetheless there is still a need for continued treatment to stabilise and improve this status.","Kertzscher, Baldofski, Kohls, Schomerus, Rummel-Kluge","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276982","20221103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40273,""
"Effects of social isolation on quality of life in elderly adults","Prolonged periods of social isolation are known to have significant negative health consequences and reduce quality of life, an effect that is particularly pronounced in older populations. Despite the known deleterious effects of social isolation, a key component of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the issuance of stay at home and/or shelter in place orders. Relatively little is known about the potential effects these periods of social isolation could have on older adults, and less still is known about potential risk factors or protective factors that modulate these effects. Here, we describe results from a longitudinal study in which we measured quality of life both prior to and immediately following a one-month period of social isolation associated with the issuance and revocation of a shelter in place order (April 6, 2020 through May 4, 2020) in the state of South Carolina. Healthy adult participants (N = 62) between the ages of 60 and 80 who had already completed quality of life questionnaires prior to isolation again completed the questionnaires following a one-month order to shelter in place. Quality of life significantly decreased during the social isolation period, with older participants showing the greatest declines. Participants with higher levels of physical activity and better physical/mental health going into the isolation period tended to show greater decreases in quality of life over time. These results highlight the negative consequences of even short bouts of social isolation for the elderly and suggest that reductions in social contact related to COVID-19 may have significant effects on mental health and emotional well-being, at least among older individuals.","Newman-Norlund, Newman-Norlund, Sayers, McLain, Riccardi, Fridriksson","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276590","20221103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40274,""
"Uptake and effects of psychological first aid training for healthcare workers' wellbeing in nursing homes: A UK national survey","Psychological First Aid is a brief intervention based on international guidance from the World Health Organisation. Free to access online training in the intervention was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic in UK. We aimed to determine the uptake of Psychological First Aid training among healthcare workers in care homes in the UK and to assess its effects on their wellbeing. This was a sequential mixed methods design. Healthcare workers (nurses and carers) working in care homes in the UK were surveyed about their uptake of Psychological First Aid, their stress, coping efficacy and the key concepts of Psychological First Aid (safety, calmness, hopefulness, connectedness, and accomplishment). Those that completed the Psychological First Aid training were asked to share their experiences via qualitative survey. Data collection was conducted between June and October 2021. Analyses included descriptive statistics and regression analysis. A six step thematic analysis was used to interpret the qualitative data. 388 participants responded to the survey. The uptake of Psychological First Aid training was 37 (9.5%). Psychological first aid was a significant predictor for coping efficacy (ÃŽÂ² = 17.54, p = .001). Participants with a physical or mental health condition experienced higher stress and lower coping regardless of PFA training. Four themes were identified from the qualitative analysis: self-awareness and growth, relationships with others, overcoming stress and accessibility. While this study suggests some benefits to healthcare workers in care home settings undergoing PFA the poor uptake of the training warrants further investigation. Care home staff need psychological support. This gap remains as few completed PFA training. This is the first study in UK and worldwide to look at the effects of psychological first aid on stress and coping in this population and it warrants further investigation.","Schoultz, McGrogan, Beattie, Macaden, Carolan, Dickens","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277062","20221103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40275,""
"Anxiety and depression status prior to radioactive iodine therapy among differentiated thyroid cancer patients during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic","The psychological health of thyroid cancer patients cannot be ignored; however, few studies have been conducted on the psychological status and influencing factors of thyroid cancer patients before radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors for anxiety and depression in thyroid cancer patients prior to RAI therapy. Clinical data were collected from patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patientsÃ‚Â preparing for RAI therapy. Anxiety and depression were measured before RAI therapy using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). We used the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis to identify independent risk factors for anxiety and depression. A total of 112 patients with thyroid cancer were included. Of these, 72.32% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°81) were female, with a mean age of 41.50Ã‚Â years. Anxiety and depression were reported by 46 (41.08%) and 38 (33.93%) patients, respectively. Based on the chi-square test and univariate logistic regression analysis, being female and having ever-experienced RAI therapy were significant risk factors for anxiety and depression among DTCs prior to RAI therapy. On multivariable analysis, the results of model 2 which included age, sex, education level, and ever suffering radioactive iodine therapy showed that being female was markedly associated with anxiety and depression in these patients, while having ever undergone RAI therapy was significantly related to anxiety but not depression. The incidence of anxiety and depression among patients withÃ‚Â DTCÃ‚Â prior to RAI therapy were 41.08% and 33.93%, respectively.Ã‚Â Being female and having ever experienced RAI therapy significantly influenced anxiety and depression. Based on these findings, anxiety and depression assessment should be an important part of pre-RAI therapy in patients with DTC, and appropriate psychological nursing intervention can be carried out for key patients.","Qiao, Gao, Tong, Shen, Ma, Lv, Li","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-022-07422-7","20221103","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Differentiated thyroid cancer; Radioactive iodine therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40276,""
"A critical period for pandemic adaptation: The evolution of depressive symptomatology in a representative sample of adults across a 17-month period during COVID-19","This 17-month longitudinal study on a representative sample of 4,361 Norwegian adults employs an observational ABAB design across 6 repeated assessments and 3 pandemic waves to systematically investigate the evolution of depressive symptomatology across all modifications of social distancing protocols (SDPs) from their onset to termination. Using Latent Change Score Models to analyze 26,166 observations, the study empirically corroborates that critical fluctuations in depressive symptomatology within and across individuals occur during the first 3 months of the pandemic, after which symptom profiles are predominantly consolidated throughout the pandemic period. Contrary to established belief, female sex, young age, lower education and preexisting psychiatric diagnosis only served as adequate predictors of the initial shocks to symptomatology observed during the onset of the pandemic and did not adequately predict subsequent change observed in symptoms within and across individuals. Population-level analyses demonstrated that symptom levels strongly covaried with the presence and strictness of SDPs and were unrelated to COVID-19 incidence rates. Upon predominant termination of SDPs, population-level symptoms began declining, while large heterogeneity was present across the adult population. Detrimental long-term adversities were revealed by 10% of the adults. These individuals displayed chaotic adaptation to the pandemic and its SDPs, exhibiting substantial increases in clinical levels of symptomatology ensuing partial reopening of society and through the remainder of the pandemic, with these deleterious symptoms projected to remain heightened ahead. Frequency of quarantine exposure was incrementally tied with increases in contemporaneously experienced and long-term depressive adversities, with information obtainment through unmonitored sources further associated with contemporaneous and long-term states of heightened symptomatology.

"Psychiatric and neurological complications of long COVID","COVID-19 was primarily considered a pulmonary disease with extrapulmonary manifestations. As the pandemic spread, there has been growing evidence that the disease affects various organs/systems, including the central and peripheral nervous systems. Accumulation of clinical data demonstrates that in a large population of survivors impairments in the function of one or more organs may persist for a long time, a phenomenon commonly known as post COVID or long COVID. Fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, such as concentration problems, short-term memory deficits, general memory loss, a specific decline in attention, language and praxis abilities, encoding and verbal fluency, impairment of executive functions, and psychomotor coordination, are amongst the most common and debilitating features of neuropsychatric symptoms of post COVID syndrome. Several patients also suffer from compromised sleep, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients with long COVID may demonstrate brain hypometabolism, hypoperfusion of the cerebral cortex and changes in the brain structure and functional connectivity. Children and adolescents represent a minority of COVID-19 cases, so not surprisingly data on the long-term sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infections in these age groups are scarce. Although the pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, epidemiology, and risk factors of the acute phase of COVID-19 have been largely explained, these areas are yet to be explored in long COVID. This review aims to provide an update on what is currently known about long COVID effects on mental health.","Zawilska, KuczyÃ…â€žska","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.10.045","20221103","Anxiety; Cognitive deficits; Depression; Long COVID; Mental health; Post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40278,""
"Mental health symptoms and sleep quality of asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2Ã‚Â infected individuals during the Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai China","To investigate mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, and sleep status) and their associated factors among people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant during the quarantine period in Shanghai. To investigate the mental health symptoms among participants with SARS-CoV-2 omicron infection, an anonymous online survey questionnaire was used. The survey panel included the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and 22-item Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS). Group comparisons and correlation analyses were employed to explore the epidemiological characteristics of patients and factors related to depression and anxiety symptoms. A total of 960 participants completed the survey. Of the total respondents, 583 participants (60.7%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 34.33 (9.21) years (95% CI: 33.74-34.91). The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among the participants was 13.7% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 151, 95% CI: 11.6%-15.7%) and 8.6% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 90, 95% CI: 6.9%-10.3%), respectively. Age-stratified analysis showed that the prevalence of anxiety among the 36- to 45-year-old group (12.9%; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 35, 8.9%-16.9%) was significantly higher than that of the 18- to 15-year-old group (7.4%; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 42, 5.3%-9.6%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .011). Spearman's correlation analyses showed that rumination (assessed by the RRS) was significantly and positively correlated with depression (rhoÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .706, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001) and anxiety symptoms (rhoÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .758, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). The results suggest that female and middle-aged populations manifest higher susceptibility to mental health distress during the current Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A descriptive, single-center, qualitative study METHODS: The enrollment for data collection included childbearing mothers aged 18 years and over between November 2021 and April 2022. The researchers invited them to write about their personal experiences during the isolation period of the first pandemic wave. The descriptive phenomenological analysis of the data was carried out using the method described by Mortari. A total of 50 mothers were recruited, of whom 28 were primiparous (56.0%) and 22 multiparous (44.0%). From the analysis of the interviews, five main themes emerged that enclose the experience of both primiparous and multiparous mothers: ""The negative feeling: between loneliness, sadness and fear""; ""The comfort of being cared for: between humanity and competence""; ""Family proximity: between comfort and stress""; ""Symbiotic intimacy: bonding; Managing physical pain and consciousness of being resilient women"". The study showed that the discomfort associated with the absence of family support in the phase of labor and childbirth was compensated by the professionalism of the health staff and allowed new mothers to experience moments of great intimacy with the child. Such data could help create recommendations based on the assisted person's experiences to ensure that care is increasingly attentive and tailored to the needs of mothers and thus, of children.","Bolgeo, Gambalunga, Di Matteo, Gatti, Roberti, Dealberti, Fadda, Grassi, Gambarini, Iacorossi, Maconi","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13890","20221103","Birth; Covid-19; lived experience; mother; storytelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40280,""

Between September and November 2020, this cross-sectional study enrolled 118 chronic schizophrenia patients. The interview with patients included Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Lebanese Anxiety Scale-10, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being-12. The results were analyzed by using linear regressions (Enter method), with anxiety, depression, total PANSS score, positive PANSS, negative PANSS, and general psychopathology PANSS subscales as dependent variables. Spirituality, fear of COVID-19, and the interaction of spirituality with fear of COVID-19 were independents variables. Fear of COVID-19 was positively correlated with increased total PANSS scores (Beta=0.90, P=0.030). Higher spirituality was significantly associated with lower anxiety (Beta=-0.14, P=0.009), lower depression (Beta=-0.21, P=0.001), lower total PANSS score (Beta=-0.90, P=0.004), lower negative PANSS score (Beta=-0.23, P=0.009), and lower general psychopathology PANSS score (Beta=-0.61, P=0.001). In patients with high fear of COVID-19, having low spirituality was significantly associated with higher anxiety, depression, and psychotic symptoms.

A total of 233 eligible questionnaires were received. Among them, 130 people (57.08%) were probably anxious and 141 (60.52%) people were clinically depressed. Poor sleep was considered an independent risk factor for anxiety (OR = 7.164, 95% CI: 3.365 15.251, <i>p</i> = 0.000) and depression (OR = 6.899, 95% CI: 3.392 14.030, <i>p</i> = 0.000). A high PHQ-9 score was considered an independent risk factor for general fatigue (OR = 1.697, 95% CI: 1.481 1.944, <i>p</i> = 0.000). Mental fatigue (OR = 1.092, 95% CI: 1.027 1.161, <i>p</i> = 0.005) and fatigue response to sleep/rest (OR = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.011 1.076 <i>p</i> = 0.008) were considered independent risk factors for general fatigue. Poor quality of sleep led to probable anxiety, depression, and general fatigue. Mental fatigue and fatigue response to sleep/rest were independent risk factors for depression, which merits attention for battling COVID-19.","Tang, Pei, Wang, Jiang, Liu, Chen, Meng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1018069","20221103","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; fatigue status; medical workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40284,""
"Tiredness, depression, and sleep disorders in frontline healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam: A field hospital study","The COVID-19 outbreak witnessed in the autumn of 2021 led to unprecedented changes in healthcare systems in some emerging countries. Many field-hospitals, temporary sites of care for COVID-19 patients, were built around the country and followed by the healthcare workers who were mobilized. This study aimed to measure sleep disorders, depression, and fatigue in volunteers working at field hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. This was a cross-sectional study. The self-report questionnaire was used for each study subject. Sleep characters, including STOP's elements were questioned. Healthcare workers' burnout was detected by using Pichot's questionnaire. One hundred front-line healthcare workers (FHWs), predominantly last year and graduated medical students, were included in the study (86% female subjects). The mean sleep-time of FHWs before, while working, and during the isolation period after working at COVID-19 field hospitals were: 7.78 Ã‚Â± 1.48, 5.71 Ã‚Â± 1.40, and 8.78 Ã‚Â± 2.31 h per day, respectively. Burnout was not a crucial issue for these volunteer subjects. The mean scores of Pichot's Fatigue Scale and Pichot's Depression Scale, measured after 4 weeks working at field hospitals, were 4.18 Ã‚Â± 5.42 and 2.54 Ã‚Â± 3.36, respectively. Thirteen participants were suspected of depression. The fatigue scores decreased significantly in the group who claimed short sleep latency. The factor that increased the depression score was ""anxious feeling"" (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Other significant factors were ""short sleep latency,"" ""observed sleep apnea,"" ""tiredness, daily sleepiness"" and ""snoring."" Appropriate work schedule, better sleep conditions, and mental health support could be helpful for FHWs. The mandatory 2 weeks of isolation after working in field hospitals provided opportunity for FHWs' recovery.","Duong-Quy, Tran-Duc, Hoang-Chau-Bao, Bui-Diem, Vu-Tran-Thien, Nguyen-Nhu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.984658","20221103","COVID-19; burnout; depression; frontline health workers; sleep disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40285,""
"A topic trend analysis on COVID-19 literature","In the past 2 years, the number of scientific publications has grown exponentially. The COVID-19 outbreak hugely contributed to this dramatic increase in the volume of published research. Currently, text mining of the volume of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 publications is limited to the first months of the outbreak. We aim to identify the major topics in COVID-19 literature collected from several citational sources and analyze the temporal trend from November 2019 to December 2021. We performed an extensive literature search on SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19 publications on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) and a structural topic modelling on the retrieved abstracts. The temporal trend of the recognized topics was analyzed. Furthermore, a comparison between our corpus and the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) repository was performed. We collected 269,186 publications and identified 10 topics. The most popular topic was related to the clinical pictures of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has a constant trend, and the least popular includes studies on COVID-19 literature and databases. ""Telemedicine"", ""Vaccine development"", and ""Epidemiology"" were popular topics in the early phase of the pandemic; increasing topics in the last period are ""COVID-19 impact on mental health"", ""Forecasting"", and ""Molecular Biology"". ""Education"" was the second most popular topic, which emerged in September 2020. We identified 10 topics for classifying COVID-19 research publications and estimated a nonlinear temporal trend that gives an overview of their unfolding over time. Several citational databases must be searched to retrieve a complete set of studies despite the efforts to build repositories for COVID-19 literature. Our collected data can help build a more focused literature search between November 2019 and December 2021 when carrying out systematic and rapid reviews and our findings can give a complete picture on the topic.","Urru, Sciannameo, Lanera, Salaris, Gregori, Berchialla","https://doi.org/10.1177/20552076221133696","20221103","COVID-19; information retrieval; open science; research practice; science communications; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40286,""
"Psychological implications of Covid-19 in healthcare workers","The Covid-19 outbreak has led to an unprecedented burden on the healthcare infrastructure. High morbidity and mortality rates have resulted in a state of stress and distress among the general population which has also impacted health professionals. This study was conducted to identify mental health disturbances among health professionals during the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a cross-sectional study, conducted in a Medical College in Himachal Pradesh, India. A self-administered anonymized questionnaire was administered to the healthcare workers. Mental health status was assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). In addition, a 15-item questionnaire was prepared to identify the probable causes of stress in HCWs during the Covid-19 Pandemic. A statistical analysis used t-test was used to find the significance of the correlation between the PHQ-ADS score and the agreement score of different factors. The response rate for the questionnaire was 27%. Anxiety and depression were seen in 29% of participants, ranging from mild (18.3%), moderate (4.7%), and severe (5.9%). Among females 43.7% of the participants and among males, 13.1% had anxiety and depression. High PHQ-ADS scores were seen in nursing staff (70%) and postgraduate students (30%), who were in the third decade of life. Most (81.7%) of the HCWs were concerned about transmitting the disease to their near ones. Fear of coming to the hospital and dealing with patients. Even sub-threshold syndromes among HCWs need to be identified before they evolve into overt diseases. The psychological needs of healthcare workers should be prioritized as they are key players in the fight against Covid-19.","Garg, Gupta, Puri, Kakkar","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_208_22","20221103","COVID-19; factors; healthcare workers; mental health; psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40287,""
"Health education and global health: Practices, applications, and future research","Health education is a crucial consideration in the healthcare system and has the potential to improve global health. Recently, researchers have expressed interest in streamlining health education, utilizing digital tools and flexible curriculums to make it more accessible, and expanding beyond disease and substance abuse prevention. They have also expressed interest in promoting global health through health and safety promotion programs. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, the refugee crisis, and overpopulation, healthcare crises are erupting all over the world. A lack of health education has and will continue to have a profound impact on community healthcare indicators, particularly in low-income nations. Current priorities within the health education sector include digitization, equity, and infectious disease prevention. Studies and data from university journals and other academic databases were analyzed in a literature review. Health education programs have a significant positive impact on attitudes and behaviors regarding global health. Improving upon these programs by digitizing them and expanding upon the scope of health education will help ensure that such interventions and programs make a significant difference.","Rizvi","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_218_22","20221103","Chronic illness; digital health education; global health; health education; health education programs; health promotion; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40288,""
"Online versus face-to-face metacognitive educational counseling program on anxiety and meta-worry in women with a history of miscarriage: A randomized clinical trial","In the COVID-19 outbreak, women with a history of miscarriage need more mental health. Anxiety and meta-worry as consequences of miscarriage, besides concerns due to pregnancy during coronavirus, show the necessity of appropriate online and face-to-face educational counseling. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of online metacognitive educational counseling versus face-to-face method on anxiety and meta-worry in these women. In this randomized clinical trial, 80 women with a history of miscarriage, anxiety, and meta-worry referred to Imam Jafar Sadegh hospital (labor, women ward and women clinic), Meybod, Iran, were selected conveniently and randomly assigned into two groups (<i>n</i> = 20/each). The participants received 8-session metacognitive educational counseling package online or face-to-face. Data were collected by Beck Anxiety Inventory, Wellz meta-worry questionnaire at baseline, week eight, and follow up as primary outcomes and analyzed via SPSS software (Anova and Repeated measure statistic tests). Anxiety in the 12<sup>th</sup> week (online group 13.75 Ã‚Â± 3.59 vs. face to face 18.25 Ã‚Â± 5.91, <i>P</i> = 0.04) was statistical significantly less than baseline (respectively 22.15 Ã‚Â± 5.67 vs. 22.35 Ã‚Â± 4.93, <i>P</i> = 0.56); with fewer anxiety scores in the online group.

"The relative contribution of COVID-19 infection versus COVID-19 related occupational stressors to insomnia in healthcare workers","Healthcare workers have experienced high rates of psychiatric symptom burden and occupational attrition during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying contributory factors can inform prevention and mitigation measures. Here, we explore the potential contributions of occupational stressors vs COVID-19 infection to insomnia symptoms in US healthcare workers. An online self-report survey was collected between September 2020 and July 2022 from N=594 US healthcare workers, with longitudinal follow-up up to 9 months. Assessments included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and a 13-item scale assessing COVID-19 related occupational stressors. Insomnia was common (45% of participants reported at least moderate and 9.2% reported severe symptoms at one or more timepoint) and significantly associated with difficulty completing work-related tasks, increased likelihood of occupational attrition, and thoughts of suicide or self-harm (all p&lt;.0001). In multivariable regression with age, gender, and family COVID-19 history as covariates, past two-week COVID-related occupational stressors, peak COVID-related occupational stressors, and personal history of COVID-19 infection were all significantly related to past two-week ISI scores (ÃŽÂ²=1.7Ã‚Â±0.14SE, ÃŽÂ²=0.08Ã‚Â±0.03, and ÃŽÂ²=0.69Ã‚Â±0.22 respectively). Although similar results were found for the PCL-5, when ISI and PCL-5 items were separated by factor, COVID-19 infection was significantly related only to the factor consisting of sleep-related items. Both recent occupational stress and personal history of COVID-19 infection were significantly associated with insomnia in healthcare workers. These results suggest that both addressing occupational stressors and reducing rates of COVID-19 infection are important to protect healthcare workers and the healthcare workforce.","Hendrickson, McCall, Rosser, Pagulayan, Chang, Sano, Thomas, Raskind","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.27.22281582","20221103","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40290,""
"Changes in health behaviors and conditions during COVID-19 pandemic strict campus lockdown among Chinese university students","To explore how a stringent campus lockdown affects the physical activity (PA), sleep and mental health of Chinese university students living in student dormitories during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on PA, sleep and mental health were collected between 24 March and 4 April 2022 from 2084 university students (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, 61.1% male students) <i>via</i> an online questionnaire distributed by the students' advisers of each dormitory. The Chinese short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-C), Athens Insomnia Scale (CAIS) and General Health Questionnaire 12-item (GHQ-12) were applied. The Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate the PA profile differences between genders, before and during the lockdown period and between students' living environments. Chi-squared (<i>Ãâ€¡</i>2) or Fisher's exact test was used to assess changes in health behaviors by gender and students' living environment compared to before the lockdown. A mediation model was used to examine whether sleep disorder mediated the relationship between PA and mental health in different students' living environments. Participants reported a significant decrease in weekly total PA levels (63.9%). Mean daily sedentary time increased by 21.4% and daily lying time increased by 10.7% compared to before lockdown. Among the participants, 21.2% had experienced insomnia, and 39.0% reported having high mental distress. Female students reported 10% higher rates of sleep disorders than male students (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and also experienced a higher incidence of mental disorders (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Students living with three roommates had a larger decrease in frequencies and durations of participation in light PA than other students (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). PA was negatively associated with sleep and mental health, and sleep disorder was a mediating factor between PA and mental health in the students living with two and three roommates. This study showed that strict lockdowns within university dormitories during the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the health of university students by changing their health behaviors, physical activity and sleep.

"Neuroscience on breaking bad news: Effects of physicians' response on patient emotion and trust","The outbreak of COVID-19, due to restrictions on patients' access to hospitals, makes patient mental health a severe problem to solve, especially for cancer patients. Delivering bad news has become one of the abilities that physicians need to improve. Former research has proposed communication strategies like SPIKES to respond to patients' emotions. However, existing strategies lack systematic and structural responses to different cues and concerns of patients. This study aims to investigate whether and how the response styles of information delivery, empathy, and authority affect patient emotions and trust in order to present a structural response system. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between strategies and EEG markers to moderate emotions and trust. This research selects different scenarios and strategies in the context of breast cancer and performs two experiments. First, we performed a behavioral experiment with 93 medical students and 15 breast cancer patients. Moreover, an EEG experiment with 53 students <i>via</i> video stimuli was conducted to explore the moderate function between strategies and emotions/trust. We use time-frequency analysis and the repeated measure ANOVA method to explore the association between strategy and EEG components. Furthermore, we perform a GLM method to investigate the relationship between EEG components and patient emotion and trust. For the first time, this study proposes the strategy matrix. The response strategies NPIm and NRIa play important roles in this system. In behavioral experiments, information delivery, empathy, and authority strategy significantly affect emotions and trust. The scenario is significant as a moderator. In the EEG experiment, strategy NPIm has more correlation with parietal alpha power than other strategies, and parietal alpha power has a significant effect on emotions, which verifies that empathy-related cerebral activities affect emotions and trust. According to the strategy matrix, physicians could apply strategy ERIa in most scenarios, and strategy NRIa in many scenarios, which means information provision is significant when it comes to responding to patients' cues and concerns. The most important strategy that physicians need to avoid is the authority strategy. Refusing to respond to patients' cues and concerns may cause their dislike. Moreover, through the EEG experiment, we verify that empathy affects emotions and trust from a neuroscience perspective and propose parietal alpha and frontal alpha as neuro-markers to moderate emotions and trust. Physicians could adjust strategies through these EEG markers.","Song, Xiu, Li, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1006695","20221103","EEG experiment; breaking bad news; communication strategy; patient emotion; physicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s response; time-frequency analysis; video-mediated","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40292,""
"NewÃ¢â‚¬â€˜onset neuropsychiatric sequelae and 'longÃ¢â‚¬â€˜COVID' syndrome (Review)","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a widespread impact on individuals' mental health through indirect psychological and social mechanisms, related to factors such as fear of infection or death, social isolation, lack of social support and financial instability. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has also been associated with the development or recurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, both during the acute phase, as well as during the post-acute 'long-COVID' phase. In addition to the COVID-19 survivors with a mental health history that are at a high risk of experiencing a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms following resolution of acute COVID-19, there is accumulating evidence that a diagnosis of COVID-19 may also be associated with new-onset neuropsychiatric morbidity among survivors without pre-existing mental health disorders. In particular, studies investigating the incidence of post-acute neuropsychiatric sequelae, based mostly on retrospective cohort study designs and data from national health registries, have reported the development of new-onset manifestations, including depression, anxiety, psychotic symptoms, sleep disturbances and fatigue. Nevertheless, when COVID-19 survivors were compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative controls and especially survivors of other disorders (such as influenza), the findings regarding the risk of incident neuropsychiatric manifestations varied among studies. While there is evidence of an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the subsequent occurrence of new-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially among patients with increased disease severity, further research using methodological approaches less susceptible to confounding bias is required to establish causal relationships.","Efstathiou, Stefanou, Demetriou, Siafakas, Katsantoni, Makris, Tsivgoulis, Zoumpourlis, Kympouropoulos, Tsoporis, Spandidos, Ferentinos, Smyrnis, Rizos","https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2022.11641","20221103","COVID-19; COVID-19 survivors; SARS-CoV-2; incidence of neuropsychiatric symptoms; long-COVID; new-onset neuropsychiatric manifestations; post-COVID syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40293,""

This study aimed to explore the mental health status of healthcare workers, compare the differences in mental health between physicians and nurses, and verify the impact of risk perception on mental health in the long-term COVID-19 pandemic in Jilin Province, China. A stratified random sample was used to conduct an on-site questionnaire survey in December 2020 to measure the mental health status, risk perceptions, and demographic characteristics of healthcare workers in Jilin Province, China. A total of 3,383 participants completed the questionnaire survey, of which 3,373 were valid questionnaires.

"Psychological research of the children with chronic kidney disease and their guardians during the COVID-19 pandemic","There is great mental stress due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there are no detailed psychological studies of the children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their guardians during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explores the psychological pressure on children with CKD and their guardians. An online survey was conducted at 20 of the largest pediatric nephropathy departments in China, including the Rutter Parent Questionnaire, Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). Overall, 885 children (589 children with CKD associated with 296 children of the control group) completed the survey together with their guardians. There was no statistical difference between CKD children and control children regarding their Rutter behavior scores and abnormal behaviors. Nevertheless, the abnormal behavior of children might aggravate the anxiety and depression of guardians in both CKD and control groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). We confirmed that the anxiety and depression of guardians in the CKD group were both significantly higher than those in the control group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The guardians in the CKD group with lower annual income were more likely to experience anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the guardians whose children were older than 11 years old might be more anxious than those who were 6-11 years old. Besides, the guardians in the CKD group who watched the news for 30-60 min daily were less likely to have depression than those who watched &lt; 10 min (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The subgroup results showed that the gender, the time of watching the news, the annual income of guardians, and children's age might be the most critical factors influencing guardians' psychological burden. The guardians in the CKD group have more severe anxiety and depression during the pandemic. The children's abnormal behavior, adolescents' pressure, low household income, and the panic about the pandemic may be the main reasons for the anxiety and depression of guardians.","Xiong, Zhang, Wang, Li, Shen, Li, Zhu, Du, Sun, Zhao, Zhao, Fu, Li, Gao, Hao, Ding, Chen, Xu, Liu, Tao, Zhang, Li, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.922678","20221104","COVID-19; anxiety; children; chronic kidney disease; depression; Child; Adolescent; Humans; Pandemics; COVID-19; Anxiety; Stress, Psychological; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40295,""
"Health-related quality of life among persons with initial mild, moderate, and severe or critical COVID-19 at 1 and 12 months after infection: a prospective cohort study","Currently, there is limited evidence about the long-term impact on physical, social and emotional functioning, i.e. health-related quality of life (HRQL) after mild or moderate COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization. We compared HRQL among persons with initial mild, moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 at 1 and 12 months following illness onset with Dutch population norms and investigated the impact of restrictive public health control measures on HRQL. RECoVERED, a prospective cohort study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, enrolled adult participants after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. HRQL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item health survey (SF-36). SF-36 scores were converted to standard scores based on an age- and sex-matched representative reference sample of the Dutch population. Differences in HRQL over time were compared among persons with initial mild, moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 using mixed linear models adjusted for potential confounders. By December 2021, 349 persons were enrolled of whom 269 completed at least one SF-36 form (77%). One month after illness onset, HRQL was significantly below population norms on all SF-36 domains except general health and bodily pain among persons with mild COVID-19. After 12 months, persons with mild COVID-19 had HRQL within population norms, whereas persons with moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 had HRQL below population norms on more than half of the SF-36 domains. Dutch-origin participants had significantly better HRQL than participants with a migration background. Participants with three or more COVID-19 high-risk comorbidities had worse HRQL than part participants with fewer comorbidities. Participants who completed the SF-36 when restrictive public health control measures applied reported less limitations in social and physical functioning and less impaired mental health than participants who completed the SF-36 when no restrictive measures applied. Twelve months after illness onset, persons with initial mild COVID-19 had HRQL within population norms, whereas persons with initial moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 still had impaired HRQL. Having a migration background and a higher number of COVID-19 high-risk comorbidities were associated with worse HRQL. Interestingly, HRQL was less impaired during periods when restrictive public health control measures were in place compared to periods without.","Verveen, Wynberg, van Willigen, Davidovich, Lok, Moll van Charante, de Jong, de Bree, Prins, Knoop, Nieuwkerk, Agard, Ayal, Cavdar, Craanen, Deuring, van Dijk, Ersan, Del Grande, Hartman, Koedoot, Leenstra, Lebbink, Loomans, Makowska, du Maine, de Man, Matser, van der Meij, van Polanen, Oud, Reid, Storey, van Wijk, van den Aardweg, van Assem, van Beek, Blankert, Dijkstra, Figaroa, Frenkel, van Gils, van Haga, Han, Harskamp-Holwerda, Hazenberg, Hidad, de Jong, Kootstra, Kuijt, Russell, van der Straten, van der Veen, Verkaik, Visser","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-022-02615-7","20221104","COVID-19; Health-related quality of life; Quality of life; SARS-CoV-2; Adult; Humans; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40296,""
"Effects of the revised WIC food package on women's and children's health: a quasi-experimental study","The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) was revised in 2009 to be more congruent with national dietary guidelines. There is limited research examining effects of the revision on women's and children's health. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the revised WIC food package was associated with various indicators of physical and mental health for women and children. We used 1998-2017 waves of the National Health Interview Survey (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°81,771 women and 27,780 children) to estimate effects of the revised WIC food package on indicators of health for both women (self-reported health and body mass index) and children (anemia, mental health, and parent-reported health). We used difference-in-differences analysis, a quasi-experimental technique that assessed pre-post differences in outcomes among WIC-recipients while ""differencing out"" the secular underlying trends among a control group of non-recipients. For all outcomes evaluated for women and children, we were unable to rule out the null hypothesis that there was no effect of receiving the revised WIC food package. These findings were confirmed across several secondary analyses conducted to assess heterogeneity of effects and robustness of results. While we did not find effects of the revised WIC food package on downstream health indicators, studies using similarly robust methods in other datasets have found shorter-term effects on more proximal outcomes related to diet and nutrition. Effects of the modest WIC revisions may be less impactful on longer-term indicators of health, and future studies should examine the larger COVID-19-era expansion.","Guan, Batra, Hamad","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-05116-w","20221104","Child nutrition; Child public health; Food policy; Health policy; Maternal nutrition; Maternal public health; Infant; Child; Female; Humans; Food Assistance; Child Health; Women's Health; COVID-19; Food","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40297,""
"Mental health in pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a Swiss online survey","The aim of our study was to evaluate the mental health of pregnant individuals during the early COVID-19 pandemic and the potential factors associated. A Swiss online survey was proposed to individuals who gave birth during the pandemic period from March 2020. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 questions (GAD-7), and Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were evaluated and used to defined mental health impairment as a composite outcome. From October, 2020 to February, 2021, 736 participants responded. The anxiety GAD-7 score was moderate in 9.6% and severe in 2.0%. The EPDS was moderate in 21.5% and severe in 32.9%. The IES-R was moderate in 10.3% and severe in 3.9%. Mental health impairment was reported in 37.0%. The association between the risk of mental health impairment and foreign nationality was significant (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.48; 95%CI [1.06-2.05]) as well as fetal and pregnancy worries because of coronavirus (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.46; 95% CI [1.08-1.98]) and 1.65; 95% CI [1.22-2.24]). Adjusted ORs were significant for foreign nationality (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.51; 95%CI [1.07-2.13]) and pregnancy worries because of coronavirus (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.62; 95%CI [1.10-2.40]). Pregnant people and especially foreign national have a high risk of mental health impairment during the pandemic.","Favre, Kunz, Schwank, Chung, Radan, Raio, Fluri, Winterfeld, Baud, Pomar","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21881-2","20221104","Pregnancy; Female; Humans; Pandemics; COVID-19; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Ethnicity; Switzerland; Depression; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-04","",40298,""
