"A Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Student Depression, Anxiety, and Stress: Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: University students are experiencing higher levels of distress and mental health disorders than before. In addressing mental health needs, web-based interventions have shown increasing promise in overcoming geographic distances and high student-to-counselor ratios, leading to the potential for wider implementation. The Mindfulness Virtual Community (MVC) program, a web-based program, guided by mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy principles, is among efforts aimed at effectively and efficiently reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress in students. OBJECTIVE: This study's aim was to evaluate the efficacy of an 8-week MVC program in reducing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress (primary outcomes), and improving mindfulness (secondary outcome) in undergraduate students at a large Canadian university. Guided by two prior randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that each demonstrated efficacy when conducted during regular university operations, this study coincided with a university-wide labor strike. Nonetheless, the students' response to an online mental health program on a disrupted campus can provide useful information for anticipating the impact of other disruptions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future disruptions. METHODS: In this parallel-arm RCT, 154 students were randomly allocated to an 8-week MVC intervention (n=76) or a wait-list control (WLC) condition (n=78). The MVC intervention included the following: (1) educational and mindfulness video modules, (2) anonymous peer-to-peer discussions, and (3) anonymous, group-based, professionally guided, 20-minute videoconferences. Study outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 8-week follow-up using the following: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). Generalized estimation equations with an AR (1) covariance structure were used to evaluate the impact of the intervention, with outcome evaluations performed on both an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) basis. RESULTS: Participants (n=154) included 35 males and 117 females with a mean age of 23.1 years. There were no statistically significant differences at baseline between the MVC and WLC groups on demographics and psychological characteristics, indicating similar demographic and psychological characteristics across the two groups. Results under both ITT and PP approaches indicated that there were no statistically significant between-group differences in PHQ-9 (ITT: ÃŸ=-0.44, P=.64; PP: ÃŸ=-0.62, P=.053), BAI (ITT: ÃŸ=-2.06, P=.31; PP: ÃŸ=-2.32, P=.27), and FFMQ-SF (ITT: ÃŸ=1.33, P=.43; PP: ÃŸ=1.44, P=.41) compared to WLC. There was a significant difference for the PSS (ITT: ÃŸ=-2.31, P=.03; PP: ÃŸ=-2.38, P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: During a university labor strike, the MVC program led to statistically significant reductions in PSS compared to the WLC group, but there were no other significant between-group differences. Comparisons with previous cycles of intervention testing, undertaken during nondisrupted university operations, when efficacy was demonstrated, are discussed.

"""Freedom to Breathe"": Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) to Investigate Air Pollution Inequities in Richmond, CA","Air pollution is a major contributor to human morbidity and mortality, potentially exacerbated by COVID-19, and a threat to planetary health. Participatory research, with a structural violence framework, illuminates exposure inequities and refines mitigation strategies. Home to profitable oil and shipping industries, several census tracts in Richmond, CA are among the most heavily impacted by aggregate burdens statewide. Formally trained researchers from the Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health (CERCH) partnered with the RYSE youth justice center to conduct youth participatory action research on air quality justice. Staff engaged five youth researchers in: (1) collaborative research using a network of passive air monitors to quantify neighborhood disparities in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), noise pollution and community risk factors; (2) training in environmental health literacy and professional development; and (3) interpretation of findings, community outreach and advocacy. Inequities in ambient NO2, but not SO2, were observed. Census tracts with higher Black populations had the highest NO2. Proximity to railroads and major roadways were associated with higher NO2. Greenspace was associated with lower NO2, suggesting investment may be conducive to improved air quality, among many additional benefits. Youth improved in measures of empowerment, and advanced community education via workshops, Photovoice, video, and ""zines"".","Nolan, James E S; Coker, Eric S; Ward, Bailey R; Williamson, Yahna A; Harley, Kim G","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020554","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(2)2021 01 11.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(2)2021 01 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-19","",9591,""
"Has loneliness and poor resilient coping influenced the magnitude of psychological distress among apparently healthy Indian adults during the lockdown? Evidence from a rapid online nation-wide cross-sectional survey","BACKGROUND: The burden of psychological distress is increasing with the spread of the pandemic and also with the enforcement of its containment measures. The aim of this research was to determine the proportion of self-reported psychological distress, loneliness and degrees of resilient coping, and to also investigate the relationship of loneliness, coping and other variables with psychological distress among apparently healthy Indians during nation-wide lockdown period. METHODS: A cross-sectional, region-stratified survey using pre-designed pre-tested Google form disseminated via different social media platforms was conducted. A total of 1249 responses were analysed all over India. The form enquired about Socio-demographic profile, awareness on COVID pandemic and cases in the surroundings. UCLA Loneliness scale, Brief resilience and coping scale (BRCS) and Psychological distress scale (K6) assessed self-reported loneliness, coping and psychological distress, respectively. Special regressor technique adjusting for endogeneity and heteroskedasticity was used to extract the average marginal effects. RESULTS: Majority of the respondents were 18-35 years old, male, single and urban residents. News media, social media mostly acted as sources of information regarding COVID related news. Overall, 54.47% (95% CI: 51.39-57.53%) and 38.39% (95% CI: 35.57-41.29%) were reported to be lonely and had low resilient coping ability respectively. Around 44.68% had high risk of developing psychological distress. Being a student (average marginal effect coefficient (AMECoef).: -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.12, -0.01]) and perceiving lockdown as an effective measure (AMECoef: -0.11, 95% CI: [-0.19, -0.03]) were protective against psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with male respondents (AMECoef 0.07, 95% CI: [0.02, 0.11]), low or medium resilient copers (AMECoef 0.89, 95% CI: [0.17, 1.61]), and perceiving a serious impact of social distancing measures (AMECoef 0.17, 95% CI: [0.09, 0.26]). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress among Indian population during lockdown was prevalent. Poor coping ability and perceiving social distancing to have a serious impact was found to be significantly contributing to psychological distress. Appropriate measures to address these issues would be beneficial for the community mental health.","Lahiri, Arista; Jha, Sweety Suman; Acharya, Rudraprasad; Dey, Abhijit; Chakraborty, Arup","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245509","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;16(1): e0245509, 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One;16(1): e0245509, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-19","",9592,""
"The Effects of Downloading a Government-Issued COVID-19 Contact Tracing App on Psychological Distress During the Pandemic Among Employed Adults: Prospective Study","BACKGROUND: Downloading a COVID-19 contact tracing app may be effective in reducing users' worry about COVID-19 and psychological distress. OBJECTIVE: This 2.5-month prospective study aimed to investigate the association of downloading a COVID-19 contact tracing app, the COVID-19 Contact Confirming Application (COCOA), released by the Japanese government, with worry about COVID-19 and psychological distress in a sample of employed adults in Japan. METHODS: A total of 996 full-time employed respondents to an online survey conducted May 22-26, 2020 (baseline), were invited to participate in a follow-up survey August 7-12, 2020 (follow-up). A high level of worrying about COVID-19 and high psychological distress were defined by baseline and follow-up scores on a single-item scale and the Kessler 6 (K6) scale, respectively. The app was released between the two surveys, on June 17. Participants were asked at follow-up if they downloaded the app. RESULTS: A total of 902 (90.6%) of 996 baseline participants responded to the follow-up survey. Among them, 184 (20.4%) reported that they downloaded the app. Downloading of the contact tracing app was significantly negatively associated with psychological distress at follow-up after controlling for baseline variables, but not with worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that using a government-issued COVID-19 contact tracing app may be beneficial for the mental health of employed adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kawakami, Norito; Sasaki, Natsu; Kuroda, Reiko; Tsuno, Kanami; Imamura, Kotaro","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23699","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(1): e23699, 2021 Jan 12.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(1): e23699, 2021 Jan 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-19","",9593,""
"Probable anxiety and components of psychological resilience amid COVID-19: A population-based study","BACKGROUND: This study examined the associations between components of psychological resilience and mental health at different levels of exposure to COVID-19 stressors. METHODS: A population-representative sample of 4,021 respondents were recruited and assessed between February 25th and March 19th, 2020. Respondents reported current anxiety symptoms (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7]), cognitive components (perceived ability to adapt to change, tendency to bounce back after adversities) and behavioral components (regularity of primary and secondary daily routines) of resilience, worry about COVID-19 infection, and sociodemographics. RESULTS: Logistic regression revealed that cognitive and behavioral components of resilience were not correlated with probable anxiety (GAD-7&#8805;10) among those reporting no worry. Among respondents who were worried, all resilient components were inversely associated with probable anxiety. Specifically, propensity to bounce back and regular primary routines were more strongly related to lower odds of probable anxiety among those reporting lower levels of worry. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design limits causal inference. Second, other resilient components and some key daily routines that could be related to better mental health were not assessed. Third, generalizability of the findings to other similar major cities is uncertain because cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in Hong Kong have been comparatively lower. CONCLUSIONS: To foster mental health, cultivation of confidence in one's ability to adapt to change and a propensity to bounce back from hardship should be coupled with sustainment of regular daily routines. Such assessment and intervention protocols could be more relevant to those who suffer heightened levels of exposure to COVID-19 stressors.","Hou, Wai Kai; Tong, Horace; Liang, Li; Li, Tsz Wai; Liu, Huinan; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Goodwin, Robin; Lee, Tatia Mei-Chun","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.127","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord;282: 594-601, 2020 Dec 28.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;282: 594-601, 2020 Dec 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-19","",9594,""
"A Text Messaging Intervention for Coping With Social Distancing During COVID-19 (StayWell at Home): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: Social distancing is a crucial intervention to slow down person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. However, social distancing has negative consequences, including increases in depression and anxiety. Digital interventions, such as text messaging, can provide accessible support on a population-wide scale. We developed text messages in English and Spanish to help individuals manage their depressive mood and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine the effect of our 60-day text messaging intervention. Additionally, we aim to assess whether the use of machine learning to adapt the messaging frequency and content improves the effectiveness of the intervention. Finally, we will examine the differences in daily mood ratings between the message categories and time windows. METHODS: The messages were designed within two different categories: behavioral activation and coping skills. Participants will be randomized into (1) a random messaging arm, where message category and timing will be chosen with equal probabilities, and (2) a reinforcement learning arm, with a learned decision mechanism for choosing the messages. Participants in both arms will receive one message per day within three different time windows and will be asked to provide their mood rating 3 hours later. We will compare self-reported daily mood ratings; self-reported depression, using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire; and self-reported anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale at baseline and at intervention completion. RESULTS: The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California Berkeley approved this study in April 2020 (No. 2020-04-13162). Data collection began in April 2020 and will run to April 2021. As of August 24, 2020, we have enrolled 229 participants. We plan to submit manuscripts describing the main results of the trial and results from the microrandomized trial for publication in peer-reviewed journals and for presentations at national and international scientific meetings. CONCLUSIONS: Results will contribute to our knowledge of effective psychological tools to alleviate the negative effects of social distancing and the benefit of using machine learning to personalize digital mental health interventions.

"Circulating Extracellular Vesicles: The Missing Link between Physical Exercise and Depression Management?","Depression is associated with an increased risk of aging-related diseases. It is also seemingly a common psychological reaction to pandemic outbreaks with forced quarantines and lockdowns. Thus, depression represents, now more than ever, a major global health burden with therapeutic management challenges. Clinical data highlights that physical exercise is gaining momentum as a non-pharmacological intervention in depressive disorders. Although it may contribute to the reduction of systemic inflammation associated with depression, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial physical exercise effects in emotional behavior remain to be elucidated. Current investigations indicate that a rapid release of extracellular vesicles into the circulation might be the signaling mediators of systemic adaptations to physical exercise. These biological entities are now well-established intercellular communicators, playing a major role in relevant physiological and pathophysiological functions, including brain cell-cell communication. We also reviewed emerging evidence correlating depression with modified circulating extracellular vesicle surfaces and cargo signatures (e.g., microRNAs and proteins), envisioned as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, efficient disease stratification and appropriate therapeutic management. Accordingly, the clinical data summarized in the present review prompted us to hypothesize that physical exercise-related circulating extracellular vesicles contribute to its antidepressant effects, particularly through the modulation of inflammation. This review sheds light on the triad ""physical exercise-extracellular vesicles-depression"" and suggests new avenues in this novel emerging field.","Soares, Edna; Reis, Julie; Rodrigues, Mariana; Ribeiro, Carlos Fontes; Pereira, Frederico C","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms22020542","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Mol Sci;22(2)2021 Jan 07.; Publication details: Int J Mol Sci;22(2)2021 Jan 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-19","",9609,""
"Study on emotional effects of agro-healing program on COVID-19 trauma among vulnerable groups","As the quarantine life from COVID-19 is prolonged, the number of people suffering from mental and psychological disorders such as fear, anxiety, and depression from viral infection is increasing  Healing agriculture, which mediates agricultural resources, has proven various effects in terms of psychological and emotional aspects  Based on this, the study investigation was conducted during 2020 at Wind Sunshine Farm, Gyeongsangbukdo, South Korea to study the emotional effects on overcoming psychological trauma by conducting an agro-healing program for the selected elderly and housewives of the COVID19 vulnerable class  The following agro-healing program was designed by applying flower therapy, aroma therapy, and food therapy using the five senses and was carried out using plants from the farm  The two groups of housewives and elderly ran the same program for each of the four sessions, making wreaths and flower arrangements using farm resources such as Setaria viridis, Salvia officinalis, Capsella burapastoris, and Gomphrena globosa, planting Rosmarinus officinalis planted in herb gardens in the farm, and harvesting and cooking crops such as Ocimum basilicum, Lycopersicone sculentum, and Lactuca sativa  As an evaluation tool, anxiety (STAI-T) and depression scale (K-BDI) were used to examine emotional changes, and the level of stress was measured by measuring U-BIO MACPA and salivary acidity to determine physiological changes according to emotional function  When looking at the changes in the subjects after the agro-healing program, the degree of anxiety significantly decreased for the housewives (p= 037), but no significant changes within the elderly group  On the other hand, it was found that the degree of depression in the elderly, somewhat higher before implementation was significantly reduced (p= 010)  As a result of measuring the stress index to examine physiological changes in emotional function, there was a significant decrease in housewives (p= 047), and no change within the elderly group  As a result of measuring saliva acidity at each session, housewives had a significant effect after implementation in sessions 1, 3, and 4 (p1 = 011, p2 = 083, p3 = 016, p4 = 010), and the elderly had significant effects in the 3rd and 4th sessions (p1 = 140, p2 = 564, p3 = 005, p4 = 007)  It is judged that there will be positive effects if a longer-term curative agriculture program is applied to various groups suffering from trauma due to COVID-19  Â© 2020, Gaurav Society of Agricultural Research Information Centre  All rights reserved","","https://doi.org/10.31830/2348-7542.2020.120","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Research on Crops;21(4):783-790, 2020.; Publication details: Research on Crops;21(4):783-790, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-19","",9610,""

"Decline in rate of divorce and separation filings in Denmark in 2020 compared to previous years","BACKGROUND The radical changes to everyday life brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and its related lockdowns and restrictions may have substantial implications for key demographic processes. The closure of non-family social spheres in particular may have impacted marriage dynamics. OBJECTIVE We provide evidence on the monthly rates of initiation of divorce and separation filings in Denmark for the period 2016-2020 to examine how filing behavior changed during 2020 compared to the four previous years. METHODS We combine administrative data on monthly number of married couples in Denmark from population registries with newly obtained data on initiation of divorce and separation filings provided by the Danish Agency of Family Law to calculate monthly rates for the period 2016-2020. We then calculate monthly and annual p-scores to compare 2020 to previous years. RESULTS Rates of initiation of divorce filings declined in 2020 to the lowest level in the period 2016-2020. On average, monthly rates in 2020 were 7 percent lower than 2019 rates and 20 percent lower than 2016 rates. There is little indication of the COVID-19 pandemic having an immediate influence on divorce dynamics, although filing rates appear slightly more depressed during lockdown periods. CONTRIBUTION The study provides up to date indications of the divorce intentions in 2020, showing that for one of the less affected countries when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is so far no indication of an increase in divorce rates coinciding with the pandemic.","Peter Fallesen","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46015-310-E10","20210118","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; vital statistics; divorce; population data; covid-19","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-19","",9623,""
