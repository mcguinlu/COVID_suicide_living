"Mood, emotions, and behaviors of children during the COVID-19 pandemic in Autonomous City of Buenos Aires","Changes in daily routine and social fabric resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic had an effect on children and adolescents. The objective of this study was to know the mood, emotions, and behaviors of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was a prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study. Parents and/ or caregivers of children and adolescents aged 3-15 years in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires were asked about their perceptions of the mood, behaviors, and emotions of children and adolescents during the lockdown. A total of 1080 questionnaires were included. Results showed that 81% of parents and/or caregivers observed changes in children and adolescents emotional health; 76% referred that children aged 3-5 years were bored, angry, and upset. They also observed an increase in crying spells (52%) and regression to behaviors that had been outgrown (29%). In the 6-11-year-old group, 43% showed difficulty focusing. Adults noticed that 3 out of 10 adolescents aged 12-15 years discontinued activities they used to enjoy and were sad and worried. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted on the mood, behaviors, and emotions of children and adolescents. Negative feelings prevailed, such as boredom, sadness, anxiety, and worry. IntroducciÃƒÂ³n.

"The Psychological Response and Perception of Stress during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Slovenia: Three-Wave Repeated Cross-Sectional Study","In addition to COVID-19 being a health threat, its longevity and restrictions act as significant stressors and risk for mental health. In the current study, we take a look at how psychological response, both its positive aspects, e.g., mental well-being and life satisfaction, and its negative aspects, e.g., anxiety, and specifically COVID-19 anxiety, have changed as the pandemic has continued (first three waves in Slovenia). Additionally, we are interested in whether the psychological response is associated with the perception of stress level in waves 2 and 3 as less, equally or more stressful when compared to the stress level in wave 1 and what shapes these perceptions. An online questionnaire battery (COVID-19 stress level comparison, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale; LAOM Anxiety Scale; Global Life Satisfaction scale; COVID-19 anxiety), with ANOVA and qualitative analysis of the open-ended question on reasons for perceiving wave 2 and wave 3 as more stressful when compared to wave 1, was used on a Slovene convenience adult sample (wave 1: N = 364, 83.5% female; wave 2: N = 987, 85.5% female; wave 3: N = 467, 78.5 % female). The findings show: a) a significant increase in COVID-19 anxiety from wave 1 to wave 3, with a peak in wave 2, and a significant decrease in mental well-being from wave 1 to wave 3; b) the level of anxiety, mental well-being, and life satisfaction differs significantly between individuals who perceive wave 2 and 3 as more stressful compared to individuals who perceive wave 2 and wave 3 as equally or less stressful when compared to wave 1; c) reasons for perceiving the succeeding waves of the pandemic as more stressful compared to wave 1 are diverse, with some being reported in both succeeding waves (e.g., negative emotional response to the pandemic, negative perceptions of measures). The findings highlight the important role of stress analysis in identifying the support mechanisms for dealing with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

"Attitudes Toward Telehealth Services Among People Living With Parkinson's Disease: A Survey Study","Telehealth has been widely adopted in providing Parkinson's disease care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The aim of this study was to survey people living with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) about their attitudes toward and utilization of telehealth services. A survey was administered to PwPD via Parkinson's Foundation and Columbia University mailing lists. Of 1,163 responses, 944 complete responses were analyzed. Telehealth awareness was 90.2% (850/942), and utilization was 82.8% (780/942). More than 40% of PwPD were equally or more satisfied with telehealth compared with in-person visits in all types of services used. The highest satisfaction was observed in speech-language pathology appointments (78.8%, 52/66) followed by mental health services (69.2%, 95/137). In selected circumstances and indications, such as speech-language pathology and mental health services, telehealth may be a useful tool in the care of PwPD beyond the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical genetics and genomics training: Perspective from clinical trainees","We sought to understand how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the well-being, clinical training, and medical education for clinical trainees in medical genetics and genomics residency and fellowship programs. All clinical genetics trainees in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited training programs were invited to complete a survey. 31 out of 174 trainees completed the survey. With regards to well-being, 18 trainees reported increased anxiety, 10 had increased depression, 3 increased financial strain, 13 worsening work-life balance, and 13 worsening physical health. There was increased telehealth utilization in both outpatient (3% before the pandemic vs. 67% during the pandemic) and inpatient clinical encounters (0% vs. 29%). The most commonly reported challenges in telehealth use were inadequate physical examination and technical problems during visits. Twenty trainees believed that the pandemic has negatively impacted overall clinical training while none reported a positive impact. We concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted most clinical genetics trainees in ACGME-accredited training programs. Telehealth has been increasingly used with some challenges. Further studies are needed on how to optimally integrate what we have learned into the training of medical genetics and genomics in the post-pandemic era.","Chenbhanich, Slavotinek, Tam","https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.a.62736","20220326","COVID-19; genetic education; medical genetics and genomics residency; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","",29096,""
"Prevalence of suicidality in clinically stable patients with the major depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with an increased risk of mental health problems including suicide in many subpopulations, but its influence on stable patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) has been studied fleetingly. This study examined the one-year prevalence of suicidality including suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plans (SP), and suicide attempts (SA) as well as their correlates in clinically stable MDD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted between October 1, 2020, and October 15, 2021 in six tertiary psychiatric hospitals. Socio-demographic information, clinical data and one-year prevalence of suicidality were recorded. Altogether, 1718 participants who met the eligibility criteria were included. The overall one-year prevalence of suicidality during the COVID-19 pandemic was 68.04% (95% confidence intervals (CI) =65.84-70.25%), with one-year SI prevalence of 66.4% (95%CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯64.18%-68.65%), SP prevalence of 36.26% (95%CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯33.99%-38.54%), and SA prevalence of 39.35% (95%CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯37.04%-41.66%). Binary logistic regression analyses revealed male gender, married marital status, college education level and above and age were negatively associated with risk of suicidality. Urban residence, unemployed work status, experiences of cyberbullying, a history of suicide among family members or friends, and more severe fatigue, physical pain, and residual depressive symptoms were positively associated with risk of suicidality. Suicidality is common among clinically stable MDD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular suicide screening and preventive measures on suicide should be provided to clinically stable MDD patients during the pandemic.","Zhang, Cai, Bai, Zou, Feng, Li, Liu, Du, Zeng, Lu, Zhang, Mi, Ding, Yang, Jackson, Cheung, Su, An, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.03.042","20220326","COVID-19 pandemic; Major depressive disorder; Suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","",29097,""
"Adherence to a guided walking program with amelioration of cognitive functions in subjects with schizophrenia even during COVID-19 pandemic","Aim of the study was to enrol a group of individuals with schizophrenia in a long-term moderate-intensity physical activity program and to evaluate its effects on their cognitive functions and cardiovascular risk factors. An additional aim of the study was the comparison of the adherence to the physical activity program before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Forty sedentary patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (mean age 46.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.6) followed by the Public Mental Health Department of Ferrara were included in the study. 28 of them followed a 1-year walking program consisting of two guided walking sessions/week, while 12 maintained their sedentary lifestyle and followed the usual Cognitive Rehabilitation program. To the participants following the walking program VO<sub>2</sub> peak and walking speed were assessed at baseline and at the end of the program. All participants were evaluated on blood pressure and anthropometric variable. Cognitive functions were assessed with the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP) and with the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) questionnaires. The 20 participants completing the walking program displayed significant improvements in cognitive functions (d<sub>ppc2</sub> 0.35 for SCIP and 0.26 for FAB), with a positive correlation between SCIP score and the number of sessions attended (RÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.86, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), evident in the patients attending to at least 75 of the 100 walking sessions. Walking speed and VO<sub>2</sub>peak increased significantly and a decrease of body weight, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure was also observed. The adherence to the walking program registered during Covid-19 period did not differ from that observed before the pandemic. The 12 CG (Control Group) patients maintaining the sedentary lifestyle did not display improvements of cognitive functions. The main finding of this study is the improvement of cognitive functions which is significantly related to the number of walking sessions attended by participants with schizophrenia. The walking program, guided by exercise specialists, proved to be an enjoyable activity for people with mental disorder feasible even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The 'new normal' includes online prenatal exercise: exploring pregnant women's experiences during the pandemic and the role of virtual group fitness on maternal mental health","Prenatal anxiety and depressive symptoms have significantly increased since the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic In addition, home confinement regulations have caused a drastic increase in time spent sedentary. Online group fitness classes may be an effective strategy that can increase maternal physical activity levels and improve mental health outcomes by providing an opportunity for social connectedness. The present study explores the experiences of pregnant women who participated in an online group exercise program during the pandemic and identifies relationships with maternal mental health and well-being. In addition, we present person-informed recommendations on how to improve the delivery of future online prenatal exercise programs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with pregnant women (8-39Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of pregnancy) who participated in an online group exercise program, from March to October 2020 in Spain. A phenomenological approach was taken, and open-ended questions were asked to understand women's experiences throughout the pandemic and the role the online exercise classes may have had on their physical activity levels, mental health, and other health behaviours such as diet. A thematic analysis was performed to evaluate data. In addition, women completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and these data supplemented qualitative findings. Twenty-four women were interviewed, and the anxiety scores were on average 32.23Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.31, ranging from low to moderate levels. Thematic analysis revealed that women felt safe exercising from home, an increased availability of time to schedule a structured exercise class, and consequently an improvement in their adherence to the program and other behaviours (i.e., healthier diet). Women emphasized feeling connected to other pregnant women when they exercised online together, and overall, this had a positive effect on their mental well-being. Women suggested that future online exercise programs should include flexible options, detailed instructions and facilitation by a qualified exercise professional. Pregnant women are receptive to online group exercise classes and expressed that they are an accessible option to accommodating physical activity during the pandemic. In addition, the online group environment provides an important sense of connectivity among pregnant women exercising together and this may mitigate the detrimental effect of COVID-19 on maternal mental health.","Silva-Jose, Nagpal, CoterÃƒÂ³n, Barakat, Mottola","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04587-1","20220326","Coronavirus; Exercise; Mental health; Physical Activity; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","",29099,""
"Sarcopenia and its association with objectively measured life-space mobility and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in the oldest-old amid the COVID-19 pandemic when a physical distancing policy is in force","The oldest-old are highly vulnerable to sarcopenia. Physical distancing remains a common and effective infection-control policy to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission during the pandemic. Sarcopenia is known to be associated with impaired immunity. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and life-space mobility (LSM) are potential strategies for minimizing the risk of sarcopenia. However, a physical distancing policy might jeopardize the practice of MVPA and LSM. The purposes of this study were to identify the prevalence of sarcopenia and examine the association between MVPA and LSM with sarcopenia in the community-dwelling oldest-old during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study employed a cross-sectional and observational design. The study was conducted in 10 community centres for older people in Hong Kong during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (September to December 2020). Eligible participants were the oldest-old people aged Ã¢â€°Â¥85Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, who were community-dwelling and had no overt symptoms of cognitive impairment or depression. Key variables included sarcopenia as measured by SARC-F, LSM as measured by a GPS built into smartphones, and MVPA as measured by a wrist-worn ActiGraph GT3X+. Variables were described by mean and frequency. A multiple linear regression was employed to test the hypotheses. The dependent variable was sarcopenia and the independent variables included LSM and MVPA. This study recruited 151 eligible participants. Their mean age was 89.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and the majority of them were female (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°93/151, 61.6%). The prevalence of sarcopenia was 24.5% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37/151) with a margin of error of 6.86%. MVPA was negatively associated with sarcopenia in older people (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002, SEÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.029). However, LSM was not associated with sarcopenia. The prevalence of sarcopenia in the community-dwelling oldest-old population is high. MVPA is negatively associated with sarcopenia. LSM is unrelated to sarcopenia. Sarcopenia should be recognized and the oldest-old with sarcopenia should be accorded priority treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kwan, Liu, Yin, Lee, Ng, Cheung, Kor, Lam, Lo, Yang, Chan, Chiang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-02861-7","20220326","COVID-19; Life-space mobility; Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; Physical distancing; Sarcopenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","",29100,""
"Prospective telehealth analysis of functional performance, frailty, quality of life, and mental health after COVID-19 hospitalization","COVID-19 is a global pandemic with poorly understood long-term consequences. Determining the trajectory of recovery following COVID-19 hospitalization is critical for prioritizing care, allocating resources, facilitating prognosis, and informing rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate recovery following COVID-19 hospitalization. Participants age 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or older who were hospitalized for Ã¢â€°Â¥24Ã¢â‚¬â€°h due to COVID-19 completed phone/video call virtual assessments (including the 10-time chair rise test) and survey forms at three time points (2-6, 12, and 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks) after hospital discharge. Univariate logistic and linear regression models assessed the associations of the outcomes with primary predictors (categorical age, sex, race/ethnicity group, and categorical pre-hospitalization frailty) at baseline; the same were used to assess differences in change from week 2-6 (continuous outcomes) or outcome persistence/worsening (categorical) at last contact. One hundred nine adults (age 53.0 [standard deviation 13.1]; 53% female) participated including 43 (39%) age 60 or greater; 59% identified as an ethnic and/or racial minority. Over 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks, the mean time to complete the 10-time chair rise test decreased (i.e., improved) by 6.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°s (95% CI: 4.1, 7.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°s; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); this change did not differ by pre-hospital frailty, race/ethnicity group, or sex, but those ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°60 had greater improvement. At weeks 2-6, 67% of participants reported a worse Clinical Frailty Scale category compared to their pre-hospitalization level, whereas 42% reported a worse frailty score at 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. Participants who did not return to pre-hospitalization levels were more likely to be female, younger, and report a pre-hospitalization category of 'very fit' or 'well'. We found that functional performance improved from weeks 2-6 to 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of follow-up; that incident clinical frailty developed in some individuals following COVID-19; and that age, sex, race/ethnicity, and pre-hospitalization frailty status may impact recovery from COVID-19. Notably, individuals age 60 and older were more likely than those under age 45Ã¢â‚¬â€°years to return to their pre-hospitalization status and to make greater improvements in functional performance.

"Antiviral Properties of Silver Nanoparticles against SARS-CoV-2: Effects of Surface Coating and Particle Size","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly and led to over 5 million deaths to date globally. Due to the successively emerging mutant strains, therapeutics and prevention against the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are urgently needed. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in public and hospital areas is essential to reduce the frequency of infections. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with virucidal effects have been reported. Therefore, we investigated the virucidal activity and safety of ten types of AgNPs with different surface modifications and particle sizes, in cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The AgNPs could effectively inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2, and different surface modifications and particle sizes conferred different virucidal effects, of which 50-nm BPEI showed the strongest antiviral effect. We concluded that the efficacy of each type of AgNP type was positively correlated with the corresponding potential difference (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.82). These in vitro experimental data provide scientific support for the development of therapeutics against COVID-19, as well as a research basis for the development of broad-spectrum virucides. Given the increasing acquired resistance of pathogens against conventional chemical and antibody-based drugs, AgNPs may well be a possible solution for cutting off the route of transmission, either as an external material or a potential medicine.","He, Lu, Liu, Lu, Li, Shang, Li, Hu, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12060990","20220326","AgNPs; SARS-CoV-2; cell activity; viral replication","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","",29102,""
"Willingness to Receive COVID-19 Booster Vaccine: Associations between Green-Pass, Social Media Information, Anti-Vax Beliefs, and Emotional Balance","The aims of the present investigation were (i) to determine psychological relapses of COVID-19 booster vaccine; (ii) to identify the determining factors affecting willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine; and (iii) to study the relationship among emotional characteristics (anxiety, stress, depression, optimism), social media information, and the mandatory political choices (i.e., green-pass) in Croatian people. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted for 1003 participants (median age: 40 years) from Croatia during December 2021. Results showed a significant association between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants in all sociodemographic variables, except for gender (<i>p</i> = 0.905). For psychological variables, significant differences were found only for levels of optimism (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). People with a postgraduate degree (OR: 2.25, [1.14-4.46], <i>p</i> = 0.020) and PhD (OR: 1.97, [95% CI: 1.01-3.52], <i>p</i> = 0.021) had higher odds of being vaccinated than participants with high school diplomas. Additionally, participants seeking information on TV and radio (OR: 2.35, [1.71-3.23], <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) or from general practitioner (OR: 2.53, [1.78-3.61], <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) had higher odds of being vaccinated. Conversely, participants seeking information on social networks (OR: 0.36, [0.27-0.49], <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), general internet/blogs forums (OR: 0.34, [0.22-0.52], <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), and from friends or acquaintances (OR: 0.66, [0.48-0.91], <i>p</i> = 0.011) had lower odds of being vaccinated. Additionally, results showed that information policies have failed to fully convince the population to vaccinate and that depression (<i>p</i> = 0.491), anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.220), and stress (<i>p</i> = 0.521) were not determining factors leading to the decision to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Most of the vaccinated participants perceived the green-pass as potentially useful. In contrast, most unvaccinated participants believed that the green-pass is a form of discrimination and not useful (88%). Further and broader research into possible reasons for continuing or undertaking vaccination is needed. It is recommended to introduce a measure of conformism that represents a change of attitude, belief, or behavior in a narrower sense.","De Giorgio, KuvaÃ„ÂiÃ„â€¡, MaleÃ…Â¡, Vecchio, Tornali, Ishac, Ramaci, Barattucci, MilaviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10030481","20220326","COVID-19 disease; anti-vax beliefs; booster; vaccine hesitancy; willingness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","",29103,""
"How to Motivate SARS-CoV-2 Convalescents to Receive a Booster Vaccination? Influence on Vaccination Willingness","(1) Background: Booster vaccinations for SARS-CoV-2 convalescents are essential for achieving herd immunity. For the first time, this study examined the influencing factors of vaccination willingness among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and identified vaccination-hesitant subgroups. (2) Methods: Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were recruited by telephone. They completed an online questionnaire during their home isolation in Germany. This questionnaire assessed the vaccination willingness and its influencing factors. (3) Results: 224 home-isolated individuals with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. Vaccination willingness of home-isolated SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with asymptomatic or moderate course was 54%. The following factors were associated with significantly lower vaccination willingness: younger age, foreign nationality, low income, low trust in vaccination effectiveness, fear of negative vaccination effects, low trust in the governmental pandemic management, low subjective informativeness about SARS-CoV-2, support of conspiracy theories. (4) Conclusions: The vaccination willingness of home-isolated SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with asymptomatic or moderate symptomatic course was low. Motivational vaccination campaigns should be adapted to individuals with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and consider the vaccination-hesitant groups. Vaccination education should be demand-driven, low-threshold, begin during the acute infection phase, and be guided for example by the established 5C model (""confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, collective responsibility"").","Kowalski, Stengel, Schneider, Goebel-Stengel, Zipfel, Graf","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10030455","20220326","COVID-19; associated factors; behavior; infected; mental health; public health; vaccination hesitancy; vaccine acceptance; vaccine intention; vaccine uptake","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","",29104,""
"Family Matters","Given the focus of the Journal this month, the Book Forum features Jessica Lahey's The Addiction Inoculation: Raising Healthy Kids in a Culture of Dependence. Lahey is a former teacher and writer whose work has appeared in the New York Times, The Atlantic, and Washington Post, focusing mostly on parenting and development. Her guide to decreasing children's risk of substance use disorders (SUDs) and building a sense of self-efficacy is reviewed this month by psychiatry resident Nat Mulkey and their faculty mentor, Amy Yule. While the Monitoring the Future survey shows that the COVID-19 era has featured an unprecedented drop in teen reports of illicit substance use,<sup>2</sup> Lahey's book seems particularly important as parents/families are poised for a resurgence in teen SUDs for many reasons. As caregivers return to work, youth are apt to have more and more unsupervised time. Furthermore, with youth increasingly contending with mental health challenges,<sup>3</sup> they are at increased risk for coping through unhealthy means including substance use.","Usher","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2022.01.005","20220326","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","",29105,""
