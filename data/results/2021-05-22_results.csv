"Does suicidal ideation increase during the second COVID-19 lockdown?","This longitudinal study aimed to investigate the predictive factors of suicidal ideation during the second lockdown in Greece. The respondents presented a 4.32% suicidal ideation in the second lockdown, which did not differ significantly to the initial 4.81%. Anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation during the first lockdown and living with a person with frail health and vulnerable for COVID-19 severe infection emerged as significant risk factors for suicidal ideation during the second lockdown, after controlling for gender, age, and mental health history.

"Mental health among pregnant women under public health interventions during COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic. As the first city struck by the COVID-19 outbreak, Wuhan had implemented unprecedented public health interventions. The mental health of pregnant women during these anti-epidemic controls remains unknown. A total of 274 pregnant women living in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak took part in our investigation online. The data on mental health conditions were evaluated using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We also collected the information on physical health status and precautionary measures against COVID-19. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and poor sleep quality was 16.1%, 13.9%, 42.7%, 37.6%, respectively. Comparing to SAS, PSQI score in pregnant women who participated in the survey after April 8 (date of Wuhan reopening), those data collected before April 8 were significantly higher. High levels of stress, severe health concerns over the fetus, and poor hygienic practices were negatively associated with mental health conditions. In conclusion, a large proportion of pregnant women reported psychological symptoms during the epidemic, which negatively related to the severe health concerns over fetus and poor hygienic practices. More psychological support during the epidemic would promote maternal mental well-being.","Xu, Zhang, Zhang, Xu, Lv, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113977","20210521","Antenatal anxiety; Antenatal depression; Sleep; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13939,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rabies reemergence in Latin America: The case of Arequipa, Peru","In Latin America, there has been tremendous progress towards eliminating canine rabies. Major components of rabies elimination programs leading to these successes have been constant and regular surveillance for rabid dogs and uninterrupted yearly mass dog vaccination campaigns. Unfortunately, vital measures to control COVID-19 have had the negative trade-off of jeopardizing these rabies elimination and prevention activities. We aimed to assess the effect of interrupting canine rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccination campaigns on rabies trends. We built a deterministic compartment model of dog rabies dynamics to create a conceptual framework for how different disruptions may affect rabies virus transmission. We parameterized the model for conditions found in Arequipa, Peru, a city with active rabies virus transmission. We examined our results over a range of plausible values for R0 (1.36-2.0). Also, we prospectively evaluated surveillance data during the pandemic to detect temporal changes. Our model suggests that a decrease in canine vaccination coverage as well as decreased surveillance could lead to a sharp rise in canine rabies within months. These results were consistent over all plausible values of R0. Surveillance data from late 2020 and early 2021 confirms that in Arequipa, Peru, rabies cases are on an increasing trajectory. The rising rabies trends in Arequipa, if indicative to the region as whole, suggest that the achievements made in Latin America towards the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies may be in jeopardy.","Raynor, DÃƒÂ­az, Shinnick, Zegarra, Monroy, Mena, De la Puente-LeÃƒÂ³n, Levy, Castillo-Neyra","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009414","20210521","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13940,""
"Simultaneously Blamed and Ignored: Cross-Sectional Rapid Assessment on Barriers, Behaviors, and Impact of COVID-19 on Asian Americans","The diverse Asian American population is impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but due to limited data and other factors, disparities for this population are hidden. The study aimed to describe the Asian American community's experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, California, and to better inform a Federally Qualified Health Center's (FQHC) health care services and response to challenges faced by the community. We conducted a cross-sectional survey between May 20 to June 23, 2020 using a multi-pronged recruitment approach, including word-of-mouth, FQHC patient appointments, and social media posts. The survey was self-administered online or administered over the phone by FQHC staff in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese. Survey questions included COVID-19 testing and preventative behaviors, economic impacts of COVID-19, experience with perceived mistreatment due to their race/ethnicity, and mental health challenges. Among 1,297 Asian American respondents, only 3% were tested, and 49% stated that they could not find a place to get tested. Three-quarters of respondents reported feeling stressed, and about 23% reported feeling depressed. About 6% of respondents reported being treated unfairly because of their race/ethnicity. Among respondents who experienced economic impacts from COVID-19, 32% had lost their regular jobs and 23% had reduced hours or reduced income. Additionally, 70% of respondents shared that they avoid leaving their homes to go to public places (e.g., grocery stores, church, and school). We found that Asian Americans reported lower levels of COVID-19 testing and limited access to testing, high prevalence of mental health issues and economic impacts, and high prevalence of risk-avoidant behaviors (e.g., not leaving the house) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide preliminary insights into the COVID-19 impact on Asian American communities served by an FQHC and underscore the longstanding need for culturally- and linguistically-appropriate approaches to providing mental health, outreach, and education services. These findings led to the establishment of the first Asian multi-lingual and multi-cultural COVID-19 testing sites in the local area where the study was conducted, and laid the groundwork for subsequent COVID-19 programs, specifically contact tracing and vaccines.

"Exploring the Social Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on People Living with HIV (PLHIV): A Scoping Review","Understanding the clinical impact of COVID-19 has been central to emerging research in the HIV field, but in focusing on the biomedical, researchers must not overlook the socially embedded nature of HIV and the potential social impacts of this new pandemic on PLHIV. We conducted a scoping review to explore emerging research examining the social impacts of COVID-19 on PLHIV in OECD countries over the first 12Ã‚Â months of the pandemic. Twenty articles were identified and included for review. Key themes included: impacts on HIV care access/telehealth; stress and mental health; social isolation and loneliness; food insecurity; changes to sexual behaviour; changes to substance use; impacts on income, education and employment; and racial and social inequality.

"Burnout among healthcare providers during COVID-19: Challenges and evidence-based interventions","Burnout is a major occupational problem among healthcare providers, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The frontline health workforce is experiencing a high workload and multiple psychosocial stressors which may affect their mental and emotional health, leading to burnout symptoms. Moreover, sleep deprivation and a critical lack of psychosocial support may aggravate such symptoms amidst Covid-19. From an ethical viewpoint, healthcare providers may experience moral distress while safeguarding patient welfare and autonomy. Moreover, social injustice and structural inequities may affect their emotional health while tackling a high volume of new cases and mortality. Global evidence indicates the need for adopting multipronged evidence-based approaches to address burnout during this pandemic, which may include increasing the awareness of work-related stress and burnout, promoting mindfulness and self-care practices for promoting mental wellbeing, ensuring optimal mental health services, using digital technologies to address workplace stress and deliver mental health interventions, and improving organisational policies and practices focusing on burnout among healthcare providers.","Sultana, Sharma, Hossain, Bhattacharya, Purohit","https://doi.org/10.20529/IJME.2020.73","20210521","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13943,""
"Corona doubt and scepticism: repression and denial as psychological defence mechanisms to process distress?","After more than a year of pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2) remains a relevant health care and society issue. Movements doubting the dangerousness or the existence of the virus have emerged and became a challenge to social cohesion. About 3487 individuals (434 Corona doubters and 3053 non-doubters) have participated in an online survey (predominat age group: 35-45 years). Particularly, COVID-19-related anxiety, generalized anxiety (Generalizied Anxiety Disorder Screener, GAD-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-2) and functional/adherent safety behaviour were assessed. COVID-19 doubters describe less functional safety behaviour. Fear of the virus is evident, similar to non-doubters. Generalized anxiety and depression were significantly higher in doubters. Repression and denial as psychological defence mechanisms could be the unconscious psychological strategy for coping with the distress variables. The results point out that public strategies may only be successful in managing opinions and beliefs if they address fears and worries.","Teufel, Schweda, Kohler, Musche, Fink, WeismÃƒÂ¼ller, Moradian, Skoda, BÃƒÂ¤uerle","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab168","20210521","groups; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13944,""

"Transdiagnostic vulnerability factors for behavioral health problems during COVID-19","The novel 2019 SARS-2-CoV causing COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the entire world. COVID-19 is a broad-based stressor, and research to date has documented increases in mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and substance use, since the onset of COVID-19. By taking a transdiagnostic approach, scholars can help elucidate mechanisms and vulnerability as well as resiliency related to behavioral health problems in the context of COVID-19. The aim of the current special issue of <i>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy</i> was to showcase ongoing research focused on transdiagnostic factors in the context of COVID-19. The purpose of this issue is to highlight the significance of this work in the pandemic for research and practice; illustrate some of the many domains currently being explored via innovative approaches; and explicate fruitful areas for programmatic study.

"Commentary on: A Call to Action: Facing the Shadow Pandemic of Complicated Forms of Grief","In this contribution, we respond to a letter in Omega: Journal of Death and Dying by Doka. Signatories of this letter to the President of the United States convey concerns that deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a higher prevalence of severe and persistent grief, i.e., prolonged grief disorder. We support their call to action to direct government funding to helping those who develop this condition during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we think that concerns about prolonged grief disorder during the pandemic can be more convincingly conveyed by firmly embedding such concerns within scientific literature. Therefore, we highlight prior scientifically informed opinion pieces from various international researchers who voiced similar concerns in the early months of the pandemic. Additionally, we provide an overview of pioneering empirical research elucidating whether prolonged grief disorder and related mental health problems will become more prevalent during the pandemic.","Eisma, Boelen","https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228211016227","20210521","COVID-19; bereavement; coronavirus; grief; prolonged grief disorder; review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13948,""

"Pandemic Fatigue And Clinical Nurses' Mental Health, Sleep Quality And Job Contentment During The COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role Of Resilience","Pandemic fatigue is an emerging health concern among frontline clinical nurses as a consequence of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the various measures implemented to slow the spread of infection. As yet, no studies have investigated the link between pandemic fatigue and resilience, mental health, sleep quality and job contentment in frontline clinical nurses. This study examined the influence of pandemic fatigue on clinical nurses' mental health, sleep quality and job contentment, with resilience as a mediator. This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study involving 255 frontline clinical nurses in the Philippines. The Pandemic Fatigue Questionnaire, Brief Resilience Scale, Job Contentment Scale, and the Sleep Quality Scale were used to collect data through an online survey. The mean pandemic fatigue score was 3.086 (out of 5). Being vaccinated (ÃŽÂ² = 0.231, p &lt; 0.001) and increased staffing levels (ÃŽÂ² = -0.488, p &lt; 0.01) were associated with decreased pandemic fatigue in clinical nurses. Resilience partially mediated the relationships between (a) pandemic fatigue and mental health (ÃŽÂ² = -0.488, p &lt; 0.001), (b) pandemic fatigue and sleep quality (ÃŽÂ² = -0.326, p &lt; 0.001) and (c) pandemic fatigue and job contentment (ÃŽÂ² = -0.395, p &lt; 0.001). Clinical nurses who received a COVID-19 vaccine and those who perceived sufficient staffing in their units reported lower levels of pandemic fatigue. Resilience reduces the effects of pandemic fatigue on clinical nurses' mental health, sleep quality and job contentment. By providing frontline nurses with access to COVID-19 vaccines and ensuring a sufficient staffing levels, nurse managers could effectively reduce or prevent pandemic fatigue and improve their mental health. Implementing resilience-promoting measures are essential to support nurses' mental health, promote their sleep quality and foster job satisfaction.","Labrague","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13383","20210521","COVID-19; job contentment; mental health; nursing; pandemic fatigue; resilience; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13950,""
"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health anxiety and cyberchondria levels of university students","Our study hypothesizes that the fear and panic of COVID-19 triggers cyberchondria (CYB) in students thus increasing health anxiety. In this way, we aim to determine the effect of the belief of previously having had and not having had COVID-19 on health anxiety and CYB levels of the university students. Our study is a descriptive cross-sectional study. The target population of our study consisted of 950 students who were continuing their education in the Vocational School of Health Services, an associate degree program of a university, and the samples consisted of 794 students (85.5%) who filled out our questionnaire (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°794). The questionnaire form included the information regarding sociodemographic characteristics and the symptoms of COVID-19, and the obtained data were electronically collected altogether with Cyberchondria Scale (CS) and Health Anxiety Inventory. Health anxiety mean scores were significantly higher in people who lived alone, had a chronic disease, searched for symptoms online, and took herbal supplements against COVID-19 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05).

"Prevalence of Depression and Anxiety Among Medical Students and House Staff During the COVID-19 Health-Care Crisis","The objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among medical trainees during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students, residents, and fellows at a medical university hospital in New York using self-reported PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening tools administered via an anonymized survey. The study was conducted in April 2020. The authors received 438 responses (33.4% response rate). Nearly half (44.5%) were medical students and female (56.6%). The prevalence of positive screen for depression (45.3%) and anxiety (48.1%) was high. Many reported moderate to severe depression (17.2%) and anxiety (20.3%). Over half (57.3%) experienced significant mood changes and inability to concentrate, and 14.6% had reconsidered their choice of profession since the start of the pandemic. Those who had reconsidered their profession had higher PHQ-9 [8.1 (6.4) vs 4.4 (4.3), p &lt; 0.0001] and GAD-7 scores [8.3 (6.1) vs 4.7 (4.6), p &lt; 0.0001], indicating adverse mental health partly contributed to their reconsideration of choice of profession.

"COVID-19 among LGBTQ+ individuals living with HIV/AIDS: psycho-social challenges and care options","Prolonged social isolation during the COVID-19 lockdown has adversely impacted the mental, social, and physical wellbeing of the global populace. Coping with mental and physical stressors amidst the global lockdown is especially strenuous for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and more (LGBT+) community, who are frequently subjected to social stigma and minority stress. Systematic stigma and discrimination place LGBT+ individuals at higher risk for deleterious behaviors, such as substance abuse (e.g., injection drug use, smoking, alcohol) and risky sexual practices (e.g., anal/vaginal/oral sex). Maladaptive coping behaviors consequently increase the chances of HIV/AIDS risk among LGBT+ individuals, compared to heterosexual individuals. LGBT+ individuals Living with HIV/AIDS perpetually face higher rates of unemployment, income disparity, and intimate partner violence. Prolonged home confinement, and impaired accessibility to healthcare, legal, and criminal justice services during lockdown may deplete the quality of life of LGBT+ individuals Living with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, it is critical that multidisciplinary service providers, including health professionals, employers, social services providers, educational institutions and community organizations, move toward online service delivery, so that homebound HIV-positive LGBT+ individuals are secured with a wide range of care options. Non-judgemental, tele-counseling may bridge the gap to mental health services. Community clinics catering to HIV-positive and/or LGBT+ clients may consider precociously supplying essential amenities, such as Preexposure (PrEP)/postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), condoms, emergency contraception, and sterile needles.

"Geriatric population in India: Demography, vulnerabilities, and healthcare challenges","Global pandemic due to corona virus disease (COVID-19) has exposed vulnerabilities of the geriatric population all over the world. India has been adding progressively increasing number of elderly to its population. This is happening with increasing life expectancy and decreasing mortality. In comparison to children, the population as well as deaths in elderly are rising with changing demography. The elderly population has its own vulnerabilities based on education, socioeconomic condition, gender, place of residence etc. They are affected by various non-communicable diseases which form predominant cause of morbidity and mortality like cardiovascular diseases, stroke, cancer, respiratory illnesses etc. The elderly also contribute to various kinds of disabilities like movement, vision, hearing and in many cases multiple disabilities. They are also more vulnerable to mental health problems and cognitive impairment. The article also suggests a way forward in dealing with rising geriatric age group and its associated problems. The programs supporting this population are largely scattered which needs to be consolidated to include social security, pension and food security along with health benefits. The approach to health care of the elderly needs a comprehensive strategy instead of the present fragmented approach where different disease based programs for non-communicable diseases, cancer and mental health cater to specific health issues of the elderly. Greater awareness, training and skill building in geriatric health for primary care physicians need focus and energy. Prioritizing training and research in this field including the need for more geriatricians has been highlighted.","Malik, Khanna, Jain, Jain","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1794_20","20210521","Disability; elderly; geriatrics; mental health; non communicable diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13956,""
"Correlation of Severity of COVID-19 Disease With Gastrointestinal Manifestations and Liver Injury - A North Brooklyn Community Hospital Experience: A Retrospective Cohort Study","Introduction The primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and liver parenchyma. The involvement of the gastrointestinal tract with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has remained unclear. The following study retrospectively reviews gastrointestinal symptoms and liver function tests at the time of hospital admission to identify patient outcomes including prolonged hospital stay, the requirement for intensive care, and all-cause in-hospital 30-day mortality. Methods A retrospective review of patient charts at the Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center (WMC) was conducted at the time of hospital admission, using a pre-determined selection criterion. All adult patients, both inpatient and outpatient, were included from March 2020 till May 2020. A 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for patient outcomes. Results Of the 520 patients, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea (OR = 0.375, p = 0.015), and nausea and vomiting in combination (OR = 0.400, p = 0.016) had an inverse protective relationship with all-cause in-hospital 30-day mortality among COVID-19 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea (OR = 1.008, p &lt; 0.001), and nausea and vomiting (OR = 1.291, p = 0.043) had a mild impact on the length of hospital stay. Conclusion Elevated liver transaminases including alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at the time of hospital admission can predict critical care requirement and all-cause 30-day hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. Presence of gastrointestinal symptoms is associated with worsened outcomes.","Deane, Singh, Sarfraz, Sarfraz, Ciccone, Zheng, Afzal, Khan, Rodriguez, Bahtiyar","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14543","20210521","covid-19; gastrointestinal; liver; prognosis; symptoms; transaminases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13957,""
"Patients With Epilepsy Who Underwent Epilepsy Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic Showed Less Depressive Tendencies","<b>Introduction:</b> Our hypothesis in this study was that differences might exist between patients with epilepsy (PWE) who underwent epilepsy surgery before and within the period of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The purpose of this study was to compare results of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) between PWE who underwent epilepsy surgery before and during the pandemic period. <b>Methods:</b> Participants were PWE who underwent open cranial epilepsy surgery between February 2019 and February 2021 in our hospital. Patients who underwent surgery in the first half of this period, between February 2019 and January 2020, were defined as the pre-pandemic period group (pre-Group) and those treated in the second half, between February 2020 and February 2021, were categorized as the pandemic period group (within-Group). All patients completed the SDS before surgery, and scores were compared between groups. <b>Results:</b> SDS score was significantly higher in the pre-Group than in the within-Group (<i>p</i> = 0.037). Other factors, including age (<i>p</i> = 0.51), sex (<i>p</i> = 0.558), epilepsy duration from onset to SDS score evaluation (<i>p</i> = 0.190), seizure frequency (<i>p</i> = 0.794), number of anti-seizure medications (<i>p</i> = 0.787), and intelligence quotient (<i>p</i> = 0.871) did not differ significantly between groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> SDS score was higher in the pre-pandemic group than in the within-pandemic group, which may indicate that PWE with less-positive outlooks may be less likely to seek medical attention during stressful periods.","Niimi, Fujimoto, Sato, Enoki, Okanishi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.677828","20210521","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Zung self-rating depression scale; epilepsy surgery; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13958,""

"Perceived Stress Among Chinese Medical Students Engaging in Online Learning in Light of COVID-19","After a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have repeatedly imposed strict quarantine regimes as the virus mutates and becomes more contagious. Medical undergraduate education has been disrupted and transformed into prolonged home isolation and online learning. Although studies have reported that the COVID-19 pandemic tends to increase perceived stress (PS) and affect the mental health of medical students, the influencing factors are unclear. Therefore, based on the stress process model, this study will comprehensively evaluate the distribution of stressors of medical students and explore the personal and environmental predictors of PS during the epidemic. An online survey was conducted among medical students (n=369) from three medical universities in western China who engaged in online learning. A stress process conceptual framework was formed to explore the influencing factors of PS. The survey items contained four sections: (a) the potential stressors derived from academic, psychosocial and health-related demands; coping resources such as (b) online learning environment support and (c) personal resilience, including online learning behavior and individual characteristics; and (d) PS, perception of imbalanced demands and coping resources. The mean PS score was 17.39 (SD=4.58), and over four-fifths (82.3%) of the students had moderate to high levels of stress. The average item scores of academic, psychosocial and health-related stressors were 2.72 (SD=0.55), 2.31 (SD=0.55) and 2.07 (SD=0.50), respectively. Gender, grade, psychosocial stressors, health-related stressors, specific online learning behavior (persistence, attitude and flexibility), and the online learning environment (teaching, social and cognitive presence) were predictors of PS. Our results specify that a reduction in psychological and health-related stressor stimulation, specific online learning behavior promotion, and well-established online learning environment support could be considered essential for alleviating the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the psychosocial health of medical undergraduates.","Wang, Liu, Zhang, Xie, Yang","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S308497","20210521","COVID-19; learning behavior; learning environment; perceived stress; stressor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13960,""

"A systematic review of neuropsychological and psychiatric sequalae of COVID-19: implications for treatment","COVID-19 impacts multiple organ systems and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Pathogenesis of viral infection, co-morbidities, medical treatments, and psychosocial factors may contribute to COVID-19 related neuropsychological and psychiatric sequelae. This systematic review aims to synthesize available literature on psychiatric and cognitive characteristics of community-dwelling survivors of COVID-19 infection. Thirty-three studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria for review. Emerging findings link COVID-19 to cognitive deficits, particularly attention, executive function, and memory. Psychiatric symptoms occur at high rates in COVID-19 survivors, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disruption, and to a lesser extent posttraumatic stress. Symptoms appear to endure, and severity of acute illness is not directly predictive of severity of cognitive or mental health issues. The course of cognitive and psychiatric sequelae is limited by lack of longitudinal data at this time. Although heterogeneity of study design and sociocultural differences limit definitive conclusions, emerging risk factors for psychiatric symptoms include female sex, perceived stigma related to COVID-19, infection of a family member, social isolation, and prior psychiatry history. The extant literature elucidates treatment targets for cognitive and psychosocial interventions. Research using longitudinal, prospective study designs is needed to characterize cognitive and psychiatric functioning of COVID-19 survivors over the course of illness and across illness severity. Emphasis on delineating the unique contributions of premorbid functioning, viral infection, co-morbidities, treatments, and psychosocial factors to cognitive and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 is warranted.","Vanderlind, Rabinovitz, Miao, Oberlin, Bueno-Castellano, Fridman, Jaywant, Kanellopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000713","20210521","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13962,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on alcohol use disorders and complications","To understand the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on persons with alcohol use disorders. From a total of 455 titles on COVID-19 and alcohol, 227 abstracts were screened, and 95 articles were reviewed (on November 25th, 2020). The immediate effect was an increase in alcohol related emergencies including alcohol withdrawal, related suicides, and methanol toxicity. Although there are mixed findings with respect to changes in the quantity of drinking, there are reports of binge/heavy drinking during the lockdown as well as relapse postlockdown. Psychological, social, biological, economic and policy-related factors appear to influence the changes in drinking. Although preliminary data suggest no change in alcohol use among persons with comorbid mental illness, findings in this population are presently limited. Among patients with alcohol related liver disease, outcomes appear worse and caution is warranted with the use of medications. Alcohol also appears to increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and complicates its course.Although some nations banned alcohol sales completely during lockdown, others declared it as an essential commodity, resulting in different problems across countries. Alcohol use has added to the burden of the problem particularly among vulnerable groups like the adolescents, elderly, patients with cancer, as well as health professionals. Services for patients with alcohol use disorders have been affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on alcohol use, with an increase in alcohol related emergencies, changes in alcohol use patterns, increased risk of contracting COVID-19, effect on alcohol policies and sales, and an effect on vulnerable groups. It is essential to understand and respond to the current situation, intervene early, and prevent further repercussions of the pandemic.Video abstract link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IJWtIs6e554PryKWhdma4VB--mjSZq1C/view?usp=sharing.","Murthy, Narasimha","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000720","20210521","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13963,""
"How patients with COVID-19 managed the disease at home during the first wave in Spain: a cross-sectional study","Most patients with mild COVID-19 had to stay at home trying to implement an optimal quarantine. The aim of this study was to describe the COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain, how they managed the disease at home, focusing on differences by age, as well as differences in knowledge, attitudes and preventive practices, compared with the uninfected population. An online survey was used to conduct a cross-sectional study of individuals who were 14 years or older living in Spain during the COVID-19 lockdown. The main variable was a COVID-19 case. Logistic regression models for COVID-19 cases were obtained using a backward stepwise procedure to assess the association between social variables, disease knowledge, attitudes, prevention practices and emotional impact. 3398 people completed the survey. Participants' mean age was 49.6 (SD=14.3). COVID-19 was significantly more prevalent among married people (5.3%) and those currently doing an on-site work (8.7%). Most of the COVID-19 cases stayed at home (84.0%) during the episode. There were significant age-based differences with regard to self-isolation conditions at home during the disease. COVID-19 cases showed better attitudes, practices and knowledge about disease symptoms and transmission than the uninfected population. COVID-19 cases also felt more depressed (adjusted OR: 3.46, 95% CI 1.45 to 8.26) and had better preventive behaviour than the uninfected population, such as always wearing a mask outside the home (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.30). COVID-19 cases found it difficult to comply with recommended home self-isolation conditions, with differences by age group. COVID-19 had an important impact on care dependency in non-hospitalised patients, who were mostly dependent on their families for care. It is necessary to reinforce social and health services and to be ready to meet the care needs of populations during the different waves or in future epidemics.","Romay-Barja, Pascual-Carrasco, De Tena-DÃƒÂ¡vila, FalcÃƒÂ³n, Rodriguez-Blazquez, Forjaz, Ayala, Molina-de la Fuente, Burgos, MuÃƒÂ±oz, Benito","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048702","20210521","COVID-19; epidemiology; infectious diseases; public health; social medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13964,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on South Australia","ObjectiveThis study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency departments (EDs) in South Australia, measured by changes in the number and casemix of patients in the system over time.MethodsData from the South Australia Emergency Department Dashboard, updated every 30min, were analysed for the period 4 October-21 December 2020. The Dashboard reports live counts of the number and type of patients in each of the six adult metropolitan public EDs in Adelaide, South Australia.ResultsThere was a significant difference in the mean daily average occupied ED capacity before and during two distinct increases in COVID-19 cases in South Australia. An increase in COVID-19 cases coincided with a decrease in patients in EDs (Pearson's r=-0.93 and -0.67; P&lt;0.001 for both). Presentations in Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) Categories 2-5 decreased during these periods, whereas ATS Category 1 stayed constant. Mental health patients continued to present to the ED, despite the overall drop in ED presentations.ConclusionsDuring the two periods of COVID-19 case growth in South Australia, there was a significant drop in the number of patients presenting to the major public EDs and a change in the casemix of patients over time.What is known about the topic?EDs in Australia often operate at or over capacity, with frequent reports of ambulance ramping, access block and long waiting times. There have been reports internationally of significant declines in ED presentations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.What does this paper add?This paper uses a novel publicly available data source that is available in real time to contribute a new perspective from South Australia, which has experienced two distinct periods of strict restrictions and lockdown. The research showed that the number of mental health presentations remained consistently high, despite a significant overall decline in ED occupancy.What are the implications for practitioners?This study demonstrates that South Australians are accessing emergency medical treatment differently in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of an overall decline in presentation numbers, the number of mental health-related presentations has not changed significantly, suggesting that this trend should be closely monitored. The findings corroborate the national concern that unwell people have avoided accessing emergency medical care during the pandemic, leading to worse outcomes and increased need for healthcare resources at a later date. It will be important to monitor and quickly detect further changes in ED usage using real-time data as the pandemic evolves, as well as in any future significant health crises.","Boyle, Mackay, Bean, Roughan","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH20366","20210521","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13966,""
"Sadness, despair and anger when a patient dies alone from COVID-19: A thematic content analysis of Twitter data from bereaved family members and friends","To inform clinical practice and policy, it is essential to understand the lived experience of health and social care policies, including restricted visitation policies towards the end of life. To explore the views and experiences of Twitter social media users who reported that a relative, friend or acquaintance died of COVID-19 without a family member/friend present. Qualitative content analysis of English-language tweets. Twitter data collected 7-20th April 2020. A bespoke software system harvested selected publicly-available tweets from the Twitter application programming interface. After filtering we hand-screened tweets to include only those referring to a relative, friend or acquaintance who died alone of COVID-19. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. 9328 tweets were hand-screened; 196 were included. Twitter users expressed sadness, despair, hopelessness and anger about their experience and loss. Saying goodbye via video-conferencing technology was viewed ambivalently. Clinicians' presence during a death was little consolation. Anger, frustration and blame were directed at governments' inaction/policies or the public. The sadness of not being able to say goodbye as wished was compounded by lack of social support and disrupted after-death rituals. Users expressed a sense of political neglect/mistreatment alongside calls for action. They also used the platform to reinforce public health messages, express condolences and pay tribute. Twitter was used for collective mourning and support and to promote public health messaging. End-of-life care providers should facilitate and optimise contact with loved ones, even when strict visitation policies are necessary, and provide proactive bereavement support.","Selman, Chamberlain, Sowden, Chao, Selman, Taubert, Braude","https://doi.org/10.1177/02692163211017026","20210521","Bereavement; coronavirus infections; grief; pandemics; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13967,""
"National identification, a social cure for COVID-19? Evidence from 67 countries","Social distancing and mass quarantines were implemented worldwide in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Prior research has shown that such measures bear negative consequences for population mental health and well-being. Conversely, a growing body of evidence suggests that feeling positively identified with a group is associated with physical and mental health benefits. This study tested whether national identification could promote wellbeing and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used survey data conducted among 67 countries (<i>N</i> = 46,450). Mixed-model analyses revealed that national identity was associated with wellbeing - despite adjustment on social belonging, COVID-19 perceived risk, exposure and ideology. This effect did not extend to physical health. These results suggest that the mere feeling of belonging to a national group may have mental health benefits. We discuss the implications of our findings within the social cure framework and their relevance for population mental health under COVID-19.","Bonetto, DelouvÃƒÂ©e, Mahfud, Adam-Troian","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211020036","20210521","COVID-19; national identity; public health; social belonging; social cure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13968,""
"Role of Psychiatric Hospitals in the Equitable Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccines","This study examined the feasibility of offering COVID-19 vaccinations to patients in inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs). Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine relationships among measures of influenza immunization, transmission of transition records, and attainment of follow-up care with data from 1,602 IPFs in 2018 and the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index. One-quarter of IPFs were in counties with high or very high COVID-19 vulnerability. On average, 84% of patients at IPFs were screened for influenza immunization status and were offered an immunization if indicated. Only 57% of patients had their records transmitted to another provider within 24 hours of discharge, and 50% had a follow-up visit with a mental health provider within 30 days. Scores on attainment of follow-up care were worse in counties with higher COVID-19 vulnerability. IPFs may be well positioned to offer COVID-19 vaccinations but will need new processes and improved rates of follow-up care to ensure that patients receive the second dose.","Brown, Bell","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000808","20210521","Aftercare; Coronavirus/COVID-19; Inpatient treatment; Prevention; Quality of care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13969,""

"Relationship between the fear of COVID-19 disease and sleep quality: the mediating role of stress","The whole world almost came to a standstill due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this pandemic, most psychological responses have been at a higher prevalence such as stress, anxiety, depression, lower mental well-being, poor sleep quality, along with the fear of contracting the COVID-19 disease. Related to these psychological responses, previous studies have suggested an association between COVID-19 fear and stress as well as stress and sleep quality. The present study aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 fear and sleep quality and investigate the possible mediating effect of perceived stress during this pandemic. The data were collected, utilizing a self-report online questionnaire, from a sample of 521 Bangladeshi adults. Results showed significant gender differences in COVID-19 fear, stress, and sleep quality and also a significant association between these variables. Mediation results revealed that stress fully mediated the association between COVID-19 fear and sleep quality for males and partially mediated it for females. These results suggest that women are in a more vulnerable position in this pandemic. These findings would be helpful to mental health professionals and policy makers to address the psychological problems induced by the current pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07033","20210501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-22","",13972,""
